**Authors**: Jian Chen, Vashisth Tiwari, Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Zhuoming Chen, Jinyuan Shi, Ian En-Hsu Yen, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:54:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency without sacrificing performance but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy speculative decoding more effectively for high throughput inference. Then, it leverages draft models with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck that scales with both sequence length and batch size. This finding underscores the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2x speedup for LLaMA-2-7B-32K and 1.84x speedup for LLaMA-3.1-8B when serving batch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/MagicDec/.

### Cyclic Wrap-Around Multi-Access Coded Caching with Private Caches
**Authors**: Dhruv Pratap Singh, Anjana A. Mahesh, B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T15:39:20Z

**Summary**: We consider a variant of the coded caching problem where users connect to two types of caches, called private caches and access caches. The problem setting consists of a server having a library of files and a set of access caches. Every user, equipped with a private cache, connects to $L$ neighboring access caches in a cyclic wrap-around fashion. The server populates the private and access caches with file contents in either coded or uncoded format. For this setting, we derive a lower bound on the optimal worst-case transmission rate using cut-set arguments. This lower bound applies to both coded and uncoded placements. We then provide an achievable scheme with uncoded placement and show that our scheme specializes to the well-known Maddah-Ali-Niesen scheme for the dedicated cache network in the absence of access caches. Finally, we show that the proposed scheme achieves optimality in large memory regimes and provide numerical plots comparing the rate of the proposed scheme with the derived lower bound, demonstrating the optimality of our scheme.

### Fundamental Limits of Multi-Message Private Computation
**Authors**: Ali Gholami, Kai Wan, Tayyebeh Jahani-Nezhad, Hua Sun, Mingyue Ji, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T13:25:07Z

**Summary**: In a typical formulation of the private information retrieval (PIR) problem, a single user wishes to retrieve one out of $ K$ files from $N$ servers without revealing the demanded file index to any server. This paper formulates an extended model of PIR, referred to as multi-message private computation (MM-PC), where instead of retrieving a single file, the user wishes to retrieve $P>1$ linear combinations of files while preserving the privacy of the demand information. The MM-PC problem is a generalization of the private computation (PC) problem (where the user requests one linear combination of the files), and the multi-message private information retrieval (MM-PIR) problem (where the user requests $P>1$ files). A baseline achievable scheme repeats the optimal PC scheme by Sun and Jafar $P$ times, or treats each possible demanded linear combination as an independent file and then uses the near optimal MM-PIR scheme by Banawan and Ulukus. In this paper, we propose a new MM-PC scheme that significantly improves upon the baseline schemes. In doing so, we design the queries inspired by the structure in the cache-aided scalar linear function retrieval scheme by Wan {\it et al.}, which leverages the dependency between linear functions to reduce the amount of communications. To ensure the decodability of our scheme, we propose a new method to benefit from the existing dependency, referred to as the sign assignment step. In the end, we use Maximum Distance Separable matrices to code the queries, which allows the reduction of download from the servers, while preserving privacy. By the proposed schemes, we characterize the capacity within a multiplicative factor of $2$.

### Which Part of the Heap is Useful? Improving Heap Liveness Analysis
**Authors**: Vini Kanvar, Uday P. Khedker

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T09:54:22Z

**Summary**: With the growing sizes of data structures allocated in heap, understanding the actual use of heap memory is critically important for minimizing cache misses and reclaiming unused memory. A static analysis aimed at this is difficult because the heap locations are unnamed. Using allocation sites to name them creates very few distinctions making it difficult to identify allocated heap locations that are not used. Heap liveness analysis using access graphs solves this problem by (a) using a storeless model of heap memory by naming the locations with access paths, and (b) representing the unbounded sets of access paths (which are regular languages) as finite automata.   We improve the scalability and efficiency of heap liveness analysis, and reduce the amount of computed heap liveness information by using deterministic automata and by minimizing the inclusion of aliased access paths in the language. Practically, our field-, flow-, context-sensitive liveness analysis on SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks scales to 36 kLoC (existing analysis scales to 10.5 kLoC) and improves efficiency even up to 99%. For some of the benchmarks, our technique shows multifold reduction in the computed liveness information, ranging from 2 to 100 times (in terms of the number of live access paths), without compromising on soundness.

### Exposing Shadow Branches
**Authors**: Chrysanthos Pepi, Bhargav Reddy Godala, Krishnam Tibrewala, Gino Chacon, Paul V. Gratz, Daniel A. Jiménez, Gilles A. Pokam, David I. August

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T17:56:29Z

**Summary**: Modern processors implement a decoupled front-end in the form of Fetch Directed Instruction Prefetching (FDIP) to avoid front-end stalls. FDIP is driven by the Branch Prediction Unit (BPU), relying on the BPU's accuracy and branch target tracking structures to speculatively fetch instructions into the Instruction Cache (L1I). As data center applications become more complex, their code footprints also grow, resulting in an increase in Branch Target Buffer (BTB) misses. FDIP can alleviate L1I cache misses, but when it encounters a BTB miss, the BPU may not identify the current instruction as a branch to FDIP. This can prevent FDIP from prefetching or cause it to speculate down the wrong path, further polluting the L1I cache. We observe that the vast majority, 75%, of BTB-missing, unidentified branches are actually present in instruction cache lines that FDIP has previously fetched but, these missing branches have not yet been decoded and inserted into the BTB. This is because the instruction line is decoded from an entry point (which is the target of the previous taken branch) till an exit point (the taken branch). Branch instructions present in the ignored portion of the cache line we call them "Shadow Branches". Here we present Skeia, a novel shadow branch decoding technique that identifies and decodes unused bytes in cache lines fetched by FDIP, inserting them into a Shadow Branch Buffer (SBB). The SBB is accessed in parallel with the BTB, allowing FDIP to speculate despite a BTB miss. With a minimal storage state of 12.25KB, Skeia delivers a geomean speedup of ~5.7% over an 8K-entry BTB (78KB) and ~2% versus adding an equal amount of state to the BTB across 16 front-end bound applications. Since many branches stored in the SBB are unique compared to those in a similarly sized BTB, we consistently observe greater performance gains with Skeia across all examined sizes until saturation.

### Stable CoO$_2$ Nanoscrolls With Outstanding Electrical Properties
**Authors**: Simon Hettler, Kankona Singha Roy, Raul Arenal, Leela S. Panchakarla

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T17:47:49Z

**Summary**: Layered CoO$_2$ is of great interest for its promising properties but is meta-stable in its bulk form. CoO$_2$ was synthesized by converting the quasi-one-dimensional crystal structure of bulk Ca$_3$Co$_2$O$_6$ via a hydrothermal treatment. The resulting nanostructures were predominantly nanoscrolls with very thin walls, which exhibit long-term stability. A detailed structural investigation reveals that the CoO$_2$ is found to crystallize in monoclinic form, similar to the related CaCoO$_2$-CoO$_2$ misfit structure. Individual nanoscrolls are characterized electrically and show a p-type semiconducting nature with a high current-carrying capacity of 4$\cdot$10$^5$ A cm$^{-2}$ and an extremely high breakdown voltage of up to 270 kV/cm. The results demonstrate the possibility to stabilize meta-stable materials in low-dimensional forms and a promising application of the nanoscrolls as interconnect in high-voltage electronic circuitry.

### Rheological behavior of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) inks under electric   fields: influence of concentration and voltage
**Authors**: Pedro C Rijo, Francisco J. Galindo-Rosales

**Updated**: 2024-08-21T10:26:26Z

**Summary**: This work provides a complete rheological characterization of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) inks in the presence of electric fields. Several concentrations of MoS2 are studied and dispersed in a viscoelastic fluid. The lubrication effects are present in the ink when the MoS2 concentration is higher than 0.10% w/w. The dielectric properties show the impossibility of a positive electrorheological effect for all MoS2-inks studied. The formation of vortices and electromigration of MoS2 particles occur under the influence of an external electric field. These two phenomena affect the rheological behavior of MoS2-inks under shear flow condition. Relatively to the extensional rheology experiments, the particle migration and the vortex formation promote anisotropy on the rheological properties of the inks which affects the relaxation time, the formation of beads-on-a-string and the uniaxial elongational flow condition is no longer valid. When the electric field strength is 1.5 kV/mm, the formation of Taylor's cone is observed and independent of MoS2 concentration.

### Towards End-to-End GPS Localization with Neural Pseudorange Correction
**Authors**: Xu Weng, KV Ling, Haochen Liu, Kun Cao

**Updated**: 2024-08-21T06:10:02Z

**Summary**: The pseudorange error is one of the root causes of localization inaccuracy in GPS. Previous data-driven methods regress and eliminate pseudorange errors using handcrafted intermediate labels. Unlike them, we propose an end-to-end GPS localization framework, E2E-PrNet, to train a neural network for pseudorange correction (PrNet) directly using the final task loss calculated with the ground truth of GPS receiver states. The gradients of the loss with respect to learnable parameters are backpropagated through a Differentiable Nonlinear Least Squares (DNLS) optimizer to PrNet. The feasibility of fusing the data-driven neural network and the model-based DNLS module is verified with GPS data collected by Android phones, showing that E2E-PrNet outperforms the baseline weighted least squares method and the state-of-the-art end-to-end data-driven approach. Finally, we discuss the explainability of E2E-PrNet.

### Telepathic Datacenters: Fast RPCs using Shared CXL Memory
**Authors**: Suyash Mahar, Ehsan Hajyjasini, Seungjin Lee, Zifeng Zhang, Mingyao Shen, Steven Swanson

**Updated**: 2024-08-21T04:16:49Z

**Summary**: Datacenter applications often rely on remote procedure calls (RPCs) for fast, efficient, and secure communication. However, RPCs are slow, inefficient, and hard to use as they require expensive serialization and compression to communicate over a packetized serial network link. Compute Express Link 3.0 (CXL) offers an alternative solution, allowing applications to share data using a cache-coherent, shared-memory interface across clusters of machines.   RPCool is a new framework that exploits CXL's shared memory capabilities. RPCool avoids serialization by passing pointers to data structures in shared memory. While avoiding serialization is useful, directly sharing pointer-rich data eliminates the isolation that copying data over traditional networks provides, leaving the receiver vulnerable to invalid pointers and concurrent updates to shared data by the sender. RPCool restores this safety with careful and efficient management of memory permissions. Another significant challenge with CXL shared memory capabilities is that they are unlikely to scale to an entire datacenter. RPCool addresses this by falling back to RDMA-based communication.   Overall, RPCool reduces the round-trip latency by 1.93$\times$ and 7.2$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art RDMA and CXL-based RPC mechanisms, respectively. Moreover, RPCool performs either comparably or better than other RPC mechanisms across a range of workloads.

### QET: Enhancing Quantized LLM Parameters and KV cache Compression through   Element Substitution and Residual Clustering
**Authors**: Yanshu Wang, Wang Li, Tong Yang

**Updated**: 2024-08-21T02:32:43Z

**Summary**: Matrix quantization compresses matrix elements into a more compact form to reduce storage requirements, with dequantization enabling reconstruction for use. We define the Quantization Error Minimization (QEM) problem as minimizing the difference between the original and quantized matrices while ensuring the quantized matrix remains within fixed memory constraints. This technique is crucial in applications like Large Language Model (LLM) weight compression and KV cache compression, where large matrix sizes demand efficient storage solutions.   As modern LLMs like GPT-4 and BERT continue to grow, effective matrix compression is increasingly important. These models contain billions of parameters in matrix form, making efficient weight quantization essential for both storage and computational efficiency. Similarly, KV caches, storing intermediate inference results, are matrix-based and benefit significantly from optimized compression techniques.   To address the QEM problem in the context of LLM weight and KV cache compression, we propose Quantum Entanglement Trees (QET). QET leverages the local structure of matrix elements by iteratively swapping elements to create a locally ordered matrix, which is then grouped and quantized column by column. To enhance QET, we introduce two optimizations: residual quantization to further reduce Mean Squared Error (MSE) and masking with batch processing to accelerate the algorithm.   Our experiments demonstrate that QET can reduce MSE to 12.3% of its original value at the same compression ratio, outperforming leading baseline methods. Our contributions include framing the QEM problem specifically for LLM and KV cache compression, developing the QET algorithm, and implementing optimizations that improve accuracy and processing speed.

### Hybrid Recurrent Models Support Emergent Descriptions for Hierarchical   Planning and Control
**Authors**: Poppy Collis, Ryan Singh, Paul F Kinghorn, Christopher L Buckley

**Updated**: 2024-08-20T16:02:54Z

**Summary**: An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work has demonstrated that a class of hybrid state-space model known as recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) discover meaningful behavioural units via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). Furthermore, they model how the underlying continuous states drive these discrete mode switches. We propose that the rich representations formed by an rSLDS can provide useful abstractions for planning and control. We present a novel hierarchical model-based algorithm inspired by Active Inference in which a discrete MDP sits above a low-level linear-quadratic controller. The recurrent transition dynamics learned by the rSLDS allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We successfully apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and non-trivial planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.

### Pluto and Charon: A Time and Memory Efficient Collaborative Edge AI   Framework for Personal LLMs Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Bei Ouyang, Shengyuan Ye, Liekang Zeng, Tianyi Qian, Jingyi Li, Xu Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-20T11:30:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a plethora of powerful applications at the network edge, such as intelligent personal assistants. Data privacy and security concerns have prompted a shift towards edge-based fine-tuning of personal LLMs, away from cloud reliance. However, this raises issues of computational intensity and resource scarcity, hindering training efficiency and feasibility. While current studies investigate parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to mitigate resource constraints, our analysis indicates that these techniques are not sufficiently resource-efficient for edge devices. To tackle these challenges, we propose Pluto and Charon (PAC), a time and memory efficient collaborative edge AI framework for personal LLMs fine-tuning. PAC breaks the resource wall of personal LLMs fine-tuning with a sophisticated algorithm-system co-design. (1) Algorithmically, PAC implements a personal LLMs fine-tuning technique that is efficient in terms of parameters, time, and memory. It utilizes Parallel Adapters to circumvent the need for a full backward pass through the LLM backbone. Additionally, an activation cache mechanism further streamlining the process by negating the necessity for repeated forward passes across multiple epochs. (2) Systematically, PAC leverages edge devices in close proximity, pooling them as a collective resource for in-situ personal LLMs fine-tuning, utilizing a hybrid data and pipeline parallelism to orchestrate distributed training. The use of the activation cache eliminates the need for forward pass through the LLM backbone,enabling exclusive fine-tuning of the Parallel Adapters using data parallelism. Extensive evaluation based on prototype implementation demonstrates that PAC remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 8.64x end-to-end speedup and up to 88.16% reduction in memory footprint.

### Heta: Distributed Training of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks
**Authors**: Yuchen Zhong, Junwei Su, Chuan Wu, Minjie Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-20T04:46:18Z

**Summary**: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) leverage diverse semantic relationships in Heterogeneous Graphs (HetGs) and have demonstrated remarkable learning performance in various applications. However, current distributed GNN training systems often overlook unique characteristics of HetGs, such as varying feature dimensions and the prevalence of missing features among nodes, leading to suboptimal performance or even incompatibility with distributed HGNN training. We introduce Heta, a framework designed to address the communication bottleneck in distributed HGNN training. Heta leverages the inherent structure of HGNNs - independent relation-specific aggregations for each relation, followed by a cross-relation aggregation - and advocates for a novel Relation-Aggregation-First computation paradigm. It performs relation-specific aggregations within graph partitions and then exchanges partial aggregations. This design, coupled with a new graph partitioning method that divides a HetG based on its graph schema and HGNN computation dependency, substantially reduces communication overhead. Heta further incorporates an innovative GPU feature caching strategy that accounts for the different cache miss-penalties associated with diverse node types. Comprehensive evaluations of various HGNN models and large heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that Heta outperforms state-of-the-art systems like DGL and GraphLearn by up to 5.8x and 2.3x in end-to-end epoch time, respectively.

### Multi-Mode Lens for Momentum Microscopy and XPEEM: Theory
**Authors**: Olena Tkach, Gerd Schoenhense

**Updated**: 2024-08-19T15:47:17Z

**Summary**: The strong electric field between the sample and the extractor is the core of cathode lenses and a pivotal determinant of high resolution. Nevertheless, fields in the range of 3-8 kV/mm can be a source of complications. Local field enhancement at sharp edges or microscopic protrusions of cleaved samples may result in field emission or flashovers. Moreover, slow background electrons are drawn into the microscope column, where they contribute to space charge effects. A novel front lens configuration, optimized through ray-tracing simulations, significantly reduces the field at the sample and allows even for zero field or retarding field, which serves to suppress space charge effects. One or several annular electrodes, situated in a concentric position relative to the extractor, serve to form an additional lens within the gap between the sample and the extractor. The refractory power of this lens, and consequently the field at the sample surface, can be modified by adjusting the potentials of the annular electrodes. The imaging properties and aberrations of this gap lens have been investigated with regard to momentum imaging and XPEEM. The study encompasses the energy range from the few-eV level for laser-ARPES to 6 keV, for hard X-ray ARPES. The additional converging lens situated in close proximity to the sample exhibits a reduced field curvature of the k-image in the backfocal plane. This allows for the acquisition of larger fields of view in both momentum and real-space imaging.

### Abstract Environment Trimming
**Authors**: Daniel Jurjo-Rivas, Jose F. Morales, Pedro López-García, Manuel V. Hermenegildo

**Updated**: 2024-08-19T09:50:35Z

**Summary**: Variable sharing is a fundamental property in the static analysis of logic programs, since it is instrumental for ensuring correctness and increasing precision while inferring many useful program properties. Such properties include modes, determinacy, non-failure, cost, etc. This has motivated significant work on developing abstract domains to improve the precision and performance of sharing analyses. Much of this work has centered around the family of set-sharing domains, because of the high precision they offer. However, this comes at a price: their scalability to a wide set of realistic programs remains challenging and this hinders their wider adoption. In this work, rather than defining new sharing abstract domains, we focus instead on developing techniques which can be incorporated in the analyzers to address aspects that are known to affect the efficiency of these domains, such as the number of variables, without affecting precision. These techniques are inspired in others used in the context of compiler optimizations, such as expression reassociation and variable trimming. We present several such techniques and provide an extensive experimental evaluation of over 1100 program modules taken from both production code and classical benchmarks. This includes the Spectector cache analyzer, the s(CASP) system, the libraries of the Ciao system, the LPdoc documenter, the PLAI analyzer itself, etc. The experimental results are quite encouraging: we have obtained significant speed-ups, and, more importantly, the number of modules that require a timeout was cut in half. As a result, many more programs can be analyzed precisely in reasonable times.

### AdapMoE: Adaptive Sensitivity-based Expert Gating and Management for   Efficient MoE Inference
**Authors**: Shuzhang Zhong, Ling Liang, Yuan Wang, Runsheng Wang, Ru Huang, Meng Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-19T03:27:15Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are designed to enhance the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) without proportionally increasing the computational demands. However, their deployment on edge devices still faces significant challenges due to high on-demand loading overheads from managing sparsely activated experts. This paper introduces AdapMoE, an algorithm-system co-design framework for efficient MoE inference. AdapMoE features adaptive expert gating and management to reduce the on-demand loading overheads. We observe the heterogeneity of experts loading across layers and tokens, based on which we propose a sensitivity-based strategy to adjust the number of activated experts dynamically. Meanwhile, we also integrate advanced prefetching and cache management techniques to further reduce the loading latency. Through comprehensive evaluations on various platforms, we demonstrate AdapMoE consistently outperforms existing techniques, reducing the average number of activated experts by 25% and achieving a 1.35x speedup without accuracy degradation.

### Post-Training Sparse Attention with Double Sparsity
**Authors**: Shuo Yang, Ying Sheng, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Ion Stoica, Lianmin Zheng

**Updated**: 2024-08-18T17:27:17Z

**Summary**: The inference process for large language models is slow and memory-intensive, with one of the most critical bottlenecks being excessive Key-Value (KV) cache accesses. This paper introduces "Double Sparsity," a novel post-training sparse attention technique designed to alleviate this bottleneck by reducing KV cache access. Double Sparsity combines token sparsity, which focuses on utilizing only the important tokens for computing self-attention, with channel sparsity, an approach that uses important feature channels for identifying important tokens. Our key insight is that the pattern of channel sparsity is relatively static, allowing us to use offline calibration to make it efficient at runtime, thereby enabling accurate and efficient identification of important tokens. Moreover, this method can be combined with offloading to achieve significant memory usage reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that Double Sparsity can achieve $\frac{1}{16}$ token and channel sparsity with minimal impact on accuracy across various tasks, including wiki-2 perplexity, key-value retrieval, and long context benchmarks with models including Llama-2-7B, Llama-2-70B, and Mixtral-8x7B. It brings up to a 14.1$\times$ acceleration in attention operations and a 1.9$\times$ improvement in end-to-end inference on GPUs. With offloading, it achieves a decoding speed acceleration of 16.3$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions at a sequence length of 256K. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/andy-yang-1/DoubleSparse.

### CMD: A Cache-assisted GPU Memory Deduplication Architecture
**Authors**: Wei Zhao, Dan Feng, Wei Tong, Xueliang Wei, Bing Wu

**Updated**: 2024-08-18T13:54:46Z

**Summary**: Massive off-chip accesses in GPUs are the main performance bottleneck, and we divided these accesses into three types: (1) Write, (2) Data-Read, and (3) Read-Only. Besides, We find that many writes are duplicate, and the duplication can be inter-dup and intra-dup. While inter-dup means different memory blocks are identical, and intra-dup means all the 4B elements in a line are the same. In this work, we propose a cache-assisted GPU memory deduplication architecture named CMD to reduce the off-chip accesses via utilizing the data duplication in GPU applications. CMD includes three key design contributions which aim to reduce the three kinds of accesses: (1) A novel GPU memory deduplication architecture that removes the inter-dup and inter-dup lines. As for the inter-dup detection, we reduce the extra read requests caused by the traditional read-verify hash process. Besides, we design several techniques to manage duplicate blocks. (2) We propose a cache-assisted read scheme to reduce the reads to duplicate data. When an L2 cache miss wants to read the duplicate block, if the reference block has been fetched to L2 and it is clean, we can copy it to the L2 missed block without accessing off-chip DRAM. As for the reads to intra-dup data, CMD uses the on-chip metadata cache to get the data. (3) When a cache line is evicted, the clean sectors in the line are invalidated while the dirty sectors are written back. However, most read-only victims are re-referenced from DRAM more than twice. Therefore, we add a full-associate FIFO to accommodate the read-only (it is also clean) victims to reduce the re-reference counts. Experiments show that CMD can decrease the off-chip accesses by 31.01%, reduce the energy by 32.78% and improve performance by 37.79%. Besides, CMD can improve the performance of memory-intensive workloads by 50.18%.

### RollingCache: Using Runtime Behavior to Defend Against Cache Side   Channel Attacks
**Authors**: Divya Ojha, Sandhya Dwarkadas

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T04:32:56Z

**Summary**: Shared caches are vulnerable to side channel attacks through contention in cache sets. Besides being a simple source of information leak, these side channels form useful gadgets for more sophisticated attacks that compromise the security of shared systems.   The fundamental design aspect that contention attacks exploit is the deterministic nature of the set of addresses contending for a cache set. In this paper, we present RollingCache, a cache design that defends against contention attacks by dynamically changing the set of addresses contending for cache sets. Unlike prior defenses, RollingCache does not rely on address encryption/decryption, data relocation, or cache partitioning. We use one level of indirection to implement dynamic mapping controlled by the whole-cache runtime behavior. Our solution does not depend on having defined security domains, and can defend against an attacker running on the same or another core.   We evaluate RollingCache on ChampSim using the SPEC-2017 benchmark suite. Our security evaluation shows that our dynamic mapping removes the deterministic ability to identify the source of contention. The performance evaluation shows an impact of 1.67\% over a mix of workloads, with a corresponding

### Ada-KV: Optimizing KV Cache Eviction by Adaptive Budget Allocation for   Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yuan Feng, Junlin Lv, Yukun Cao, Xike Xie, S. Kevin Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-08-16T08:46:33Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models have excelled in various fields but encounter challenges in memory and time efficiency due to the expanding Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-sequence inference. Recent efforts try to reduce KV cache size to a given memory budget by evicting vast non-critical cache elements during runtime, while preserving generation quality. Our revisiting of current eviction methods reveals that they fundamentally minimize an upper bound of the $L_1$ eviction loss between the pre- and post-eviction outputs of multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the common practices of uniformly assigning budgets across attention heads harm their post-eviction generation quality. In light of these findings, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive budget allocation algorithm. This algorithm not only optimizes the theoretical loss upper bound but also reduces the $L_1$ eviction loss in practice by aligning with the varied characteristics across different heads. By integrating this algorithm into two state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using adaptive budget allocation to optimize KV cache eviction. Extensive evaluations on 16 datasets and the Needle-in-a-Haystack test confirm significant performance improvements across various tasks.

### SelectLLM: Query-Aware Efficient Selection Algorithm for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2024-08-16T06:11:21Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have gained increased popularity due to their remarkable success across various tasks, which has led to the active development of a large set of diverse LLMs. However, individual LLMs have limitations when applied to complex tasks because of such factors as training biases, model sizes, and the datasets used. A promising approach is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. Towards this goal, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM. This algorithm directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring they collectively provide the correct response efficiently. SelectLLM uses a multi-label classifier, utilizing the classifier's predictions and confidence scores to design optimal policies for selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings show that the proposed model outperforms individual LLMs and achieves competitive performance compared to similarly sized, computationally expensive top-performing LLM subsets. Specifically, with a similarly sized top-performing LLM subset, we achieve a significant reduction in latency on two standard reasoning benchmarks: 13% lower latency for GSM8K and 70% lower latency for MMLU. Additionally, we conduct comprehensive analyses and ablation studies, which validate the robustness of the proposed model.

### Symmetric Locality: Definition and Initial Results
**Authors**: Giordan Escalona, Dylan McKellips, Chen Ding

**Updated**: 2024-08-16T04:12:25Z

**Summary**: In this short paper, we characterize symmetric locality. In designing algorithms, compilers, and systems, data movement is a common bottleneck in high-performance computation, in which we improve cache and memory performance. We study a special type of data reuse in the form of repeated traversals, or re-traversals, which are based on the symmetric group. The cyclic and sawtooth traces are previously known results in symmetric locality, and in this work, we would like to generalize this result for any re-traversal. Then, we also provide an abstract framework for applications in compiler design and machine learning models to improve the memory performance of certain programs.

### ConfusedPilot: Confused Deputy Risks in RAG-based LLMs
**Authors**: Ayush RoyChowdhury, Mulong Luo, Prateek Sahu, Sarbartha Banerjee, Mohit Tiwari

**Updated**: 2024-08-15T05:24:19Z

**Summary**: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.   In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.

### A Case for Enabling Delegation of 5G Core Decisions to the RAN
**Authors**: Lucas Vancina, Geoffrey Xie

**Updated**: 2024-08-14T23:42:46Z

**Summary**: Under conventional 5G system design, the authentication and continuous monitoring of user equipment (UE) demands a reliable backhaul connection between the radio access network (RAN) and the core network functions (AMF, AUSF, UDM, etc.). This is not a given, especially in disaster response and military operations. We propose that, in these scenarios, decisions made by core functions can be effectively delegated to the RAN by leveraging the RAN's computing resources and the micro-service programmability of the O-RAN system architecture. This paper presents several concrete designs of core-RAN decision delegation, including caching of core decisions and replicating some of the core decision logic. Each design has revealed interesting performance and security trade-offs that warrant further investigation.

### The Bicameral Cache: a split cache for vector architectures
**Authors**: Susana Rebolledo, Borja Perez, Jose Luis Bosque, Peter Hsu

**Updated**: 2024-08-14T09:18:02Z

**Summary**: The Bicameral Cache is a cache organization proposal for a vector architecture that segregates data according to their access type, distinguishing scalar from vector references. Its aim is to avoid both types of references from interfering in each other's data locality, with a special focus on prioritizing the performance on vector references. The proposed system incorporates an additional, non-polluting prefetching mechanism to help populate the long vector cache lines in advance to increase the hit rate by further exploiting the spatial locality on vector data. Its evaluation was conducted on the Cavatools simulator, comparing the performance to a standard conventional cache, over different typical vector benchmarks for several vector lengths. The results proved the proposed cache speeds up performance on stride-1 vector benchmarks, while hardly impacting non-stride-1's. In addition, the prefetching feature consistently provided an additional value.

### At Least Factor-of-Two Optimization for RWLE-Based Homomorphic   Encryption
**Authors**: Jonathan Ly

**Updated**: 2024-08-14T05:42:35Z

**Summary**: Many modern applications that deal with sensitive data, such as healthcare and government services, outsource computation to cloud platforms. In such untrusted environments, privacy is of vital importance. One solution to this problem is homomorphic encryption (HE), a family of cryptographic schemes that support certain algebraic operations on encrypted data without the need for decryption. However, despite major advancements, encryption in modern HE schemes still comes with a non-trivial computational overhead that can hamper data-intensive workloads. To resolve this, recent research has shown that leveraging caching techniques, such as Rache, can significantly enhance the performance of HE schemes while maintaining security. Rache unfortunately displays a key limitation in the time complexity of its caching procedure, which scales with the size of the plaintext space. Smuche is another caching scheme that simultaneously improves the scalability of the caching procedure and turns the encryption process into a constant-time operation, utilizing only a single scalar multiplication. Even still, more can be done. In this paper, we present an encryption method we call ``Zinc" which entirely forgoes the multiple caching process, replacing it with a single scalar addition, and then injecting randomness that takes constant time with respect to the plaintext space. This injection of randomness is similar to Smuche, and a great improvement from Rache, allowing Zinc to achieve efficiency without compromising security. We implement the scheme using Microsoft SEAL and compare its performance to vanilla CKKS.

### Cache-Aided MIMO Communications: DoF Analysis and Transmitter   Optimization
**Authors**: Mohammad NaseriTehrani, MohammadJavad Salehi, Antti Tölli

**Updated**: 2024-08-13T13:56:14Z

**Summary**: Cache-aided MIMO communications aims to jointly exploit both coded caching~(CC) and spatial multiplexing gains to enhance communication efficiency. In this paper, we first analyze the achievable degrees of freedom~(DoF) in a MIMO-CC system with CC gain \(t\), where a server with \(L\) transmit antennas communicates with \(K\) users, each equipped with \(G\) receive antennas. We demonstrate that the enhanced achievable DoF is \(\max_{\beta, \Omega} \Omega \beta\), where the number of users \(\Omega\) served in each transmission is fine-tuned to maximize DoF, and \(\beta \le \min\big(G, \nicefrac{L \binom{\Omega-1}{t}}{1 + (\Omega - t - 1)\binom{\Omega-1}{t}}\big)\) represents the number of parallel streams decoded by each user. Second, we introduce an effective transmit covariance matrix design aimed at maximizing the symmetric rate, solved iteratively via successive convex approximation. Third, we propose a new class of MIMO-CC schemes using a novel scheduling mechanism leveraging maximal multicasting opportunities to maximize delivery rates at given SNR levels while adhering to linear processing constraints. Lastly, we devise linear multicast beamforming strategies tailored for the flexible scheduling schemes in MIMO-CC systems and present an iterative solution for the efficient design of beamformers. Extensive numerical simulations are used to verify the results of the paper.

### Ownership in low-level intermediate representation
**Authors**: Siddharth Priya, Arie Gurfinkel

**Updated**: 2024-08-13T13:31:34Z

**Summary**: The concept of ownership in high level languages can aid both the programmer and the compiler to reason about the validity of memory operations. Previously, ownership semantics has been used successfully in high level automatic program verification to model a reference to data by a first order logic (FOL) representation of data instead of maintaining an address map. However, ownership semantics is not used in low level program verification. We have identified two challenges. First, ownership information is lost when a program is compiled to a low level intermediate representation (e.g., in LLVM IR). Second, pointers in low level programs point to bytes using an address map (e.g., in unsafe Rust) and thus the verification condition (VC) cannot always replace a pointer by its FOL abstraction. To remedy the situation, we develop ownership semantics for an LLVM like low level intermediate representation. Using these semantics, the VC can opportunistically model some memory accesses by a direct access of a pointer cache that stores byte representation of data. This scheme reduces instances where an address map must be maintained, especially for mostly safe programs that follow ownership semantics. For unsafe functionality, memory accesses are modelled by operations on an address map and we provide mechanisms to keep the address map and pointer cache in sync. We implement these semantics in SEABMC, a bit precise bounded model checker for LLVM. For evaluation, the source programs are assumed to be written in C. Since C does not have ownership built in, suitable macros are added that introduce and preserve ownership during translation to LLVM like IR for verification. This approach is evaluated on mature open source C code. For both handcrafted benchmarks and practical programs, we observe a speedup of $1.3x-5x$ during SMT solving.

### Decision-Focused Learning to Predict Action Costs for Planning
**Authors**: Jayanta Mandi, Marco Foschini, Daniel Holler, Sylvie Thiebaux, Jorg Hoffmann, Tias Guns

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T11:29:07Z

**Summary**: In many automated planning applications, action costs can be hard to specify. An example is the time needed to travel through a certain road segment, which depends on many factors, such as the current weather conditions. A natural way to address this issue is to learn to predict these parameters based on input features (e.g., weather forecasts) and use the predicted action costs in automated planning afterward. Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) has been successful in learning to predict the parameters of combinatorial optimization problems in a way that optimizes solution quality rather than prediction quality. This approach yields better results than treating prediction and optimization as separate tasks. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the challenges of implementing DFL for automated planning in order to learn to predict the action costs. There are two main challenges to overcome: (1) planning systems are called during gradient descent learning, to solve planning problems with negative action costs, which are not supported in planning. We propose novel methods for gradient computation to avoid this issue. (2) DFL requires repeated planner calls during training, which can limit the scalability of the method. We experiment with different methods approximating the optimal plan as well as an easy-to-implement caching mechanism to speed up the learning process. As the first work that addresses DFL for automated planning, we demonstrate that the proposed gradient computation consistently yields significantly better plans than predictions aimed at minimizing prediction error; and that caching can temper the computation requirements.

### Keep the Cost Down: A Review on Methods to Optimize LLM' s KV-Cache   Consumption
**Authors**: Luohe Shi, Hongyi Zhang, Yao Yao, Zuchao Li, Hai Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-08-13T09:55:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by ChatGPT' s release in late 2022, have revolutionized various industries with their advanced language comprehension. However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture' s struggle with handling long texts. KV-Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV-Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV-Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV-Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our review thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering insights into future advancements in this dynamic field.

### Finch: Prompt-guided Key-Value Cache Compression
**Authors**: Giulio Corallo, Paolo Papotti

**Updated**: 2024-08-13T09:08:55Z

**Summary**: Recent large language model applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation and chatbots, have led to an increased need to process longer input contexts. However, this requirement is hampered by inherent limitations. Architecturally, models are constrained by a context window defined during training. Additionally, processing extensive texts requires substantial GPU memory. We propose a novel approach, Finch, to compress the input context by leveraging the pre-trained model weights of the self-attention. Given a prompt and a long text, Finch iteratively identifies the most relevant Key (K) and Value (V) pairs over chunks of the text conditioned on the prompt. Only such pairs are stored in the KV cache, which, within the space constrained by the context window, ultimately contains a compressed version of the long text. Our proposal enables models to consume large inputs even with high compression (up to 93x) while preserving semantic integrity without the need for fine-tuning.

### Value-based Proactive Caching for Sensing Data in Internet of Vehicles
**Authors**: Yantong Wang, Ke Liu, Hui Ji, Jiande Sun

**Updated**: 2024-08-12T08:46:30Z

**Summary**: Sensing data (SD) plays an important role in safe-related applications for Internet of Vehicles. Proactively caching required sensing data (SD) is a pivotal strategy for alleviating network congestion and improving data accessibility. Despite merits, existing studies predominantly address SD caching within a single time slot, which may not be scalable to scenarios involving multi-slots. Furthermore, the oversight of service capacity at caching nodes could lead to significant queuing delays in SD reception. To tackle these limitations, we jointly consider the problem of anchoring caching placement and requests allocation for SD. A value model incorporating both temporal and spacial characteristics is first proposed to estimate the significance of different caching decisions. Subsequently, a stochastic integer nonlinear programming model is provided to optimize the long-term system performance, which is converted into a series of online optimization problem by leveraging the Lyapunov method and linearized via introducing auxiliary variables. To expedite the solution, we provide a binary quantum particle swarm optimization based algorithm with quadratic time complexity. Numerical investigations demonstrate the superiority of proposed algorithms compared with other schemes in terms of energy consumption, response latency, and cache-hit ratio.

**Updated**: 2024-08-12T07:47:28Z

**Summary**: Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) based on cache coherency is crucial for high-end embedded systems like automotive applications. RISC-V is gaining traction, and open-source hardware (OSH) platforms offer solutions to issues such as IP costs and vendor dependency. Existing multi-core cache-coherent RISC-V platforms are complex and not efficient for small embedded core clusters. We propose an open-source SystemVerilog implementation of a lightweight snoop-based cache-coherent cluster of Linux-capable CVA6 cores. Our design uses the MOESI protocol via the Arm's AMBA ACE protocol. Evaluated with Splash-3 benchmarks, our solution shows up to 32.87% faster performance in a dual-core setup and an average improvement of 15.8% over OpenPiton. Synthesized using GF 22nm FDSOI technology, the Cache Coherency Unit occupies only 1.6% of the system area.

### Correct Wrong Path

**Updated**: 2024-08-12T03:53:51Z

**Summary**: Modern OOO CPUs have very deep pipelines with large branch misprediction recovery penalties. Speculatively executed instructions on the wrong path can significantly change cache state, depending on speculation levels. Architects often employ trace-driven simulation models in the design exploration stage, which sacrifice precision for speed. Trace-driven simulators are orders of magnitude faster than execution-driven models, reducing the often hundreds of thousands of simulation hours needed to explore new micro-architectural ideas. Despite this strong benefit of trace-driven simulation, these often fail to adequately model the consequences of wrong path because obtaining them is nontrivial. Prior works consider either a positive or negative impact of wrong path but not both. Here, we examine wrong path execution in simulation results and design a set of infrastructure for enabling wrong-path execution in a trace driven simulator. Our analysis shows the wrong path affects structures on both the instruction and data sides extensively, resulting in performance variations ranging from $-3.05$\% to $20.9$\% when ignoring wrong path. To benefit the research community and enhance the accuracy of simulators, we opened our traces and tracing utility in the hopes that industry can provide wrong-path traces generated by their internal simulators, enabling academic simulation without exposing industry IP.

### Hierarchical Coded Caching with Low Subpacketization and Coding Delay
**Authors**: Rashid Ummer N. T., B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2024-08-11T16:35:10Z

**Summary**: Coded caching scheme originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) considered a broadcast network consisting of a single server connected to a set of users each having a cache memory. Motivated by practical scenarios, Karamchandani \textit{et al.} in [16] proposed a coded caching scheme for a two-layer hierarchical network consisting of a single server connected to multiple mirror sites and each mirror site connected to a distinct set of users, in which both mirror sites and users having cache memories. Low subpacketization level coded caching schemes are desirable for practical implementations. Placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed as a tool to design coded caching schemes with reduced subpacketization level by Yan \textit{et al.} in [4]. Schemes with reduced subpacketization levels are studied extensively in the literature for single-layer networks. Kong \textit{et al.} in [17] proposed a structure called hierarchical placement delivery arrays (HPDA), which characterizes a hierarchical coded caching system and also proposed a class of HPDAs that gives low subpacketization level schemes by using two PDAs. Low subpacketization level hierarchical schemes using combinatorial $t$-designs is proposed in [20]. Apart from that there is no other existing work that discusses the subpacketization problem in a hierarchical network. This paper proposes a class of HPDA construction that gives low subpacketization level hierarchical coded caching schemes, by first constructing a new class of PDAs. Compared with the existing schemes, in cases where the system parameters and subpacketization level are the same, the proposed hierarchical scheme has a better coding delay. Further, the new class of PDAs constructed either subsumes several known PDA constructions or achieves better transmission load for the same system parameters.

### Genie: Smart ROS-based Caching for Connected Autonomous Robots
**Authors**: Zexin Li, Soroush Bateni, Cong Liu

**Updated**: 2024-08-11T08:07:28Z

**Summary**: Despite the promising future of autonomous robots, several key issues currently remain that can lead to compromised performance and safety. One such issue is latency, where we find that even the latest embedded platforms from NVIDIA fail to execute intelligence tasks (e.g., object detection) of autonomous vehicles in a real-time fashion. One remedy to this problem is the promising paradigm of edge computing. Through collaboration with our industry partner, we identify key prohibitive limitations of the current edge mindset: (1) servers are not distributed enough and thus, are not close enough to vehicles, (2) current proposed edge solutions do not provide substantially better performance and extra information specific to autonomous vehicles to warrant their cost to the user, and (3) the state-of-the-art solutions are not compatible with popular frameworks used in autonomous systems, particularly the Robot Operating System (ROS).   To remedy these issues, we provide Genie, an encapsulation technique that can enable transparent caching in ROS in a non-intrusive way (i.e., without modifying the source code), can build the cache in a distributed manner (in contrast to traditional central caching methods), and can construct a collective three-dimensional object map to provide substantially better latency (even on low-power edge servers) and higher quality data to all vehicles in a certain locality. We fully implement our design on state-of-the-art industry-adopted embedded and edge platforms, using the prominent autonomous driving software Autoware, and find that Genie can enhance the latency of Autoware Vision Detector by 82% on average, enable object reusability 31% of the time on average and as much as 67% for the incoming requests, and boost the confidence in its object map considerably over time.

### Eigen Attention: Attention in Low-Rank Space for KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Utkarsh Saxena, Gobinda Saha, Sakshi Choudhary, Kaushik Roy

**Updated**: 2024-08-10T22:47:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the domain of natural language processing due to their impressive reasoning abilities. Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the context lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex tasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new bottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen Attention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby reducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we demonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache sizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop in performance.

### ICGMM: CXL-enabled Memory Expansion with Intelligent Caching Using   Gaussian Mixture Model
**Authors**: Hanqiu Chen, Yitu Wang, Luis Vitorio Cargnini, Mohammadreza Soltaniyeh, Dongyang Li, Gongjin Sun, Pradeep Subedi, Andrew Chang, Yiran Chen, Cong Hao

**Updated**: 2024-08-10T19:17:46Z

**Summary**: Compute Express Link (CXL) emerges as a solution for wide gap between computational speed and data communication rates among host and multiple devices. It fosters a unified and coherent memory space between host and CXL storage devices such as such as Solid-state drive (SSD) for memory expansion, with a corresponding DRAM implemented as the device cache. However, this introduces challenges such as substantial cache miss penalties, sub-optimal caching due to data access granularity mismatch between the DRAM "cache" and SSD "memory", and inefficient hardware cache management. To address these issues, we propose a novel solution, named ICGMM, which optimizes caching and eviction directly on hardware, employing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based approach. We prototype our solution on an FPGA board, which demonstrates a noteworthy improvement compared to the classic Least Recently Used (LRU) cache strategy. We observe a decrease in the cache miss rate ranging from 0.32% to 6.14%, leading to a substantial 16.23% to 39.14% reduction in the average SSD access latency. Furthermore, when compared to the state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based cache policies, our GMM algorithm on FPGA showcases an impressive latency reduction of over 10,000 times. Remarkably, this is achieved while demanding much fewer hardware resources.

### Time-resolved measurement of neutron energy isotropy in a   sheared-flow-stabilized Z pinch
**Authors**: R. A. Ryan, P. E. Tsai, A. R. Johansen, A. Youmans, D. P. Higginson, J. M. Mitrani, C. S. Adams, D. A. Sutherland, B. Levitt, U. Shumlak

**Updated**: 2024-08-09T16:48:01Z

**Summary**: Previous measurements of neutron energy using fast plastic scintillators while operating the Fusion Z Pinch Experiment (FuZE) constrained the energy of any yield-producing deuteron beams to less than $4.65 keV$. FuZE has since been operated at increasingly higher input power, resulting in increased plasma current and larger fusion neutron yields. A detailed experimental study of the neutron energy isotropy in these regimes applies more stringent limits to possible contributions from beam-target fusion. The FuZE device operated at $-25~kV$ charge voltage has resulted in average plasma currents of $370~kA$ and D-D fusion neutron yields of $4\times10^7$ neutrons per discharge. Measurements of the neutron energy isotropy under these operating conditions demonstrates the energy of deuteron beams is less than $7.4 \pm 5.6^\mathrm{(stat)} \pm 3.7^\mathrm{(syst)}~keV$. Characterization of the detector response has reduced the number of free parameters in the fit of the neutron energy distribution, improving the confidence in the forward-fit method. Gamma backgrounds have been measured and the impact of these contributions on the isotropy results have been studied. Additionally, a time dependent measurement of the isotropy has been resolved for the first time, indicating increases to possible deuteron beam energies at late times. This suggests the possible growth of $m$=0 instabilities at the end of the main radiation event but confirms that the majority of the neutron production exhibits isotropy consistent with thermonuclear origin.

**Authors**: Yilong Chen, Guoxia Wang, Junyuan Shang, Shiyao Cui, Zhenyu Zhang, Tingwen Liu, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun, Dianhai Yu, Hua Wu

**Updated**: 2024-08-08T01:20:13Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ignited an innovative surge of AI applications, marking a new era of exciting possibilities equipped with extended context windows. However, hosting these models is cost-prohibitive mainly due to the extensive memory consumption of KV Cache involving long-context modeling. Despite several works proposing to evict unnecessary tokens from the KV Cache, most of them rely on the biased local statistics of accumulated attention scores and report performance using unconvincing metric like perplexity on inadequate short-text evaluation. In this paper, we propose NACL, a general framework for long-context KV cache eviction that achieves more optimal and efficient eviction in a single operation during the encoding phase. Due to NACL's efficiency, we combine more accurate attention score statistics in PROXY TOKENS EVICTION with the diversified random eviction strategy of RANDOM EVICTION, aiming to alleviate the issue of attention bias and enhance the robustness in maintaining pivotal tokens for long-context modeling tasks. Notably, our method significantly improves the performance on short- and long-text tasks by 80% and 76% respectively, reducing KV Cache by up to 50% with over 95% performance maintenance. The code is available at https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Research/tree/master/NLP/ACL2024-NACL.

**Authors**: Yao Zhao, Youyang Qu, Yong Xiang, Md Palash Uddin, Dezhong Peng, Longxiang Gao

**Updated**: 2024-08-07T23:48:59Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in edge computing~(EC) have pushed cloud-based data caching services to edge, however, such emerging edge storage comes with numerous challenging and unique security issues. One of them is the problem of edge data integrity verification (EDIV) which coordinates multiple participants (e.g., data owners and edge nodes) to inspect whether data cached on edge is authentic. To date, various solutions have been proposed to address the EDIV problem, while there is no systematic review. Thus, we offer a comprehensive survey for the first time, aiming to show current research status, open problems, and potentially promising insights for readers to further investigate this under-explored field. Specifically, we begin by stating the significance of the EDIV problem, the integrity verification difference between data cached on cloud and edge, and three typical system models with corresponding inspection processes. To thoroughly assess prior research efforts, we synthesize a universal criteria framework that an effective verification approach should satisfy. On top of it, a schematic development timeline is developed to reveal the research advance on EDIV in a sequential manner, followed by a detailed review of the existing EDIV solutions. Finally, we highlight intriguing research challenges and possible directions for future work, along with a discussion on how forthcoming technology, e.g., machine learning and context-aware security, can augment security in EC. Given our findings, some major observations are: there is a noticeable trend to equip EDIV solutions with various functions and diversify study scenarios; completing EDIV within two types of participants (i.e., data owner and edge nodes) is garnering escalating interest among researchers; although the majority of existing methods rely on cryptography, emerging technology is being explored to handle the EDIV problem.

### Zero-Delay QKV Compression for Mitigating KV Cache and Network   Bottlenecks in LLM Inference
**Authors**: Zeyu Zhang, Haiying Shen

**Updated**: 2024-08-07T22:10:26Z

**Summary**: In large-language models, memory constraints in the key-value cache (KVC) pose a challenge during inference, especially with long prompts. In this work, we observed that compressing KV values is more effective than compressing the model regarding accuracy and job completion time (JCT). However, quantizing KV values and dropping less-important tokens incur significant runtime computational time overhead, delaying JCT. These methods also cannot reduce computation time or high network communication time overhead in sequence-parallelism (SP) frameworks for long prompts. To tackle these issues, based on our insightful observations from experimental analysis, we propose ZeroC, a Zero-delay QKV Compression system that eliminates time overhead and even reduces computation and communication time of the model operations. ZeroC innovatively embeds compression and decompression operations within model operations and adaptively determines compression ratios at a hybrid layer-token level. Further, it enables a communication-efficient SP inference framework. Trace-driven experiments demonstrate that ZeroC achieves up to 80% lower average JCT, 35% lower average perplexity, and 2.8x higher throughput with the same latency compared to state-of-the-art compression methods. ZeroC also reduces the average JCT of current LLM serving systems by up to 91% with the constraint of 0.1 perplexity increase. We open-sourced the code.

### Temporal Feature Matters: A Framework for Diffusion Model Quantization
**Authors**: Yushi Huang, Ruihao Gong, Xianglong Liu, Jing Liu, Yuhang Li, Jiwen Lu, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2024-08-07T20:43:10Z

**Summary**: The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant challenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference times and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising. Typically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are developed to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two maintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and hardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration..

### mucAI at WojoodNER 2024: Arabic Named Entity Recognition with Nearest   Neighbor Search
**Authors**: Ahmed Abdou, Tasneem Mohsen

**Updated**: 2024-08-07T09:34:55Z

**Summary**: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to identify and classify entities in text into predefined categories. However, when applied to Arabic data, NER encounters unique challenges stemming from the language's rich morphological inflections, absence of capitalization cues, and spelling variants, where a single word can comprise multiple morphemes. In this paper, we introduce Arabic KNN-NER, our submission to the Wojood NER Shared Task 2024 (ArabicNLP 2024). We have participated in the shared sub-task 1 Flat NER. In this shared sub-task, we tackle fine-grained flat-entity recognition for Arabic text, where we identify a single main entity and possibly zero or multiple sub-entities for each word. Arabic KNN-NER augments the probability distribution of a fine-tuned model with another label probability distribution derived from performing a KNN search over the cached training data. Our submission achieved 91% on the test set on the WojoodFine dataset, placing Arabic KNN-NER on top of the leaderboard for the shared task.

### Potential and Limitation of High-Frequency Cores and Caches
**Authors**: Kunal Pai, Anusheel Nand, Jason Lowe-Power

**Updated**: 2024-08-06T17:16:19Z

**Summary**: This paper explores the potential of cryogenic computing and superconducting electronics as promising alternatives to traditional semiconductor devices. As semiconductor devices face challenges such as increased leakage currents and reduced performance at higher temperatures, these novel technologies offer high performance and low power computation. Cryogenic computing operates at ultra-low temperatures near 77 K, leading to lower leakage currents and improved electron mobility. On the other hand, superconducting electronics, operating near 0 K, allow electrons to flow without resistance, offering the potential for ultra-low-power, high-speed computation. This study presents a comprehensive performance modeling and analysis of these technologies and provides insights into their potential benefits and limitations. We implement models of in-order and out-of-order cores operating at high clock frequencies associated with superconducting electronics and cryogenic computing in gem5. We evaluate the performance of these components using workloads representative of real-world applications like NPB, SPEC CPU2006, and GAPBS. Our results show the potential speedups achievable by these components and the limitations posed by cache bandwidth. This work provides valuable insights into the performance implications and design trade-offs associated with cryogenic and superconducting technologies, laying the foundation for future research in this field using gem5.

### LLMs as Probabilistic Minimally Adequate Teachers for DFA Learning
**Authors**: Lekai Chen, Ashutosh Trivedi, Alvaro Velasquez

**Updated**: 2024-08-06T07:12:09Z

**Summary**: The emergence of intelligence in large language models (LLMs) has inspired investigations into their integration into automata learning. This paper introduces the probabilistic Minimally Adequate Teacher (pMAT) formulation, which leverages a probabilistic oracle that could give persistent errors randomly during answering the membership queries for deterministic finite automata (DFA) learning. Given the tendency of LLMs to produce hallucinatory content, we have developed techniques to improve answer accuracy and ensure the correctness of the learned automata. We propose the $\mathtt{Discrimination}$ prompt as well as the $\mathtt{Verification}$ prompt and explore their advantages over common prompts. Additionally, we compare DFA learning performance between the TTT algorithm and common active learning algorithms. To address the exponential number of persistent errors, we implement a dynamic query cache refinement algorithm that identifies and corrects conflicting queries by combining the active and passive learning algorithms. The empirical results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach, providing a theoretical foundation for automata learning with LLMs in the loop.

### NVPC: A Transparent NVM Page Cache
**Authors**: Guoyu Wang, Xilong Che, Haoyang Wei, Shuo Chen, Puyi He, Juncheng Hu

**Updated**: 2024-08-06T02:51:22Z

**Summary**: Towards a compatible utilization of NVM, NVM-specialized kernel file systems and NVM-based disk file system accelerators have been proposed. However, these studies only focus on one or several characteristics of NVM, while failing to exploit its best practice by putting NVM in the proper position of the whole storage stack. In this paper, we present NVPC, a transparent acceleration to existing kernel file systems with an NVM-enhanced page cache. The acceleration lies in two aspects, respectively matching the desperate needs of existing disk file systems: sync writes and cache-missed operations. Besides, the fast DRAM page cache is preserved for cache-hit operations. For sync writes, a high-performance log-based sync absorbing area is provided to redirect data destination from the slow disk to the fast NVM. Meanwhile, the byte-addressable feature of NVM is used to prevent write amplification. For cache-missed operations, NVPC makes use of the idle space on NVM to extend the DRAM page cache, so that more and larger workloads can fit into the cache. NVPC is entirely implemented as a page cache, thus can provide efficient speed-up to disk file systems with full transparency to users and full compatibility to lower file systems.   In Filebench macro-benchmarks, NVPC achieves at most 3.55x, 2.84x, and 2.64x faster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS. In RocksDB workloads with working set larger than DRAM, NVPC achieves 1.12x, 2.59x, and 2.11x faster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS. Meanwhile, NVPC gains positive revenue from NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS in 62.5% of the tested cases in our read/write/sync mixed evaluation, demonstrating that NVPC is more balanced and adaptive to complex real-world workloads. Experimental results also show that NVPC is the only method that accelerates Ext-4 in particular cases for up to 15.19x, with no slow-down to any other use cases.

### Electron-beam-induced modification of gold microparticles in an SEM
**Authors**: Kristina Weinel, Marc Benjamin Hahn, Axel Lubk, Wen Feng, Ignacio Gonzalez Martinez, Bernd Büchner, Leonardo Agudo Jácome

**Updated**: 2024-08-05T12:09:50Z

**Summary**: Electron-beam-induced conversion of materials in a transmission electron microscope uses the high power density of a localized electron beam of acceleration voltages above 100 kV as an energy source to transform matter at the sub-micron scale. Here, the e-beam-induced transformation of precursor microparticles employing a low-energy e-beam with an acceleration voltage of 30 kV in a scanning electron microscope is developed to increase the versatility and efficiency of the technique. Under these conditions, the technique can be classified between e-beam lithography, where the e-beam is used to mill holes in or grow some different material onto a substrate, and e-beam welding, where matter can be welded together when overcoming the melting phase. Modifying gold microparticles on an amorphous SiOx substrate reveals the dominant role of inelastic electron-matter interaction and subsequent localized heating for the observed melting and vaporization of the precursor microparticles under the electron beam. Monte-Carlo scattering simulations and thermodynamic modeling further support the findings.

### SLO-aware GPU Frequency Scaling for Energy Efficient LLM Inference   Serving
**Authors**: Andreas Kosmas Kakolyris, Dimosthenis Masouros, Petros Vavaroutsos, Sotirios Xydis, Dimitrios Soudris

**Updated**: 2024-08-05T09:07:06Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction, their reliance on power-hungry GPUs places ever-increasing energy demands, raising environmental and monetary concerns. Inference dominates LLM workloads, presenting a critical challenge for providers: minimizing energy costs under Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) that ensure optimal user experience. In this paper, we present \textit{throttLL'eM}, a framework that reduces energy consumption while meeting SLOs through the use of instance and GPU frequency scaling. \textit{throttLL'eM} features mechanisms that project future KV cache usage and batch size. Leveraging a Machine-Learning (ML) model that receives these projections as inputs, \textit{throttLL'eM} manages performance at the iteration level to satisfy SLOs with reduced frequencies and instance sizes. We show that the proposed ML model achieves $R^2$ scores greater than 0.97 and miss-predicts performance by less than 1 iteration per second on average. Experimental results on LLM inference traces show that \textit{throttLL'eM} achieves up to 43.8\% lower energy consumption and an energy efficiency improvement of at least $1.71\times$ under SLOs, when compared to NVIDIA's Triton server.

### TriForce: Lossless Acceleration of Long Sequence Generation with   Hierarchical Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Hanshi Sun, Zhuoming Chen, Xinyu Yang, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-04T00:58:04Z

**Summary**: With large language models (LLMs) widely deployed in long content generation recently, there has emerged an increasing demand for efficient long-sequence inference support. However, key-value (KV) cache, which is stored to avoid re-computation, has emerged as a critical bottleneck by growing linearly in size with the sequence length. Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the entire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low utilization of computational cores and high latency. While various compression methods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer from degradation in generation quality. We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical speculative decoding system that is scalable for long sequence generation. This approach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via retrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the hierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting latency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K, achieving up to 2.31$\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in handling even longer contexts. For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs, TriForce achieves 0.108s/token$\unicode{x2014}$only half as slow as the auto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\times$ on our optimized offloading system. Additionally, TriForce performs 4.86$\times$ than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference on a single RTX 4090 GPU. TriForce's robustness is highlighted by its consistently outstanding performance across various temperatures. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/TriForce.

### Cross-layer Attention Sharing for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yongyu Mu, Yuzhang Wu, Yuchun Fan, Chenglong Wang, Hengyu Li, Qiaozhi He, Murun Yang, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-08-04T00:38:34Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) evolve, the increase in model depth and parameter number leads to substantial redundancy. To enhance the efficiency of the attention mechanism, previous works primarily compress the KV cache or group attention heads, while largely overlooking redundancy between layers. Our comprehensive analyses across various LLMs show that highly similar attention patterns persist within most layers. It's intuitive to save the computation by sharing attention weights across layers. However, further analysis reveals two challenges: (1) Directly sharing the weight matrix without carefully rearranging the attention heads proves to be ineffective; (2) Shallow layers are vulnerable to small deviations in attention weights. Driven by these insights, we introduce LiSA, a lightweight substitute for self-attention in well-trained LLMs. LiSA employs tiny feed-forward networks to align attention heads between adjacent layers and low-rank matrices to approximate differences in layer-wise attention weights. Evaluations encompassing 13 typical benchmarks demonstrate that LiSA maintains high response quality in terms of accuracy and perplexity while reducing redundant attention calculations within 53-84% of the total layers. Our implementations of LiSA achieve a 6X compression of Q and K, with maximum throughput improvements of 19.5% for LLaMA3-8B and 32.3% for LLaMA2-7B.

### Multi-Material Decomposition Using Spectral Diffusion Posterior Sampling
**Authors**: Xiao Jiang, Grace J. Gang, J. Webster Stayman

**Updated**: 2024-08-02T18:25:57Z

**Summary**: Many spectral CT applications require accurate material decomposition. Existing material decomposition algorithms are often susceptible to significant noise magnification or, in the case of one-step model-based approaches, hampered by slow convergence rates and large computational requirements. In this work, we proposed a novel framework - spectral diffusion posterior sampling (spectral DPS) - for one-step reconstruction and multi-material decomposition, which combines sophisticated prior information captured by one-time unsupervised learning and an arbitrary analytic physical system model. Spectral DPS is built upon a general DPS framework for nonlinear inverse problems. Several strategies developed in previous work, including jumpstart sampling, Jacobian approximation, and multi-step likelihood updates are applied facilitate stable and accurate decompositions. The effectiveness of spectral DPS was evaluated on a simulated dual-layer and a kV-switching spectral system as well as on a physical cone-beam CT (CBCT) test bench. In simulation studies, spectral DPS improved PSNR by 27.49% to 71.93% over baseline DPS and by 26.53% to 57.30% over MBMD, depending on the the region of interest. In physical phantom study, spectral DPS achieved a <1% error in estimating the mean density in a homogeneous region. Compared with baseline DPS, spectral DPS effectively avoided generating false structures in the homogeneous phantom and reduced the variability around edges. Both simulation and physical phantom studies demonstrated the superior performance of spectral DPS for stable and accurate material decomposition.

### Search-in-Memory (SiM): Reliable, Versatile, and Efficient Data Matching   in SSD's NAND Flash Memory Chip for Data Indexing Acceleration
**Authors**: Yun-Chih Chen, Yuan-Hao Chang, Tei-Wei Kuo

**Updated**: 2024-08-02T07:37:51Z

**Summary**: To index the increasing volume of data, modern data indexes are typically stored on SSDs and cached in DRAM. However, searching such an index has resulted in significant I/O traffic due to limited access locality and inefficient cache utilization. At the heart of index searching is the operation of filtering through vast data spans to isolate a small, relevant subset, which involves basic equality tests rather than the complex arithmetic provided by modern CPUs. This paper introduces the Search-in-Memory (SiM) chip, which demonstrates the feasibility of performing data filtering directly within a NAND flash memory chip, transmitting only relevant search results rather than complete pages. Instead of adding complex circuits, we propose repurposing existing circuitry for efficient and accurate bitwise parallel matching. We demonstrate how different data structures can use our flexible SIMD command interface to offload index searches. This strategy not only frees up the CPU for more computationally demanding tasks, but it also optimizes DRAM usage for write buffering, significantly lowering energy consumption associated with I/O transmission between the CPU and DRAM. Extensive testing across a wide range of workloads reveals up to a 9X speedup in write-heavy workloads and up to 45% energy savings due to reduced read and write I/O. Furthermore, we achieve significant reductions in median and tail read latencies of up to 89% and 85% respectively.

### Caching Aided Multi-Tenant Serverless Computing
**Authors**: Chu Qiao, Cong Wang, Zhenkai Zhang, Yuede Ji, Xing Gao

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T23:52:43Z

**Summary**: One key to enabling high-performance serverless computing is to mitigate cold-starts. Current solutions utilize a warm pool to keep function alive: a warm-start can be analogous to a CPU cache-hit. However, modern cache has multiple hierarchies and the last-level cache is shared among cores, whereas the warm pool is limited to a single tenant for security concerns. Also, the warm pool keep-alive policy can be further optimized using cache replacement algorithms. In this paper, we borrow practical optimizations from caching, and design FaasCamp, a caching-aided multi-tenant serverless computing framework. FaasCamp extends the single-tier warm pool into multi-tiers, with a reclaim pool introduced enabling secure function instance sharing among tenants. Also, FaasCamp leverages machine learning to approximate the optimal cache replacement policy to improve the warm rate. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments under multiple scenarios. The results show that FaasCamp can outperform existing platforms with minimal overhead.

### Do language models plan ahead for future tokens?
**Authors**: Wilson Wu, John X. Morris, Lionel Levine

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T21:21:28Z

**Summary**: Do transformers "think ahead" during inference at a given position? It is known transformers prepare information in the hidden states of the forward pass at time step $t$ that is then used in future forward passes $t+\tau$. We posit two explanations for this phenomenon: pre-caching, in which off-diagonal gradient terms present during training result in the model computing features at $t$ irrelevant to the present inference task but useful for the future, and breadcrumbs, in which features most relevant to time step $t$ are already the same as those that would most benefit inference at time $t+\tau$. We test these hypotheses by training language models without propagating gradients to past timesteps, a scheme we formalize as myopic training. In a constructed synthetic data setting, we find clear evidence for pre-caching. In the autoregressive language modeling setting, our experiments are more suggestive of the breadcrumbs hypothesis, though pre-caching increases with model scale.

### Intermittent Semi-working Mask: A New Masking Paradigm for LLMs
**Authors**: Mingcong Lu, Jiangcai Zhu, Wang Hao, Zheng Li, Shusheng Zhang, Kailai Shao, Chao Chen, Nan Li, Feng Wang, Xin Lu

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T13:22:01Z

**Summary**: Multi-turn dialogues are a key interaction method between humans and Large Language Models (LLMs), as conversations extend over multiple rounds, keeping LLMs' high generation quality and low latency is a challenge. Mainstream LLMs can be grouped into two categories based on masking strategy: causal LLM and prefix LLM. Several works have demonstrated that prefix LLMs tend to outperform causal ones in scenarios that heavily depend on historical context such as multi-turn dialogues or in-context learning, thanks to their bidirectional attention on prefix sequences. However, prefix LLMs have an inherent inefficient training problem in multi-turn dialogue datasets. In addition, the attention mechanism of prefix LLM makes it unable to reuse Key-Value Cache (KV Cache) across dialogue rounds to reduce generation latency. In this paper, we propose a novel masking scheme called Intermittent Semi-working Mask (ISM) to address these problems. Specifically, we apply alternate bidirectional and unidirectional attention on queries and answers in the dialogue history. In this way, ISM is able to maintain the high quality of prefix LLM and low generation latency of causal LLM, simultaneously. Extensive experiments illustrate that our ISM achieves significant performance.

### MoE-Infinity: Offloading-Efficient MoE Model Serving
**Authors**: Leyang Xue, Yao Fu, Zhan Lu, Luo Mai, Mahesh Marina

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T13:21:24Z

**Summary**: This paper presents MoE-Infinity, an offloading-efficient serving system for sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. To optimize offloading, MoE-Infinity achieves novel request-level tracing for expert activation, capturing MoE's sparse execution patterns such as selective activation, group activation, and skewed reuse. Leveraging the request-level trace, MoE-Infinity performs effective expert prefetching and expert caching, achieving high efficiency in transferring model parameters from host memory to GPU memory. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-Infinity achieves low latency comparable to expensive full-GPU deployments, which require up to 4X more GPU resources than MoE-Infinity. Compared to offloading-supporting LLM serving systems such as DeepSpeed-Inference, Llama.cpp, Mixtral Offloading, and BrainStorm, MoE-Infinity exhibits superior latency performance, providing 2-20X improvements when serving various MoE models for a large collection of LLM tasks. MoE-Infinity's source code is publicly available a https://github.com/TorchMoE/MoE-Infinity

### ChunkAttention: Efficient Self-Attention with Prefix-Aware KV Cache and   Two-Phase Partition
**Authors**: Lu Ye, Ze Tao, Yong Huang, Yang Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T07:51:25Z

**Summary**: Self-attention is an essential component of large language models (LLM) but a significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant LLM serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8$\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096.

### CDFGNN: a Systematic Design of Cache-based Distributed Full-Batch Graph   Neural Network Training with Communication Reduction
**Authors**: Shuai Zhang, Zite Jiang, Haihang You

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T01:57:09Z

**Summary**: Graph neural network training is mainly categorized into mini-batch and full-batch training methods. The mini-batch training method samples subgraphs from the original graph in each iteration. This sampling operation introduces extra computation overhead and reduces the training accuracy. Meanwhile, the full-batch training method calculates the features and corresponding gradients of all vertices in each iteration, and therefore has higher convergence accuracy. However, in the distributed cluster, frequent remote accesses of vertex features and gradients lead to huge communication overhead, thus restricting the overall training efficiency.   In this paper, we introduce the cached-based distributed full-batch graph neural network training framework (CDFGNN). We propose the adaptive cache mechanism to reduce the remote vertex access by caching the historical features and gradients of neighbor vertices. Besides, we further optimize the communication overhead by quantifying the messages and designing the graph partition algorithm for the hierarchical communication architecture. Experiments show that the adaptive cache mechanism reduces remote vertex accesses by 63.14% on average. Combined with communication quantization and hierarchical GP algorithm, CDFGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed full-batch training frameworks by 30.39% in our experiments. Our results indicate that CDFGNN has great potential in accelerating distributed full-batch GNN training tasks.

### Towards Variable-Length In-Network Caching
**Authors**: Gyuyeong Kim

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T00:41:52Z

**Summary**: We present StarCache, a new in-network caching architecture that can cache variable-length items to balance a wide range of key-value workloads. Unlike existing works, StarCache does not cache hot items in the switch memory. Instead, we make hot items revisit the switch data plane continuously by exploiting packet recirculation. Our approach keeps cached key-value pairs in the switch data plane while freeing them from item size limitations caused by hardware constraints. We implement a StarCache prototype on an Intel Tofino switch. Our experimental results show that StarCache can balance highly skewed workloads with various key and value sizes.

### A2SF: Accumulative Attention Scoring with Forgetting Factor for Token   Pruning in Transformer Decoder
**Authors**: Hyun-rae Jo, Dongkun Shin

**Updated**: 2024-07-31T02:02:40Z

**Summary**: Recently, large language models (LLM) based on transformers are facing memory bottleneck issues due to KV cache, especially in long sequence handling. Previous researches proposed KV cache compression techniques that identify insignificant tokens based on Accumulative Attention Scores and removes their items from KV cache, noting that only few tokens play an important role in attention operations. However, we have observed that the existing Accumulative Attention Score is not suitable for the transformer decoder structure. In the decoder model, the number of times the Attention Score accumulates varies depending on the order of token appearance due to the effect of masking, causing an uneven comparison between tokens. To solve this, we propose Accumulative Attention Score with Forgetting Factor (A2SF) technique, which introduces a Forgetting Factor in the Attention Score accumulation process. A2SF applies a penalty to the past Attention Score generated from old tokens by repeatedly multiplying the Forgetting Factor to the Attention Score over time. Therefore, older tokens receive a larger penalty, providing fairness among different ages of tokens. Through the fair comparison among tokens, we can more effectively select important tokens. We have verified the accuracy improvement through A2SF in the OPT and LLaMA models and A2SF improves the accuracy of LLaMA 2 by up to 7.8% and 5.1% on 1-shot and 0-shot.

**Updated**: 2024-07-30T21:27:00Z

**Summary**: The possibility of electric field control of magnetocaloric effect through quasi-isostatic compression as a result of the converse piezoelectric effect was demonstrated on cylindrical type magnetoelectric composite MnAs/PZT. It was shown that an electric voltage of 100 V corresponding to an electric field of E ~0.3 kV/mm applied to the walls of the piezoelectric component PZT of the MnAs/PZT composite contributes to an increase in the maximum adiabatic temperature change by 0.2 K in the temperature range of the magnetostructural phase transition of MnAs ~317 K at magnetic field change of 1.8 T. Calculations using the finite element method have shown that an electric field voltage of 100 V is capable of creating a quasi-isostatic mechanical stress in the region inside a cylindrical PZT tube of ~3 MPa. Moreover, in the region of weak pressures up to 10 MPa, the contribution to the MCE from piezo compression linearly depends on the electrical voltage that can be used for control the MCE

**Authors**: Chi-Chih Chang, Wei-Cheng Lin, Chien-Yu Lin, Chong-Yan Chen, Yu-Fang Hu, Pei-Shuo Wang, Ning-Chi Huang, Luis Ceze, Kai-Chiang Wu

**Updated**: 2024-07-30T18:19:38Z

**Summary**: KV-Cache compression methods generally sample a KV-Cache of effectual tokens or quantize it into lower bits. However, these methods cannot exploit the redundancy of the hidden dimension of KV tensors. This paper investigates a unique hidden dimension approach called Palu, a novel KV-Cache compression framework that utilizes low-rank projection. Palu decomposes the linear layers into low-rank matrices, caches the smaller intermediate states, and reconstructs the full keys and values on the fly. To improve accuracy, compression rate, and efficiency, Palu further encompasses (1) a medium-grained low-rank decomposition scheme, (2) an efficient rank search algorithm, (3) a low-rank-aware quantization algorithm, and (4) matrix fusion with optimized GPU kernels. Our extensive experiments with popular LLMs show that Palu can compress KV-Cache by more than 91.25% while maintaining a significantly better accuracy (up to 1.19 lower perplexity) than state-of-the-art KV-Cache quantization methods at a similar or even higher memory usage. When compressing KV-Cache for 50%, Palu delivers up to 1.61x end-to-end speedup for the attention module. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/shadowpa0327/Palu.

**Authors**: Yuhui Xu, Zhanming Jie, Hanze Dong, Lei Wang, Xudong Lu, Aojun Zhou, Amrita Saha, Caiming Xiong, Doyen Sahoo

**Updated**: 2024-07-30T17:59:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications by leveraging increased model sizes and sequence lengths. However, the associated rise in computational and memory costs poses significant challenges, particularly in managing long sequences due to the quadratic complexity of the transformer attention mechanism. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence lengths, we uncover that the channel dimension of the KV cache exhibits significant redundancy, characterized by unbalanced magnitude distribution and low-rank structure in attention weights. Based on these observations, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction methods. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA3 and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets confirm the efficacy of ThinK, setting a new precedent for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance. We also outline the potential of extending our method to value cache pruning, demonstrating ThinK's versatility and broad applicability in reducing both memory and computational overheads.

### SpChar: Characterizing the Sparse Puzzle via Decision Trees
**Authors**: Francesco Sgherzi, Marco Siracusa, Ivan Fernandez, Adrià Armejach, Miquel Moretó

**Updated**: 2024-07-30T13:06:36Z

**Summary**: Sparse matrix computation is crucial in various modern applications, including large-scale graph analytics, deep learning, and recommender systems. The performance of sparse kernels varies greatly depending on the structure of the input matrix, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of sparse computation and its relationship to inputs, algorithms, and target machine architecture. Despite extensive research on certain sparse kernels, such as Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV), the overall family of sparse algorithms has yet to be investigated as a whole. This paper introduces SpChar, a workload characterization methodology for general sparse computation. SpChar employs tree-based models to identify the most relevant hardware and input characteristics, starting from hardware and input-related metrics gathered from Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) and matrices. Our analysis enables the creation of a characterization loop that facilitates the optimization of sparse computation by mapping the impact of architectural features to inputs and algorithmic choices. We apply SpChar to more than 600 matrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix collection and three state-of-the-art Arm CPUs to determine the critical hardware and software characteristics that affect sparse computation. In our analysis, we determine that the biggest limiting factors for high-performance sparse computation are (1) the latency of the memory system, (2) the pipeline flush overhead resulting from branch misprediction, and (3) the poor reuse of cached elements. Additionally, we propose software and hardware optimizations that designers can implement to create a platform suitable for sparse computation. We then investigate these optimizations using the gem5 simulator to achieve a significant speedup of up to 2.63x compared to a CPU where the optimizations are not applied.

**Updated**: 2024-07-30T12:16:39Z

**Summary**: Applications with irregular data structures, data-dependent control flows and fine-grained data transfers (e.g., real-world graph computations) perform poorly on cache-based systems. We propose the UpDown accelerator that supports fine-grained execution with novel architecture mechanisms - lightweight threading, event-driven scheduling, efficient ultra-short threads, and split-transaction DRAM access with software-controlled synchronization. These hardware primitives support software programmable events, enabling high performance on diverse data structures and algorithms. UpDown also supports scalable performance; hardware replication enables programs to scale up performance. Evaluation results show UpDown's flexibility and scalability enable it to outperform CPUs on graph mining and analytics computations by up to 116-195x geomean speedup and more than 4x speedup over prior accelerators. We show that UpDown generates high memory parallelism (~4.6x over CPU) required for memory intensive graph computations. We present measurements that attribute the performance of UpDown (23x architectural advantage) to its individual architectural mechanisms. Finally, we also analyze the area and power cost of UpDown's mechanisms for software programmability.

### Noise-Tolerant Few-Shot Unsupervised Adapter for Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Eman Ali, Muhammad Haris Khan

**Updated**: 2024-07-30T08:39:52Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models have achieved impressive performance in various zero-shot image classification tasks. While prior studies have demonstrated significant improvements by introducing few-shot labelled target samples, they still require labelling of target samples, which greatly degrades their scalability and generalizability while handling various visual recognition tasks. We design NtUA, a Noise-tolerant Unsupervised Adapter that allows the learning of effective target models with few unlabelled target samples. NtUA works as a key-value cache that formulates visual features and predicted pseudo-labels of the few unlabelled target samples as key-value pairs. It consists of two complementary designs. The first is adaptive cache formation that combats pseudo-label noises by weighting the key-value pairs according to their prediction confidence. The second is knowledge-guided cache refinement, which refines pair values (i.e., pseudo-labels) and cache weights by leveraging knowledge distillation from large-scale vision language models. Extensive experiments show that NtUA achieves superior performance consistently across multiple widely adopted benchmarks.

### Robust Federated Learning for Wireless Networks: A Demonstration with   Channel Estimation
**Authors**: Zexin Fang, Bin Han, Hans D. Schotten

**Updated**: 2024-07-30T08:19:53Z

**Summary**: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving collaborative approach for training models in wireless networks, with channel estimation emerging as a promising application. Despite extensive studies on FL-empowered channel estimation, the security concerns associated with FL require meticulous attention. In a scenario where small base stations (SBSs) serve as local models trained on cached data, and a macro base station (MBS) functions as the global model setting, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability of FL, launching attacks with various adversarial attacks or deployment tactics. In this paper, we analyze such vulnerabilities, corresponding solutions were brought forth, and validated through simulation.

### Can Increasing the Hit Ratio Hurt Cache Throughput? (Long Version)
**Authors**: Ziyue Qiu, Juncheng Yang, Mor Harchol-Balter

**Updated**: 2024-07-30T04:01:25Z

**Summary**: Software caches are an intrinsic component of almost every computer system. Consequently, caching algorithms, particularly eviction policies, are the topic of many papers. Almost all these prior papers evaluate the caching algorithm based on its hit ratio, namely the fraction of requests that are found in the cache, as opposed to disk. The hit ratio is viewed as a proxy for traditional performance metrics like system throughput or response time. Intuitively it makes sense that higher hit ratio should lead to higher throughput (and lower response time), since more requests are found in the cache (low access time) as opposed to the disk (high access time).   This paper challenges this intuition. We show that increasing the hit ratio can actually hurt the throughput (and response time) for many caching algorithms. Our investigation follows a three-pronged approach involving (i) queueing modeling and analysis, (ii) implementation and measurement, and (iii) simulation to validate the accuracy of the queueing model. We also show that the phenomenon of throughput decreasing at higher hit ratios is likely to be more pronounced in future systems, where the trend is towards faster disks and higher numbers of cores per CPU.

**Authors**: Dhruv Gajaria, Kevin Antony Gomez, Tosiron Adegbija

**Updated**: 2024-07-29T01:43:26Z

**Summary**: In-memory computing promises to overcome the von Neumann bottleneck in computer systems by performing computations directly within the memory. Previous research has suggested using Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM) for in-memory computing due to its non-volatility, low leakage power, high density, endurance, and commercial viability. This paper explores hierarchical in-memory computing, where different levels of the memory hierarchy are augmented with processing elements to optimize workload execution. The paper investigates processing in memory (PiM) using non-volatile STT-RAM and processing in cache (PiC) using volatile STT-RAM with relaxed retention, which helps mitigate STT-RAM's write latency and energy overheads. We analyze tradeoffs and overheads associated with data movement for PiC versus write overheads for PiM using STT-RAMs for various workloads. We examine workload characteristics, such as computational intensity and CPU-dependent workloads with limited instruction-level parallelism, and their impact on PiC/PiM tradeoffs. Using these workloads, we evaluate computing in STT-RAM versus SRAM at different cache hierarchy levels and explore the potential of heterogeneous STT-RAM cache architectures with various retention times for PiC and CPU-based computing. Our experiments reveal significant advantages of STT-RAM-based PiC over PiM for specific workloads. Finally, we describe open research problems in hierarchical in-memory computing architectures to further enhance this paradigm.

### CHIME: Energy-Efficient STT-RAM-based Concurrent Hierarchical In-Memory   Processing
**Authors**: Dhruv Gajaria, Tosiron Adegbija, Kevin Gomez

**Updated**: 2024-07-29T01:17:54Z

**Summary**: Processing-in-cache (PiC) and Processing-in-memory (PiM) architectures, especially those utilizing bit-line computing, offer promising solutions to mitigate data movement bottlenecks within the memory hierarchy. While previous studies have explored the integration of compute units within individual memory levels, the complexity and potential overheads associated with these designs have often limited their capabilities. This paper introduces a novel PiC/PiM architecture, Concurrent Hierarchical In-Memory Processing (CHIME), which strategically incorporates heterogeneous compute units across multiple levels of the memory hierarchy. This design targets the efficient execution of diverse, domain-specific workloads by placing computations closest to the data where it optimizes performance, energy consumption, data movement costs, and area. CHIME employs STT-RAM due to its various advantages in PiC/PiM computing, such as high density, low leakage, and better resiliency to data corruption from activating multiple word lines. We demonstrate that CHIME enhances concurrency and improves compute unit utilization at each level of the memory hierarchy. We present strategies for exploring the design space, grouping, and placing the compute units across the memory hierarchy. Experiments reveal that, compared to the state-of-the-art bit-line computing approaches, CHIME achieves significant speedup and energy savings of 57.95% and 78.23% for various domain-specific workloads, while reducing the overheads associated with single-level compute designs.

### ARC: DVFS-Aware Asymmetric-Retention STT-RAM Caches for Energy-Efficient   Multicore Processors
**Authors**: Dhruv Gajaria, Tosiron Adegbija

**Updated**: 2024-07-28T23:43:59Z

**Summary**: Relaxed retention (or volatile) spin-transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM) has been widely studied as a way to reduce STT-RAM's write energy and latency overheads. Given a relaxed retention time STT-RAM level one (L1) cache, we analyze the impacts of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) -- a common optimization in modern processors -- on STT-RAM L1 cache design. Our analysis reveals that, apart from the fact that different applications may require different retention times, the clock frequency, which is typically ignored in most STT-RAM studies, may also significantly impact applications' retention time needs. Based on our findings, we propose an asymmetric-retention core (ARC) design for multicore architectures. ARC features retention time heterogeneity to specialize STT-RAM retention times to applications' needs. We also propose a runtime prediction model to determine the best core on which to run an application, based on the applications' characteristics, their retention time requirements, and available DVFS settings. Results reveal that the proposed approach can reduce the average cache energy by 20.19% and overall processor energy by 7.66%, compared to a homogeneous STT-RAM cache design.

### SCART: Predicting STT-RAM Cache Retention Times Using Machine Learning
**Authors**: Dhruv Gajaria, Kyle Kuan, Tosiron Adegbija

**Updated**: 2024-07-28T22:34:20Z

**Summary**: Prior studies have shown that the retention time of the non-volatile spin-transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM) can be relaxed in order to reduce STT-RAM's write energy and latency. However, since different applications may require different retention times, STT-RAM retention times must be critically explored to satisfy various applications' needs. This process can be challenging due to exploration overhead, and exacerbated by the fact that STT-RAM caches are emerging and are not readily available for design time exploration. This paper explores using known and easily obtainable statistics (e.g., SRAM statistics) to predict the appropriate STT-RAM retention times, in order to minimize exploration overhead. We propose an STT-RAM Cache Retention Time (SCART) model, which utilizes machine learning to enable design time or runtime prediction of right-provisioned STT-RAM retention times for latency or energy optimization. Experimental results show that, on average, SCART can reduce the latency and energy by 20.34% and 29.12%, respectively, compared to a homogeneous retention time while reducing the exploration overheads by 52.58% compared to prior work.

### Missile: Fine-Grained, Hardware-Level GPU Resource Isolation for   Multi-Tenant DNN Inference
**Authors**: Yongkang Zhang, Haoxuan Yu, Chenxia Han, Cheng Wang, Baotong Lu, Yang Li, Xiaowen Chu, Huaicheng Li

**Updated**: 2024-07-27T08:52:39Z

**Summary**: Colocating high-priority, latency-sensitive (LS) and low-priority, best-effort (BE) DNN inference services reduces the total cost of ownership (TCO) of GPU clusters. Limited by bottlenecks such as VRAM channel conflicts and PCIe bus contentions, existing GPU sharing solutions are unable to avoid resource conflicts among concurrently executing tasks, failing to achieve both low latency for LS tasks and high throughput for BE tasks. To bridge this gap, this paper presents Missile, a general GPU sharing solution for multi-tenant DNN inference on NVIDIA GPUs. Missile approximates fine-grained GPU hardware resource isolation between multiple LS and BE DNN tasks at software level. Through comprehensive reverse engineering, Missile first reveals a general VRAM channel hash mapping architecture of NVIDIA GPUs and eliminates VRAM channel conflicts using software-level cache coloring. It also isolates the PCIe bus and fairly allocates PCIe bandwidth using completely fair scheduler. We evaluate 12 mainstream DNNs with synthetic and real-world workloads on four GPUs. The results show that compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing solutions, Missile reduces tail latency for LS services by up to ~50%, achieves up to 6.1x BE job throughput, and allocates PCIe bus bandwidth to tenants on-demand for optimal performance.

### Faster Image2Video Generation: A Closer Look at CLIP Image Embedding's   Impact on Spatio-Temporal Cross-Attentions
**Authors**: Ashkan Taghipour, Morteza Ghahremani, Mohammed Bennamoun, Aref Miri Rekavandi, Zinuo Li, Hamid Laga, Farid Boussaid

**Updated**: 2024-07-27T08:21:14Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates the role of CLIP image embeddings within the Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) framework, focusing on their impact on video generation quality and computational efficiency. Our findings indicate that CLIP embeddings, while crucial for aesthetic quality, do not significantly contribute towards the subject and background consistency of video outputs. Moreover, the computationally expensive cross-attention mechanism can be effectively replaced by a simpler linear layer. This layer is computed only once at the first diffusion inference step, and its output is then cached and reused throughout the inference process, thereby enhancing efficiency while maintaining high-quality outputs. Building on these insights, we introduce the VCUT, a training-free approach optimized for efficiency within the SVD architecture. VCUT eliminates temporal cross-attention and replaces spatial cross-attention with a one-time computed linear layer, significantly reducing computational load. The implementation of VCUT leads to a reduction of up to 322T Multiple-Accumulate Operations (MACs) per video and a decrease in model parameters by up to 50M, achieving a 20% reduction in latency compared to the baseline. Our approach demonstrates that conditioning during the Semantic Binding stage is sufficient, eliminating the need for continuous computation across all inference steps and setting a new standard for efficient video generation.

### MetaHive: A Cache-Optimized Metadata Management for Heterogeneous   Key-Value Stores
**Authors**: Alireza Heidari, Amirhossein Ahmadi, Zefeng Zhi, Wei Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-07-26T21:11:58Z

**Summary**: Cloud key-value (KV) stores provide businesses with a cost-effective and adaptive alternative to traditional on-premise data management solutions. KV stores frequently consist of heterogeneous clusters, characterized by varying hardware specifications of the deployment nodes, with each node potentially running a distinct version of the KV store software. This heterogeneity is accompanied by the diverse metadata that they need to manage. In this study, we introduce MetaHive, a cache-optimized approach to managing metadata in heterogeneous KV store clusters. MetaHive disaggregates the original data from its associated metadata to promote independence between them, while maintaining their interconnection during usage. This makes the metadata opaque from the downstream processes and the other KV stores in the cluster. MetaHive also ensures that the KV and metadata entries are stored in the vicinity of each other in memory and storage. This allows MetaHive to optimally utilize the caching mechanism without extra storage read overhead for metadata retrieval. We deploy MetaHive to ensure data integrity in RocksDB and demonstrate its rapid data validation with minimal effect on performance.

### Efficient Inference of Vision Instruction-Following Models with Elastic   Cache
**Authors**: Zuyan Liu, Benlin Liu, Jiahui Wang, Yuhao Dong, Guangyi Chen, Yongming Rao, Ranjay Krishna, Jiwen Lu

**Updated**: 2024-07-25T15:29:05Z

**Summary**: In the field of instruction-following large vision-language models (LVLMs), the efficient deployment of these models faces challenges, notably due to the high memory demands of their key-value (KV) caches. Conventional cache management strategies for LLMs focus on cache eviction, which often fails to address the specific needs of multimodal instruction-following models. Recognizing this gap, in this paper, we introduce Elastic Cache, a novel approach that benefits from applying distinct acceleration methods for instruction encoding and output generation stages. We investigate the metrics of importance in different stages and propose an importance-driven cache merging strategy to prune redundancy caches. Instead of discarding less important caches, our strategy identifies important key/value vectors as anchor points. Surrounding less important caches are then merged with these anchors, enhancing the preservation of contextual information in the KV caches while yielding an arbitrary acceleration ratio. For instruction encoding, we utilize the frequency to evaluate the importance of caches. Regarding output generation, we prioritize tokens based on their distance with an offset, by which both the initial and most recent tokens are retained. Results on a range of LVLMs demonstrate that Elastic Cache not only boosts efficiency but also notably outperforms existing pruning methods in language generation across various tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/liuzuyan/ElasticCache

### KIVI: A Tuning-Free Asymmetric 2bit Quantization for KV Cache
**Authors**: Zirui Liu, Jiayi Yuan, Hongye Jin, Shaochen Zhong, Zhaozhuo Xu, Vladimir Braverman, Beidi Chen, Xia Hu

**Updated**: 2024-07-25T09:16:05Z

**Summary**: Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) requires batching of many requests to reduce the cost per request. Yet, with larger batch sizes and longer context lengths, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores attention keys and values to avoid re-computations, significantly increases memory demands and becomes the new bottleneck in speed and memory usage. Additionally, the loading of the KV cache causes the computational core to be idle, which limits the inference speed. A straightforward and effective solution to reduce KV cache size is quantization, which decreases the total bytes taken by KV cache. However, there is a lack of in-depth studies that explore the element distribution of KV cache to understand the hardness and limitation of KV cache quantization. To fill the gap, we conducted a comprehensive study on the element distribution in KV cache of popular LLMs. Our findings indicate that the key cache should be quantized per-channel, i.e., group elements along the channel dimension and quantize them together. In contrast, the value cache should be quantized per-token. From this analysis, we developed a tuning-free 2bit KV cache quantization algorithm named KIVI. With hardware-friendly implementation, KIVI can enable Llama, Falcon, and Mistral models to maintain almost the same quality while using $\mathbf{2.6\times}$ less peak memory (including model weight). This reduction in memory usage enables up to $\mathbf{4\times}$ larger batch size, bringing $\mathbf{2.35\times \sim 3.47\times}$ throughput on real LLM inference workload.

### An Efficient Inference Framework for Early-exit Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ruijie Miao, Yihan Yan, Xinshuo Yao, Tong Yang

**Updated**: 2024-07-25T07:50:17Z

**Summary**: Building efficient inference framework has gained increasing interests for research community. Early-exit models, a variant of LLMs, improves the inference efficiency of LLMs by skipping rest layers and directly generate output tokens when they are confident enough. However, there is no work of LLM inference framework that takes early-exit models into consideration. This is non-trivial as prior art on LLM inference cannot be directly applied to early-exit models. In this work, we solves two key challenges in building efficient inference framework for early-exit models: (1) batch inference at iteration-level granularity; and (2) KV cache management. For the former, we propose to process the batch until all sequences surpass the early-exit confidence threshold. For the latter, we propose to fill the KV cache of rest layers before the iteration terminates. Our evaluation shows that, compared with the original vLLM operating at full layers, our solution achieves up to 1.25x speed up.

### Efficient LLM Training and Serving with Heterogeneous Context Sharding   among Attention Heads
**Authors**: Xihui Lin, Yunan Zhang, Suyu Ge, Barun Patra, Vishrav Chaudhary, Xia Song

**Updated**: 2024-07-25T00:27:07Z

**Summary**: Existing LLM training and inference frameworks struggle in boosting efficiency with sparsity while maintaining the integrity of context and model architecture. Inspired by the sharding concept in database and the fact that attention parallelizes over heads on accelerators, we propose Sparsely-Sharded (S2) Attention, an attention algorithm that allocates heterogeneous context partitions for different attention heads to divide and conquer. S2-Attention enforces each attention head to only attend to a partition of contexts following a strided sparsity pattern, while the full context is preserved as the union of all the shards. As attention heads are processed in separate thread blocks, the context reduction for each head can thus produce end-to-end speed-up and memory reduction. At inference, LLMs trained with S2-Attention can then take the KV cache reduction as free meals with guaranteed model quality preserve. In experiments, we show S2-Attentioncan provide as much as (1) 25.3X wall-clock attention speed-up over FlashAttention-2, resulting in 6X reduction in end-to-end training time and 10X inference latency, (2) on-par model training quality compared to default attention, (3)perfect needle retrieval accuracy over 32K context window. On top of the algorithm, we build DKernel, an LLM training and inference kernel library that allows users to customize sparsity patterns for their own models. We open-sourced DKerneland make it compatible with Megatron, Pytorch, and vLLM.

### Robust, Secure and Private Cache-aided Scalar Linear Function Retrieval   from Distributed System with Blind and Adversarial Servers
**Authors**: Qifa Yan, Xiaohu Tang, Zhengchun Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-07-24T13:36:03Z

**Summary**: In this work, a distributed server system composed of multiple servers that holds some coded files and multiple users that are interested in retrieving the linear functions of the files is investigated, where the servers are robust, blind and adversarial in the sense that any $J$ servers can together recover all files, while any $I$ colluding servers cannot obtain any information about the files, and at most $A$ servers maliciously provides erroneous information. In addition, the file library must be secure from a wiretapper who obtains all the signals, and the demands of any subset of users must kept private from the other users and servers, even if they collude. A coding scheme is proposed by incorporating the ideas of Shamir's secret sharing and key superposition into the framework of Placement Delivery Array (PDA), originally proposed to characterize the single-server coded caching system without any security or privacy constraints. It is shown that PDAs associated to Maddah-Ali and Niesen's coded caching scheme results in an achievable memory-storage-communication region, such that the storage size and communication load were optimal to within a multiplicative gap, except for the small memory regime when the number of files was smaller than the number of users.

### Adaptive Splitting of Reusable Temporal Monitors for Rare Traffic   Violations
**Authors**: Craig Innes, Subramanian Ramamoorthy

**Updated**: 2024-07-24T12:56:41Z

**Summary**: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are often tested in simulation to estimate the probability they will violate safety specifications. Two common issues arise when using existing techniques to produce this estimation: If violations occur rarely, simple Monte-Carlo sampling techniques can fail to produce efficient estimates; if simulation horizons are too long, importance sampling techniques (which learn proposal distributions from past simulations) can fail to converge. This paper addresses both issues by interleaving rare-event sampling techniques with online specification monitoring algorithms. We use adaptive multi-level splitting to decompose simulations into partial trajectories, then calculate the distance of those partial trajectories to failure by leveraging robustness metrics from Signal Temporal Logic (STL). By caching those partial robustness metric values, we can efficiently re-use computations across multiple sampling stages. Our experiments on an interstate lane-change scenario show our method is viable for testing simulated AV-pipelines, efficiently estimating failure probabilities for STL specifications based on real traffic rules. We produce better estimates than Monte-Carlo and importance sampling in fewer simulations.

### Efficient Tuning and Inference for Large Language Models on Textual   Graphs
**Authors**: Yun Zhu, Yaoke Wang, Haizhou Shi, Siliang Tang

**Updated**: 2024-07-24T08:56:11Z

**Summary**: Rich textual and topological information of textual graphs need to be modeled in real-world applications such as webpages, e-commerce, and academic articles. Practitioners have been long following the path of adopting a shallow text encoder and a subsequent graph neural network (GNN) to solve this problem. In light of recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), it is apparent that integrating LLMs for enhanced textual encoding can substantially improve the performance of textual graphs. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these methods poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ENGINE, a parameter- and memory-efficient fine-tuning method for textual graphs with an LLM encoder. The key insight is to combine the LLMs and GNNs through a tunable side structure, which significantly reduces the training complexity without impairing the joint model's capacity. Extensive experiments on textual graphs demonstrate our method's effectiveness by achieving the best model performance, meanwhile having the lowest training cost compared to previous methods. Moreover, we introduce two variants with caching and dynamic early exit to further enhance training and inference speed. Specifically, caching accelerates ENGINE's training by 12x, and dynamic early exit achieves up to 5x faster inference with a negligible performance drop (at maximum 1.17% relevant drop across 7 datasets). Our codes are available at: https://github.com/ZhuYun97/ENGINE

### Dynamic Memory Compression: Retrofitting LLMs for Accelerated Inference
**Authors**: Piotr Nawrot, Adrian Łańcucki, Marcin Chochowski, David Tarjan, Edoardo M. Ponti

**Updated**: 2024-07-23T17:55:30Z

**Summary**: Transformers have emerged as the backbone of large language models (LLMs). However, generation remains inefficient due to the need to store in memory a cache of key-value representations for past tokens, whose size scales linearly with the input sequence length and batch size. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for online key-value cache compression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply different compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofit pre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers, achieving up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible percentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. DMC preserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression, outperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key-value eviction policies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded gains. Hence, DMC can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.

**Updated**: 2024-07-23T17:42:57Z

**Summary**: What will the future of cislunar communications be? The ever-expanding horizons of the space exploration missions, and the need for establishing sustainable space communication and navigation infrastructure necessitate to think this question thoroughly. In this article, we examine how some of the concepts of 6G technologies developed for terrestrial networks can be relevant in the context of cislunar networks. We discuss how 6G concepts, such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, quantum-resistant physical layer security, private information read/write/cache networks, semantic and goal-oriented communications, information freshness based quality of communication metrics, multi-relay and cooperative networks, hold the potential to shape the future of cislunar communications.

### Hidden Web Caches Discovery
**Authors**: Matteo Golinelli, Bruno Crispo

**Updated**: 2024-07-23T08:58:06Z

**Summary**: Web caches play a crucial role in web performance and scalability. However, detecting cached responses is challenging when web servers do not reliably communicate the cache status through standardized headers. This paper presents a novel methodology for cache detection using timing analysis. Our approach eliminates the dependency on cache status headers, making it applicable to any web server. The methodology relies on sending paired requests using HTTP multiplexing functionality and makes heavy use of cache-busting to control the origin of the responses. By measuring the time it takes to receive responses from paired requests, we can determine if a response is cached or not. In each pair, one request is cache-busted to force retrieval from the origin server, while the other request is not and might be served from the cache, if present. A faster response time for the non-cache-busted request compared to the cache-busted one suggests the first one is coming from the cache. We implemented this approach in a tool and achieved an estimated accuracy of 89.6% compared to state-of-the-art methods based on cache status headers. Leveraging our cache detection approach, we conducted a large-scale experiment on the Tranco Top 50k websites. We identified a significant presence of hidden caches (5.8%) that do not advertise themselves through headers. Additionally, we employed our methodology to detect Web Cache Deception (WCD) vulnerabilities in these hidden caches. We discovered that 1.020 of them are susceptible to WCD vulnerabilities, potentially leaking sensitive data. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our timing analysis methodology for cache discovery and highlight the importance of a tool that does not rely on cache-communicated cache status headers.

### A Programming Model for Disaggregated Memory over CXL
**Authors**: Gal Assa, Michal Friedman, Ori Lahav

**Updated**: 2024-07-23T08:55:10Z

**Summary**: CXL (Compute Express Link) is an emerging open industry-standard interconnect between processing and memory devices that is expected to revolutionize the way systems are designed in the near future. It enables cache-coherent shared memory pools in a disaggregated fashion at unprecedented scales, allowing algorithms to interact with a variety of storage devices using simple loads and stores in a cacheline granularity. Alongside with unleashing unique opportunities for a wide range of applications, CXL introduces new challenges of data management and crash consistency. Alas, CXL lacks an adequate programming model, which makes reasoning about the correctness and expected behaviors of algorithms and systems on top of it nearly impossible.   In this work, we present CXL0, the first programming model for concurrent programs running on top of CXL. We propose a high-level abstraction for CXL memory accesses and formally define operational semantics on top of that abstraction. We provide a set of general transformations that adapt concurrent algorithms to the new disruptive technology. Using these transformations, every linearizable algorithm can be easily transformed into its provably correct version in the face of a full-system or sub-system crash. We believe that this work will serve as the stepping stone for systems design and modelling on top of CXL, and support the development of future models as software and hardware evolve.

### A deeper look at depth pruning of LLMs
**Authors**: Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui, Xin Dong, Greg Heinrich, Thomas Breuel, Jan Kautz, David Krueger, Pavlo Molchanov

**Updated**: 2024-07-23T08:40:27Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are not only resource-intensive to train but even more costly to deploy in production. Therefore, recent work has attempted to prune blocks of LLMs based on cheap proxies for estimating block importance, effectively removing 10% of blocks in well-trained LLaMa-2 and Mistral 7b models without any significant degradation of downstream metrics. In this paper, we explore different block importance metrics by considering adaptive metrics such as Shapley value in addition to static ones explored in prior work. We show that adaptive metrics exhibit a trade-off in performance between tasks i.e., improvement on one task may degrade performance on the other due to differences in the computed block influences. Furthermore, we extend this analysis from a complete block to individual self-attention and feed-forward layers, highlighting the propensity of the self-attention layers to be more amendable to pruning, even allowing removal of upto 33% of the self-attention layers without incurring any performance degradation on MMLU for Mistral 7b (significant reduction in costly maintenance of KV-cache). Finally, we look at simple performance recovery techniques to emulate the pruned layers by training lightweight additive bias or low-rank linear adapters. Performance recovery using emulated updates avoids performance degradation for the initial blocks (up to 5% absolute improvement on MMLU), which is either competitive or superior to the learning-based technique.

**Authors**: Jiale Xu, Rui Zhang, Cong Guo, Weiming Hu, Zihan Liu, Feiyang Wu, Yu Feng, Shixuan Sun, Changxu Shao, Yuhong Guo, Junping Zhao, Ke Zhang, Minyi Guo, Jingwen Leng

**Updated**: 2024-07-22T14:37:58Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across various domains, processing millions of daily requests. This surge in demand poses significant challenges in optimizing throughput and latency while keeping costs manageable. The Key-Value (KV) cache, a standard method for retaining previous computations, makes LLM inference highly bounded by memory. While batching strategies can enhance performance, they frequently lead to significant memory fragmentation. Even though cutting-edge systems like vLLM mitigate KV cache fragmentation using paged Attention mechanisms, they still suffer from inefficient memory and computational operations due to the tightly coupled page management and computation kernels.   This study introduces the vTensor, an innovative tensor structure for LLM inference based on GPU virtual memory management (VMM). vTensor addresses existing limitations by decoupling computation from memory defragmentation and offering dynamic extensibility. Our framework employs a CPU-GPU heterogeneous approach, ensuring efficient, fragmentation-free memory management while accommodating various computation kernels across different LLM architectures. Experimental results indicate that vTensor achieves an average speedup of 1.86x across different models, with up to 2.42x in multi-turn chat scenarios. Additionally, vTensor provides average speedups of 2.12x and 3.15x in kernel evaluation, reaching up to 3.92x and 3.27x compared to SGLang Triton prefix-prefilling kernels and vLLM paged Attention kernel, respectively. Furthermore, it frees approximately 71.25% (57GB) of memory on the NVIDIA A100 GPU compared to vLLM, enabling more memory-intensive workloads.

### vLSM: Low tail latency and I/O amplification in LSM-based KV stores
**Authors**: Giorgos Xanthakis, Antonios Katsarakis, Giorgos Saloustros, Angelos Bilas

**Updated**: 2024-07-22T12:17:01Z

**Summary**: LSM-based key-value (KV) stores are an important component in modern data infrastructures. However, they suffer from high tail latency, in the order of several seconds, making them less attractive for user-facing applications. In this paper, we introduce the notion of compaction chains and we analyse how they affect tail latency. Then, we show that modern designs reduce tail latency, by trading I/O amplification or require large amounts of memory. Based on our analysis, we present vLSM, a new KV store design that improves tail latency significantly without compromising on memory or I/O amplification. vLSM reduces (a) compaction chain width by using small SSTs and eliminating the tiering compaction required in L0 by modern systems and (b) compaction chain length by using a larger than typical growth factor between L1 and L2 and introducing overlap-aware SSTs in L1. We implement vLSM in RocksDB and evaluate it using db_bench and YCSB. Our evaluation highlights the underlying trade-off among memory requirements, I/O amplification, and tail latency, as well as the advantage of vLSM over current approaches. vLSM improves P99 tail latency by up to 4.8x for writes and by up to 12.5x for reads, reduces cumulative write stalls by up to 60% while also slightly improves I/O amplification at the same memory budget.

### Coalgebraic Satisfiability Checking for Arithmetic $μ$-Calculi
**Authors**: Daniel Hausmann, Lutz Schröder

**Updated**: 2024-07-22T10:02:57Z

**Summary**: The coalgebraic $\mu$-calculus provides a generic semantic framework for fixpoint logics over systems whose branching type goes beyond the standard relational setup, e.g. probabilistic, weighted, or game-based. Previous work on the coalgebraic $\mu$-calculus includes an exponential-time upper bound on satisfiability checking, which however relies on the availability of tableau rules for the next-step modalities that are sufficiently well-behaved in a formally defined sense; in particular, rule matches need to be representable by polynomial-sized codes, and the sequent duals of the rules need to absorb cut. While such rule sets have been identified for some important cases, they are not known to exist in all cases of interest, in particular ones involving either integer weights as in the graded $\mu$-calculus, or real-valued weights in combination with non-linear arithmetic. In the present work, we prove the same upper complexity bound under more general assumptions, specifically regarding the complexity of the (much simpler) satisfiability problem for the underlying one-step logic, roughly described as the nesting-free next-step fragment of the logic. The bound is realized by a generic global caching algorithm that supports on-the-fly satisfiability checking. Notably, our approach directly accommodates unguarded formulae, and thus avoids use of the guardedness transformation. Example applications include new exponential-time upper bounds for satisfiability checking in an extension of the graded $\mu$-calculus with polynomial inequalities (including positive Presburger arithmetic), as well as an extension of the (two-valued) probabilistic $\mu$-calculus with polynomial inequalities.

### Dissecting Multiplication in Transformers: Insights into LLMs
**Authors**: Luyu Qiu, Jianing Li, Chi Su, Chen Jason Zhang, Lei Chen

**Updated**: 2024-07-22T04:07:26Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models have achieved remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks. However, they often struggle with seemingly easy tasks like arithmetic despite their vast capabilities. This stark disparity raise human's concerns about their safe and ethical use, hinder their widespread adoption.In this paper, we focus on a typical arithmetic task, integer multiplication, to explore and explain the imperfection of transformers in this domain. We provide comprehensive analysis of a vanilla transformer trained to perform n-digit integer multiplication. Our observations indicate that the model decomposes multiplication task into multiple parallel subtasks, sequentially optimizing each subtask for each digit to complete the final multiplication. Based on observation and analysis, we infer the reasons of transformers deficiencies in multiplication tasks lies in their difficulty in calculating successive carryovers and caching intermediate results, and confirmed this inference through experiments. Guided by these findings, we propose improvements to enhance transformers performance on multiplication tasks. These enhancements are validated through rigorous testing and mathematical modeling, not only enhance transformer's interpretability, but also improve its performance, e.g., we achieve over 99.9% accuracy on 5-digit integer multiplication with a tiny transformer, outperform LLMs GPT-4. Our method contributes to the broader fields of model understanding and interpretability, paving the way for analyzing more complex tasks and Transformer models. This work underscores the importance of explainable AI, helping to build trust in large language models and promoting their adoption in critical applications.

### RazorAttention: Efficient KV Cache Compression Through Retrieval Heads
**Authors**: Hanlin Tang, Yang Lin, Jing Lin, Qingsen Han, Shikuan Hong, Yiwu Yao, Gongyi Wang

**Updated**: 2024-07-22T01:12:23Z

**Summary**: The memory and computational demands of Key-Value (KV) cache present significant challenges for deploying long-context language models. Previous approaches attempt to mitigate this issue by selectively dropping tokens, which irreversibly erases critical information that might be needed for future queries. In this paper, we propose a novel compression technique for KV cache that preserves all token information. Our investigation reveals that: i) Most attention heads primarily focus on the local context; ii) Only a few heads, denoted as retrieval heads, can essentially pay attention to all input tokens. These key observations motivate us to use separate caching strategy for attention heads. Therefore, we propose RazorAttention, a training-free KV cache compression algorithm, which maintains a full cache for these crucial retrieval heads and discards the remote tokens in non-retrieval heads. Furthermore, we introduce a novel mechanism involving a "compensation token" to further recover the information in the dropped tokens. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of large language models (LLMs) demonstrate that RazorAttention achieves a reduction in KV cache size by over 70% without noticeable impacts on performance. Additionally, RazorAttention is compatible with FlashAttention, rendering it an efficient and plug-and-play solution that enhances LLM inference efficiency without overhead or retraining of the original model.

### LSM-GNN: Large-scale Storage-based Multi-GPU GNN Training by Optimizing   Data Transfer Scheme
**Authors**: Jeongmin Brian Park, Kun Wu, Vikram Sharma Mailthody, Zaid Quresh, Scott Mahlke, Wen-mei Hwu

**Updated**: 2024-07-21T20:41:39Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used today in recommendation systems, fraud detection, and node/link classification tasks. Real world GNNs continue to scale in size and require a large memory footprint for storing graphs and embeddings that often exceed the memory capacities of the target GPUs used for training. To address limited memory capacities, traditional GNN training approaches use graph partitioning and sharding techniques to scale up across multiple GPUs within a node and/or scale out across multiple nodes. However, this approach suffers from the high computational costs of graph partitioning algorithms and inefficient communication across GPUs.   To address these overheads, we propose Large-scale Storage-based Multi-GPU GNN framework (LSM-GNN), a storagebased approach to train GNN models that utilizes a novel communication layer enabling GPU software caches to function as a system-wide shared cache with low overheads.LSM-GNN incorporates a hybrid eviction policy that intelligently manages cache space by using both static and dynamic node information to significantly enhance cache performance. Furthermore, we introduce the Preemptive Victim-buffer Prefetcher (PVP), a mechanism for prefetching node feature data from a Victim Buffer located in CPU pinned-memory to further reduce the pressure on the storage devices. Experimental results show that despite the lower compute capabilities and memory capacities, LSM-GNN in a single node with two GPUs offers superior performance over two-node-four-GPU Dist-DGL baseline and provides up to 3.75x speed up on end-to-end epoch time while running large-scale GNN training

### Farewell to Length Extrapolation, a Training-Free Infinite Context with   Finite Attention Scope
**Authors**: Xiaoran Liu, Qipeng Guo, Yuerong Song, Zhigeng Liu, Kai Lv, Hang Yan, Linlin Li, Qun Liu, Xipeng Qiu

**Updated**: 2024-07-21T14:23:37Z

**Summary**: The maximum supported context length is a critical bottleneck limiting the practical application of the Large Language Model (LLM). Although existing length extrapolation methods can extend the context of LLMs to millions of tokens, these methods all have an explicit upper bound. In this work, we propose LongCache, a training-free approach that enables LLM to support an infinite context with finite context scope, through full-context cache selection and training-free integration. This effectively frees LLMs from the length extrapolation issue. We validate LongCache on the LongBench and L-Eval and demonstrate its performance is on par with traditional full-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we have applied LongCache on mainstream LLMs, including LLaMA3 and Mistral-v0.3, enabling them to support context lengths of at least 400K in Needle-In-A-Haystack tests. We will improve the efficiency of LongCache by GPU-aware optimization soon.

### Split Learning without Local Weight Sharing to Enhance Client-side Data   Privacy
**Authors**: Ngoc Duy Pham, Tran Khoa Phan, Alsharif Abuadbba, Yansong Gao, Doan Nguyen, Naveen Chilamkurti

**Updated**: 2024-07-21T11:47:04Z

**Summary**: Split learning (SL) aims to protect user data privacy by distributing deep models between client-server and keeping private data locally. In SL training with multiple clients, the local model weights are shared among the clients for local model update. This paper first reveals data privacy leakage exacerbated from local weight sharing among the clients in SL through model inversion attacks. Then, to reduce the data privacy leakage issue, we propose and analyze privacy-enhanced SL (P-SL) (or SL without local weight sharing). We further propose parallelized P-SL to expedite the training process by duplicating multiple server-side model instances without compromising accuracy. Finally, we explore P-SL with late participating clients and devise a server-side cache-based training method to address the forgetting phenomenon in SL when late clients join. Experimental results demonstrate that P-SL helps reduce up to 50% of client-side data leakage, which essentially achieves a better privacy-accuracy trade-off than the current trend by using differential privacy mechanisms. Moreover, P-SL and its cache-based version achieve comparable accuracy to baseline SL under various data distributions, while cost less computation and communication. Additionally, caching-based training in P-SL mitigates the negative effect of forgetting, stabilizes the learning, and enables practical and low-complexity training in a dynamic environment with late-arriving clients.

### Model Tells You Where to Merge: Adaptive KV Cache Merging for LLMs on   Long-Context Tasks
**Authors**: Zheng Wang, Boxiao Jin, Zhongzhi Yu, Minjia Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-07-21T02:37:11Z

**Summary**: How to efficiently serve Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a pressing issue because of their huge computational cost in their autoregressive generation process. To mitigate computational costs, LLMs often employ the KV Cache technique to improve the generation speed. While improving the computational efficiency, the storage requirements of the KV cache are substantial, particularly in long-context scenarios, leading to significant memory consumption. Existing KV cache eviction methods often degrade the performance of LLMs in long-context scenarios due to the information loss introduced by eviction. In this paper, we propose a novel KV cache merging approach, called KVMerger, to achieve adaptive KV cache compression for long-context tasks without significant performance degradation under constrained memory budgets. Our approach is inspired by the intriguing observation that key states exhibit high similarity at the token level within a single sequence. To facilitate merging, we develop an effective yet straightforward merging set identification algorithm to identify suitable KV states for merging. Our merging set identification algorithm stimulates the second observation that KV cache sparsity, from similarity perspective, is independent of the dataset and remains persistent at the model level. Subsequently, we propose a Gaussian kernel weighted merging algorithm to selectively merge all states within each merging set. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of KVMerger for long-context tasks under constrained memory budgets, applying it to models including Llama2-7B-chat and Llama2-13B-chat. Using the LongBench and ZeroScroll benchmarks, we compare our method with other KV cache compression techniques, including H2O and CaM, showing that our method achieves superior performance across tasks with both 50% and 35% KV cache budgets.

**Authors**: Qi Wu, Joseph A. Insley, Victor A. Mateevitsi, Silvio Rizzi, Michael E. Papka, Kwan-Liu Ma

**Updated**: 2024-07-20T22:14:42Z

**Summary**: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing large-scale volume data. This opens up new possibilities for in situ visualization. However, the efficient application of INRs to distributed data remains an underexplored area. In this work, we develop a distributed volumetric neural representation and optimize it for in situ visualization. Our technique eliminates data exchanges between processes, achieving state-of-the-art compression speed, quality and ratios. Our technique also enables the implementation of an efficient strategy for caching large-scale simulation data in high temporal frequencies, further facilitating the use of reactive in situ visualization in a wider range of scientific problems. We integrate this system with the Ascent infrastructure and evaluate its performance and usability using real-world simulations.

### SquareSort: a cache-oblivious sorting algorithm
**Authors**: Michal Koucký, Josef Matějka

**Updated**: 2024-07-20T08:21:46Z

**Summary**: In this paper we consider sorting in the cache-oblivious model of Frigo, Leiserson, Prokop, and Ramachandran (1999). We introduce a new simple sorting algorithm in that model which has asymptotically optimal IO complexity $O(\frac{n}{B} \log_{M/B} n)$, where $n$ is the instance size, $M$ size of the cache and $B$ size of a memory block. This is the same as the complexity of the best known cache-oblivious sorting algorithm FunnelSort.

 ### MME-RealWorld: Could Your Multimodal LLM Challenge High-Resolution   Real-World Scenarios that are Difficult for Humans?
**Authors**: Yi-Fan Zhang, Huanyu Zhang, Haochen Tian, Chaoyou Fu, Shuangqing Zhang, Junfei Wu, Feng Li, Kun Wang, Qingsong Wen, Zhang Zhang, Liang Wang, Rong Jin, Tieniu Tan

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:59:51Z

**Summary**: Comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has recently garnered widespread attention in the research community. However, we observe that existing benchmarks present several common barriers that make it difficult to measure the significant challenges that models face in the real world, including: 1) small data scale leads to a large performance variance; 2) reliance on model-based annotations results in restricted data quality; 3) insufficient task difficulty, especially caused by the limited image resolution. To tackle these issues, we introduce MME-RealWorld. Specifically, we collect more than $300$K images from public datasets and the Internet, filtering $13,366$ high-quality images for annotation. This involves the efforts of professional $25$ annotators and $7$ experts in MLLMs, contributing to $29,429$ question-answer pairs that cover $43$ subtasks across $5$ real-world scenarios, extremely challenging even for humans. As far as we know, MME-RealWorld is the largest manually annotated benchmark to date, featuring the highest resolution and a targeted focus on real-world applications. We further conduct a thorough evaluation involving $28$ prominent MLLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our results show that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where none of them reach $60\%$ accuracy. The challenges of perceiving high-resolution images and understanding complex real-world scenarios remain urgent issues to be addressed. The data and evaluation code are released at https://mme-realworld.github.io/ .

### Search-Adaptor: Embedding Customization for Information Retrieval
**Authors**: Jinsung Yoon, Sercan O Arik, Yanfei Chen, Tomas Pfister

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:55:12Z

**Summary**: Embeddings extracted by pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant potential to improve information retrieval and search. Beyond the zero-shot setup in which they are being conventionally used, being able to take advantage of the information from the relevant query-corpus paired data can further boost the LLM capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Search-Adaptor, for customizing LLMs for information retrieval in an efficient and robust way. Search-Adaptor modifies the embeddings generated by pre-trained LLMs, and can be integrated with any LLM, including those only available via prediction APIs. On multiple English, multilingual, and multimodal retrieval datasets, we show consistent and significant performance benefits for Search-Adaptor -- e.g., more than 5% improvements for Google Embedding APIs in nDCG@10 averaged over 14 BEIR datasets.

### MagicDec: Breaking the Latency-Throughput Tradeoff for Long Context   Generation with Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Jian Chen, Vashisth Tiwari, Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Zhuoming Chen, Jinyuan Shi, Ian En-Hsu Yen, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:54:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency without sacrificing performance but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy speculative decoding more effectively for high throughput inference. Then, it leverages draft models with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck that scales with both sequence length and batch size. This finding underscores the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2x speedup for LLaMA-2-7B-32K and 1.84x speedup for LLaMA-3.1-8B when serving batch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/MagicDec/.

### Combining observational and experimental data for causal inference   considering data privacy
**Authors**: Charlotte Z. Mann, Adam C. Sales, Johann A. Gagnon-Bartsch

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:49:01Z

**Summary**: Combining observational and experimental data for causal inference can improve treatment effect estimation. However, many observational data sets cannot be released due to data privacy considerations, so one researcher may not have access to both experimental and observational data. Nonetheless, a small amount of risk of disclosing sensitive information might be tolerable to organizations that house confidential data. In these cases, organizations can employ data privacy techniques, which decrease disclosure risk, potentially at the expense of data utility. In this paper, we explore disclosure limiting transformations of observational data, which can be combined with experimental data to estimate the sample and population average treatment effects. We consider leveraging observational data to improve generalizability of treatment effect estimates when a randomized experiment (RCT) is not representative of the population of interest, and to increase precision of treatment effect estimates. Through simulation studies, we illustrate the trade-off between privacy and utility when employing different disclosure limiting transformations. We find that leveraging transformed observational data in treatment effect estimation can still improve estimation over only using data from an RCT.

### Variational inference of effective range parameters for   ${}^3$He-${}^4$He scattering
**Authors**: Andrius Burnelis, Vojta Kejzlar, Daniel R. Phillips

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:46:42Z

**Summary**: We use two different methods, Monte Carlo sampling and variational inference (VI), to perform a Bayesian calibration of the effective-range parameters in ${}^3$He-${}^4$He elastic scattering. The parameters are calibrated to data from a recent set of $^{3}$He-${}^4$He elastic scattering differential cross section measurements. Analysis of these data for $E_{\rm lab} \leq 4.3$ MeV yields a unimodal posterior for which both methods obtain the same structure. However, the effective-range expansion amplitude does not account for the $7/2^-$ state of ${}^7$Be so, even after calibration, the description of data at the upper end of this energy range is poor. The data up to $E_{\rm lab}=2.6$ MeV can be well described, but calibration to this lower-energy subset of the data yields a bimodal posterior. After adapting VI to treat such a multi-modal posterior we find good agreement between the VI results and those obtained with parallel-tempered Monte Carlo sampling.

### Data Exposure from LLM Apps: An In-depth Investigation of OpenAI's GPTs
**Authors**: Evin Jaff, Yuhao Wu, Ning Zhang, Umar Iqbal

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:42:06Z

**Summary**: LLM app ecosystems are quickly maturing and supporting a wide range of use cases, which requires them to collect excessive user data. Given that the LLM apps are developed by third-parties and that anecdotal evidence suggests LLM platforms currently do not strictly enforce their policies, user data shared with arbitrary third-parties poses a significant privacy risk. In this paper we aim to bring transparency in data practices of LLM apps. As a case study, we study OpenAI's GPT app ecosystem. We develop an LLM-based framework to conduct the static analysis of natural language-based source code of GPTs and their Actions (external services) to characterize their data collection practices. Our findings indicate that Actions collect expansive data about users, including sensitive information prohibited by OpenAI, such as passwords. We find that some Actions, including related to advertising and analytics, are embedded in multiple GPTs, which allow them to track user activities across GPTs. Additionally, co-occurrence of Actions exposes as much as 9.5x more data to them, than it is exposed to individual Actions. Lastly, we develop an LLM-based privacy policy analysis framework to automatically check the consistency of data collection by Actions with disclosures in their privacy policies. Our measurements indicate that the disclosures for most of the collected data types are omitted in privacy policies, with only 5.8% of Actions clearly disclosing their data collection practices.

### Impacts of floating-point non-associativity on reproducibility for HPC   and deep learning applications
**Authors**: Sanjif Shanmugavelu, Mathieu Taillefumier, Christopher Culver, Oscar Hernandez, Mark Coletti, Ada Sedova

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:40:15Z

**Summary**: Run-by-run variability in parallel programs caused by floating-point non-associativity (FPNA) has been known to significantly affect reproducibility in iterative algorithms, due to accumulating errors. Non-reproducibility negatively affects efficiency and effectiveness of correctness testing for stochastic programs. Recently, the sensitivity of deep learning (DL) training and inference pipelines to FPNA have been found to be extreme, and can prevent certification for commercial applications, accurate assessment of robustness and sensitivity, and bug detection. New approaches in scientific computing applications have coupled DL models with high-performance computing (HPC) simulations, leading to an aggravation of debugging and testing challenges. Here we perform an investigation of the statistical properties of FPNA within modern parallel programming models, analyze performance and productivity impacts of replacing atomic operations with deterministic alternatives on GPUs, and examine the recently-added deterministic options within the PyTorch framework within the context of GPU deployment, uncovering and quantifying the impacts of input parameters triggering run-by-run variability and reporting on the reliability and completeness of the documentation. Finally, we evaluate the strategy of exploiting automatic determinism provided by deterministic hardware, using the Groq LPU$^{TM}$ accelerator for inference portions of the DL pipeline. We demonstrate the benefits that this strategy can provide within reproducibility and correctness efforts.

### Multi-Layer Transformers Gradient Can be Approximated in Almost Linear   Time
**Authors**: Yingyu Liang, Zhizhou Sha, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Yufa Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:16:43Z

**Summary**: The quadratic computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism of popular transformer architectures poses significant challenges for training and inference, particularly in terms of efficiency and memory requirements. Towards addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a novel fast computation method for gradient calculation in multi-layer transformer models. Our approach enables the computation of gradients for the entire multi-layer transformer model in almost linear time $n^{1+o(1)}$, where $n$ is the input sequence length. This breakthrough significantly reduces the computational bottleneck associated with the traditional quadratic time complexity. Our theory holds for any loss function and maintains a bounded approximation error across the entire model. Furthermore, our analysis can hold when the multi-layer transformer model contains many practical sub-modules, such as residual connection, casual mask, and multi-head attention. By improving the efficiency of gradient computation in large language models, we hope that our work will facilitate the more effective training and deployment of long-context language models based on our theoretical results.

### Ancient Wisdom, Modern Tools: Exploring Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for   Ancient Indian Philosophy
**Authors**: Priyanka Mandikal

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:15:39Z

**Summary**: LLMs have revolutionized the landscape of information retrieval and knowledge dissemination. However, their application in specialized areas is often hindered by factual inaccuracies and hallucinations, especially in long-tail knowledge distributions. We explore the potential of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models for long-form question answering (LFQA) in a specialized knowledge domain. We present VedantaNY-10M, a dataset curated from extensive public discourses on the ancient Indian philosophy of Advaita Vedanta. We develop and benchmark a RAG model against a standard, non-RAG LLM, focusing on transcription, retrieval, and generation performance. Human evaluations by computational linguists and domain experts show that the RAG model significantly outperforms the standard model in producing factual and comprehensive responses having fewer hallucinations. In addition, a keyword-based hybrid retriever that emphasizes unique low-frequency terms further improves results. Our study provides insights into effectively integrating modern large language models with ancient knowledge systems. Project page with dataset and code: https://sites.google.com/view/vedantany-10m

### Amortized Bayesian Multilevel Models
**Authors**: Daniel Habermann, Marvin Schmitt, Lars Kühmichel, Andreas Bulling, Stefan T. Radev, Paul-Christian Bürkner

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:11:04Z

**Summary**: Multilevel models (MLMs) are a central building block of the Bayesian workflow. They enable joint, interpretable modeling of data across hierarchical levels and provide a fully probabilistic quantification of uncertainty. Despite their well-recognized advantages, MLMs pose significant computational challenges, often rendering their estimation and evaluation intractable within reasonable time constraints. Recent advances in simulation-based inference offer promising solutions for addressing complex probabilistic models using deep generative networks. However, the utility and reliability of deep learning methods for estimating Bayesian MLMs remains largely unexplored, especially when compared with gold-standard samplers. To this end, we explore a family of neural network architectures that leverage the probabilistic factorization of multilevel models to facilitate efficient neural network training and subsequent near-instant posterior inference on unseen data sets. We test our method on several real-world case studies and provide comprehensive comparisons to Stan as a gold-standard method where possible. Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of our methods to stimulate further research in the nascent field of amortized Bayesian inference.

### Towards Fine-Grained Citation Evaluation in Generated Text: A   Comparative Analysis of Faithfulness Metrics
**Authors**: Weijia Zhang, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Yifei Yuan, Jiahuan Pei, Jia-Hong Huang, Evangelos Kanoulas

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:04:38Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often produce unsupported or unverifiable content, known as "hallucinations." To mitigate this, retrieval-augmented LLMs incorporate citations, grounding the content in verifiable sources. Despite such developments, manually assessing how well a citation supports the associated statement remains a major challenge. Previous studies use faithfulness metrics to estimate citation support automatically but are limited to binary classification, overlooking fine-grained citation support in practical scenarios. To investigate the effectiveness of faithfulness metrics in fine-grained scenarios, we propose a comparative evaluation framework that assesses the metric effectiveness in distinguishing citations between three-category support levels: full, partial, and no support. Our framework employs correlation analysis, classification evaluation, and retrieval evaluation to measure the alignment between metric scores and human judgments comprehensively. Our results show no single metric consistently excels across all evaluations, revealing the complexity of assessing fine-grained support. Based on the findings, we provide practical recommendations for developing more effective metrics.

### A New Perspective to Fish Trajectory Imputation: A Methodology for   Spatiotemporal Modeling of Acoustically Tagged Fish Data
**Authors**: Mahshid Ahmadian, Edward L. Boone, Grace S. Chiu

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T16:54:41Z

**Summary**: The focus of this paper is a key component of a methodology for understanding, interpolating, and predicting fish movement patterns based on spatiotemporal data recorded by spatially static acoustic receivers. For periods of time, fish may be far from the receivers, resulting in the absence of observations. The lack of information on the fish's location for extended time periods poses challenges to the understanding of fish movement patterns, and hence, the identification of proper statistical inference frameworks for modeling the trajectories. As the initial step in our methodology, in this paper, we implement an imputation strategy that relies on both Markov chain and Brownian motion principles to enhance our dataset over time. This methodology will be generalizable and applicable to all fish species with similar migration patterns or data with similar structures due to the use of static acoustic receivers.

### Mapping the Inner 0.1 pc of a Supermassive Black Hole Environment with   the Tidal Disruption Event and Extreme Coronal Line Emitter AT 2022upj
**Authors**: Megan Newsome, Iair Arcavi, D. Andrew Howell, Curtis McCully, Giacomo Terreran, Griffin Hosseinzadeh, K. Azalee Bostroem, Yael Dgany, Joseph Farah, Sara Faris, Estefania Padilla-Gonzalez, Craig Pellegrino, Moira Andrews

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T16:52:49Z

**Summary**: Extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) are objects showing transient high-ionization lines in the centers of galaxies. They have been attributed to echoes of high-energy flares of ionizing radiation, such as those produced by tidal disruption events (TDEs), but have only recently been observed within hundreds of days after an optical transient was detected. AT 2022upj is a nuclear UV-optical flare at z=0.054 with spectra showing [Fe X] {\lambda}6375 and [Fe XIV] {\lambda}5303 during the optical peak, the earliest presence of extreme coronal lines during an ongoing transient. AT 2022upj is also the second ever ECLE (and first with a concurrent flare) to show broad He II {\lambda}4686 emission, a key signature of optical/UV TDEs. We also detect X-ray emission during the optical transient phase, which may be related to the source of ionizing photons for the extreme coronal lines. Finally, we analyze the spectroscopic evolution of each emission line and find that [Fe X] and [Fe XIV] weaken within 400d of optical peak, while [Fe VII] {\lambda}5720, [Fe VII] {\lambda}6087, and [O III] {\lambda}{\lambda}4959,5007 emerge over the same period. The velocities of the iron lines indicate circumnuclear gas within 0.1pc of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), while a dust echo inferred from NEOWISE data indicates that circumnuclear dust lies at a minimum of 0.4pc away, providing evidence of stratified material around a SMBH. AT 2022upj is the first confirmed ECLE-TDE with clear signatures of both classes. This event's spectroscopic evolution on a $\sim$year unveils the impact of highly energetic flares such as TDEs on the complex environments around SMBHs.

### Multimodal Reinforcement Learning for Robots Collaborating with Humans
**Authors**: Afagh Mehri Shervedani, Siyu Li, Natawut Monaikul, Bahareh Abbasi, Barbara Di Eugenio, Milos Zefran

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T16:42:41Z

**Summary**: Robot assistants for older adults and people with disabilities need to interact with their users in collaborative tasks. The core component of these systems is an interaction manager whose job is to observe and assess the task, and infer the state of the human and their intent to choose the best course of action for the robot. Due to the sparseness of the data in this domain, the policy for such multi-modal systems is often crafted by hand; as the complexity of interactions grows this process is not scalable. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to learn the robot policy. In contrast to the dialog systems, our agent is trained with a simulator developed by using human data and can deal with multiple modalities such as language and physical actions. We conducted a human study to evaluate the performance of the system in the interaction with a user. Our designed system shows promising preliminary results when it is used by a real user.

### End-To-End Causal Effect Estimation from Unstructured Natural Language   Data
**Authors**: Nikita Dhawan, Leonardo Cotta, Karen Ullrich, Rahul G. Krishnan, Chris J. Maddison

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T16:41:47Z

**Summary**: Knowing the effect of an intervention is critical for human decision-making, but current approaches for causal effect estimation rely on manual data collection and structuring, regardless of the causal assumptions. This increases both the cost and time-to-completion for studies. We show how large, diverse observational text data can be mined with large language models (LLMs) to produce inexpensive causal effect estimates under appropriate causal assumptions. We introduce NATURAL, a novel family of causal effect estimators built with LLMs that operate over datasets of unstructured text. Our estimators use LLM conditional distributions (over variables of interest, given the text data) to assist in the computation of classical estimators of causal effect. We overcome a number of technical challenges to realize this idea, such as automating data curation and using LLMs to impute missing information. We prepare six (two synthetic and four real) observational datasets, paired with corresponding ground truth in the form of randomized trials, which we used to systematically evaluate each step of our pipeline. NATURAL estimators demonstrate remarkable performance, yielding causal effect estimates that fall within 3 percentage points of their ground truth counterparts, including on real-world Phase 3/4 clinical trials. Our results suggest that unstructured text data is a rich source of causal effect information, and NATURAL is a first step towards an automated pipeline to tap this resource.

### DOMAINEVAL: An Auto-Constructed Benchmark for Multi-Domain Code   Generation
**Authors**: Qiming Zhu, Jialun Cao, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Le Sun, Shing-Chi Cheung

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T16:33:58Z

**Summary**: Code benchmarks such as HumanEval are widely adopted to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses. However, current benchmarks primarily exercise LLMs' capability on common coding tasks (e.g., bubble sort, greatest common divisor), leaving domain-specific coding tasks (e.g., computation, system, cryptography) unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-domain code benchmark, DOMAINEVAL, designed to evaluate LLMs' coding capabilities thoroughly. Our pipeline works in a fully automated manner, enabling a push-bottom construction from code repositories into formatted subjects under study. Interesting findings are observed by evaluating 12 representative LLMs against DOMAINEVAL. We notice that LLMs are generally good at computation tasks while falling short on cryptography and system coding tasks. The performance gap can be as much as 68.94% (80.94% - 12.0%) in some LLMs. We also observe that generating more samples can increase the overall performance of LLMs, while the domain bias may even increase. The contributions of this study include a code generation benchmark dataset DOMAINEVAL, encompassing six popular domains, a fully automated pipeline for constructing code benchmarks, and an identification of the limitations of LLMs in code generation tasks based on their performance on DOMAINEVAL, providing directions for future research improvements. The leaderboard is available at https://domaineval.github.io/.

### NAS-Cap: Deep-Learning Driven 3-D Capacitance Extraction with Neural   Architecture Search and Data Augmentation
**Authors**: Haoyuan Li, Dingcheng Yang, Chunyan Pei, Wenjian Yu

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T16:25:33Z

**Summary**: More accurate capacitance extraction is demanded for designing integrated circuits under advanced process technology. The pattern matching approach and the field solver for capacitance extraction have the drawbacks of inaccuracy and large computational cost, respectively. Recent work \cite{yang2023cnn} proposes a grid-based data representation and a convolutional neural network (CNN) based capacitance models (called CNN-Cap), which opens the third way for 3-D capacitance extraction to get accurate results with much less time cost than field solver. In this work, the techniques of neural architecture search (NAS) and data augmentation are proposed to train better CNN models for 3-D capacitance extraction. Experimental results on datasets from different designs show that the obtained NAS-Cap models achieve remarkably higher accuracy than CNN-Cap, while consuming less runtime for inference and space for model storage. Meanwhile, the transferability of the NAS is validated, as the once searched architecture brought similar error reduction on coupling/total capacitance for the test cases from different design and/or process technology.

### Advancing Voice Cloning for Nepali: Leveraging Transfer Learning in a   Low-Resource Language
**Authors**: Manjil Karki, Pratik Shakya, Sandesh Acharya, Ravi Pandit, Dinesh Gothe

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T16:15:30Z

**Summary**: Voice cloning is a prominent feature in personalized speech interfaces. A neural vocal cloning system can mimic someone's voice using just a few audio samples. Both speaker encoding and speaker adaptation are topics of research in the field of voice cloning. Speaker adaptation relies on fine-tuning a multi-speaker generative model, which involves training a separate model to infer a new speaker embedding used for speaker encoding. Both methods can achieve excellent performance, even with a small number of cloning audios, in terms of the speech's naturalness and similarity to the original speaker. Speaker encoding approaches are more appropriate for low-resource deployment since they require significantly less memory and have a faster cloning time than speaker adaption, which can offer slightly greater naturalness and similarity. The main goal is to create a vocal cloning system that produces audio output with a Nepali accent or that sounds like Nepali. For the further advancement of TTS, the idea of transfer learning was effectively used to address several issues that were encountered in the development of this system, including the poor audio quality and the lack of available data.

### Solving Robotics Problems in Zero-Shot with Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Zidan Wang, Rui Shen, Bradly Stadie

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T16:06:27Z

**Summary**: We introduce Wonderful Team, a multi-agent visual LLM (VLLM) framework for solving robotics problems in the zero-shot regime. By zero-shot we mean that, for a novel environment, we feed a VLLM an image of the robot's environment and a description of the task, and have the VLLM output the sequence of actions necessary for the robot to complete the task. Prior work on VLLMs in robotics has largely focused on settings where some part of the pipeline is fine-tuned, such as tuning an LLM on robot data or training a separate vision encoder for perception and action generation. Surprisingly, due to recent advances in the capabilities of VLLMs, this type of fine-tuning may no longer be necessary for many tasks. In this work, we show that with careful engineering, we can prompt a single off-the-shelf VLLM to handle all aspects of a robotics task, from high-level planning to low-level location-extraction and action-execution. Wonderful Team builds on recent advances in multi-agent LLMs to partition tasks across an agent hierarchy, making it self-corrective and able to effectively partition and solve even long-horizon tasks. Extensive experiments on VIMABench and real-world robotic environments demonstrate the system's capability to handle a variety of robotic tasks, including manipulation, visual goal-reaching, and visual reasoning, all in a zero-shot manner. These results underscore a key point: vision-language models have progressed rapidly in the past year, and should strongly be considered as a backbone for robotics problems going forward.

### Can LLM be a Good Path Planner based on Prompt Engineering? Mitigating   the Hallucination for Path Planning
**Authors**: Hourui Deng, Hongjie Zhang, Jie Ou, Chaosheng Feng

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T16:02:54Z

**Summary**: Spatial reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is the foundation for embodied intelligence. However, even in simple maze environments, LLMs still encounter challenges in long-term path-planning, primarily influenced by their spatial hallucination and context inconsistency hallucination by long-term reasoning. To address this challenge, this study proposes an innovative model, Spatial-to-Relational Transformation and Curriculum Q-Learning (S2RCQL). To address the spatial hallucination of LLMs, we propose the Spatial-to-Relational approach, which transforms spatial prompts into entity relations and paths representing entity relation chains. This approach fully taps the potential of LLMs in terms of sequential thinking. As a result, we design a path-planning algorithm based on Q-learning to mitigate the context inconsistency hallucination, which enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs. Using the Q-value of state-action as auxiliary information for prompts, we correct the hallucinations of LLMs, thereby guiding LLMs to learn the optimal path. Finally, we propose a reverse curriculum learning technique based on LLMs to further mitigate the context inconsistency hallucination. LLMs can rapidly accumulate successful experiences by reducing task difficulty and leveraging them to tackle more complex tasks. We performed comprehensive experiments based on Baidu's self-developed LLM: ERNIE-Bot 4.0. The results showed that our S2RCQL achieved a 23%--40% improvement in both success and optimality rates compared with advanced prompt engineering.

### Impact of lensing of gravitational waves on the observed distribution of   neutron star masses
**Authors**: Sofia Canevarolo, Loek van Vonderen, Nora Elisa Chisari

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T15:59:16Z

**Summary**: The distribution of masses of neutron stars, particularly the maximum mass value, is considered a probe of their formation, evolution and internal physics (i.e., equation of state). This mass distribution could in principle be inferred from the detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers. Using mock catalogues of $10^5$ dark sirens events, expected to be detected by Einstein Telescope over an operational period of $\sim1\, \rm year$ , we show how the biased luminosity distance measurement induced by gravitational lensing affects the inferred redshift and mass of the merger. This results in higher observed masses than expected. Up to $2\%$ of the events are predicted to fall above the maximum allowed neutron star mass depending on the intrinsic mass distribution and signal-to-noise ratio threshold adopted. The underlying true mass distribution and maximum mass could still be approximately recovered in the case of bright standard sirens.

### A latent space model for multivariate count data time series analysis
**Authors**: Hardeep Kaur, Riccardo Rastelli

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T15:35:37Z

**Summary**: Motivated by a dataset of burglaries in Chicago, USA, we introduce a novel framework to analyze time series of count data combining common multivariate time series models with latent position network models. This novel methodology allows us to gain a new latent variable perspective on the crime dataset that we consider, allowing us to disentangle and explain the complex patterns exhibited by the data, while providing a natural time series framework that can be used to make future predictions. Our model is underpinned by two well known statistical approaches: a log-linear vector autoregressive model, which is prominent in the literature on multivariate count time series, and a latent projection model, which is a popular latent variable model for networks. The role of the projection model is to characterize the interaction parameters of the vector autoregressive model, thus uncovering the underlying network that is associated with the pairwise relationships between the time series. Estimation and inferential procedures are performed using an optimization algorithm and a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo procedure for efficient Bayesian inference. We also include a simulation study to illustrate the merits of our methodology in recovering consistent parameter estimates, and in making accurate future predictions for the time series. As we demonstrate in our application to the crime dataset, this new methodology can provide very meaningful model-based interpretations of the data, and it can be generalized to other time series contexts and applications.

### Say No to Freeloader: Protecting Intellectual Property of Your Deep   Model
**Authors**: Lianyu Wang, Meng Wang, Huazhu Fu, Daoqiang Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T15:34:33Z

**Summary**: Model intellectual property (IP) protection has attracted growing attention as science and technology advancements stem from human intellectual labor and computational expenses. Ensuring IP safety for trainers and owners is of utmost importance, particularly in domains where ownership verification and applicability authorization are required. A notable approach to safeguarding model IP involves proactively preventing the use of well-trained models of authorized domains from unauthorized domains. In this paper, we introduce a novel Compact Un-transferable Pyramid Isolation Domain (CUPI-Domain) which serves as a barrier against illegal transfers from authorized to unauthorized domains. Drawing inspiration from human transitive inference and learning abilities, the CUPI-Domain is designed to obstruct cross-domain transfers by emphasizing the distinctive style features of the authorized domain. This emphasis leads to failure in recognizing irrelevant private style features on unauthorized domains. To this end, we propose novel CUPI-Domain generators, which select features from both authorized and CUPI-Domain as anchors. Then, we fuse the style features and semantic features of these anchors to generate labeled and style-rich CUPI-Domain. Additionally, we design external Domain-Information Memory Banks (DIMB) for storing and updating labeled pyramid features to obtain stable domain class features and domain class-wise style features. Based on the proposed whole method, the novel style and discriminative loss functions are designed to effectively enhance the distinction in style and discriminative features between authorized and unauthorized domains, respectively. Moreover, we provide two solutions for utilizing CUPI-Domain based on whether the unauthorized domain is known: target-specified CUPI-Domain and target-free CUPI-Domain.

### AI and Jobs: Has the Inflection Point Arrived? Evidence from an Online   Labor Platform
**Authors**: Dandan Qiao, Huaxia Rui, Qian Xiong

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T15:29:05Z

**Summary**: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has renewed the debate on the important issue of "technology displacement". While prior research has investigated the effect of information technology in general on human labor from a macro perspective, this paper complements the literature by examining the impact of LLMs on freelancers from a micro perspective. Specifically, we leverage the release of ChatGPT to investigate how AI influences freelancers across different online labor markets (OLMs). Employing the Difference-in-Differences method, we discovered two distinct scenarios following ChatGPT's release: 1) the displacement effect of LLMs, featuring reduced work volume and earnings, as is exemplified by the translation & localization OLM; 2) the productivity effect of LLMs, featuring increased work volume and earnings, as is exemplified by the web development OLM. To shed light on the underlying mechanisms, we developed a Cournot-type competition model to highlight the existence of an inflection point for each occupation which separates the timeline of AI progress into a honeymoon phase and a substitution phase. Before AI performance crosses the inflection point, human labor benefits each time AI improves, resulting in the honeymoon phase. However, after AI performance crosses the inflection point, additional AI enhancement hurts human labor. Further analyzing the progression from ChatGPT 3.5 to 4.0, we found three effect scenarios (i.e., productivity to productivity, displacement to displacement, and productivity to displacement), consistent with the inflection point conjecture. Heterogeneous analyses reveal that U.S. web developers tend to benefit more from the release of ChatGPT compared to their counterparts in other regions, and somewhat surprisingly, experienced translators seem more likely to exit the market than less experienced translators after the release of ChatGPT.

### DeTPP: Leveraging Object Detection for Robust Long-Horizon Event   Prediction
**Authors**: Ivan Karpukhin, Andrey Savchenko

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T14:57:46Z

**Summary**: Forecasting future events over extended periods, known as long-horizon prediction, is a fundamental task in various domains, including retail, finance, healthcare, and social networks. Traditional methods, such as Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPP), typically use autoregressive models to predict multiple future events. However, these models frequently encounter issues such as converging to constant or repetitive outputs, which significantly limits their effectiveness and applicability. To overcome these limitations, we propose DeTPP (Detection-based Temporal Point Processes), a novel approach inspired by object detection methods from computer vision. DeTPP utilizes a novel matching-based loss function that selectively focuses on reliably predictable events, enhancing both training robustness and inference diversity. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art in long-horizon event prediction, significantly outperforming existing MTPP and next-K approaches. The implementation of DeTPP is publicly available on GitHub.

### Optical activation function using a metamaterial waveguide for an   all-optical neural network
**Authors**: Yoshihiro Honda, Yuya Shoji, Tomohiro Amemiya

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T14:55:39Z

**Summary**: In this study, we experimentally demonstrated that the nonlinear optical coefficient of the original Si can be enhanced by incorporating a metamaterial structure into an existing silicon waveguide. The two-photon absorption coefficient enhanced by the metamaterial structure was 424 cm/GW, which is 1.2x10^3 times higher than that of Si. Using this metamaterial waveguide-based nonlinear optical activation function, we achieved a high inference accuracy of 98.36% in the handwritten character recognition task, comparable to that obtained with the ReLU function as the activation function. Therefore, our approach can contribute to the realization of more power-efficient and compact all-optical neural networks.

### Evidential Deep Partial Multi-View Classification With Discount Fusion
**Authors**: Haojian Huang, Zhe Liu, Sukumar Letchmunan, Mingwei Lin, Muhammet Deveci, Witold Pedrycz, Patrick Siarry

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T14:50:49Z

**Summary**: Incomplete multi-view data classification poses significant challenges due to the common issue of missing views in real-world scenarios. Despite advancements, existing methods often fail to provide reliable predictions, largely due to the uncertainty of missing views and the inconsistent quality of imputed data. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel framework called Evidential Deep Partial Multi-View Classification (EDP-MVC). Initially, we use K-means imputation to address missing views, creating a complete set of multi-view data. However, the potential conflicts and uncertainties within this imputed data can affect the reliability of downstream inferences. To manage this, we introduce a Conflict-Aware Evidential Fusion Network (CAEFN), which dynamically adjusts based on the reliability of the evidence, ensuring trustworthy discount fusion and producing reliable inference outcomes. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets reveal EDP-MVC not only matches but often surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods.

### Posterior Sampling in High Dimension via Diffusion Processes
**Authors**: Andrea Montanari, Yuchen Wu

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T14:50:29Z

**Summary**: Sampling from the posterior is a key technical problem in Bayesian statistics. Rigorous guarantees are difficult to obtain for Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms of common use. In this paper, we study an alternative class of algorithms based on diffusion processes and variational methods. The diffusion is constructed in such a way that, at its final time, it approximates the target posterior distribution. The drift of this diffusion is given by the posterior expectation of the unknown parameter vector ${\boldsymbol \theta}$ given the data and the additional noisy observations.   In order to construct an efficient sampling algorithm, we use a simple Euler discretization of the diffusion process, and leverage message passing algorithms and variational inference techniques to approximate the posterior expectation oracle.   We apply this method to posterior sampling in two canonical problems in high-dimensional statistics: sparse regression and low-rank matrix estimation within the spiked model. In both cases we develop the first algorithms with accuracy guarantees in the regime of constant signal-to-noise ratios.

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T14:17:24Z

**Summary**: We present 12 new AGN at 4<z<7 in the JADES survey (in addition to the previously identified AGN in GN-z11 at z=10.6) revealed through the detection of a Broad Line Region as seen in Halpha. The depth of JADES, together with the use of three different spectral resolutions, enables us to probe a lower mass regime relative to previous studies. In a few cases we find evidence for two broad components of Halpha which suggests that these could be candidate merging black holes (BHs). The inferred BH masses range between 8 x 10^7 Msun down to 4 x 10^5 Msun, interestingly probing the regime expected for Direct Collapse Black Holes (DCBHs). The inferred AGN bolometric luminosities (~10^44-10^45 erg/s) imply accretion rates that are < 0.5 times the Eddington rate in most cases. However, small BHs, with M_BH ~ 10^6 Msun, tend to accrete at Eddington or super-Eddington rates. These BH at z~4-11 are over-massive relative to their host galaxies stellar masses when compared to the local M_BH-Mstar relation, and even approaching M_BH~Mstar, as expected for DCBHs and super-Eddington scenarios. However, we find that these early BHs tend to be more consistent with the local relation between M_BH and velocity dispersion, as well as between M_BH and dynamical mass, suggesting that these are more fundamental and universal relations. On the BPT excitation-diagnostic diagram these AGN are located in the region that is that is locally occupied by star-forming galaxies, implying that they would be missed by the standard classification techniques if they did not display broad lines. Their location on the diagram is consistent with what expected for AGN hosted in metal poor galaxies (Z ~ 0.1-0.2 Zsun). The fraction of broad line AGN with L_AGN > 10^44 erg/s, among galaxies in the redshift range 4<z<6, is about 10%, suggesting that the contribution of AGN and their hosts to the reionization of the Universe is > 10%.

### Diffusion-based Episodes Augmentation for Offline Multi-Agent   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Jihwan Oh, Sungnyun Kim, Gahee Kim, Sunghwan Kim, Se-Young Yun

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T14:17:17Z

**Summary**: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is increasingly recognized as crucial for effectively deploying RL algorithms in environments where real-time interaction is impractical, risky, or costly. In the offline setting, learning from a static dataset of past interactions allows for the development of robust and safe policies without the need for live data collection, which can be fraught with challenges. Building on this foundational importance, we present EAQ, Episodes Augmentation guided by Q-total loss, a novel approach for offline MARL framework utilizing diffusion models. EAQ integrates the Q-total function directly into the diffusion model as a guidance to maximize the global returns in an episode, eliminating the need for separate training. Our focus primarily lies on cooperative scenarios, where agents are required to act collectively towards achieving a shared goal-essentially, maximizing global returns. Consequently, we demonstrate that our episodes augmentation in a collaborative manner significantly boosts offline MARL algorithm compared to the original dataset, improving the normalized return by +17.3% and +12.9% for medium and poor behavioral policies in SMAC simulator, respectively.

### Enhancing Training Efficiency Using Packing with Flash Attention
**Authors**: Achintya Kundu, Rhui Dih Lee, Laura Wynter, Raghu Kiran Ganti, Mayank Mishra

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T14:11:05Z

**Summary**: Padding is often used in tuning LLM models by adding special tokens to shorter training examples to match the length of the longest sequence in each batch. While this ensures uniformity for batch processing, it introduces inefficiencies by including irrelevant padding tokens in the computation and wastes GPU resources. Hugging Face SFT trainer has always offered the option to use packing to combine multiple training examples, allowing for maximal utilization of GPU resources. However, up till now, it did not offer proper masking of each packed training example. This capability has now been added to Hugging Face Transformers 4.44. We analyse this new feature and show the benefits across different variations of packing.

### IntelliCare: Improving Healthcare Analysis with Variance-Controlled   Patient-Level Knowledge from Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhihao Yu, Yujie Jin, Yongxin Xu, Xu Chu, Yasha Wang, Junfeng Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T13:56:00Z

**Summary**: While pioneering deep learning methods have made great strides in analyzing electronic health record (EHR) data, they often struggle to fully capture the semantics of diverse medical codes from limited data. The integration of external knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a promising avenue for improving healthcare predictions. However, LLM analyses may exhibit significant variance due to ambiguity problems and inconsistency issues, hindering their effective utilization. To address these challenges, we propose IntelliCare, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to provide high-quality patient-level external knowledge and enhance existing EHR models. Concretely, IntelliCare identifies patient cohorts and employs task-relevant statistical information to augment LLM understanding and generation, effectively mitigating the ambiguity problem. Additionally, it refines LLM-derived knowledge through a hybrid approach, generating multiple analyses and calibrating them using both the EHR model and perplexity measures. Experimental evaluations on three clinical prediction tasks across two large-scale EHR datasets demonstrate that IntelliCare delivers significant performance improvements to existing methods, highlighting its potential in advancing personalized healthcare predictions and decision support systems.

### Guiding IoT-Based Healthcare Alert Systems with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yulan Gao, Ziqiang Ye, Ming Xiao, Yue Xiao, Dong In Kim

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T13:55:36Z

**Summary**: Healthcare alert systems (HAS) are undergoing rapid evolution, propelled by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, and increasing health consciousness. Despite significant progress, a fundamental challenge remains: balancing the accuracy of personalized health alerts with stringent privacy protection in HAS environments constrained by resources. To address this issue, we introduce a uniform framework, LLM-HAS, which incorporates Large Language Models (LLM) into HAS to significantly boost the accuracy, ensure user privacy, and enhance personalized health service, while also improving the subjective quality of experience (QoE) for users. Our innovative framework leverages a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach, augmented with LLM, to analyze users' personalized preferences and potential health risks from additional textual job descriptions. This analysis guides the selection of specialized Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDPG) experts, tasked with making precise health alerts. Moreover, LLM-HAS can process Conversational User Feedback, which not only allows fine-tuning of DDPG but also deepen user engagement, thereby enhancing both the accuracy and personalization of health management strategies. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the LLM-HAS framework, highlighting its potential as a groundbreaking approach for employing generative AI (GAI) to provide highly accurate and reliable alerts.

### General Intelligent Imaging and Uncertainty Quantification by   Deterministic Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Weiru Fan, Xiaobin Tang, Yiyi Liao, Da-Wei Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T13:37:54Z

**Summary**: Computational imaging is crucial in many disciplines from autonomous driving to life sciences. However, traditional model-driven and iterative methods consume large computational power and lack scalability for imaging. Deep learning (DL) is effective in processing local-to-local patterns, but it struggles with handling universal global-to-local (nonlocal) patterns under current frameworks. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel DL framework that employs a progressive denoising strategy, named the deterministic diffusion model (DDM), to facilitate general computational imaging at a low cost. We experimentally demonstrate the efficient and faithful image reconstruction capabilities of DDM from nonlocal patterns, such as speckles from multimode fiber and intensity patterns of second harmonic generation, surpassing the capability of previous state-of-the-art DL algorithms. By embedding Bayesian inference into DDM, we establish a theoretical framework and provide experimental proof of its uncertainty quantification. This advancement ensures the predictive reliability of DDM, avoiding misjudgment in high-stakes scenarios. This versatile and integrable DDM framework can readily extend and improve the efficacy of existing DL-based imaging applications.

### Adaptive complexity of log-concave sampling
**Authors**: Huanjian Zhou, Baoxiang Wang, Masashi Sugiyama

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T13:06:43Z

**Summary**: In large-data applications, such as the inference process of diffusion models, it is desirable to design sampling algorithms with a high degree of parallelization. In this work, we study the adaptive complexity of sampling, which is the minimal number of sequential rounds required to achieve sampling given polynomially many queries executed in parallel at each round. For unconstrained sampling, we examine distributions that are log-smooth or log-Lipschitz and log strongly or non-strongly concave. We show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with a specific exponentially small accuracy under total variation distance. For box-constrained sampling, we show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with sup-polynomially small accuracy under total variation distance for log-concave distributions. Our proof relies upon novel analysis with the characterization of the output for the hardness potentials based on the chain-like structure with random partition and classical smoothing techniques.

### KaMPIng: Flexible and (Near) Zero-Overhead C++ Bindings for MPI
**Authors**: Tim Niklas Uhl, Matthias Schimek, Lukas Hübner, Demian Hespe, Florian Kurpicz, Christoph Stelz, Peter Sanders

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T12:44:08Z

**Summary**: The Message-Passing Interface (MPI) and C++ form the backbone of high-performance computing, but MPI only provides C and Fortran bindings. While this offers great language interoperability, high-level programming languages like C++ make software development quicker and less error-prone.   We propose novel C++ language bindings that cover all abstraction levels from low-level MPI calls to convenient STL-style bindings, where most parameters are inferred from a small subset of parameters, by bringing named parameters to C++. This enables rapid prototyping and fine-tuning runtime behavior and memory management. A flexible type system and additional safety guarantees help to prevent programming errors.   By exploiting C++'s template metaprogramming capabilities, this has (near) zero overhead, as only required code paths are generated at compile time.   We demonstrate that our library is a strong foundation for a future distributed standard library using multiple application benchmarks, ranging from text-book sorting algorithms to phylogenetic interference.

### Real Log Canonical Thresholds at Non-singular Points
**Authors**: Yuki Kurumadani

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T12:38:22Z

**Summary**: Recent advances have clarified theoretical learning accuracy in Bayesian inference, revealing that the asymptotic behavior of metrics such as generalization loss and free energy, assessing predictive accuracy, is dictated by a rational number unique to each statistical model, termed the learning coefficient (real log canonical threshold). For models meeting regularity conditions, their learning coefficients are known. However, for singular models not meeting these conditions, exact values of learning coefficients are provided for specific models like reduced-rank regression, but a broadly applicable calculation method for these learning coefficients in singular models remains elusive.   This paper extends the application range of the previous work and provides an approach that can be applied to many points within the set of realizable parameters. Specifically, it provides a formula for calculating the real log canonical threshold at many non-singular points within the set of realizable parameters. If this calculation can be performed, it is possible to obtain an upper bound for the learning coefficient of the statistical model. Thus, this approach can also be used to easily obtain an upper bound for the learning coefficients of statistical models. As an application example, it provides an upper bound for the learning coefficient of a mixed binomial model, and calculates the learning coefficient for a specific case of reduced-rank regression, confirming that the results are consistent with previous research.

### In-Context Learning with Reinforcement Learning for Incomplete Utterance   Rewriting
**Authors**: Haowei Du, Dongyan Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T12:32:12Z

**Summary**: In-context learning (ICL) of large language models (LLMs) has attracted increasing attention in the community where LLMs make predictions only based on instructions augmented with a few examples. Existing example selection methods for ICL utilize sparse or dense retrievers and derive effective performance. However, these methods do not utilize direct feedback of LLM to train the retriever and the examples selected can not necessarily improve the analogy ability of LLM. To tackle this, we propose our policy-based reinforcement learning framework for example selection (RLS), which consists of a language model (LM) selector and an LLM generator. The LM selector encodes the candidate examples into dense representations and selects the top-k examples into the demonstration for LLM. The outputs of LLM are adopted to compute the reward and policy gradient to optimize the LM selector. We conduct experiments on different datasets and significantly outperform existing example selection methods. Moreover, our approach shows advantages over supervised finetuning (SFT) models in few shot setting. Further experiments show the balance of abundance and the similarity with the test case of examples is important for ICL performance of LLM.

### Thermodynamic inference of correlations in nonequilibrium collective   dynamics
**Authors**: Michalis Chatzittofi, Ramin Golestanian, Jaime Agudo-Canalejo

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T12:29:05Z

**Summary**: The theory of stochastic thermodynamics has revealed many useful fluctuation relations, with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) being a theorem of major interest. When many nonequilibrium currents interact with each other, a naive application of the TUR to an individual current can result in an apparent violation of the TUR bound. Here, we explore how such an apparent violation can be used to put a lower bound on the strength of correlations as well as the number of interacting currents in collective dynamics. Our proposed protocol allows for the inference of hidden correlations in experiment, for example when a team of molecular motors pulls on the same cargo but only one or a subset of them is fluorescently tagged. By solving analytically and numerically several models of many-body nonequilibrium dynamics, we ascertain under which conditions this strategy can be applied and the inferred bound on correlations becomes tight.

### TokenPacker: Efficient Visual Projector for Multimodal LLM
**Authors**: Wentong Li, Yuqian Yuan, Jian Liu, Dongqi Tang, Song Wang, Jie Qin, Jianke Zhu, Lei Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T12:27:06Z

**Summary**: The visual projector serves as an essential bridge between the visual encoder and the Large Language Model (LLM) in a Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Typically, MLLMs adopt a simple MLP to preserve all visual contexts via one-to-one transformation. However, the visual tokens are redundant and can be considerably increased when dealing with high-resolution images, impairing the efficiency of MLLMs significantly. Some recent works have introduced resampler or abstractor to reduce the number of resulting visual tokens. Unfortunately, they fail to capture finer details and undermine the visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. In this work, we propose a novel visual projector, which adopts a coarse-to-fine scheme to inject the enriched characteristics to generate the condensed visual tokens. In specific, we first interpolate the visual features as a low-resolution point query, providing the overall visual representation as the foundation. Then, we introduce a region-to-point injection module that utilizes high-resolution, multi-level region-based cues as fine-grained reference keys and values, allowing them to be fully absorbed within the corresponding local context region. This step effectively updates the coarse point query, transforming it into an enriched one for the subsequent LLM reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach compresses the visual tokens by 75%~89%, while achieves comparable or even better performance across diverse benchmarks with significantly higher efficiency. The source codes can be found at https://github.com/CircleRadon/TokenPacker.

### Performance Law of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chuhan Wu, Ruiming Tang

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T12:14:18Z

**Summary**: Guided by the belief of the scaling law, large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, scaling law only gives a qualitative estimation of loss, which is influenced by various factors such as model architectures, data distributions, tokenizers, and computation precision. Thus, estimating the real performance of LLMs with different training settings rather than loss may be quite useful in practical development. In this article, we present an empirical equation named "Performance Law" to directly predict the MMLU score of an LLM, which is a widely used metric to indicate the general capability of LLMs in real-world conversations and applications. Based on only a few key hyperparameters of the LLM architecture and the size of training data, we obtain a quite accurate MMLU prediction of various LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures developed by different organizations in different years. Performance law can be used to guide the choice of LLM architecture and the effective allocation of computational resources without extensive experiments.

### A Web-Based Solution for Federated Learning with LLM-Based Automation
**Authors**: Chamith Mawela, Chaouki Ben Issaid, Mehdi Bennis

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T11:57:02Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach for collaborative machine learning across distributed devices. However, its adoption is hindered by the complexity of building reliable communication architectures and the need for expertise in both machine learning and network programming. This paper presents a comprehensive solution that simplifies the orchestration of FL tasks while integrating intent-based automation. We develop a user-friendly web application supporting the federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm, enabling users to configure parameters through an intuitive interface. The backend solution efficiently manages communication between the parameter server and edge nodes. We also implement model compression and scheduling algorithms to optimize FL performance. Furthermore, we explore intent-based automation in FL using a fine-tuned Language Model (LLM) trained on a tailored dataset, allowing users to conduct FL tasks using high-level prompts. We observe that the LLM-based automated solution achieves comparable test accuracy to the standard web-based solution while reducing transferred bytes by up to 64% and CPU time by up to 46% for FL tasks. Also, we leverage the neural architecture search (NAS) and hyperparameter optimization (HPO) using LLM to improve the performance. We observe that by using this approach test accuracy can be improved by 10-20% for the carried out FL tasks.

### Systematic Evaluation of LLM-as-a-Judge in LLM Alignment Tasks:   Explainable Metrics and Diverse Prompt Templates
**Authors**: Hui Wei, Shenghua He, Tian Xia, Andy Wong, Jingyang Lin, Mei Han

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T11:49:01Z

**Summary**: Alignment approaches such as RLHF and DPO are actively investigated to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Commercial large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have been recently employed to evaluate and compare different LLM alignment approaches. These models act as surrogates for human evaluators due to their promising abilities to approximate human preferences with remarkably faster feedback and lower costs. This methodology is referred to as LLM-as-a-judge. However, concerns regarding its reliability have emerged, attributed to LLM judges' biases and inconsistent decision-making. Previous research has sought to develop robust evaluation frameworks for assessing the reliability of LLM judges and their alignment with human preferences. However, the employed evaluation metrics often lack adequate explainability and fail to address the internal inconsistency of LLMs. Additionally, existing studies inadequately explore the impact of various prompt templates when applying LLM-as-a-judge methods, which leads to potentially inconsistent comparisons between different alignment algorithms. In this work, we systematically evaluate LLM judges on alignment tasks (e.g. summarization) by defining evaluation metrics with improved theoretical interpretability and disentangling reliability metrics with LLM internal inconsistency. We develop a framework to evaluate, compare, and visualize the reliability and alignment of LLM judges to provide informative observations that help choose LLM judges for alignment tasks. Our results indicate a significant impact of prompt templates on LLM judge performance, as well as a mediocre alignment level between the tested LLM judges and human evaluators.

### CRUXEval-X: A Benchmark for Multilingual Code Reasoning, Understanding   and Execution
**Authors**: Ruiyang Xu, Jialun Cao, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Ben He, Shing-Chi Cheung, Le Sun

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T11:43:00Z

**Summary**: Code benchmarks such as HumanEval are widely adopted to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) coding capabilities. However, there is an unignorable programming language bias in existing code benchmarks -- over 95% code generation benchmarks are dominated by Python, leaving the LLMs' capabilities in other programming languages such as Java and C/C++ unknown. Moreover, coding task bias is also crucial. Most benchmarks focus on code generation capability, while benchmarks for code reasoning (given input, reasoning output; and given output, reasoning input), an essential coding capability, are insufficient. Yet, constructing multi-lingual benchmarks can be expensive and labor-intensive, and codes in contest websites such as Leetcode suffer from data contamination during training. To fill this gap, we propose CRUXEVAL-X, a multi-lingual code reasoning benchmark that contains 19 programming languages. It comprises at least 600 subjects for each language, along with 19K content-consistent tests in total. In particular, the construction pipeline of CRUXEVAL-X works in a fully automated and test-guided manner, which iteratively generates and repairs based on execution feedback. Also, to cross language barriers (e.g., dynamic/static type systems in Python/C++), we formulated various transition rules between language pairs to facilitate translation. Our intensive evaluation of 24 representative LLMs reveals the correlation between language pairs. For example, TypeScript and JavaScript show a significant positive correlation, while Racket has less correlation with other languages. More interestingly, even a model trained solely on Python can achieve at most 34.4% Pass@1 in other languages, revealing the cross-language generalization of LLMs.

### RIFF: Inducing Rules for Fraud Detection from Decision Trees
**Authors**: João Lucas Martins, João Bravo, Ana Sofia Gomes, Carlos Soares, Pedro Bizarro

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T11:14:20Z

**Summary**: Financial fraud is the cause of multi-billion dollar losses annually. Traditionally, fraud detection systems rely on rules due to their transparency and interpretability, key features in domains where decisions need to be explained. However, rule systems require significant input from domain experts to create and tune, an issue that rule induction algorithms attempt to mitigate by inferring rules directly from data. We explore the application of these algorithms to fraud detection, where rule systems are constrained to have a low false positive rate (FPR) or alert rate, by proposing RIFF, a rule induction algorithm that distills a low FPR rule set directly from decision trees. Our experiments show that the induced rules are often able to maintain or improve performance of the original models for low FPR tasks, while substantially reducing their complexity and outperforming rules hand-tuned by experts.

### Inference-Adaptive Neural Steering for Real-Time Area-Based Sound Source   Separation
**Authors**: Martin Strauss, Wolfgang Mack, María Luis Valero, Okan Köpüklü

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T10:59:14Z

**Summary**: We propose a novel Neural Steering technique that adapts the target area of a spatial-aware multi-microphone sound source separation algorithm during inference without the necessity of retraining the deep neural network (DNN). To achieve this, we first train a DNN aiming to retain speech within a target region, defined by an angular span, while suppressing sound sources stemming from other directions. Afterward, a phase shift is applied to the microphone signals, allowing us to shift the center of the target area during inference at negligible additional cost in computational complexity. Further, we show that the proposed approach performs well in a wide variety of acoustic scenarios, including several speakers inside and outside the target area and additional noise. More precisely, the proposed approach performs on par with DNNs trained explicitly for the steered target area in terms of DNSMOS and SI-SDR.

### Internal and External Knowledge Interactive Refinement Framework for   Knowledge-Intensive Question Answering
**Authors**: Haowei Du, Dongyan Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T10:52:57Z

**Summary**: Recent works have attempted to integrate external knowledge into LLMs to address the limitations and potential factual errors in LLM-generated content. However, how to retrieve the correct knowledge from the large amount of external knowledge imposes a challenge. To this end, we empirically observe that LLMs have already encoded rich knowledge in their pretrained parameters and utilizing these internal knowledge improves the retrieval of external knowledge when applying them to knowledge-intensive tasks. In this paper, we propose a new internal and external knowledge interactive refinement paradigm dubbed IEKR to utilize internal knowledge in LLM to help retrieve relevant knowledge from the external knowledge base, as well as exploit the external knowledge to refine the hallucination of generated internal knowledge. By simply adding a prompt like 'Tell me something about' to the LLMs, we try to review related explicit knowledge and insert them with the query into the retriever for external retrieval. The external knowledge is utilized to complement the internal knowledge into input of LLM for answers. We conduct experiments on 3 benchmark datasets in knowledge-intensive question answering task with different LLMs and domains, achieving the new state-of-the-art. Further analysis shows the effectiveness of different modules in our approach.

### Contrasting Linguistic Patterns in Human and LLM-Generated Text
**Authors**: Alberto Muñoz-Ortiz, Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez, David Vilares

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T10:42:45Z

**Summary**: We conduct a quantitative analysis contrasting human-written English news text with comparable large language model (LLM) output from six different LLMs that cover three different families and four sizes in total. Our analysis spans several measurable linguistic dimensions, including morphological, syntactic, psychometric, and sociolinguistic aspects. The results reveal various measurable differences between human and AI-generated texts. Human texts exhibit more scattered sentence length distributions, more variety of vocabulary, a distinct use of dependency and constituent types, shorter constituents, and more optimized dependency distances. Humans tend to exhibit stronger negative emotions (such as fear and disgust) and less joy compared to text generated by LLMs, with the toxicity of these models increasing as their size grows. LLM outputs use more numbers, symbols and auxiliaries (suggesting objective language) than human texts, as well as more pronouns. The sexist bias prevalent in human text is also expressed by LLMs, and even magnified in all of them but one. Differences between LLMs and humans are larger than between LLMs.

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T10:18:39Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we propose and describe the first open Llama2 large language models (LLMs) for the Lithuanian language, including an accompanying question/answer (Q/A) dataset and translations of popular LLM benchmarks. We provide a brief review of open regional LLMs and detailed information on the proposed LLMs and their training process. We also conduct an empirical evaluation, comparing the perplexities of the proposed LLMs with those of other modern open LLMs. In addition, benchmarking the proposed LLMs against language understanding tasks reveals that high-quality pretraining datasets may be essential for achieving models that perform efficiently on these benchmarks. The full realisations of the described LLMs are available in the accompanying open repository~\url{https://huggingface.co/neurotechnology}.

### Multimodal Contrastive In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Yosuke Miyanishi, Minh Le Nguyen

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T10:10:01Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) usage has highlighted the importance of gradient-free in-context learning (ICL). However, interpreting their inner workings remains challenging. This paper introduces a novel multimodal contrastive in-context learning framework to enhance our understanding of ICL in LLMs. First, we present a contrastive learning-based interpretation of ICL in real-world settings, marking the distance of the key-value representation as the differentiator in ICL. Second, we develop an analytical framework to address biases in multimodal input formatting for real-world datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ICL examples where baseline performance is poor, even when they are represented in unseen formats. Lastly, we propose an on-the-fly approach for ICL (Anchored-by-Text ICL) that demonstrates effectiveness in detecting hateful memes, a task where typical ICL struggles due to resource limitations. Extensive experiments on multimodal datasets reveal that our approach significantly improves ICL performance across various scenarios, such as challenging tasks and resource-constrained environments. Moreover, it provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of in-context learning in LLMs. Our findings have important implications for developing more interpretable, efficient, and robust multimodal AI systems, especially in challenging tasks and resource-constrained environments.

**Authors**: Yue Pan, Chen Lyu, Zhenyu Yang, Lantian Li, Qi Liu, Xiuting Shao

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T09:57:37Z

**Summary**: Context: With the waning of Moore's Law, the software industry is placing increasing importance on finding alternative solutions for continuous performance enhancement. The significance and research results of software performance optimization have been on the rise in recent years, especially with the advancement propelled by Large Language Models(LLMs). However, traditional strategies for rectifying performance flaws have shown significant limitations at the competitive code efficiency optimization level, and research on this topic is surprisingly scarce. Objective: This study aims to address the research gap in this domain, offering practical solutions to the various challenges encountered. Specifically, we have overcome the constraints of traditional performance error rectification strategies and developed a Language Model (LM) tailored for the competitive code efficiency optimization realm. Method: We introduced E-code, an advanced program synthesis LM. Inspired by the recent success of expert LMs, we designed an innovative structure called the Expert Encoder Group. This structure employs multiple expert encoders to extract features tailored for different input types. We assessed the performance of E-code against other leading models on a competitive dataset and conducted in-depth ablation experiments. Results: Upon systematic evaluation, E-code achieved a 54.98% improvement in code efficiency, significantly outperforming other advanced models. In the ablation experiments, we further validated the significance of the expert encoder group and other components within E-code. Conclusion: The research findings indicate that the expert encoder group can effectively handle various inputs in efficiency optimization tasks, significantly enhancing the model's performance.

### Causal-Guided Active Learning for Debiasing Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhouhao Sun, Li Du, Xiao Ding, Yixuan Ma, Kaitao Qiu, Ting Liu, Bing Qin

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T09:46:15Z

**Summary**: Although achieving promising performance, recent analyses show that current generative large language models (LLMs) may still capture dataset biases and utilize them for generation, leading to poor generalizability and harmfulness of LLMs. However, due to the diversity of dataset biases and the over-optimization problem, previous prior-knowledge-based debiasing methods and fine-tuning-based debiasing methods may not be suitable for current LLMs. To address this issue, we explore combining active learning with the causal mechanisms and propose a casual-guided active learning (CAL) framework, which utilizes LLMs itself to automatically and autonomously identify informative biased samples and induce the bias patterns. Then a cost-effective and efficient in-context learning based method is employed to prevent LLMs from utilizing dataset biases during generation. Experimental results show that CAL can effectively recognize typical biased instances and induce various bias patterns for debiasing LLMs.

### Trustworthy, Responsible, and Safe AI: A Comprehensive Architectural   Framework for AI Safety with Challenges and Mitigations
**Authors**: Chen Chen, Ziyao Liu, Weifeng Jiang, Goh Si Qi, KwoK-Yan Lam

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T09:33:48Z

**Summary**: AI Safety is an emerging area of critical importance to the safe adoption and deployment of AI systems. With the rapid proliferation of AI and especially with the recent advancement of Generative AI (or GAI), the technology ecosystem behind the design, development, adoption, and deployment of AI systems has drastically changed, broadening the scope of AI Safety to address impacts on public safety and national security. In this paper, we propose a novel architectural framework for understanding and analyzing AI Safety; defining its characteristics from three perspectives: Trustworthy AI, Responsible AI, and Safe AI. We provide an extensive review of current research and advancements in AI safety from these perspectives, highlighting their key challenges and mitigation approaches. Through examples from state-of-the-art technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), we present innovative mechanism, methodologies, and techniques for designing and testing AI safety. Our goal is to promote advancement in AI safety research, and ultimately enhance people's trust in digital transformation.

### Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Next Location Predictors
**Authors**: Ciro Beneduce, Bruno Lepri, Massimiliano Luca

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T09:24:22Z

**Summary**: Predicting the locations an individual will visit in the future is crucial for solving many societal issues like disease diffusion and reduction of pollution. However, next-location predictors require a significant amount of individual-level information that may be scarce or unavailable in some scenarios (e.g., cold-start). Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown good generalization and reasoning capabilities and are rich in geographical knowledge, allowing us to believe that these models can act as zero-shot next-location predictors. We tested more than 15 LLMs on three real-world mobility datasets and we found that LLMs can obtain accuracies up to 36.2%, a significant relative improvement of almost 640% when compared to other models specifically designed for human mobility. We also test for data contamination and explored the possibility of using LLMs as text-based explainers for next-location prediction, showing that, regardless of the model size, LLMs can explain their decision.

### Animal Identification with Independent Foreground and Background   Modeling
**Authors**: Lukas Picek, Lukas Neumann, Jiri Matas

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T09:19:34Z

**Summary**: We propose a method that robustly exploits background and foreground in visual identification of individual animals. Experiments show that their automatic separation, made easy with methods like Segment Anything, together with independent foreground and background-related modeling, improves results. The two predictions are combined in a principled way, thanks to novel Per-Instance Temperature Scaling that helps the classifier to deal with appearance ambiguities in training and to produce calibrated outputs in the inference phase. For identity prediction from the background, we propose novel spatial and temporal models. On two problems, the relative error w.r.t. the baseline was reduced by 22.3% and 8.8%, respectively. For cases where objects appear in new locations, an example of background drift, accuracy doubles.

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T09:14:58Z

**Summary**: This work presents ParGo, a novel Partial-Global projector designed to connect the vision and language modalities for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous works that rely on global attention-based projectors, our ParGo bridges the representation gap between the separately pre-trained vision encoders and the LLMs by integrating global and partial views, which alleviates the overemphasis on prominent regions. To facilitate the effective training of ParGo, we collect a large-scale detail-captioned image-text dataset named ParGoCap-1M-PT, consisting of 1 million images paired with high-quality captions. Extensive experiments on several MLLM benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ParGo, highlighting its superiority in aligning vision and language modalities. Compared to conventional Q-Former projector, our ParGo achieves an improvement of 259.96 in MME benchmark. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ParGo significantly outperforms other projectors, particularly in tasks that emphasize detail perception ability.

### Federated Neural Graph Databases
**Authors**: Qi Hu, Weifeng Jiang, Haoran Li, Zihao Wang, Jiaxin Bai, Qianren Mao, Yangqiu Song, Lixin Fan, Jianxin Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T08:40:23Z

**Summary**: The increasing demand for large-scale language models (LLMs) has highlighted the importance of efficient data retrieval mechanisms. Neural graph databases (NGDBs) have emerged as a promising approach to storing and querying graph-structured data in neural space, enabling the retrieval of relevant information for LLMs. However, existing NGDBs are typically designed to operate on a single graph, limiting their ability to reason across multiple graphs. Furthermore, the lack of support for multi-source graph data in existing NGDBs hinders their ability to capture the complexity and diversity of real-world data. In many applications, data is distributed across multiple sources, and the ability to reason across these sources is crucial for making informed decisions. This limitation is particularly problematic when dealing with sensitive graph data, as directly sharing and aggregating such data poses significant privacy risks. As a result, many applications that rely on NGDBs are forced to choose between compromising data privacy or sacrificing the ability to reason across multiple graphs. To address these limitations, we propose Federated Neural Graph Database (FedNGDB), a novel framework that enables reasoning over multi-source graph-based data while preserving privacy. FedNGDB leverages federated learning to collaboratively learn graph representations across multiple sources, enriching relationships between entities and improving the overall quality of the graph data. Unlike existing methods, FedNGDB can handle complex graph structures and relationships, making it suitable for various downstream tasks.

### SUBLLM: A Novel Efficient Architecture with Token Sequence Subsampling   for LLM
**Authors**: Quandong Wang, Yuxuan Yuan, Xiaoyu Yang, Ruike Zhang, Kang Zhao, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Daniel Povey, Bin Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T08:17:58Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various fields, the efficiency of training and inference remains a major challenge. To address this issue, we propose SUBLLM, short for Subsampling-Upsampling-Bypass Large Language Model, an innovative architecture that extends the core decoder-only framework by incorporating subsampling, upsampling, and bypass modules. The subsampling modules are responsible for shortening the sequence, while the upsampling modules restore the sequence length, and the bypass modules enhance convergence. In comparison to LLaMA, the proposed SUBLLM exhibits significant enhancements in both training and inference speeds as well as memory usage, while maintaining competitive few-shot performance. During training, SUBLLM increases speeds by 26% and cuts memory by 10GB per GPU. In inference, it boosts speeds by up to 37% and reduces memory by 1GB per GPU. The training and inference speeds can be enhanced by 34% and 52% respectively when the context window is expanded to 8192. Our code is available at https://github.com/XiaoMi/subllm.

### A Quick, trustworthy spectral detection Q&A system based on the SDAAP   Dataset and large language model
**Authors**: Jiheng Liang, Ziru Yu, Zujie Xie, Xiangyang Yu

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T08:16:50Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) has demonstrated significant success in a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks within general domain. The emergence of LLM has introduced innovative methodologies across diverse fields, including the natural sciences. Researchers aim to implement automated, concurrent process driven by LLM to supplant conventional manual, repetitive and labor-intensive work. In the domain of spectral analysis and detection, it is imperative for researchers to autonomously acquire pertinent knowledge across various research objects, which encompasses the spectroscopic techniques and the chemometric methods that are employed in experiments and analysis. Paradoxically, despite the recognition of spectroscopic detection as an effective analytical method, the fundamental process of knowledge retrieval remains both time-intensive and repetitive. In response to this challenge, we first introduced the Spectral Detection and Analysis Based Paper(SDAAP) dataset, which is the first open-source textual knowledge dataset for spectral analysis and detection and contains annotated literature data as well as corresponding knowledge instruction data. Subsequently, we also designed an automated Q\&A framework based on the SDAAP dataset, which can retrieve relevant knowledge and generate high-quality responses by extracting entities in the input as retrieval parameters. It is worth noting that: within this framework, LLM is only used as a tool to provide generalizability, while RAG technique is used to accurately capture the source of the knowledge.This approach not only improves the quality of the generated responses, but also ensures the traceability of the knowledge. Experimental results show that our framework generates responses with more reliable expertise compared to the baseline.

### RoundTable: Leveraging Dynamic Schema and Contextual Autocomplete for   Enhanced Query Precision in Tabular Question Answering
**Authors**: Pratyush Kumar, Kuber Vijaykumar Bellad, Bharat Vadlamudi, Aman Chadha

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T08:11:09Z

**Summary**: With advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), a major use case that has emerged is querying databases in plain English, translating user questions into executable database queries, which has improved significantly. However, real-world datasets often feature a vast array of attributes and complex values, complicating the LLMs task of accurately identifying relevant columns or values from natural language queries. Traditional methods cannot fully relay the datasets size and complexity to the LLM. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages Full-Text Search (FTS) on the input table. This approach not only enables precise detection of specific values and columns but also narrows the search space for language models, thereby enhancing query accuracy. Additionally, it supports a custom auto-complete feature that suggests queries based on the data in the table. This integration significantly refines the interaction between the user and complex datasets, offering a sophisticated solution to the limitations faced by current table querying capabilities. This work is accompanied by an application for both Mac and Windows platforms, which readers can try out themselves on their own data.

### Robust Feature Inference: A Test-time Defense Strategy using Spectral   Projections
**Authors**: Anurag Singh, Mahalakshmi Sabanayagam, Krikamol Muandet, Debarghya Ghoshdastidar

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T07:54:39Z

**Summary**: Test-time defenses are used to improve the robustness of deep neural networks to adversarial examples during inference. However, existing methods either require an additional trained classifier to detect and correct the adversarial samples, or perform additional complex optimization on the model parameters or the input to adapt to the adversarial samples at test-time, resulting in a significant increase in the inference time compared to the base model. In this work, we propose a novel test-time defense strategy called Robust Feature Inference (RFI) that is easy to integrate with any existing (robust) training procedure without additional test-time computation. Based on the notion of robustness of features that we present, the key idea is to project the trained models to the most robust feature space, thereby reducing the vulnerability to adversarial attacks in non-robust directions. We theoretically characterize the subspace of the eigenspectrum of the feature covariance that is the most robust for a generalized additive model. Our extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, tiny ImageNet and ImageNet datasets for several robustness benchmarks, including the state-of-the-art methods in RobustBench show that RFI improves robustness across adaptive and transfer attacks consistently. We also compare RFI with adaptive test-time defenses to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T07:46:17Z

**Summary**: Information Technology (IT) Operations (Ops), particularly Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps), is the guarantee for maintaining the orderly and stable operation of existing information systems. According to Gartner's prediction, the use of AI technology for automated IT operations has become a new trend. Large language models (LLMs) that have exhibited remarkable capabilities in NLP-related tasks, are showing great potential in the field of AIOps, such as in aspects of root cause analysis of failures, generation of operations and maintenance scripts, and summarizing of alert information. Nevertheless, the performance of current LLMs in Ops tasks is yet to be determined. In this paper, we present OpsEval, a comprehensive task-oriented Ops benchmark designed for LLMs. For the first time, OpsEval assesses LLMs' proficiency in various crucial scenarios at different ability levels. The benchmark includes 7184 multi-choice questions and 1736 question-answering (QA) formats in English and Chinese. By conducting a comprehensive performance evaluation of the current leading large language models, we show how various LLM techniques can affect the performance of Ops, and discussed findings related to various topics, including model quantification, QA evaluation, and hallucination issues. To ensure the credibility of our evaluation, we invite dozens of domain experts to manually review our questions. At the same time, we have open-sourced 20% of the test QA to assist current researchers in preliminary evaluations of their OpsLLM models. The remaining 80% of the data, which is not disclosed, is used to eliminate the issue of the test set leakage. Additionally, we have constructed an online leaderboard that is updated in real-time and will continue to be updated, ensuring that any newly emerging LLMs will be evaluated promptly. Both our dataset and leaderboard have been made public.

### BERT-ASC: Auxiliary-Sentence Construction for Implicit Aspect Learning   in Sentiment Analysis
**Authors**: Murtadha Ahmed, Bo Wen, Shengfeng Pan, Jianlin Su, Luo Ao, Yunfeng Liu

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T07:46:00Z

**Summary**: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to associate a text with a set of aspects and infer their respective sentimental polarities. State-of-the-art approaches are built on fine-tuning pre-trained language models, focusing on learning aspect-specific representations from the corpus. However, aspects are often expressed implicitly, making implicit mapping challenging without sufficient labeled examples, which may be scarce in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a unified framework to address aspect categorization and aspect-based sentiment subtasks. We introduce a mechanism to construct an auxiliary-sentence for the implicit aspect using the corpus's semantic information. We then encourage BERT to learn aspect-specific representation in response to this auxiliary-sentence, not the aspect itself. We evaluate our approach on real benchmark datasets for both ABSA and Targeted-ABSA tasks. Our experiments show that it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in aspect categorization and aspect-based sentiment across all datasets, with considerable improvement margins. The BERT-ASC code is available at https://github.com/amurtadha/BERT-ASC.

### Distillation Contrastive Decoding: Improving LLMs Reasoning with   Contrastive Decoding and Distillation
**Authors**: Phuc Phan, Hieu Tran, Long Phan

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T07:31:42Z

**Summary**: We propose a straightforward approach called Distillation Contrastive Decoding (DCD) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference. In contrast to previous approaches that relied on smaller amateur models or analysis of hidden state differences, DCD employs Contrastive Chain-of-thought Prompting and advanced distillation techniques, including Dropout and Quantization. This approach effectively addresses the limitations of Contrastive Decoding (CD), which typically requires both an expert and an amateur model, thus increasing computational resource demands. By integrating contrastive prompts with distillation, DCD obviates the need for an amateur model and reduces memory usage. Our evaluations demonstrate that DCD significantly enhances LLM performance across a range of reasoning benchmarks, surpassing both CD and existing methods in the GSM8K and StrategyQA datasets.

### Semantic Alignment for Multimodal Large Language Models
**Authors**: Tao Wu, Mengze Li, Jingyuan Chen, Wei Ji, Wang Lin, Jinyang Gao, Kun Kuang, Zhou Zhao, Fei Wu

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T06:48:46Z

**Summary**: Research on Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) towards the multi-image cross-modal instruction has received increasing attention and made significant progress, particularly in scenarios involving closely resembling images (e.g., change captioning). Existing MLLMs typically follow a two-step process in their pipelines: first, extracting visual tokens independently for each input image, and then aligning these visual tokens from different images with the Large Language Model (LLM) in its textual feature space. However, the independent extraction of visual tokens for each image may result in different semantics being prioritized for different images in the first step, leading to a lack of preservation of linking information among images for subsequent LLM analysis. This issue becomes more serious in scenarios where significant variations exist among the images (e.g., visual storytelling). To address this challenge, we introduce Semantic Alignment for Multi-modal large language models (SAM). By involving the bidirectional semantic guidance between different images in the visual-token extraction process, SAM aims to enhance the preservation of linking information for coherent analysis and align the semantics of different images before feeding them into LLM. As the test bed, we propose a large-scale dataset named MmLINK consisting of 69K samples. Different from most existing datasets for MLLMs fine-tuning, our MmLINK dataset comprises multi-modal instructions with significantly diverse images. Extensive experiments on the group captioning task and the storytelling task prove the effectiveness of our SAM model, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+37% for group captioning and +22% for storytelling on CIDEr score).

**Authors**: Kun Luo, Minghao Qin, Zheng Liu, Shitao Xiao, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T06:46:41Z

**Summary**: Pretrained language models like BERT and T5 serve as crucial backbone encoders for dense retrieval. However, these models often exhibit limited generalization capabilities and face challenges in improving in domain accuracy. Recent research has explored using large language models (LLMs) as retrievers, achieving SOTA performance across various tasks. Despite these advancements, the specific benefits of LLMs over traditional retrievers and the impact of different LLM configurations, such as parameter sizes, pretraining duration, and alignment processes on retrieval tasks remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on a wide range of retrieval tasks, including in domain accuracy, data efficiency, zero shot generalization, lengthy retrieval, instruction based retrieval, and multi task learning. We evaluate over 15 different backbone LLMs and non LLMs. Our findings reveal that larger models and extensive pretraining consistently enhance in domain accuracy and data efficiency. Additionally, larger models demonstrate significant potential in zero shot generalization, lengthy retrieval, instruction based retrieval, and multi task learning. These results underscore the advantages of LLMs as versatile and effective backbone encoders in dense retrieval, providing valuable insights for future research and development in this field.

**Authors**: Jun Guo, Xiaojian Ma, Yue Fan, Huaping Liu, Qing Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T06:44:36Z

**Summary**: Open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding presents a significant challenge in computer vision, with wide-ranging applications in embodied agents and augmented reality systems. Existing methods adopt neurel rendering methods as 3D representations and jointly optimize color and semantic features to achieve rendering and scene understanding simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce Semantic Gaussians, a novel open-vocabulary scene understanding approach based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to distill knowledge from 2D pre-trained models to 3D Gaussians. Unlike existing methods, we design a versatile projection approach that maps various 2D semantic features from pre-trained image encoders into a novel semantic component of 3D Gaussians, which is based on spatial relationship and need no additional training. We further build a 3D semantic network that directly predicts the semantic component from raw 3D Gaussians for fast inference. The quantitative results on ScanNet segmentation and LERF object localization demonstates the superior performance of our method. Additionally, we explore several applications of Semantic Gaussians including object part segmentation, instance segmentation, scene editing, and spatiotemporal segmentation with better qualitative results over 2D and 3D baselines, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness on supporting diverse downstream tasks.

### Memory-Efficient LLM Training with Online Subspace Descent
**Authors**: Kaizhao Liang, Bo Liu, Lizhang Chen, Qiang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T05:54:53Z

**Summary**: Recently, a wide range of memory-efficient LLM training algorithms have gained substantial popularity. These methods leverage the low-rank structure of gradients to project optimizer states into a subspace using projection matrix found by singular value decomposition (SVD). However, convergence of these algorithms is highly dependent on the update rules of their projection matrix. In this work, we provide the \emph{first} convergence guarantee for arbitrary update rules of projection matrix. This guarantee is generally applicable to optimizers that can be analyzed with Hamiltonian Descent, including most common ones, such as LION, Adam. Inspired by our theoretical understanding, we propose Online Subspace Descent, a new family of subspace descent optimizer without SVD. Instead of updating the projection matrix with eigenvectors, Online Subspace Descent updates the projection matrix with online PCA. Online Subspace Descent is flexible and introduces only minimum overhead to training. We show that for the task of pretraining LLaMA models ranging from 60M to 7B parameters on the C4 dataset, Online Subspace Descent achieves lower perplexity and better downstream tasks performance than state-of-the-art low-rank training methods across different settings and narrows the gap with full-rank baselines.

### Predicting Affective States from Screen Text Sentiment
**Authors**: Songyan Teng, Tianyi Zhang, Simon D'Alfonso, Vassilis Kostakos

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T05:25:11Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of mobile sensing technologies has enabled the study of various physiological and behavioural phenomena through unobtrusive data collection from smartphone sensors. This approach offers real-time insights into individuals' physical and mental states, creating opportunities for personalised treatment and interventions. However, the potential of analysing the textual content viewed on smartphones to predict affective states remains underexplored. To better understand how the screen text that users are exposed to and interact with can influence their affects, we investigated a subset of data obtained from a digital phenotyping study of Australian university students conducted in 2023. We employed linear regression, zero-shot, and multi-shot prompting using a large language model (LLM) to analyse relationships between screen text and affective states. Our findings indicate that multi-shot prompting substantially outperforms both linear regression and zero-shot prompting, highlighting the importance of context in affect prediction. We discuss the value of incorporating textual and sentiment data for improving affect prediction, providing a basis for future advancements in understanding smartphone use and wellbeing.

### HGNAS: Hardware-Aware Graph Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices
**Authors**: Ao Zhou, Jianlei Yang, Yingjie Qi, Tong Qiao, Yumeng Shi, Cenlin Duan, Weisheng Zhao, Chunming Hu

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T05:11:22Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are becoming increasingly popular for graph-based learning tasks such as point cloud processing due to their state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Nevertheless, the research community has primarily focused on improving model expressiveness, lacking consideration of how to design efficient GNN models for edge scenarios with real-time requirements and limited resources. Examining existing GNN models reveals varied execution across platforms and frequent Out-Of-Memory (OOM) problems, highlighting the need for hardware-aware GNN design. To address this challenge, this work proposes a novel hardware-aware graph neural architecture search framework tailored for resource constraint edge devices, namely HGNAS. To achieve hardware awareness, HGNAS integrates an efficient GNN hardware performance predictor that evaluates the latency and peak memory usage of GNNs in milliseconds. Meanwhile, we study GNN memory usage during inference and offer a peak memory estimation method, enhancing the robustness of architecture evaluations when combined with predictor outcomes. Furthermore, HGNAS constructs a fine-grained design space to enable the exploration of extreme performance architectures by decoupling the GNN paradigm. In addition, the multi-stage hierarchical search strategy is leveraged to facilitate the navigation of huge candidates, which can reduce the single search time to a few GPU hours. To the best of our knowledge, HGNAS is the first automated GNN design framework for edge devices, and also the first work to achieve hardware awareness of GNNs across different platforms. Extensive experiments across various applications and edge devices have proven the superiority of HGNAS. It can achieve up to a 10.6x speedup and an 82.5% peak memory reduction with negligible accuracy loss compared to DGCNN on ModelNet40.

**Authors**: Takashi Koide, Naoki Fukushi, Hiroki Nakano, Daiki Chiba

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T05:03:44Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of phishing sites and emails poses significant challenges to existing cybersecurity efforts. Despite advances in malicious email filters and email security protocols, problems with oversight and false positives persist. Users often struggle to understand why emails are flagged as potentially fraudulent, risking the possibility of missing important communications or mistakenly trusting deceptive phishing emails. This study introduces ChatSpamDetector, a system that uses large language models (LLMs) to detect phishing emails. By converting email data into a prompt suitable for LLM analysis, the system provides a highly accurate determination of whether an email is phishing or not. Importantly, it offers detailed reasoning for its phishing determinations, assisting users in making informed decisions about how to handle suspicious emails. We conducted an evaluation using a comprehensive phishing email dataset and compared our system to several LLMs and baseline systems. We confirmed that our system using GPT-4 has superior detection capabilities with an accuracy of 99.70%. Advanced contextual interpretation by LLMs enables the identification of various phishing tactics and impersonations, making them a potentially powerful tool in the fight against email-based phishing threats.

### CLLMFS: A Contrastive Learning enhanced Large Language Model Framework   for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition
**Authors**: Yafeng Zhang, Zilan Yu, Yuang Huang, Jing Tang

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T04:44:05Z

**Summary**: Few-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER), the task of identifying named entities with only a limited amount of labeled data, has gained increasing significance in natural language processing. While existing methodologies have shown some effectiveness, such as enriching label semantics through various prompting modes or employing metric learning techniques, their performance exhibits limited robustness across diverse domains due to the lack of rich knowledge in their pre-trained models. To address this issue, we propose CLLMFS, a Contrastive Learning enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) Framework for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition, achieving promising results with limited training data. Considering the impact of LLM's internal representations on downstream tasks, CLLMFS integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and contrastive learning mechanisms specifically tailored for few-shot NER. By enhancing the model's internal representations, CLLMFS effectively improves both entity boundary awareness ability and entity recognition accuracy. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance improvements on F1-score ranging from 2.58\% to 97.74\% over existing best-performing methods across several recognized benchmarks. Furthermore, through cross-domain NER experiments conducted on multiple datasets, we have further validated the robust generalization capability of our method. Our code will be released in the near future.

### LIMP: Large Language Model Enhanced Intent-aware Mobility Prediction
**Authors**: Songwei Li, Jie Feng, Jiawei Chi, Xinyuan Hu, Xiaomeng Zhao, Fengli Xu

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T04:28:56Z

**Summary**: Human mobility prediction is essential for applications like urban planning and transportation management, yet it remains challenging due to the complex, often implicit, intentions behind human behavior. Existing models predominantly focus on spatiotemporal patterns, paying less attention to the underlying intentions that govern movements. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative research angle for integrating commonsense reasoning into mobility prediction. However, it is a non-trivial problem because LLMs are not natively built for mobility intention inference, and they also face scalability issues and integration difficulties with spatiotemporal models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel LIMP (LLMs for Intent-ware Mobility Prediction) framework. Specifically, LIMP introduces an "Analyze-Abstract-Infer" (A2I) agentic workflow to unleash LLM's commonsense reasoning power for mobility intention inference. Besides, we design an efficient fine-tuning scheme to transfer reasoning power from commercial LLM to smaller-scale, open-source language model, ensuring LIMP's scalability to millions of mobility records. Moreover, we propose a transformer-based intention-aware mobility prediction model to effectively harness the intention inference ability of LLM. Evaluated on two real-world datasets, LIMP significantly outperforms baseline models, demonstrating improved accuracy in next-location prediction and effective intention inference. The interpretability of intention-aware mobility prediction highlights our LIMP framework's potential for real-world applications. Codes and data can be found in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/LIMP .

### SAMBO-RL: Shifts-aware Model-based Offline Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Wang Luo, Haoran Li, Zicheng Zhang, Congying Han, Jiayu Lv, Tiande Guo

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T04:25:09Z

**Summary**: Model-based Offline Reinforcement Learning trains policies based on offline datasets and model dynamics, without direct real-world environment interactions. However, this method is inherently challenged by distribution shift. Previous approaches have primarily focused on tackling this issue directly leveraging off-policy mechanisms and heuristic uncertainty in model dynamics, but they resulted in inconsistent objectives and lacked a unified theoretical foundation. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis that disentangles the problem into two key components: model bias and policy shift. We provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence to demonstrate how these factors lead to inaccuracies in value function estimation and impose implicit restrictions on policy learning. To address these challenges, we derive adjustment terms for model bias and policy shift within a unified probabilistic inference framework. These adjustments are seamlessly integrated into the vanilla reward function to create a novel Shifts-aware Reward (SAR), aiming at refining value learning and facilitating policy training. Furthermore, we introduce Shifts-aware Model-based Offline Reinforcement Learning (SAMBO-RL), a practical framework that efficiently trains classifiers to approximate the SAR for policy optimization. Empirically, we show that SAR effectively mitigates distribution shift, and SAMBO-RL demonstrates superior performance across various benchmarks, underscoring its practical effectiveness and validating our theoretical analysis.

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T04:13:48Z

**Summary**: With the advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), LLM-driven visual agents are increasingly impacting software interfaces, particularly those with graphical user interfaces. This work introduces a novel LLM-based multimodal agent framework for mobile devices. This framework, capable of navigating mobile devices, emulates human-like interactions. Our agent constructs a flexible action space that enhances adaptability across various applications including parser, text and vision descriptions. The agent operates through two main phases: exploration and deployment. During the exploration phase, functionalities of user interface elements are documented either through agent-driven or manual explorations into a customized structured knowledge base. In the deployment phase, RAG technology enables efficient retrieval and update from this knowledge base, thereby empowering the agent to perform tasks effectively and accurately. This includes performing complex, multi-step operations across various applications, thereby demonstrating the framework's adaptability and precision in handling customized task workflows. Our experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate the framework's superior performance, confirming its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Our code will be open source soon.

### Instruction-Driven Game Engines on Large Language Models
**Authors**: Hongqiu Wu, Yan Wang, Xingyuan Liu, Hai Zhao, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T04:06:41Z

**Summary**: The Instruction-Driven Game Engine (IDGE) project aims to democratize game development by enabling a large language model (LLM) to follow free-form game rules and autonomously generate game-play processes. The IDGE allows users to create games by issuing simple natural language instructions, which significantly lowers the barrier for game development. We approach the learning process for IDGEs as a Next State Prediction task, wherein the model autoregressively predicts in-game states given player actions. It is a challenging task because the computation of in-game states must be precise; otherwise, slight errors could disrupt the game-play. To address this, we train the IDGE in a curriculum manner that progressively increases the model's exposure to complex scenarios. Our initial progress lies in developing an IDGE for Poker, a universally cherished card game. The engine we've designed not only supports a wide range of poker variants but also allows for high customization of rules through natural language inputs. Furthermore, it also favors rapid prototyping of new games from minimal samples, proposing an innovative paradigm in game development that relies on minimal prompt and data engineering. This work lays the groundwork for future advancements in instruction-driven game creation, potentially transforming how games are designed and played.

### Scaling Virtual World with Delta-Engine
**Authors**: Hongqiu Wu, Zekai Xu, Tianyang Xu, Jiale Hong, Weiqi Wu, Yan Wang, Hai Zhao, Min Zhang, Zhezhi He

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T03:57:24Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we focus on the \emph{virtual world}, a cyberspace where people can live in. An ideal virtual world shares great similarity with our real world. One of the crucial aspects is its evolving nature, reflected by individuals' capability to grow and thereby influence the objective world. Such dynamics is unpredictable and beyond the reach of existing systems. For this, we propose a special engine called \textbf{\emph{Delta-Engine}} to drive this virtual world. $\Delta$ associates the world's evolution to the engine's scalability. It consists of a base engine and a neural proxy. The base engine programs the prototype of the virtual world; given a trigger, the neural proxy generates new snippets on the base engine through \emph{incremental prediction}.   This paper presents a full-stack introduction to the delta-engine. The key feature of the delta-engine is its scalability to unknown elements within the world, Technically, it derives from the prefect co-work of the neural proxy and the base engine, and the alignment with high-quality data. We introduce an engine-oriented fine-tuning method that embeds the base engine into the proxy. We then discuss the human-LLM collaborative design to produce novel and interesting data efficiently. Eventually, we propose three evaluation principles to comprehensively assess the performance of a delta engine: naive evaluation, incremental evaluation, and adversarial evaluation.

**Summary**: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models (FMs) has generated heightened interest in their applications that integrate vision and language. This paper investigates the capabilities of ChatGPT-4V and Gemini Pro for Street View Imagery, Built Environment, and Interior by evaluating their performance across various tasks. The assessments include street furniture identification, pedestrian and car counts, and road width measurement in Street View Imagery; building function classification, building age analysis, building height analysis, and building structure classification in the Built Environment; and interior room classification, interior design style analysis, interior furniture counts, and interior length measurement in Interior. The results reveal proficiency in length measurement, style analysis, question answering, and basic image understanding, but highlight limitations in detailed recognition and counting tasks. While zero-shot learning shows potential, performance varies depending on the problem domains and image complexities. This study provides new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of multimodal foundation models for practical challenges in Street View Imagery, Built Environment, and Interior. Overall, the findings demonstrate foundational multimodal intelligence, emphasizing the potential of FMs to drive forward interdisciplinary applications at the intersection of computer vision and language.

However, creating commentary is a time-consuming task, even for skilled commentators. Large language models (LLMs) have simplified the process of natural language generation, but their direct application in commentary creation still faces challenges due to unique task requirements. These requirements can be categorized into two levels: 1) fundamental requirements, which include creating well-structured and logically consistent narratives, and 2) advanced requirements, which involve generating quality arguments and providing convincing evidence. In this paper, we introduce Xinyu, an efficient LLM-based system designed to assist commentators in generating Chinese commentaries. To meet the fundamental requirements, we deconstruct the generation process into sequential steps, proposing targeted strategies and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for each step. To address the advanced requirements, we present an argument ranking model for arguments and establish a comprehensive evidence database that includes up-to-date events and classic books, thereby strengthening the substantiation of the evidence with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technology. To evaluate the generated commentaries more fairly, corresponding to the two-level requirements, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation metric that considers five distinct perspectives in commentary generation. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed system. We also observe a significant increase in the efficiency of commentators in real-world scenarios, with the average time spent on creating a commentary dropping from 4 hours to 20 minutes. Importantly, such an increase in efficiency does not compromise the quality of the commentaries.

### The Best of Both Worlds: Toward an Honest and Helpful Large Language   Model
**Authors**: Chujie Gao, Qihui Zhang, Dongping Chen, Yue Huang, Siyuan Wu, Zhengyan Fu, Yao Wan, Xiangliang Zhang, Lichao Sun

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T03:39:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various industries due to their exceptional generative capabilities. However, for safe and effective real-world deployments, ensuring honesty and helpfulness is critical. This paper addresses the question: Can we prioritize the helpfulness of LLMs while preserving their honesty? To begin with, we establish exhaustive principles aimed at guaranteeing the honesty of LLM. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset, referred to as HoneSet, comprising 930 queries spanning six categories meticulously crafted to assess an LLM's capacity for maintaining honesty. Subsequently, we present two approaches to augmenting honesty and helpfulness in LLMs: a training-free enhancement and a fine-tuning-based improvement. The training-free approach, which is based on curiosity-driven prompting, empowers LLMs to articulate internal confusion and uncertainty regarding queries, thereby optimizing their responses. Conversely, the fine-tuning-based method employs a two-stage process inspired by curriculum learning: initially instructing LLMs to discern between honest and dishonest responses, then refining their training to enhance helpfulness. Experiments conducted on nine prominent LLMs demonstrate a significant improvement in alignment with honesty across all models through the implementation of our proposed enhancements. Particularly noteworthy is the 65.3% enhancement observed in Llama3-8b and the remarkable 124.7% improvement in Mistral-7b, as measured by the H$^{2}$ (honest and helpful) assessment. We believe that our work can pave the way for developing more trustworthy LLMs for real-world applications.

### Grounding Fallacies Misrepresenting Scientific Publications in Evidence
**Authors**: Max Glockner, Yufang Hou, Preslav Nakov, Iryna Gurevych

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T03:16:26Z

**Summary**: Health-related misinformation claims often falsely cite a credible biomedical publication as evidence, which superficially appears to support the false claim. The publication does not really support the claim, but a reader could believe it thanks to the use of logical fallacies. Here, we aim to detect and to highlight such fallacies, which requires carefully assessing the exact content of the misrepresented publications. To achieve this, we introduce MissciPlus, an extension of the fallacy detection dataset Missci. MissciPlus builds on Missci by grounding the applied fallacies in real-world passages from misrepresented studies. This creates a realistic test-bed for detecting and verbalizing these fallacies under real-world input conditions, and enables novel passage-retrieval tasks. MissciPlus is the first logical fallacy dataset which pairs the real-world misrepresented evidence with incorrect claims, identical to the input to evidence-based fact-checking models. With MissciPlus, we i) benchmark retrieval models in identifying passages that support claims only when fallacies are applied, ii) evaluate how well LLMs articulate fallacious reasoning from misrepresented scientific passages, and iii) assess the effectiveness of fact-checking models in refuting claims that misrepresent biomedical research. Our findings show that current fact-checking models struggle to use relevant passages from misrepresented publications to refute misinformation. Moreover, these passages can mislead LLMs into accepting false claims as true.

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T02:56:13Z

**Summary**: In an era where digital threats are increasingly sophisticated, the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and cybersecurity presents both promising defenses and potent dangers. This paper delves into the escalating threat posed by the misuse of AI, specifically through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). This study details various techniques like the switch method and character play method, which can be exploited by cybercriminals to generate and automate cyber attacks. Through a series of controlled experiments, the paper demonstrates how these models can be manipulated to bypass ethical and privacy safeguards to effectively generate cyber attacks such as social engineering, malicious code, payload generation, and spyware. By testing these AI generated attacks on live systems, the study assesses their effectiveness and the vulnerabilities they exploit, offering a practical perspective on the risks AI poses to critical infrastructure. We also introduce Occupy AI, a customized, finetuned LLM specifically engineered to automate and execute cyberattacks. This specialized AI driven tool is adept at crafting steps and generating executable code for a variety of cyber threats, including phishing, malware injection, and system exploitation. The results underscore the urgency for ethical AI practices, robust cybersecurity measures, and regulatory oversight to mitigate AI related threats. This paper aims to elevate awareness within the cybersecurity community about the evolving digital threat landscape, advocating for proactive defense strategies and responsible AI development to protect against emerging cyber threats.

### Multi-Treatment Multi-Task Uplift Modeling for Enhancing User Growth
**Authors**: Yuxiang Wei, Zhaoxin Qiu, Yingjie Li, Yuke Sun, Xiaoling Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T02:44:08Z

**Summary**: As a key component in boosting online user growth, uplift modeling aims to measure individual user responses (e.g., whether to play the game) to various treatments, such as gaming bonuses, thereby enhancing business outcomes. However, previous research typically considers a single-task, single-treatment setting, where only one treatment exists and the overall treatment effect is measured by a single type of user response. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Treatment Multi-Task (MTMT) uplift network to estimate treatment effects in a multi-task scenario. We identify the multi-treatment problem as a causal inference problem with a tiered response, comprising a base effect (from offering a treatment) and an incremental effect (from offering a specific type of treatment), where the base effect can be numerically much larger than the incremental effect. Specifically, MTMT separately encodes user features and treatments. The user feature encoder uses a multi-gate mixture of experts (MMOE) network to encode relevant user features, explicitly learning inter-task relations. The resultant embeddings are used to measure natural responses per task. Furthermore, we introduce a treatment-user feature interaction module to model correlations between each treatment and user feature. Consequently, we separately measure the base and incremental treatment effect for each task based on the produced treatment-aware representations. Experimental results based on an offline public dataset and an online proprietary dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MTMT in single/multi-treatment and single/multi-task settings. Additionally, MTMT has been deployed in our gaming platform to improve user experience.

### Flexible max-stable processes for fast and efficient inference
**Authors**: Peng Zhong, Scott A. Sisson, Boris Beranger

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T02:29:15Z

**Summary**: Max-stable processes serve as the fundamental distributional family in extreme value theory. However, likelihood-based inference methods for max-stable processes still heavily rely on composite likelihoods, rendering them intractable in high dimensions due to their intractable densities. In this paper, we introduce a fast and efficient inference method for max-stable processes based on their angular densities for a class of max-stable processes whose angular densities do not put mass on the boundary space of the simplex. This class can also be used to construct r-Pareto processes. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method through two new max-stable processes: the truncated extremal-t process and the skewed Brown-Resnick process. The skewed Brown-Resnick process contains the popular Brown-Resnick model as a special case and possesses nonstationary extremal dependence structures. The proposed method is shown to be computationally efficient and can be applied to large datasets. We showcase the new max-stable processes on simulated and real data.

**Authors**: Yige Li, Hanxun Huang, Yunhan Zhao, Xingjun Ma, Jun Sun

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T02:21:21Z

**Summary**: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides across various tasks, but they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where specific triggers in the prompt cause the LLM to generate adversary-desired responses. While most backdoor research has focused on vision or text classification tasks, backdoor attacks in text generation have been largely overlooked. In this work, we introduce \textit{BackdoorLLM}, the first comprehensive benchmark for studying backdoor attacks on LLMs. \textit{BackdoorLLM} features: 1) a repository of backdoor benchmarks with a standardized training pipeline, 2) diverse attack strategies, including data poisoning, weight poisoning, hidden state attacks, and chain-of-thought attacks, 3) extensive evaluations with over 200 experiments on 8 attacks across 7 scenarios and 6 model architectures, and 4) key insights into the effectiveness and limitations of backdoors in LLMs. We hope \textit{BackdoorLLM} will raise awareness of backdoor threats and contribute to advancing AI safety. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/bboylyg/BackdoorLLM}.

### Can Large Language Models Automatically Jailbreak GPT-4V?
**Authors**: Yuanwei Wu, Yue Huang, Yixin Liu, Xiang Li, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T01:52:10Z

**Summary**: GPT-4V has attracted considerable attention due to its extraordinary capacity for integrating and processing multimodal information. At the same time, its ability of face recognition raises new safety concerns of privacy leakage. Despite researchers' efforts in safety alignment through RLHF or preprocessing filters, vulnerabilities might still be exploited. In our study, we introduce AutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt optimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to refine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning prompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method that incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token expenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly surpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 95.3\%. This research sheds light on strengthening GPT-4V security, underscoring the potential for LLMs to be exploited in compromising GPT-4V integrity.

### Context-Aware Temporal Embedding of Objects in Video Data
**Authors**: Ahnaf Farhan, M. Shahriar Hossain

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T01:44:10Z

**Summary**: In video analysis, understanding the temporal context is crucial for recognizing object interactions, event patterns, and contextual changes over time. The proposed model leverages adjacency and semantic similarities between objects from neighboring video frames to construct context-aware temporal object embeddings. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on visual appearance, our temporal embedding model considers the contextual relationships between objects, creating a meaningful embedding space where temporally connected object's vectors are positioned in proximity. Empirical studies demonstrate that our context-aware temporal embeddings can be used in conjunction with conventional visual embeddings to enhance the effectiveness of downstream applications. Moreover, the embeddings can be used to narrate a video using a Large Language Model (LLM). This paper describes the intricate details of the proposed objective function to generate context-aware temporal object embeddings for video data and showcases the potential applications of the generated embeddings in video analysis and object classification tasks.

**Authors**: Qinbin Li, Junyuan Hong, Chulin Xie, Jeffrey Tan, Rachel Xin, Junyi Hou, Xavier Yin, Zhun Wang, Dan Hendrycks, Zhangyang Wang, Bo Li, Bingsheng He, Dawn Song

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T01:37:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to numerous domains, significantly advancing applications in data management, mining, and analysis. Their profound capabilities in processing and interpreting complex language data, however, bring to light pressing concerns regarding data privacy, especially the risk of unintentional training data leakage. Despite the critical nature of this issue, there has been no existing literature to offer a comprehensive assessment of data privacy risks in LLMs. Addressing this gap, our paper introduces LLM-PBE, a toolkit crafted specifically for the systematic evaluation of data privacy risks in LLMs. LLM-PBE is designed to analyze privacy across the entire lifecycle of LLMs, incorporating diverse attack and defense strategies, and handling various data types and metrics. Through detailed experimentation with multiple LLMs, LLM-PBE facilitates an in-depth exploration of data privacy concerns, shedding light on influential factors such as model size, data characteristics, and evolving temporal dimensions. This study not only enriches the understanding of privacy issues in LLMs but also serves as a vital resource for future research in the field. Aimed at enhancing the breadth of knowledge in this area, the findings, resources, and our full technical report are made available at https://llm-pbe.github.io/, providing an open platform for academic and practical advancements in LLM privacy assessment.

**Authors**: Shenglin Zhang, Pengtian Zhu, Minghua Ma, Jiagang Wang, Yongqian Sun, Dongwen Li, Jingyu Wang, Qianying Guo, Xiaolei Hua, Lin Zhu, Dan Pei

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T01:25:26Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general question-answering (Q&A) but often fall short in specialized domains due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge. Commercial companies face the dual challenges of privacy protection and resource constraints when involving LLMs for fine-tuning. This paper propose a novel framework, Self-Evolution, designed to address these issues by leveraging lightweight open-source LLMs through multiple iterative fine-tuning rounds. To enhance the efficiency of iterative fine-tuning, Self-Evolution employ a strategy that filters and reinforces the knowledge with higher value during the iterative process. We employed Self-Evolution on Qwen1.5-7B-Chat using 4,000 documents containing rich domain knowledge from China Mobile, achieving a performance score 174% higher on domain-specific question-answering evaluations than Qwen1.5-7B-Chat and even 22% higher than Qwen1.5-72B-Chat. Self-Evolution has been deployed in China Mobile's daily operation and maintenance for 117 days, and it improves the efficiency of locating alarms, fixing problems, and finding related reports, with an average efficiency improvement of over 18.6%. In addition, we release Self-Evolution framework code in https://github.com/Zero-Pointer/Self-Evolution.

### ABQ-LLM: Arbitrary-Bit Quantized Inference Acceleration for Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Chao Zeng, Songwei Liu, Yusheng Xie, Hong Liu, Xiaojian Wang, Miao Wei, Shu Yang, Fangmin Chen, Xing Mei

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T01:09:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, their practical application is constrained by substantial memory and computational demands. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is considered an effective method to accelerate LLM inference. Despite its growing popularity in LLM model compression, PTQ deployment faces two major challenges. First, low-bit quantization leads to performance degradation. Second, restricted by the limited integer computing unit type on GPUs, quantized matrix operations with different precisions cannot be effectively accelerated. To address these issues, we introduce a novel arbitrary-bit quantization algorithm and inference framework, ABQ-LLM. It achieves superior performance across various quantization settings and enables efficient arbitrary-precision quantized inference on the GPU. ABQ-LLM introduces several key innovations: (1) a distribution correction method for transformer blocks to mitigate distribution differences caused by full quantization of weights and activations, improving performance at low bit-widths. (2) the bit balance strategy to counteract performance degradation from asymmetric distribution issues at very low bit-widths (e.g., 2-bit). (3) an innovative quantization acceleration framework that reconstructs the quantization matrix multiplication of arbitrary precision combinations based on BTC (Binary TensorCore) equivalents, gets rid of the limitations of INT4/INT8 computing units. ABQ-LLM can convert each component bit width gain into actual acceleration gain, maximizing performance under mixed precision(e.g., W6A6, W2A8). Based on W2*A8 quantization configuration on LLaMA-7B model, it achieved a WikiText2 perplexity of 7.59 (2.17$\downarrow $ vs 9.76 in AffineQuant). Compared to SmoothQuant, we realized 1.6$\times$ acceleration improvement and 2.7$\times$ memory compression gain.

### Rational Sensibility: LLM Enhanced Empathetic Response Generation Guided   by Self-presentation Theory
**Authors**: Linzhuang Sun, Yao Dong, Nan Xu, Jingxuan Wei, Bihui Yu, Yin Luo

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T01:03:13Z

**Summary**: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) provides human-centered Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) with a glimmer of hope. Empathy serves as a key emotional attribute of humanity, playing an irreplaceable role in human-centered AGI. Despite numerous researches aim to improve the cognitive empathy of models by incorporating external knowledge, there has been limited attention on the sensibility and rationality of the conversation itself, which are vital components of the empathy. However, the rationality information within the conversation is restricted, and previous methods of extending knowledge are subject to semantic conflict and single-role view. In this paper, we design an innovative encoder module inspired by self-presentation theory in sociology, which specifically processes sensibility and rationality sentences in dialogues. And we employ a LLM as a rational brain to decipher profound logical information preserved within the conversation, which assists our model in assessing the balance between sensibility and rationality to produce high-quality empathetic response. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms other methods in both automatic and human evaluations.

### Quality or Quantity? On Data Scale and Diversity in Adapting Large   Language Models for Low-Resource Translation
**Authors**: Vivek Iyer, Bhavitvya Malik, Pavel Stepachev, Pinzhen Chen, Barry Haddow, Alexandra Birch

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T00:59:38Z

**Summary**: Despite the recent popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Machine Translation (MT), their performance in low-resource translation still lags significantly behind Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models. In this paper, we explore what it would take to adapt LLMs for low-resource settings. In particular, we re-examine the role of two factors: a) the importance and application of parallel data, and b) diversity in Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Recently, parallel data has been shown to be less important for MT using LLMs than in previous MT research. Similarly, diversity during SFT has been shown to promote significant transfer in LLMs across languages and tasks. However, for low-resource LLM-MT, we show that the opposite is true for both of these considerations: a) parallel data is critical during both pretraining and SFT, and b) diversity tends to cause interference, not transfer. Our experiments, conducted with 3 LLMs across 2 low-resourced language groups - indigenous American and North-East Indian - reveal consistent patterns in both cases, underscoring the generalizability of our findings. We believe these insights will be valuable for scaling to massively multilingual LLM-MT models that can effectively serve lower-resource languages.

### Investigating LLM Applications in E-Commerce
**Authors**: Chester Palen-Michel, Ruixiang Wang, Yipeng Zhang, David Yu, Canran Xu, Zhe Wu

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T00:57:37Z

**Summary**: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing in various applications especially in e-commerce. One crucial step before the application of such LLMs in these fields is to understand and compare the performance in different use cases in such tasks. This paper explored the efficacy of LLMs in the e-commerce domain, focusing on instruction-tuning an open source LLM model with public e-commerce datasets of varying sizes and comparing the performance with the conventional models prevalent in industrial applications. We conducted a comprehensive comparison between LLMs and traditional pre-trained language models across specific tasks intrinsic to the e-commerce domain, namely classification, generation, summarization, and named entity recognition (NER). Furthermore, we examined the effectiveness of the current niche industrial application of very large LLM, using in-context learning, in e-commerce specific tasks. Our findings indicate that few-shot inference with very large LLMs often does not outperform fine-tuning smaller pre-trained models, underscoring the importance of task-specific model optimization.Additionally, we investigated different training methodologies such as single-task training, mixed-task training, and LoRA merging both within domain/tasks and between different tasks. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, this paper offers valuable insights into the potential effectiveness of LLMs to advance natural language processing capabilities within the e-commerce industry.

### Effect of the spatial curvature on light bending and time delay in   curved Einstein-Straus--de Sitter spacetime
**Authors**: Mourad Guenouche

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T00:55:56Z

**Summary**: A method of general applicability has been developed, whereby the null geodesic equations of the Einstein-Straus-de Sitter metric can be integrated simultaneously in terms of the curvature constant $k$. The purpose is to generalize the computation of light deflection and time delay by a spherical mass distribution. Assuming a flat Universe with most recent measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, five time delays between the four bright images of the lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112 have been forecasted and compared to others in the field. In addition, we have reviewed the question of the possible contribution of a positive $\Lambda$ to reduce the light bending, and concluded that the changes are seemingly too small to be appreciable on cosmological scales. The same conclusion has been reached regarding the time delay. Having addressed the question of the effect of the spatial curvature in both closed and open Universe, we have found that the strong lensing is slightly affected by the expected small curvature density $\Omega_{k0}$ of the current Universe within its error bar $|\Omega_{k0}|\lessapprox 0.001$, in such a way that it may safely be neglected. However, it's only if $\Omega_{k0}$ gets quite larger that the effect being noticeable. While it is only theoretically possible for $\Omega_{k0}$ to be higher, it's worthwhile to stress that this should impact the light bending and time delay, causing them to decrease or increase depending upon whether the spatial curvature is positive or negative. Furthermore, one can infer that the observed light deflection and time delay independently, that are found to be significantly deviated from those of the flat Universe, may serve as a useful means to provide constraints on $\Omega _{k0}$, thus making the approach employed in this work more promising than others.

### Environment-Centric Active Inference
**Authors**: Kanako Esaki, Tadayuki Matsumura, Takeshi Kato, Shunsuke Minusa, Yang Shao, Hiroyuki Mizuno

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T00:54:28Z

**Summary**: To handle unintended changes in the environment by agents, we propose an environment-centric active inference EC-AIF in which the Markov Blanket of active inference is defined starting from the environment. In normal active inference, the Markov Blanket is defined starting from the agent. That is, first the agent was defined as the entity that performs the "action" such as a robot or a person, then the environment was defined as other people or objects that are directly affected by the agent's "action," and the boundary between the agent and the environment was defined as the Markov Blanket. This agent-centric definition does not allow the agent to respond to unintended changes in the environment caused by factors outside of the defined environment. In the proposed EC-AIF, there is no entity corresponding to an agent. The environment includes all observable things, including people and things conventionally considered to be the environment, as well as entities that perform "actions" such as robots and people. Accordingly, all states, including robots and people, are included in inference targets, eliminating unintended changes in the environment. The EC-AIF was applied to a robot arm and validated with an object transport task by the robot arm. The results showed that the robot arm successfully transported objects while responding to changes in the target position of the object and to changes in the orientation of another robot arm.

**Summary**: Advancements in chip design and manufacturing have enabled the processing of complex tasks such as deep learning and natural language processing, paving the way for the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). AI, on the other hand, can be leveraged to innovate and streamline semiconductor technology from planning and implementation to manufacturing. In this paper, we present \textit{Intelligent OPC Engineer Assistant}, an AI/LLM-powered methodology designed to solve the core manufacturing-aware optimization problem known as optical proximity correction (OPC). The methodology involves a reinforcement learning-based OPC recipe search and a customized multi-modal agent system for recipe summarization. Experiments demonstrate that our methodology can efficiently build OPC recipes on various chip designs with specially handled design topologies, a task that typically requires the full-time effort of OPC engineers with years of experience.

### Fixed-b Asymptotics for Panel Models with Two-Way Clustering
**Authors**: Kaicheng Chen, Timothy J. Vogelsang

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T00:31:17Z

**Summary**: This paper studies a cluster robust variance estimator proposed by Chiang, Hansen and Sasaki (2024) for linear panels. First, we show algebraically that this variance estimator (CHS estimator, hereafter) is a linear combination of three common variance estimators: the one-way unit cluster estimator, the "HAC of averages" estimator, and the "average of HACs" estimator. Based on this finding, we obtain a fixed-$b$ asymptotic result for the CHS estimator and corresponding test statistics as the cross-section and time sample sizes jointly go to infinity. Furthermore, we propose two simple bias-corrected versions of the variance estimator and derive the fixed-$b$ limits. In a simulation study, we find that the two bias-corrected variance estimators along with fixed-$b$ critical values provide improvements in finite sample coverage probabilities. We illustrate the impact of bias-correction and use of the fixed-$b$ critical values on inference in an empirical example on the relationship between industry profitability and market concentration.

### A Survey on Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Yizheng Huang, Jimmy Huang

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T00:17:02Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) merges retrieval methods with deep learning advancements to address the static limitations of large language models (LLMs) by enabling the dynamic integration of up-to-date external information. This methodology, focusing primarily on the text domain, provides a cost-effective solution to the generation of plausible but possibly incorrect responses by LLMs, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of their outputs through the use of real-world data. As RAG grows in complexity and incorporates multiple concepts that can influence its performance, this paper organizes the RAG paradigm into four categories: pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation, offering a detailed perspective from the retrieval viewpoint. It outlines RAG's evolution and discusses the field's progression through the analysis of significant studies. Additionally, the paper introduces evaluation methods for RAG, addressing the challenges faced and proposing future research directions.

**Authors**: Siyuan Wu, Yue Huang, Chujie Gao, Dongping Chen, Qihui Zhang, Yao Wan, Tianyi Zhou, Xiangliang Zhang, Jianfeng Gao, Chaowei Xiao, Lichao Sun

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T00:14:51Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama3 have significantly impacted various fields by enabling high-quality synthetic data generation and reducing dependence on expensive human-generated datasets. Despite this, challenges remain in the areas of generalization, controllability, diversity, and truthfulness within the existing generative frameworks. To address these challenges, this paper presents UniGen, a comprehensive LLM-powered framework designed to produce diverse, accurate, and highly controllable datasets. UniGen is adaptable, supporting all types of text datasets and enhancing the generative process through innovative mechanisms. To augment data diversity, UniGen incorporates an attribute-guided generation module and a group checking feature. For accuracy, it employs a code-based mathematical assessment for label verification alongside a retrieval-augmented generation technique for factual validation. The framework also allows for user-specified constraints, enabling customization of the data generation process to suit particular requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior quality of data generated by UniGen, and each module within UniGen plays a critical role in this enhancement. Additionally, UniGen is applied in two practical scenarios: benchmarking LLMs and data augmentation. The results indicate that UniGen effectively supports dynamic and evolving benchmarking, and that data augmentation improves LLM capabilities in various domains, including agent-oriented abilities and reasoning skills.

 ### MME-RealWorld: Could Your Multimodal LLM Challenge High-Resolution   Real-World Scenarios that are Difficult for Humans?
**Authors**: Yi-Fan Zhang, Huanyu Zhang, Haochen Tian, Chaoyou Fu, Shuangqing Zhang, Junfei Wu, Feng Li, Kun Wang, Qingsong Wen, Zhang Zhang, Liang Wang, Rong Jin, Tieniu Tan

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:59:51Z

**Summary**: Comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has recently garnered widespread attention in the research community. However, we observe that existing benchmarks present several common barriers that make it difficult to measure the significant challenges that models face in the real world, including: 1) small data scale leads to a large performance variance; 2) reliance on model-based annotations results in restricted data quality; 3) insufficient task difficulty, especially caused by the limited image resolution. To tackle these issues, we introduce MME-RealWorld. Specifically, we collect more than $300$K images from public datasets and the Internet, filtering $13,366$ high-quality images for annotation. This involves the efforts of professional $25$ annotators and $7$ experts in MLLMs, contributing to $29,429$ question-answer pairs that cover $43$ subtasks across $5$ real-world scenarios, extremely challenging even for humans. As far as we know, MME-RealWorld is the largest manually annotated benchmark to date, featuring the highest resolution and a targeted focus on real-world applications. We further conduct a thorough evaluation involving $28$ prominent MLLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our results show that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where none of them reach $60\%$ accuracy. The challenges of perceiving high-resolution images and understanding complex real-world scenarios remain urgent issues to be addressed. The data and evaluation code are released at https://mme-realworld.github.io/ .

### Search-Adaptor: Embedding Customization for Information Retrieval
**Authors**: Jinsung Yoon, Sercan O Arik, Yanfei Chen, Tomas Pfister

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:55:12Z

**Summary**: Embeddings extracted by pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant potential to improve information retrieval and search. Beyond the zero-shot setup in which they are being conventionally used, being able to take advantage of the information from the relevant query-corpus paired data can further boost the LLM capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Search-Adaptor, for customizing LLMs for information retrieval in an efficient and robust way. Search-Adaptor modifies the embeddings generated by pre-trained LLMs, and can be integrated with any LLM, including those only available via prediction APIs. On multiple English, multilingual, and multimodal retrieval datasets, we show consistent and significant performance benefits for Search-Adaptor -- e.g., more than 5% improvements for Google Embedding APIs in nDCG@10 averaged over 14 BEIR datasets.

### MagicDec: Breaking the Latency-Throughput Tradeoff for Long Context   Generation with Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Jian Chen, Vashisth Tiwari, Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Zhuoming Chen, Jinyuan Shi, Ian En-Hsu Yen, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:54:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency without sacrificing performance but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy speculative decoding more effectively for high throughput inference. Then, it leverages draft models with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck that scales with both sequence length and batch size. This finding underscores the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2x speedup for LLaMA-2-7B-32K and 1.84x speedup for LLaMA-3.1-8B when serving batch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/MagicDec/.

### Re-evaluation of Face Anti-spoofing Algorithm in Post COVID-19 Era Using   Mask Based Occlusion Attack
**Authors**: Vaibhav Sundharam, Abhijit Sarkar, A. Lynn Abbott

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:48:22Z

**Summary**: Face anti-spoofing algorithms play a pivotal role in the robust deployment of face recognition systems against presentation attacks. Conventionally, full facial images are required by such systems to correctly authenticate individuals, but the widespread requirement of masks due to the current COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges for these biometric authentication systems. Hence, in this work, we investigate the performance of presentation attack detection (PAD) algorithms under synthetic facial occlusions using masks and glasses. We have used five variants of masks to cover the lower part of the face with varying coverage areas (low-coverage, medium-coverage, high-coverage, round coverage), and 3D cues. We have also used different variants of glasses that cover the upper part of the face. We systematically tested the performance of four PAD algorithms under these occlusion attacks using a benchmark dataset. We have specifically looked at four different baseline PAD algorithms that focus on, texture, image quality, frame difference/motion, and abstract features through a convolutional neural network (CNN). Additionally we have introduced a new hybrid model that uses CNN and local binary pattern textures. Our experiment shows that adding the occlusions significantly degrades the performance of all of the PAD algorithms. Our results show the vulnerability of face anti-spoofing algorithms with occlusions, which could be in the usage of such algorithms in the post-pandemic era.

### Data Exposure from LLM Apps: An In-depth Investigation of OpenAI's GPTs
**Authors**: Evin Jaff, Yuhao Wu, Ning Zhang, Umar Iqbal

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:42:06Z

**Summary**: LLM app ecosystems are quickly maturing and supporting a wide range of use cases, which requires them to collect excessive user data. Given that the LLM apps are developed by third-parties and that anecdotal evidence suggests LLM platforms currently do not strictly enforce their policies, user data shared with arbitrary third-parties poses a significant privacy risk. In this paper we aim to bring transparency in data practices of LLM apps. As a case study, we study OpenAI's GPT app ecosystem. We develop an LLM-based framework to conduct the static analysis of natural language-based source code of GPTs and their Actions (external services) to characterize their data collection practices. Our findings indicate that Actions collect expansive data about users, including sensitive information prohibited by OpenAI, such as passwords. We find that some Actions, including related to advertising and analytics, are embedded in multiple GPTs, which allow them to track user activities across GPTs. Additionally, co-occurrence of Actions exposes as much as 9.5x more data to them, than it is exposed to individual Actions. Lastly, we develop an LLM-based privacy policy analysis framework to automatically check the consistency of data collection by Actions with disclosures in their privacy policies. Our measurements indicate that the disclosures for most of the collected data types are omitted in privacy policies, with only 5.8% of Actions clearly disclosing their data collection practices.

### Impacts of floating-point non-associativity on reproducibility for HPC   and deep learning applications
**Authors**: Sanjif Shanmugavelu, Mathieu Taillefumier, Christopher Culver, Oscar Hernandez, Mark Coletti, Ada Sedova

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:40:15Z

**Summary**: Run-by-run variability in parallel programs caused by floating-point non-associativity (FPNA) has been known to significantly affect reproducibility in iterative algorithms, due to accumulating errors. Non-reproducibility negatively affects efficiency and effectiveness of correctness testing for stochastic programs. Recently, the sensitivity of deep learning (DL) training and inference pipelines to FPNA have been found to be extreme, and can prevent certification for commercial applications, accurate assessment of robustness and sensitivity, and bug detection. New approaches in scientific computing applications have coupled DL models with high-performance computing (HPC) simulations, leading to an aggravation of debugging and testing challenges. Here we perform an investigation of the statistical properties of FPNA within modern parallel programming models, analyze performance and productivity impacts of replacing atomic operations with deterministic alternatives on GPUs, and examine the recently-added deterministic options within the PyTorch framework within the context of GPU deployment, uncovering and quantifying the impacts of input parameters triggering run-by-run variability and reporting on the reliability and completeness of the documentation. Finally, we evaluate the strategy of exploiting automatic determinism provided by deterministic hardware, using the Groq LPU$^{TM}$ accelerator for inference portions of the DL pipeline. We demonstrate the benefits that this strategy can provide within reproducibility and correctness efforts.

### Multi-Layer Transformers Gradient Can be Approximated in Almost Linear   Time
**Authors**: Yingyu Liang, Zhizhou Sha, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Yufa Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:16:43Z

**Summary**: The quadratic computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism of popular transformer architectures poses significant challenges for training and inference, particularly in terms of efficiency and memory requirements. Towards addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a novel fast computation method for gradient calculation in multi-layer transformer models. Our approach enables the computation of gradients for the entire multi-layer transformer model in almost linear time $n^{1+o(1)}$, where $n$ is the input sequence length. This breakthrough significantly reduces the computational bottleneck associated with the traditional quadratic time complexity. Our theory holds for any loss function and maintains a bounded approximation error across the entire model. Furthermore, our analysis can hold when the multi-layer transformer model contains many practical sub-modules, such as residual connection, casual mask, and multi-head attention. By improving the efficiency of gradient computation in large language models, we hope that our work will facilitate the more effective training and deployment of long-context language models based on our theoretical results.

### Ancient Wisdom, Modern Tools: Exploring Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for   Ancient Indian Philosophy
**Authors**: Priyanka Mandikal

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:15:39Z

**Summary**: LLMs have revolutionized the landscape of information retrieval and knowledge dissemination. However, their application in specialized areas is often hindered by factual inaccuracies and hallucinations, especially in long-tail knowledge distributions. We explore the potential of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models for long-form question answering (LFQA) in a specialized knowledge domain. We present VedantaNY-10M, a dataset curated from extensive public discourses on the ancient Indian philosophy of Advaita Vedanta. We develop and benchmark a RAG model against a standard, non-RAG LLM, focusing on transcription, retrieval, and generation performance. Human evaluations by computational linguists and domain experts show that the RAG model significantly outperforms the standard model in producing factual and comprehensive responses having fewer hallucinations. In addition, a keyword-based hybrid retriever that emphasizes unique low-frequency terms further improves results. Our study provides insights into effectively integrating modern large language models with ancient knowledge systems. Project page with dataset and code: https://sites.google.com/view/vedantany-10m

### Towards Fine-Grained Citation Evaluation in Generated Text: A   Comparative Analysis of Faithfulness Metrics
**Authors**: Weijia Zhang, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Yifei Yuan, Jiahuan Pei, Jia-Hong Huang, Evangelos Kanoulas

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:04:38Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often produce unsupported or unverifiable content, known as "hallucinations." To mitigate this, retrieval-augmented LLMs incorporate citations, grounding the content in verifiable sources. Despite such developments, manually assessing how well a citation supports the associated statement remains a major challenge. Previous studies use faithfulness metrics to estimate citation support automatically but are limited to binary classification, overlooking fine-grained citation support in practical scenarios. To investigate the effectiveness of faithfulness metrics in fine-grained scenarios, we propose a comparative evaluation framework that assesses the metric effectiveness in distinguishing citations between three-category support levels: full, partial, and no support. Our framework employs correlation analysis, classification evaluation, and retrieval evaluation to measure the alignment between metric scores and human judgments comprehensively. Our results show no single metric consistently excels across all evaluations, revealing the complexity of assessing fine-grained support. Based on the findings, we provide practical recommendations for developing more effective metrics.

### End-To-End Causal Effect Estimation from Unstructured Natural Language   Data
**Authors**: Nikita Dhawan, Leonardo Cotta, Karen Ullrich, Rahul G. Krishnan, Chris J. Maddison

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T16:41:47Z

**Summary**: Knowing the effect of an intervention is critical for human decision-making, but current approaches for causal effect estimation rely on manual data collection and structuring, regardless of the causal assumptions. This increases both the cost and time-to-completion for studies. We show how large, diverse observational text data can be mined with large language models (LLMs) to produce inexpensive causal effect estimates under appropriate causal assumptions. We introduce NATURAL, a novel family of causal effect estimators built with LLMs that operate over datasets of unstructured text. Our estimators use LLM conditional distributions (over variables of interest, given the text data) to assist in the computation of classical estimators of causal effect. We overcome a number of technical challenges to realize this idea, such as automating data curation and using LLMs to impute missing information. We prepare six (two synthetic and four real) observational datasets, paired with corresponding ground truth in the form of randomized trials, which we used to systematically evaluate each step of our pipeline. NATURAL estimators demonstrate remarkable performance, yielding causal effect estimates that fall within 3 percentage points of their ground truth counterparts, including on real-world Phase 3/4 clinical trials. Our results suggest that unstructured text data is a rich source of causal effect information, and NATURAL is a first step towards an automated pipeline to tap this resource.

### DOMAINEVAL: An Auto-Constructed Benchmark for Multi-Domain Code   Generation
**Authors**: Qiming Zhu, Jialun Cao, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Le Sun, Shing-Chi Cheung

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T16:33:58Z

**Summary**: Code benchmarks such as HumanEval are widely adopted to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses. However, current benchmarks primarily exercise LLMs' capability on common coding tasks (e.g., bubble sort, greatest common divisor), leaving domain-specific coding tasks (e.g., computation, system, cryptography) unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-domain code benchmark, DOMAINEVAL, designed to evaluate LLMs' coding capabilities thoroughly. Our pipeline works in a fully automated manner, enabling a push-bottom construction from code repositories into formatted subjects under study. Interesting findings are observed by evaluating 12 representative LLMs against DOMAINEVAL. We notice that LLMs are generally good at computation tasks while falling short on cryptography and system coding tasks. The performance gap can be as much as 68.94% (80.94% - 12.0%) in some LLMs. We also observe that generating more samples can increase the overall performance of LLMs, while the domain bias may even increase. The contributions of this study include a code generation benchmark dataset DOMAINEVAL, encompassing six popular domains, a fully automated pipeline for constructing code benchmarks, and an identification of the limitations of LLMs in code generation tasks based on their performance on DOMAINEVAL, providing directions for future research improvements. The leaderboard is available at https://domaineval.github.io/.

### Advancing Voice Cloning for Nepali: Leveraging Transfer Learning in a   Low-Resource Language
**Authors**: Manjil Karki, Pratik Shakya, Sandesh Acharya, Ravi Pandit, Dinesh Gothe

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T16:15:30Z

**Summary**: Voice cloning is a prominent feature in personalized speech interfaces. A neural vocal cloning system can mimic someone's voice using just a few audio samples. Both speaker encoding and speaker adaptation are topics of research in the field of voice cloning. Speaker adaptation relies on fine-tuning a multi-speaker generative model, which involves training a separate model to infer a new speaker embedding used for speaker encoding. Both methods can achieve excellent performance, even with a small number of cloning audios, in terms of the speech's naturalness and similarity to the original speaker. Speaker encoding approaches are more appropriate for low-resource deployment since they require significantly less memory and have a faster cloning time than speaker adaption, which can offer slightly greater naturalness and similarity. The main goal is to create a vocal cloning system that produces audio output with a Nepali accent or that sounds like Nepali. For the further advancement of TTS, the idea of transfer learning was effectively used to address several issues that were encountered in the development of this system, including the poor audio quality and the lack of available data.

### Solving Robotics Problems in Zero-Shot with Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Zidan Wang, Rui Shen, Bradly Stadie

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T16:06:27Z

**Summary**: We introduce Wonderful Team, a multi-agent visual LLM (VLLM) framework for solving robotics problems in the zero-shot regime. By zero-shot we mean that, for a novel environment, we feed a VLLM an image of the robot's environment and a description of the task, and have the VLLM output the sequence of actions necessary for the robot to complete the task. Prior work on VLLMs in robotics has largely focused on settings where some part of the pipeline is fine-tuned, such as tuning an LLM on robot data or training a separate vision encoder for perception and action generation. Surprisingly, due to recent advances in the capabilities of VLLMs, this type of fine-tuning may no longer be necessary for many tasks. In this work, we show that with careful engineering, we can prompt a single off-the-shelf VLLM to handle all aspects of a robotics task, from high-level planning to low-level location-extraction and action-execution. Wonderful Team builds on recent advances in multi-agent LLMs to partition tasks across an agent hierarchy, making it self-corrective and able to effectively partition and solve even long-horizon tasks. Extensive experiments on VIMABench and real-world robotic environments demonstrate the system's capability to handle a variety of robotic tasks, including manipulation, visual goal-reaching, and visual reasoning, all in a zero-shot manner. These results underscore a key point: vision-language models have progressed rapidly in the past year, and should strongly be considered as a backbone for robotics problems going forward.

### Can LLM be a Good Path Planner based on Prompt Engineering? Mitigating   the Hallucination for Path Planning
**Authors**: Hourui Deng, Hongjie Zhang, Jie Ou, Chaosheng Feng

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T16:02:54Z

**Summary**: Spatial reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is the foundation for embodied intelligence. However, even in simple maze environments, LLMs still encounter challenges in long-term path-planning, primarily influenced by their spatial hallucination and context inconsistency hallucination by long-term reasoning. To address this challenge, this study proposes an innovative model, Spatial-to-Relational Transformation and Curriculum Q-Learning (S2RCQL). To address the spatial hallucination of LLMs, we propose the Spatial-to-Relational approach, which transforms spatial prompts into entity relations and paths representing entity relation chains. This approach fully taps the potential of LLMs in terms of sequential thinking. As a result, we design a path-planning algorithm based on Q-learning to mitigate the context inconsistency hallucination, which enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs. Using the Q-value of state-action as auxiliary information for prompts, we correct the hallucinations of LLMs, thereby guiding LLMs to learn the optimal path. Finally, we propose a reverse curriculum learning technique based on LLMs to further mitigate the context inconsistency hallucination. LLMs can rapidly accumulate successful experiences by reducing task difficulty and leveraging them to tackle more complex tasks. We performed comprehensive experiments based on Baidu's self-developed LLM: ERNIE-Bot 4.0. The results showed that our S2RCQL achieved a 23%--40% improvement in both success and optimality rates compared with advanced prompt engineering.

### Towards Weaknesses and Attack Patterns Prediction for IoT Devices
**Authors**: Carlos A. Rivera A., Arash Shaghaghi, Gustavo Batista, Salil S. Kanhere

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T15:43:51Z

**Summary**: As the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices continues to rise in enterprise environments, the need for effective and efficient security measures becomes increasingly critical. This paper presents a cost-efficient platform to facilitate the pre-deployment security checks of IoT devices by predicting potential weaknesses and associated attack patterns. The platform employs a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network to analyse device-related textual data and predict weaknesses. At the same time, a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model predicts likely attack patterns that could exploit these weaknesses. When evaluated on a dataset curated from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and publicly accessible IoT data sources, the system demonstrates high accuracy and reliability. The dataset created for this solution is publicly accessible.

### AI and Jobs: Has the Inflection Point Arrived? Evidence from an Online   Labor Platform
**Authors**: Dandan Qiao, Huaxia Rui, Qian Xiong

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T15:29:05Z

**Summary**: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has renewed the debate on the important issue of "technology displacement". While prior research has investigated the effect of information technology in general on human labor from a macro perspective, this paper complements the literature by examining the impact of LLMs on freelancers from a micro perspective. Specifically, we leverage the release of ChatGPT to investigate how AI influences freelancers across different online labor markets (OLMs). Employing the Difference-in-Differences method, we discovered two distinct scenarios following ChatGPT's release: 1) the displacement effect of LLMs, featuring reduced work volume and earnings, as is exemplified by the translation & localization OLM; 2) the productivity effect of LLMs, featuring increased work volume and earnings, as is exemplified by the web development OLM. To shed light on the underlying mechanisms, we developed a Cournot-type competition model to highlight the existence of an inflection point for each occupation which separates the timeline of AI progress into a honeymoon phase and a substitution phase. Before AI performance crosses the inflection point, human labor benefits each time AI improves, resulting in the honeymoon phase. However, after AI performance crosses the inflection point, additional AI enhancement hurts human labor. Further analyzing the progression from ChatGPT 3.5 to 4.0, we found three effect scenarios (i.e., productivity to productivity, displacement to displacement, and productivity to displacement), consistent with the inflection point conjecture. Heterogeneous analyses reveal that U.S. web developers tend to benefit more from the release of ChatGPT compared to their counterparts in other regions, and somewhat surprisingly, experienced translators seem more likely to exit the market than less experienced translators after the release of ChatGPT.

### Enhancing Training Efficiency Using Packing with Flash Attention
**Authors**: Achintya Kundu, Rhui Dih Lee, Laura Wynter, Raghu Kiran Ganti, Mayank Mishra

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T14:11:05Z

**Summary**: Padding is often used in tuning LLM models by adding special tokens to shorter training examples to match the length of the longest sequence in each batch. While this ensures uniformity for batch processing, it introduces inefficiencies by including irrelevant padding tokens in the computation and wastes GPU resources. Hugging Face SFT trainer has always offered the option to use packing to combine multiple training examples, allowing for maximal utilization of GPU resources. However, up till now, it did not offer proper masking of each packed training example. This capability has now been added to Hugging Face Transformers 4.44. We analyse this new feature and show the benefits across different variations of packing.

### IntelliCare: Improving Healthcare Analysis with Variance-Controlled   Patient-Level Knowledge from Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhihao Yu, Yujie Jin, Yongxin Xu, Xu Chu, Yasha Wang, Junfeng Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T13:56:00Z

**Summary**: While pioneering deep learning methods have made great strides in analyzing electronic health record (EHR) data, they often struggle to fully capture the semantics of diverse medical codes from limited data. The integration of external knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a promising avenue for improving healthcare predictions. However, LLM analyses may exhibit significant variance due to ambiguity problems and inconsistency issues, hindering their effective utilization. To address these challenges, we propose IntelliCare, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to provide high-quality patient-level external knowledge and enhance existing EHR models. Concretely, IntelliCare identifies patient cohorts and employs task-relevant statistical information to augment LLM understanding and generation, effectively mitigating the ambiguity problem. Additionally, it refines LLM-derived knowledge through a hybrid approach, generating multiple analyses and calibrating them using both the EHR model and perplexity measures. Experimental evaluations on three clinical prediction tasks across two large-scale EHR datasets demonstrate that IntelliCare delivers significant performance improvements to existing methods, highlighting its potential in advancing personalized healthcare predictions and decision support systems.

**Authors**: Yulan Gao, Ziqiang Ye, Ming Xiao, Yue Xiao, Dong In Kim

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T13:55:36Z

**Summary**: Healthcare alert systems (HAS) are undergoing rapid evolution, propelled by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, and increasing health consciousness. Despite significant progress, a fundamental challenge remains: balancing the accuracy of personalized health alerts with stringent privacy protection in HAS environments constrained by resources. To address this issue, we introduce a uniform framework, LLM-HAS, which incorporates Large Language Models (LLM) into HAS to significantly boost the accuracy, ensure user privacy, and enhance personalized health service, while also improving the subjective quality of experience (QoE) for users. Our innovative framework leverages a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach, augmented with LLM, to analyze users' personalized preferences and potential health risks from additional textual job descriptions. This analysis guides the selection of specialized Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDPG) experts, tasked with making precise health alerts. Moreover, LLM-HAS can process Conversational User Feedback, which not only allows fine-tuning of DDPG but also deepen user engagement, thereby enhancing both the accuracy and personalization of health management strategies. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the LLM-HAS framework, highlighting its potential as a groundbreaking approach for employing generative AI (GAI) to provide highly accurate and reliable alerts.

### In-Context Learning with Reinforcement Learning for Incomplete Utterance   Rewriting
**Authors**: Haowei Du, Dongyan Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T12:32:12Z

**Summary**: In-context learning (ICL) of large language models (LLMs) has attracted increasing attention in the community where LLMs make predictions only based on instructions augmented with a few examples. Existing example selection methods for ICL utilize sparse or dense retrievers and derive effective performance. However, these methods do not utilize direct feedback of LLM to train the retriever and the examples selected can not necessarily improve the analogy ability of LLM. To tackle this, we propose our policy-based reinforcement learning framework for example selection (RLS), which consists of a language model (LM) selector and an LLM generator. The LM selector encodes the candidate examples into dense representations and selects the top-k examples into the demonstration for LLM. The outputs of LLM are adopted to compute the reward and policy gradient to optimize the LM selector. We conduct experiments on different datasets and significantly outperform existing example selection methods. Moreover, our approach shows advantages over supervised finetuning (SFT) models in few shot setting. Further experiments show the balance of abundance and the similarity with the test case of examples is important for ICL performance of LLM.

### TokenPacker: Efficient Visual Projector for Multimodal LLM
**Authors**: Wentong Li, Yuqian Yuan, Jian Liu, Dongqi Tang, Song Wang, Jie Qin, Jianke Zhu, Lei Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T12:27:06Z

**Summary**: The visual projector serves as an essential bridge between the visual encoder and the Large Language Model (LLM) in a Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Typically, MLLMs adopt a simple MLP to preserve all visual contexts via one-to-one transformation. However, the visual tokens are redundant and can be considerably increased when dealing with high-resolution images, impairing the efficiency of MLLMs significantly. Some recent works have introduced resampler or abstractor to reduce the number of resulting visual tokens. Unfortunately, they fail to capture finer details and undermine the visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. In this work, we propose a novel visual projector, which adopts a coarse-to-fine scheme to inject the enriched characteristics to generate the condensed visual tokens. In specific, we first interpolate the visual features as a low-resolution point query, providing the overall visual representation as the foundation. Then, we introduce a region-to-point injection module that utilizes high-resolution, multi-level region-based cues as fine-grained reference keys and values, allowing them to be fully absorbed within the corresponding local context region. This step effectively updates the coarse point query, transforming it into an enriched one for the subsequent LLM reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach compresses the visual tokens by 75%~89%, while achieves comparable or even better performance across diverse benchmarks with significantly higher efficiency. The source codes can be found at https://github.com/CircleRadon/TokenPacker.

### Performance Law of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chuhan Wu, Ruiming Tang

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T12:14:18Z

**Summary**: Guided by the belief of the scaling law, large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, scaling law only gives a qualitative estimation of loss, which is influenced by various factors such as model architectures, data distributions, tokenizers, and computation precision. Thus, estimating the real performance of LLMs with different training settings rather than loss may be quite useful in practical development. In this article, we present an empirical equation named "Performance Law" to directly predict the MMLU score of an LLM, which is a widely used metric to indicate the general capability of LLMs in real-world conversations and applications. Based on only a few key hyperparameters of the LLM architecture and the size of training data, we obtain a quite accurate MMLU prediction of various LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures developed by different organizations in different years. Performance law can be used to guide the choice of LLM architecture and the effective allocation of computational resources without extensive experiments.

**Authors**: Chamith Mawela, Chaouki Ben Issaid, Mehdi Bennis

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T11:57:02Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach for collaborative machine learning across distributed devices. However, its adoption is hindered by the complexity of building reliable communication architectures and the need for expertise in both machine learning and network programming. This paper presents a comprehensive solution that simplifies the orchestration of FL tasks while integrating intent-based automation. We develop a user-friendly web application supporting the federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm, enabling users to configure parameters through an intuitive interface. The backend solution efficiently manages communication between the parameter server and edge nodes. We also implement model compression and scheduling algorithms to optimize FL performance. Furthermore, we explore intent-based automation in FL using a fine-tuned Language Model (LLM) trained on a tailored dataset, allowing users to conduct FL tasks using high-level prompts. We observe that the LLM-based automated solution achieves comparable test accuracy to the standard web-based solution while reducing transferred bytes by up to 64% and CPU time by up to 46% for FL tasks. Also, we leverage the neural architecture search (NAS) and hyperparameter optimization (HPO) using LLM to improve the performance. We observe that by using this approach test accuracy can be improved by 10-20% for the carried out FL tasks.

### Systematic Evaluation of LLM-as-a-Judge in LLM Alignment Tasks:   Explainable Metrics and Diverse Prompt Templates
**Authors**: Hui Wei, Shenghua He, Tian Xia, Andy Wong, Jingyang Lin, Mei Han

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T11:49:01Z

**Summary**: Alignment approaches such as RLHF and DPO are actively investigated to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Commercial large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have been recently employed to evaluate and compare different LLM alignment approaches. These models act as surrogates for human evaluators due to their promising abilities to approximate human preferences with remarkably faster feedback and lower costs. This methodology is referred to as LLM-as-a-judge. However, concerns regarding its reliability have emerged, attributed to LLM judges' biases and inconsistent decision-making. Previous research has sought to develop robust evaluation frameworks for assessing the reliability of LLM judges and their alignment with human preferences. However, the employed evaluation metrics often lack adequate explainability and fail to address the internal inconsistency of LLMs. Additionally, existing studies inadequately explore the impact of various prompt templates when applying LLM-as-a-judge methods, which leads to potentially inconsistent comparisons between different alignment algorithms. In this work, we systematically evaluate LLM judges on alignment tasks (e.g. summarization) by defining evaluation metrics with improved theoretical interpretability and disentangling reliability metrics with LLM internal inconsistency. We develop a framework to evaluate, compare, and visualize the reliability and alignment of LLM judges to provide informative observations that help choose LLM judges for alignment tasks. Our results indicate a significant impact of prompt templates on LLM judge performance, as well as a mediocre alignment level between the tested LLM judges and human evaluators.

### CRUXEval-X: A Benchmark for Multilingual Code Reasoning, Understanding   and Execution
**Authors**: Ruiyang Xu, Jialun Cao, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Ben He, Shing-Chi Cheung, Le Sun

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T11:43:00Z

**Summary**: Code benchmarks such as HumanEval are widely adopted to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) coding capabilities. However, there is an unignorable programming language bias in existing code benchmarks -- over 95% code generation benchmarks are dominated by Python, leaving the LLMs' capabilities in other programming languages such as Java and C/C++ unknown. Moreover, coding task bias is also crucial. Most benchmarks focus on code generation capability, while benchmarks for code reasoning (given input, reasoning output; and given output, reasoning input), an essential coding capability, are insufficient. Yet, constructing multi-lingual benchmarks can be expensive and labor-intensive, and codes in contest websites such as Leetcode suffer from data contamination during training. To fill this gap, we propose CRUXEVAL-X, a multi-lingual code reasoning benchmark that contains 19 programming languages. It comprises at least 600 subjects for each language, along with 19K content-consistent tests in total. In particular, the construction pipeline of CRUXEVAL-X works in a fully automated and test-guided manner, which iteratively generates and repairs based on execution feedback. Also, to cross language barriers (e.g., dynamic/static type systems in Python/C++), we formulated various transition rules between language pairs to facilitate translation. Our intensive evaluation of 24 representative LLMs reveals the correlation between language pairs. For example, TypeScript and JavaScript show a significant positive correlation, while Racket has less correlation with other languages. More interestingly, even a model trained solely on Python can achieve at most 34.4% Pass@1 in other languages, revealing the cross-language generalization of LLMs.

### Near-field Beam training for Extremely Large-scale MIMO Based on Deep   Learning
**Authors**: Jiali Nie, Yuanhao Cui, Zhaohui Yang, Weijie Yuan, Xiaojun Jing

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T11:02:49Z

**Summary**: Extremely Large-scale Array (ELAA) is considered a frontier technology for future communication systems, pivotal in improving wireless systems' rate and spectral efficiency. As ELAA employs a multitude of antennas operating at higher frequencies, users are typically situated in the near-field region where the spherical wavefront propagates. The near-field beam training in ELAA requires both angle and distance information, which inevitably leads to a significant increase in the beam training overhead. To address this problem, we propose a near-field beam training method based on deep learning. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to efficiently learn channel characteristics from historical data by strategically selecting padding and kernel sizes. The negative value of the user average achievable rate is utilized as the loss function to optimize the beamformer. This method maximizes multi-user networks' achievable rate without predefined beam codebooks. Upon deployment, the model requires solely the pre-estimated channel state information (CSI) to derive the optimal beamforming vector. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a more stable beamforming gain and significantly improves performance compared to the traditional beam training method. Furthermore, owing to the inherent traits of deep learning methodologies, this approach substantially diminishes the near-field beam training overhead.

### Internal and External Knowledge Interactive Refinement Framework for   Knowledge-Intensive Question Answering
**Authors**: Haowei Du, Dongyan Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T10:52:57Z

**Summary**: Recent works have attempted to integrate external knowledge into LLMs to address the limitations and potential factual errors in LLM-generated content. However, how to retrieve the correct knowledge from the large amount of external knowledge imposes a challenge. To this end, we empirically observe that LLMs have already encoded rich knowledge in their pretrained parameters and utilizing these internal knowledge improves the retrieval of external knowledge when applying them to knowledge-intensive tasks. In this paper, we propose a new internal and external knowledge interactive refinement paradigm dubbed IEKR to utilize internal knowledge in LLM to help retrieve relevant knowledge from the external knowledge base, as well as exploit the external knowledge to refine the hallucination of generated internal knowledge. By simply adding a prompt like 'Tell me something about' to the LLMs, we try to review related explicit knowledge and insert them with the query into the retriever for external retrieval. The external knowledge is utilized to complement the internal knowledge into input of LLM for answers. We conduct experiments on 3 benchmark datasets in knowledge-intensive question answering task with different LLMs and domains, achieving the new state-of-the-art. Further analysis shows the effectiveness of different modules in our approach.

**Authors**: Marzieh Hassanshahi Varposhti, Mahyar Shahsavari, Marcel van Gerven

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T10:50:29Z

**Summary**: Implementing AI algorithms on event-based embedded devices enables real-time processing of data, minimizes latency, and enhances power efficiency in edge computing. This research explores the deployment of a spiking recurrent neural network (SRNN) with liquid time constant neurons for gesture recognition. We focus on the energy efficiency and computational efficacy of NVIDIA Jetson Nano embedded GPU platforms. The embedded GPU showcases a 14-fold increase in power efficiency relative to a conventional GPU, making a compelling argument for its use in energy-constrained applications. The study's empirical findings also highlight that batch processing significantly boosts frame rates across various batch sizes while maintaining accuracy levels well above the baseline. These insights validate the SRNN with liquid time constant neurons as a robust model for interpreting temporal-spatial data in gesture recognition, striking a critical balance between processing speed and power frugality.

### Contrasting Linguistic Patterns in Human and LLM-Generated Text
**Authors**: Alberto Muñoz-Ortiz, Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez, David Vilares

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T10:42:45Z

**Summary**: We conduct a quantitative analysis contrasting human-written English news text with comparable large language model (LLM) output from six different LLMs that cover three different families and four sizes in total. Our analysis spans several measurable linguistic dimensions, including morphological, syntactic, psychometric, and sociolinguistic aspects. The results reveal various measurable differences between human and AI-generated texts. Human texts exhibit more scattered sentence length distributions, more variety of vocabulary, a distinct use of dependency and constituent types, shorter constituents, and more optimized dependency distances. Humans tend to exhibit stronger negative emotions (such as fear and disgust) and less joy compared to text generated by LLMs, with the toxicity of these models increasing as their size grows. LLM outputs use more numbers, symbols and auxiliaries (suggesting objective language) than human texts, as well as more pronouns. The sexist bias prevalent in human text is also expressed by LLMs, and even magnified in all of them but one. Differences between LLMs and humans are larger than between LLMs.

We provide a brief review of open regional LLMs and detailed information on the proposed LLMs and their training process. We also conduct an empirical evaluation, comparing the perplexities of the proposed LLMs with those of other modern open LLMs. In addition, benchmarking the proposed LLMs against language understanding tasks reveals that high-quality pretraining datasets may be essential for achieving models that perform efficiently on these benchmarks. The full realisations of the described LLMs are available in the accompanying open repository~\url{https://huggingface.co/neurotechnology}.

### Multimodal Contrastive In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Yosuke Miyanishi, Minh Le Nguyen

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T10:10:01Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) usage has highlighted the importance of gradient-free in-context learning (ICL). However, interpreting their inner workings remains challenging. This paper introduces a novel multimodal contrastive in-context learning framework to enhance our understanding of ICL in LLMs. First, we present a contrastive learning-based interpretation of ICL in real-world settings, marking the distance of the key-value representation as the differentiator in ICL. Second, we develop an analytical framework to address biases in multimodal input formatting for real-world datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ICL examples where baseline performance is poor, even when they are represented in unseen formats. Lastly, we propose an on-the-fly approach for ICL (Anchored-by-Text ICL) that demonstrates effectiveness in detecting hateful memes, a task where typical ICL struggles due to resource limitations. Extensive experiments on multimodal datasets reveal that our approach significantly improves ICL performance across various scenarios, such as challenging tasks and resource-constrained environments. Moreover, it provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of in-context learning in LLMs. Our findings have important implications for developing more interpretable, efficient, and robust multimodal AI systems, especially in challenging tasks and resource-constrained environments.

**Authors**: Yue Pan, Chen Lyu, Zhenyu Yang, Lantian Li, Qi Liu, Xiuting Shao

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T09:57:37Z

**Summary**: Context: With the waning of Moore's Law, the software industry is placing increasing importance on finding alternative solutions for continuous performance enhancement. The significance and research results of software performance optimization have been on the rise in recent years, especially with the advancement propelled by Large Language Models(LLMs). However, traditional strategies for rectifying performance flaws have shown significant limitations at the competitive code efficiency optimization level, and research on this topic is surprisingly scarce. Objective: This study aims to address the research gap in this domain, offering practical solutions to the various challenges encountered. Specifically, we have overcome the constraints of traditional performance error rectification strategies and developed a Language Model (LM) tailored for the competitive code efficiency optimization realm. Method: We introduced E-code, an advanced program synthesis LM. Inspired by the recent success of expert LMs, we designed an innovative structure called the Expert Encoder Group. This structure employs multiple expert encoders to extract features tailored for different input types. We assessed the performance of E-code against other leading models on a competitive dataset and conducted in-depth ablation experiments. Results: Upon systematic evaluation, E-code achieved a 54.98% improvement in code efficiency, significantly outperforming other advanced models. In the ablation experiments, we further validated the significance of the expert encoder group and other components within E-code. Conclusion: The research findings indicate that the expert encoder group can effectively handle various inputs in efficiency optimization tasks, significantly enhancing the model's performance.

### Find the Assembly Mistakes: Error Segmentation for Industrial   Applications
**Authors**: Dan Lehman, Tim J. Schoonbeek, Shao-Hsuan Hung, Jacek Kustra, Peter H. N. de With, Fons van der Sommen

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T09:51:55Z

**Summary**: Recognizing errors in assembly and maintenance procedures is valuable for industrial applications, since it can increase worker efficiency and prevent unplanned down-time. Although assembly state recognition is gaining attention, none of the current works investigate assembly error localization. Therefore, we propose StateDiffNet, which localizes assembly errors based on detecting the differences between a (correct) intended assembly state and a test image from a similar viewpoint. StateDiffNet is trained on synthetically generated image pairs, providing full control over the type of meaningful change that should be detected. The proposed approach is the first to correctly localize assembly errors taken from real ego-centric video data for both states and error types that are never presented during training. Furthermore, the deployment of change detection to this industrial application provides valuable insights and considerations into the mechanisms of state-of-the-art change detection algorithms. The code and data generation pipeline are publicly available at: https://timschoonbeek.github.io/error_seg.

### Causal-Guided Active Learning for Debiasing Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhouhao Sun, Li Du, Xiao Ding, Yixuan Ma, Kaitao Qiu, Ting Liu, Bing Qin

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T09:46:15Z

**Summary**: Although achieving promising performance, recent analyses show that current generative large language models (LLMs) may still capture dataset biases and utilize them for generation, leading to poor generalizability and harmfulness of LLMs. However, due to the diversity of dataset biases and the over-optimization problem, previous prior-knowledge-based debiasing methods and fine-tuning-based debiasing methods may not be suitable for current LLMs. To address this issue, we explore combining active learning with the causal mechanisms and propose a casual-guided active learning (CAL) framework, which utilizes LLMs itself to automatically and autonomously identify informative biased samples and induce the bias patterns. Then a cost-effective and efficient in-context learning based method is employed to prevent LLMs from utilizing dataset biases during generation. Experimental results show that CAL can effectively recognize typical biased instances and induce various bias patterns for debiasing LLMs.

**Authors**: Chen Chen, Ziyao Liu, Weifeng Jiang, Goh Si Qi, KwoK-Yan Lam

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T09:33:48Z

**Summary**: AI Safety is an emerging area of critical importance to the safe adoption and deployment of AI systems.

We provide an extensive review of current research and advancements in AI safety from these perspectives, highlighting their key challenges and mitigation approaches. Through examples from state-of-the-art technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), we present innovative mechanism, methodologies, and techniques for designing and testing AI safety. Our goal is to promote advancement in AI safety research, and ultimately enhance people's trust in digital transformation.

### Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Next Location Predictors
**Authors**: Ciro Beneduce, Bruno Lepri, Massimiliano Luca

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T09:24:22Z

**Summary**: Predicting the locations an individual will visit in the future is crucial for solving many societal issues like disease diffusion and reduction of pollution. However, next-location predictors require a significant amount of individual-level information that may be scarce or unavailable in some scenarios (e.g., cold-start). Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown good generalization and reasoning capabilities and are rich in geographical knowledge, allowing us to believe that these models can act as zero-shot next-location predictors. We tested more than 15 LLMs on three real-world mobility datasets and we found that LLMs can obtain accuracies up to 36.2%, a significant relative improvement of almost 640% when compared to other models specifically designed for human mobility. We also test for data contamination and explored the possibility of using LLMs as text-based explainers for next-location prediction, showing that, regardless of the model size, LLMs can explain their decision.

### Split Conformal Prediction and Non-Exchangeable Data
**Authors**: Roberto I. Oliveira, Paulo Orenstein, Thiago Ramos, João Vitor Romano

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T09:21:00Z

**Summary**: Split conformal prediction (CP) is arguably the most popular CP method for uncertainty quantification, enjoying both academic interest and widespread deployment. However, the original theoretical analysis of split CP makes the crucial assumption of data exchangeability, which hinders many real-world applications. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical framework based on concentration inequalities and decoupling properties of the data, proving that split CP remains valid for many non-exchangeable processes by adding a small coverage penalty. Through experiments with both real and synthetic data, we show that our theoretical results translate to good empirical performance under non-exchangeability, e.g., for time series and spatiotemporal data. Compared to recent conformal algorithms designed to counter specific exchangeability violations, we show that split CP is competitive in terms of coverage and interval size, with the benefit of being extremely simple and orders of magnitude faster than alternatives.

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T09:14:58Z

**Summary**: This work presents ParGo, a novel Partial-Global projector designed to connect the vision and language modalities for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous works that rely on global attention-based projectors, our ParGo bridges the representation gap between the separately pre-trained vision encoders and the LLMs by integrating global and partial views, which alleviates the overemphasis on prominent regions. To facilitate the effective training of ParGo, we collect a large-scale detail-captioned image-text dataset named ParGoCap-1M-PT, consisting of 1 million images paired with high-quality captions. Extensive experiments on several MLLM benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ParGo, highlighting its superiority in aligning vision and language modalities. Compared to conventional Q-Former projector, our ParGo achieves an improvement of 259.96 in MME benchmark. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ParGo significantly outperforms other projectors, particularly in tasks that emphasize detail perception ability.

### Federated Neural Graph Databases
**Authors**: Qi Hu, Weifeng Jiang, Haoran Li, Zihao Wang, Jiaxin Bai, Qianren Mao, Yangqiu Song, Lixin Fan, Jianxin Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T08:40:23Z

**Summary**: The increasing demand for large-scale language models (LLMs) has highlighted the importance of efficient data retrieval mechanisms. Neural graph databases (NGDBs) have emerged as a promising approach to storing and querying graph-structured data in neural space, enabling the retrieval of relevant information for LLMs. However, existing NGDBs are typically designed to operate on a single graph, limiting their ability to reason across multiple graphs. Furthermore, the lack of support for multi-source graph data in existing NGDBs hinders their ability to capture the complexity and diversity of real-world data. In many applications, data is distributed across multiple sources, and the ability to reason across these sources is crucial for making informed decisions. This limitation is particularly problematic when dealing with sensitive graph data, as directly sharing and aggregating such data poses significant privacy risks. As a result, many applications that rely on NGDBs are forced to choose between compromising data privacy or sacrificing the ability to reason across multiple graphs. To address these limitations, we propose Federated Neural Graph Database (FedNGDB), a novel framework that enables reasoning over multi-source graph-based data while preserving privacy. FedNGDB leverages federated learning to collaboratively learn graph representations across multiple sources, enriching relationships between entities and improving the overall quality of the graph data. Unlike existing methods, FedNGDB can handle complex graph structures and relationships, making it suitable for various downstream tasks.

### ADMM Based Semi-Structured Pattern Pruning Framework For Transformer
**Authors**: TianChen Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T08:36:41Z

**Summary**: NLP(natural language processsing) has achieved great success through the transformer model.However, the model has hundreds of millions or billions parameters,which is huge burden for its deployment on personal computer or small scale of server.To deal with it, we either make the model's weight matrix relatively sparser, or compress attention layer. Pattern pruning ,one of the most important pruning methods, permits selecting fixed number of parameters in each divided pattern block and prunes it. However, the effect of pattern pruning is strictly limited by the sparsity within a region of weights in each layer. In this paper,we first introduced Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers(ADMM) based pattern pruning framework to reshape the distribution of activation map. Specifically, we propose to formulate the pattern pruning on transformer as a constrained optimization and use ADMM to optimize the problem. In this way, the initial dense feature maps is transformed to rather regionally sparsified ones.Therefore, we can then achieve higher compression ratio with better performance based on pattern pruning method. Additionally, this paper provides a theoretical derivations of the ADMM with local sparsity. Finally, we also extend the proposed ADMM based framework with SR-STE to demonstrate its generalization and to avoid gradient vanishing problem. We conduct extensive experiments on classification tasks over GLUE datasets. Significantly, we achieve 50% percent compression ratio while maintaining overall score 80.1 on GLUE dataset.

**Authors**: Quandong Wang, Yuxuan Yuan, Xiaoyu Yang, Ruike Zhang, Kang Zhao, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Daniel Povey, Bin Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T08:17:58Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various fields, the efficiency of training and inference remains a major challenge. To address this issue, we propose SUBLLM, short for Subsampling-Upsampling-Bypass Large Language Model, an innovative architecture that extends the core decoder-only framework by incorporating subsampling, upsampling, and bypass modules. The subsampling modules are responsible for shortening the sequence, while the upsampling modules restore the sequence length, and the bypass modules enhance convergence. In comparison to LLaMA, the proposed SUBLLM exhibits significant enhancements in both training and inference speeds as well as memory usage, while maintaining competitive few-shot performance. During training, SUBLLM increases speeds by 26% and cuts memory by 10GB per GPU. In inference, it boosts speeds by up to 37% and reduces memory by 1GB per GPU. The training and inference speeds can be enhanced by 34% and 52% respectively when the context window is expanded to 8192. Our code is available at https://github.com/XiaoMi/subllm.

### A Quick, trustworthy spectral detection Q&A system based on the SDAAP   Dataset and large language model
**Authors**: Jiheng Liang, Ziru Yu, Zujie Xie, Xiangyang Yu

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T08:16:50Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) has demonstrated significant success in a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks within general domain. The emergence of LLM has introduced innovative methodologies across diverse fields, including the natural sciences. Researchers aim to implement automated, concurrent process driven by LLM to supplant conventional manual, repetitive and labor-intensive work. In the domain of spectral analysis and detection, it is imperative for researchers to autonomously acquire pertinent knowledge across various research objects, which encompasses the spectroscopic techniques and the chemometric methods that are employed in experiments and analysis. Paradoxically, despite the recognition of spectroscopic detection as an effective analytical method, the fundamental process of knowledge retrieval remains both time-intensive and repetitive. In response to this challenge, we first introduced the Spectral Detection and Analysis Based Paper(SDAAP) dataset, which is the first open-source textual knowledge dataset for spectral analysis and detection and contains annotated literature data as well as corresponding knowledge instruction data. Subsequently, we also designed an automated Q\&A framework based on the SDAAP dataset, which can retrieve relevant knowledge and generate high-quality responses by extracting entities in the input as retrieval parameters. It is worth noting that: within this framework, LLM is only used as a tool to provide generalizability, while RAG technique is used to accurately capture the source of the knowledge.This approach not only improves the quality of the generated responses, but also ensures the traceability of the knowledge. Experimental results show that our framework generates responses with more reliable expertise compared to the baseline.

### RoundTable: Leveraging Dynamic Schema and Contextual Autocomplete for   Enhanced Query Precision in Tabular Question Answering
**Authors**: Pratyush Kumar, Kuber Vijaykumar Bellad, Bharat Vadlamudi, Aman Chadha

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T08:11:09Z

**Summary**: With advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), a major use case that has emerged is querying databases in plain English, translating user questions into executable database queries, which has improved significantly. However, real-world datasets often feature a vast array of attributes and complex values, complicating the LLMs task of accurately identifying relevant columns or values from natural language queries. Traditional methods cannot fully relay the datasets size and complexity to the LLM. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages Full-Text Search (FTS) on the input table. This approach not only enables precise detection of specific values and columns but also narrows the search space for language models, thereby enhancing query accuracy. Additionally, it supports a custom auto-complete feature that suggests queries based on the data in the table. This integration significantly refines the interaction between the user and complex datasets, offering a sophisticated solution to the limitations faced by current table querying capabilities. This work is accompanied by an application for both Mac and Windows platforms, which readers can try out themselves on their own data.

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T07:46:17Z

**Summary**: Information Technology (IT) Operations (Ops), particularly Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps), is the guarantee for maintaining the orderly and stable operation of existing information systems. According to Gartner's prediction, the use of AI technology for automated IT operations has become a new trend. Large language models (LLMs) that have exhibited remarkable capabilities in NLP-related tasks, are showing great potential in the field of AIOps, such as in aspects of root cause analysis of failures, generation of operations and maintenance scripts, and summarizing of alert information. Nevertheless, the performance of current LLMs in Ops tasks is yet to be determined. In this paper, we present OpsEval, a comprehensive task-oriented Ops benchmark designed for LLMs. For the first time, OpsEval assesses LLMs' proficiency in various crucial scenarios at different ability levels. The benchmark includes 7184 multi-choice questions and 1736 question-answering (QA) formats in English and Chinese. By conducting a comprehensive performance evaluation of the current leading large language models, we show how various LLM techniques can affect the performance of Ops, and discussed findings related to various topics, including model quantification, QA evaluation, and hallucination issues. To ensure the credibility of our evaluation, we invite dozens of domain experts to manually review our questions. At the same time, we have open-sourced 20% of the test QA to assist current researchers in preliminary evaluations of their OpsLLM models. The remaining 80% of the data, which is not disclosed, is used to eliminate the issue of the test set leakage. Additionally, we have constructed an online leaderboard that is updated in real-time and will continue to be updated, ensuring that any newly emerging LLMs will be evaluated promptly. Both our dataset and leaderboard have been made public.

### Distillation Contrastive Decoding: Improving LLMs Reasoning with   Contrastive Decoding and Distillation
**Authors**: Phuc Phan, Hieu Tran, Long Phan

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T07:31:42Z

**Summary**: We propose a straightforward approach called Distillation Contrastive Decoding (DCD) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference. In contrast to previous approaches that relied on smaller amateur models or analysis of hidden state differences, DCD employs Contrastive Chain-of-thought Prompting and advanced distillation techniques, including Dropout and Quantization. This approach effectively addresses the limitations of Contrastive Decoding (CD), which typically requires both an expert and an amateur model, thus increasing computational resource demands. By integrating contrastive prompts with distillation, DCD obviates the need for an amateur model and reduces memory usage. Our evaluations demonstrate that DCD significantly enhances LLM performance across a range of reasoning benchmarks, surpassing both CD and existing methods in the GSM8K and StrategyQA datasets.

### Semantic Alignment for Multimodal Large Language Models
**Authors**: Tao Wu, Mengze Li, Jingyuan Chen, Wei Ji, Wang Lin, Jinyang Gao, Kun Kuang, Zhou Zhao, Fei Wu

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T06:48:46Z

**Summary**: Research on Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) towards the multi-image cross-modal instruction has received increasing attention and made significant progress, particularly in scenarios involving closely resembling images (e.g., change captioning). Existing MLLMs typically follow a two-step process in their pipelines: first, extracting visual tokens independently for each input image, and then aligning these visual tokens from different images with the Large Language Model (LLM) in its textual feature space. However, the independent extraction of visual tokens for each image may result in different semantics being prioritized for different images in the first step, leading to a lack of preservation of linking information among images for subsequent LLM analysis. This issue becomes more serious in scenarios where significant variations exist among the images (e.g., visual storytelling). To address this challenge, we introduce Semantic Alignment for Multi-modal large language models (SAM). By involving the bidirectional semantic guidance between different images in the visual-token extraction process, SAM aims to enhance the preservation of linking information for coherent analysis and align the semantics of different images before feeding them into LLM. As the test bed, we propose a large-scale dataset named MmLINK consisting of 69K samples. Different from most existing datasets for MLLMs fine-tuning, our MmLINK dataset comprises multi-modal instructions with significantly diverse images. Extensive experiments on the group captioning task and the storytelling task prove the effectiveness of our SAM model, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+37% for group captioning and +22% for storytelling on CIDEr score).

**Authors**: Kun Luo, Minghao Qin, Zheng Liu, Shitao Xiao, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T06:46:41Z

**Summary**: Pretrained language models like BERT and T5 serve as crucial backbone encoders for dense retrieval. However, these models often exhibit limited generalization capabilities and face challenges in improving in domain accuracy. Recent research has explored using large language models (LLMs) as retrievers, achieving SOTA performance across various tasks. Despite these advancements, the specific benefits of LLMs over traditional retrievers and the impact of different LLM configurations, such as parameter sizes, pretraining duration, and alignment processes on retrieval tasks remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on a wide range of retrieval tasks, including in domain accuracy, data efficiency, zero shot generalization, lengthy retrieval, instruction based retrieval, and multi task learning. We evaluate over 15 different backbone LLMs and non LLMs. Our findings reveal that larger models and extensive pretraining consistently enhance in domain accuracy and data efficiency. Additionally, larger models demonstrate significant potential in zero shot generalization, lengthy retrieval, instruction based retrieval, and multi task learning. These results underscore the advantages of LLMs as versatile and effective backbone encoders in dense retrieval, providing valuable insights for future research and development in this field.

### Memory-Efficient LLM Training with Online Subspace Descent
**Authors**: Kaizhao Liang, Bo Liu, Lizhang Chen, Qiang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T05:54:53Z

**Summary**: Recently, a wide range of memory-efficient LLM training algorithms have gained substantial popularity. These methods leverage the low-rank structure of gradients to project optimizer states into a subspace using projection matrix found by singular value decomposition (SVD). However, convergence of these algorithms is highly dependent on the update rules of their projection matrix. In this work, we provide the \emph{first} convergence guarantee for arbitrary update rules of projection matrix. This guarantee is generally applicable to optimizers that can be analyzed with Hamiltonian Descent, including most common ones, such as LION, Adam. Inspired by our theoretical understanding, we propose Online Subspace Descent, a new family of subspace descent optimizer without SVD. Instead of updating the projection matrix with eigenvectors, Online Subspace Descent updates the projection matrix with online PCA. Online Subspace Descent is flexible and introduces only minimum overhead to training. We show that for the task of pretraining LLaMA models ranging from 60M to 7B parameters on the C4 dataset, Online Subspace Descent achieves lower perplexity and better downstream tasks performance than state-of-the-art low-rank training methods across different settings and narrows the gap with full-rank baselines.

**Authors**: Songyan Teng, Tianyi Zhang, Simon D'Alfonso, Vassilis Kostakos

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T05:25:11Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of mobile sensing technologies has enabled the study of various physiological and behavioural phenomena through unobtrusive data collection from smartphone sensors. This approach offers real-time insights into individuals' physical and mental states, creating opportunities for personalised treatment and interventions. However, the potential of analysing the textual content viewed on smartphones to predict affective states remains underexplored. To better understand how the screen text that users are exposed to and interact with can influence their affects, we investigated a subset of data obtained from a digital phenotyping study of Australian university students conducted in 2023. We employed linear regression, zero-shot, and multi-shot prompting using a large language model (LLM) to analyse relationships between screen text and affective states. Our findings indicate that multi-shot prompting substantially outperforms both linear regression and zero-shot prompting, highlighting the importance of context in affect prediction. We discuss the value of incorporating textual and sentiment data for improving affect prediction, providing a basis for future advancements in understanding smartphone use and wellbeing.

**Authors**: Takashi Koide, Naoki Fukushi, Hiroki Nakano, Daiki Chiba

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T05:03:44Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of phishing sites and emails poses significant challenges to existing cybersecurity efforts. Despite advances in malicious email filters and email security protocols, problems with oversight and false positives persist. Users often struggle to understand why emails are flagged as potentially fraudulent, risking the possibility of missing important communications or mistakenly trusting deceptive phishing emails. This study introduces ChatSpamDetector, a system that uses large language models (LLMs) to detect phishing emails. By converting email data into a prompt suitable for LLM analysis, the system provides a highly accurate determination of whether an email is phishing or not. Importantly, it offers detailed reasoning for its phishing determinations, assisting users in making informed decisions about how to handle suspicious emails. We conducted an evaluation using a comprehensive phishing email dataset and compared our system to several LLMs and baseline systems. We confirmed that our system using GPT-4 has superior detection capabilities with an accuracy of 99.70%. Advanced contextual interpretation by LLMs enables the identification of various phishing tactics and impersonations, making them a potentially powerful tool in the fight against email-based phishing threats.

**Authors**: Purushothaman Natarajan, Athira Nambiar

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T04:54:18Z

**Summary**: Deep learning techniques have revolutionized image classification by mimicking human cognition and automating complex decision-making processes. However, the deployment of AI systems in the wild, especially in high-security domains such as defence, is curbed by the lack of explainability of the model. To this end, eXplainable AI (XAI) is an emerging area of research that is intended to explore the unexplained hidden black box nature of deep neural networks. This paper explores the application of the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tool to interpret the underwater image classification results, one of the first works in the domain to the best of our knowledge. Our study delves into the realm of SONAR image classification using a custom dataset derived from diverse sources, including the Seabed Objects KLSG dataset, the camera SONAR dataset, the mine SONAR images dataset, and the SCTD dataset. An extensive analysis of transfer learning techniques for image classification using benchmark Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures such as VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, etc. is carried out. On top of this classification model, a post-hoc XAI technique, viz. Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) are incorporated to provide transparent justifications for the model's decisions by perturbing input data locally to see how predictions change. Furthermore, Submodular Picks LIME (SP-LIME) a version of LIME particular to images, that perturbs the image based on the submodular picks is also extensively studied. To this end, two submodular optimization algorithms i.e. Quickshift and Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) are leveraged towards submodular picks. The extensive analysis of XAI techniques highlights interpretability of the results in a more human-compliant way, thus boosting our confidence and reliability.

### CLLMFS: A Contrastive Learning enhanced Large Language Model Framework   for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition
**Authors**: Yafeng Zhang, Zilan Yu, Yuang Huang, Jing Tang

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T04:44:05Z

**Summary**: Few-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER), the task of identifying named entities with only a limited amount of labeled data, has gained increasing significance in natural language processing. While existing methodologies have shown some effectiveness, such as enriching label semantics through various prompting modes or employing metric learning techniques, their performance exhibits limited robustness across diverse domains due to the lack of rich knowledge in their pre-trained models. To address this issue, we propose CLLMFS, a Contrastive Learning enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) Framework for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition, achieving promising results with limited training data. Considering the impact of LLM's internal representations on downstream tasks, CLLMFS integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and contrastive learning mechanisms specifically tailored for few-shot NER. By enhancing the model's internal representations, CLLMFS effectively improves both entity boundary awareness ability and entity recognition accuracy. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance improvements on F1-score ranging from 2.58\% to 97.74\% over existing best-performing methods across several recognized benchmarks. Furthermore, through cross-domain NER experiments conducted on multiple datasets, we have further validated the robust generalization capability of our method. Our code will be released in the near future.

### LIMP: Large Language Model Enhanced Intent-aware Mobility Prediction
**Authors**: Songwei Li, Jie Feng, Jiawei Chi, Xinyuan Hu, Xiaomeng Zhao, Fengli Xu

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T04:28:56Z

**Summary**: Human mobility prediction is essential for applications like urban planning and transportation management, yet it remains challenging due to the complex, often implicit, intentions behind human behavior. Existing models predominantly focus on spatiotemporal patterns, paying less attention to the underlying intentions that govern movements. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative research angle for integrating commonsense reasoning into mobility prediction. However, it is a non-trivial problem because LLMs are not natively built for mobility intention inference, and they also face scalability issues and integration difficulties with spatiotemporal models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel LIMP (LLMs for Intent-ware Mobility Prediction) framework. Specifically, LIMP introduces an "Analyze-Abstract-Infer" (A2I) agentic workflow to unleash LLM's commonsense reasoning power for mobility intention inference. Besides, we design an efficient fine-tuning scheme to transfer reasoning power from commercial LLM to smaller-scale, open-source language model, ensuring LIMP's scalability to millions of mobility records. Moreover, we propose a transformer-based intention-aware mobility prediction model to effectively harness the intention inference ability of LLM. Evaluated on two real-world datasets, LIMP significantly outperforms baseline models, demonstrating improved accuracy in next-location prediction and effective intention inference. The interpretability of intention-aware mobility prediction highlights our LIMP framework's potential for real-world applications. Codes and data can be found in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/LIMP .

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T04:13:48Z

**Summary**: With the advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), LLM-driven visual agents are increasingly impacting software interfaces, particularly those with graphical user interfaces. This work introduces a novel LLM-based multimodal agent framework for mobile devices. This framework, capable of navigating mobile devices, emulates human-like interactions.

The agent operates through two main phases: exploration and deployment. During the exploration phase, functionalities of user interface elements are documented either through agent-driven or manual explorations into a customized structured knowledge base. In the deployment phase, RAG technology enables efficient retrieval and update from this knowledge base, thereby empowering the agent to perform tasks effectively and accurately. This includes performing complex, multi-step operations across various applications, thereby demonstrating the framework's adaptability and precision in handling customized task workflows.

### Instruction-Driven Game Engines on Large Language Models
**Authors**: Hongqiu Wu, Yan Wang, Xingyuan Liu, Hai Zhao, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T04:06:41Z

**Summary**: The Instruction-Driven Game Engine (IDGE) project aims to democratize game development by enabling a large language model (LLM) to follow free-form game rules and autonomously generate game-play processes. The IDGE allows users to create games by issuing simple natural language instructions, which significantly lowers the barrier for game development. We approach the learning process for IDGEs as a Next State Prediction task, wherein the model autoregressively predicts in-game states given player actions. It is a challenging task because the computation of in-game states must be precise; otherwise, slight errors could disrupt the game-play. To address this, we train the IDGE in a curriculum manner that progressively increases the model's exposure to complex scenarios. Our initial progress lies in developing an IDGE for Poker, a universally cherished card game. The engine we've designed not only supports a wide range of poker variants but also allows for high customization of rules through natural language inputs. Furthermore, it also favors rapid prototyping of new games from minimal samples, proposing an innovative paradigm in game development that relies on minimal prompt and data engineering. This work lays the groundwork for future advancements in instruction-driven game creation, potentially transforming how games are designed and played.

### Scaling Virtual World with Delta-Engine
**Authors**: Hongqiu Wu, Zekai Xu, Tianyang Xu, Jiale Hong, Weiqi Wu, Yan Wang, Hai Zhao, Min Zhang, Zhezhi He

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T03:57:24Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we focus on the \emph{virtual world}, a cyberspace where people can live in. An ideal virtual world shares great similarity with our real world. One of the crucial aspects is its evolving nature, reflected by individuals' capability to grow and thereby influence the objective world. Such dynamics is unpredictable and beyond the reach of existing systems. For this, we propose a special engine called \textbf{\emph{Delta-Engine}} to drive this virtual world. $\Delta$ associates the world's evolution to the engine's scalability. It consists of a base engine and a neural proxy. The base engine programs the prototype of the virtual world; given a trigger, the neural proxy generates new snippets on the base engine through \emph{incremental prediction}.   This paper presents a full-stack introduction to the delta-engine. The key feature of the delta-engine is its scalability to unknown elements within the world, Technically, it derives from the prefect co-work of the neural proxy and the base engine, and the alignment with high-quality data. We introduce an engine-oriented fine-tuning method that embeds the base engine into the proxy. We then discuss the human-LLM collaborative design to produce novel and interesting data efficiently. Eventually, we propose three evaluation principles to comprehensively assess the performance of a delta engine: naive evaluation, incremental evaluation, and adversarial evaluation.

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T03:45:31Z

**Summary**: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models (FMs) has generated heightened interest in their applications that integrate vision and language. This paper investigates the capabilities of ChatGPT-4V and Gemini Pro for Street View Imagery, Built Environment, and Interior by evaluating their performance across various tasks. The assessments include street furniture identification, pedestrian and car counts, and road width measurement in Street View Imagery; building function classification, building age analysis, building height analysis, and building structure classification in the Built Environment; and interior room classification, interior design style analysis, interior furniture counts, and interior length measurement in Interior. The results reveal proficiency in length measurement, style analysis, question answering, and basic image understanding, but highlight limitations in detailed recognition and counting tasks. While zero-shot learning shows potential, performance varies depending on the problem domains and image complexities. This study provides new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of multimodal foundation models for practical challenges in Street View Imagery, Built Environment, and Interior. Overall, the findings demonstrate foundational multimodal intelligence, emphasizing the potential of FMs to drive forward interdisciplinary applications at the intersection of computer vision and language.

### Xinyu: An Efficient LLM-based System for Commentary Generation
**Authors**: Yiquan Wu, Bo Tang, Chenyang Xi, Yu Yu, Pengyu Wang, Yifei Liu, Kun Kuang, Haiying Deng, Zhiyu Li, Feiyu Xiong, Jie Hu, Peng Cheng, Zhonghao Wang, Yi Wang, Yi Luo, Mingchuan Yang

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T03:40:44Z

**Summary**: Commentary provides readers with a deep understanding of events by presenting diverse arguments and evidence. However, creating commentary is a time-consuming task, even for skilled commentators. Large language models (LLMs) have simplified the process of natural language generation, but their direct application in commentary creation still faces challenges due to unique task requirements. These requirements can be categorized into two levels: 1) fundamental requirements, which include creating well-structured and logically consistent narratives, and 2) advanced requirements, which involve generating quality arguments and providing convincing evidence. In this paper, we introduce Xinyu, an efficient LLM-based system designed to assist commentators in generating Chinese commentaries. To meet the fundamental requirements, we deconstruct the generation process into sequential steps, proposing targeted strategies and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for each step. To address the advanced requirements, we present an argument ranking model for arguments and establish a comprehensive evidence database that includes up-to-date events and classic books, thereby strengthening the substantiation of the evidence with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technology. To evaluate the generated commentaries more fairly, corresponding to the two-level requirements, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation metric that considers five distinct perspectives in commentary generation. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed system. We also observe a significant increase in the efficiency of commentators in real-world scenarios, with the average time spent on creating a commentary dropping from 4 hours to 20 minutes. Importantly, such an increase in efficiency does not compromise the quality of the commentaries.

### The Best of Both Worlds: Toward an Honest and Helpful Large Language   Model
**Authors**: Chujie Gao, Qihui Zhang, Dongping Chen, Yue Huang, Siyuan Wu, Zhengyan Fu, Yao Wan, Xiangliang Zhang, Lichao Sun

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T03:39:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various industries due to their exceptional generative capabilities. However, for safe and effective real-world deployments, ensuring honesty and helpfulness is critical. This paper addresses the question: Can we prioritize the helpfulness of LLMs while preserving their honesty? To begin with, we establish exhaustive principles aimed at guaranteeing the honesty of LLM. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset, referred to as HoneSet, comprising 930 queries spanning six categories meticulously crafted to assess an LLM's capacity for maintaining honesty. Subsequently, we present two approaches to augmenting honesty and helpfulness in LLMs: a training-free enhancement and a fine-tuning-based improvement. The training-free approach, which is based on curiosity-driven prompting, empowers LLMs to articulate internal confusion and uncertainty regarding queries, thereby optimizing their responses. Conversely, the fine-tuning-based method employs a two-stage process inspired by curriculum learning: initially instructing LLMs to discern between honest and dishonest responses, then refining their training to enhance helpfulness. Experiments conducted on nine prominent LLMs demonstrate a significant improvement in alignment with honesty across all models through the implementation of our proposed enhancements. Particularly noteworthy is the 65.3% enhancement observed in Llama3-8b and the remarkable 124.7% improvement in Mistral-7b, as measured by the H$^{2}$ (honest and helpful) assessment. We believe that our work can pave the way for developing more trustworthy LLMs for real-world applications.

### Staircase Cascaded Fusion of Lightweight Local Pattern Recognition and   Long-Range Dependencies for Structural Crack Segmentation
**Authors**: Hui Liu, Chen Jia, Fan Shi, Xu Cheng, Mianzhao Wang, Shengyong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T03:21:51Z

**Summary**: Detecting cracks with pixel-level precision for key structures is a significant challenge, as existing methods struggle to effectively integrate local textures and pixel dependencies of cracks. Furthermore, these methods often possess numerous parameters and substantial computational requirements, complicating deployment on edge devices. In this paper, we propose a staircase cascaded fusion crack segmentation network (CrackSCF) that generates high-quality crack segmentation maps using minimal computational resources. We constructed a staircase cascaded fusion module that effectively captures local patterns of cracks and long-range dependencies of pixels, and it can suppress background noise well. To reduce the computational resources required by the model, we introduced a lightweight convolution block, which replaces all convolution operations in the network, significantly reducing the required computation and parameters without affecting the network's performance. To evaluate our method, we created a challenging benchmark dataset called TUT and conducted experiments on this dataset and five other public datasets. The experimental results indicate that our method offers significant advantages over existing methods, especially in handling background noise interference and detailed crack segmentation. The F1 and mIoU scores on the TUT dataset are 0.8382 and 0.8473, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while requiring the least computational resources. The code and dataset is available at https://github.com/Karl1109/CrackSCF.

### Grounding Fallacies Misrepresenting Scientific Publications in Evidence
**Authors**: Max Glockner, Yufang Hou, Preslav Nakov, Iryna Gurevych

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T03:16:26Z

**Summary**: Health-related misinformation claims often falsely cite a credible biomedical publication as evidence, which superficially appears to support the false claim. The publication does not really support the claim, but a reader could believe it thanks to the use of logical fallacies. Here, we aim to detect and to highlight such fallacies, which requires carefully assessing the exact content of the misrepresented publications. To achieve this, we introduce MissciPlus, an extension of the fallacy detection dataset Missci. MissciPlus builds on Missci by grounding the applied fallacies in real-world passages from misrepresented studies. This creates a realistic test-bed for detecting and verbalizing these fallacies under real-world input conditions, and enables novel passage-retrieval tasks. MissciPlus is the first logical fallacy dataset which pairs the real-world misrepresented evidence with incorrect claims, identical to the input to evidence-based fact-checking models. With MissciPlus, we i) benchmark retrieval models in identifying passages that support claims only when fallacies are applied, ii) evaluate how well LLMs articulate fallacious reasoning from misrepresented scientific passages, and iii) assess the effectiveness of fact-checking models in refuting claims that misrepresent biomedical research. Our findings show that current fact-checking models struggle to use relevant passages from misrepresented publications to refute misinformation. Moreover, these passages can mislead LLMs into accepting false claims as true.

**Summary**: In an era where digital threats are increasingly sophisticated, the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and cybersecurity presents both promising defenses and potent dangers. This paper delves into the escalating threat posed by the misuse of AI, specifically through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). This study details various techniques like the switch method and character play method, which can be exploited by cybercriminals to generate and automate cyber attacks. Through a series of controlled experiments, the paper demonstrates how these models can be manipulated to bypass ethical and privacy safeguards to effectively generate cyber attacks such as social engineering, malicious code, payload generation, and spyware. By testing these AI generated attacks on live systems, the study assesses their effectiveness and the vulnerabilities they exploit, offering a practical perspective on the risks AI poses to critical infrastructure. We also introduce Occupy AI, a customized, finetuned LLM specifically engineered to automate and execute cyberattacks. This specialized AI driven tool is adept at crafting steps and generating executable code for a variety of cyber threats, including phishing, malware injection, and system exploitation. The results underscore the urgency for ethical AI practices, robust cybersecurity measures, and regulatory oversight to mitigate AI related threats. This paper aims to elevate awareness within the cybersecurity community about the evolving digital threat landscape, advocating for proactive defense strategies and responsible AI development to protect against emerging cyber threats.

**Authors**: Yige Li, Hanxun Huang, Yunhan Zhao, Xingjun Ma, Jun Sun

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T02:21:21Z

**Summary**: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides across various tasks, but they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where specific triggers in the prompt cause the LLM to generate adversary-desired responses. While most backdoor research has focused on vision or text classification tasks, backdoor attacks in text generation have been largely overlooked. In this work, we introduce \textit{BackdoorLLM}, the first comprehensive benchmark for studying backdoor attacks on LLMs. \textit{BackdoorLLM} features: 1) a repository of backdoor benchmarks with a standardized training pipeline, 2) diverse attack strategies, including data poisoning, weight poisoning, hidden state attacks, and chain-of-thought attacks, 3) extensive evaluations with over 200 experiments on 8 attacks across 7 scenarios and 6 model architectures, and 4) key insights into the effectiveness and limitations of backdoors in LLMs. We hope \textit{BackdoorLLM} will raise awareness of backdoor threats and contribute to advancing AI safety. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/bboylyg/BackdoorLLM}.

### "Golden Ratio Yoshimura" for Meta-Stable and Massively Reconfigurable   Deployment
**Authors**: Vishrut Deshpande, Yogesh Phalak, Ziyang Zhou, Ian Walker, Suyi Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T02:00:27Z

**Summary**: Yoshimura origami is a classical folding pattern that has inspired many deployable structure designs. Its applications span from space exploration, kinetic architectures, and soft robots to even everyday household items. However, despite its wide usage, Yoshimura has been fixated on a set of design constraints to ensure its flat-foldability. Through extensive kinematic analysis and prototype tests, this study presents a new Yoshimura that intentionally defies these constraints. Remarkably, one can impart a unique meta-stability by using the Golden Ratio angle to define the triangular facets of a generalized Yoshimura. As a result, when its facets are strategically popped out, a ``Golden Ratio Yoshimura'' boom with $m$ modules can be theoretically reconfigured into $8^m$ geometrically unique and load-bearing shapes. This result not only challenges the existing design norms but also opens up a new avenue to create deployable and versatile structural systems.

### Can Large Language Models Automatically Jailbreak GPT-4V?
**Authors**: Yuanwei Wu, Yue Huang, Yixin Liu, Xiang Li, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T01:52:10Z

**Summary**: GPT-4V has attracted considerable attention due to its extraordinary capacity for integrating and processing multimodal information. At the same time, its ability of face recognition raises new safety concerns of privacy leakage. Despite researchers' efforts in safety alignment through RLHF or preprocessing filters, vulnerabilities might still be exploited. In our study, we introduce AutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt optimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to refine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning prompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method that incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token expenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly surpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 95.3\%. This research sheds light on strengthening GPT-4V security, underscoring the potential for LLMs to be exploited in compromising GPT-4V integrity.

### Context-Aware Temporal Embedding of Objects in Video Data
**Authors**: Ahnaf Farhan, M. Shahriar Hossain

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T01:44:10Z

**Summary**: In video analysis, understanding the temporal context is crucial for recognizing object interactions, event patterns, and contextual changes over time. The proposed model leverages adjacency and semantic similarities between objects from neighboring video frames to construct context-aware temporal object embeddings. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on visual appearance, our temporal embedding model considers the contextual relationships between objects, creating a meaningful embedding space where temporally connected object's vectors are positioned in proximity. Empirical studies demonstrate that our context-aware temporal embeddings can be used in conjunction with conventional visual embeddings to enhance the effectiveness of downstream applications. Moreover, the embeddings can be used to narrate a video using a Large Language Model (LLM). This paper describes the intricate details of the proposed objective function to generate context-aware temporal object embeddings for video data and showcases the potential applications of the generated embeddings in video analysis and object classification tasks.

**Authors**: Qinbin Li, Junyuan Hong, Chulin Xie, Jeffrey Tan, Rachel Xin, Junyi Hou, Xavier Yin, Zhun Wang, Dan Hendrycks, Zhangyang Wang, Bo Li, Bingsheng He, Dawn Song

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T01:37:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to numerous domains, significantly advancing applications in data management, mining, and analysis. Their profound capabilities in processing and interpreting complex language data, however, bring to light pressing concerns regarding data privacy, especially the risk of unintentional training data leakage. Despite the critical nature of this issue, there has been no existing literature to offer a comprehensive assessment of data privacy risks in LLMs. Addressing this gap, our paper introduces LLM-PBE, a toolkit crafted specifically for the systematic evaluation of data privacy risks in LLMs. LLM-PBE is designed to analyze privacy across the entire lifecycle of LLMs, incorporating diverse attack and defense strategies, and handling various data types and metrics. Through detailed experimentation with multiple LLMs, LLM-PBE facilitates an in-depth exploration of data privacy concerns, shedding light on influential factors such as model size, data characteristics, and evolving temporal dimensions. This study not only enriches the understanding of privacy issues in LLMs but also serves as a vital resource for future research in the field. Aimed at enhancing the breadth of knowledge in this area, the findings, resources, and our full technical report are made available at https://llm-pbe.github.io/, providing an open platform for academic and practical advancements in LLM privacy assessment.

**Authors**: Shenglin Zhang, Pengtian Zhu, Minghua Ma, Jiagang Wang, Yongqian Sun, Dongwen Li, Jingyu Wang, Qianying Guo, Xiaolei Hua, Lin Zhu, Dan Pei

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T01:25:26Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general question-answering (Q&A) but often fall short in specialized domains due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge. Commercial companies face the dual challenges of privacy protection and resource constraints when involving LLMs for fine-tuning. This paper propose a novel framework, Self-Evolution, designed to address these issues by leveraging lightweight open-source LLMs through multiple iterative fine-tuning rounds. To enhance the efficiency of iterative fine-tuning, Self-Evolution employ a strategy that filters and reinforces the knowledge with higher value during the iterative process. We employed Self-Evolution on Qwen1.5-7B-Chat using 4,000 documents containing rich domain knowledge from China Mobile, achieving a performance score 174% higher on domain-specific question-answering evaluations than Qwen1.5-7B-Chat and even 22% higher than Qwen1.5-72B-Chat. Self-Evolution has been deployed in China Mobile's daily operation and maintenance for 117 days, and it improves the efficiency of locating alarms, fixing problems, and finding related reports, with an average efficiency improvement of over 18.6%. In addition, we release Self-Evolution framework code in https://github.com/Zero-Pointer/Self-Evolution.

### ABQ-LLM: Arbitrary-Bit Quantized Inference Acceleration for Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Chao Zeng, Songwei Liu, Yusheng Xie, Hong Liu, Xiaojian Wang, Miao Wei, Shu Yang, Fangmin Chen, Xing Mei

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T01:09:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, their practical application is constrained by substantial memory and computational demands. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is considered an effective method to accelerate LLM inference. Despite its growing popularity in LLM model compression, PTQ deployment faces two major challenges. First, low-bit quantization leads to performance degradation. Second, restricted by the limited integer computing unit type on GPUs, quantized matrix operations with different precisions cannot be effectively accelerated. To address these issues, we introduce a novel arbitrary-bit quantization algorithm and inference framework, ABQ-LLM. It achieves superior performance across various quantization settings and enables efficient arbitrary-precision quantized inference on the GPU. ABQ-LLM introduces several key innovations: (1) a distribution correction method for transformer blocks to mitigate distribution differences caused by full quantization of weights and activations, improving performance at low bit-widths. (2) the bit balance strategy to counteract performance degradation from asymmetric distribution issues at very low bit-widths (e.g., 2-bit). (3) an innovative quantization acceleration framework that reconstructs the quantization matrix multiplication of arbitrary precision combinations based on BTC (Binary TensorCore) equivalents, gets rid of the limitations of INT4/INT8 computing units. ABQ-LLM can convert each component bit width gain into actual acceleration gain, maximizing performance under mixed precision(e.g., W6A6, W2A8). Based on W2*A8 quantization configuration on LLaMA-7B model, it achieved a WikiText2 perplexity of 7.59 (2.17$\downarrow $ vs 9.76 in AffineQuant). Compared to SmoothQuant, we realized 1.6$\times$ acceleration improvement and 2.7$\times$ memory compression gain.

### Rational Sensibility: LLM Enhanced Empathetic Response Generation Guided   by Self-presentation Theory
**Authors**: Linzhuang Sun, Yao Dong, Nan Xu, Jingxuan Wei, Bihui Yu, Yin Luo

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T01:03:13Z

**Summary**: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) provides human-centered Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) with a glimmer of hope. Empathy serves as a key emotional attribute of humanity, playing an irreplaceable role in human-centered AGI. Despite numerous researches aim to improve the cognitive empathy of models by incorporating external knowledge, there has been limited attention on the sensibility and rationality of the conversation itself, which are vital components of the empathy. However, the rationality information within the conversation is restricted, and previous methods of extending knowledge are subject to semantic conflict and single-role view. In this paper, we design an innovative encoder module inspired by self-presentation theory in sociology, which specifically processes sensibility and rationality sentences in dialogues. And we employ a LLM as a rational brain to decipher profound logical information preserved within the conversation, which assists our model in assessing the balance between sensibility and rationality to produce high-quality empathetic response. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms other methods in both automatic and human evaluations.

### Quality or Quantity? On Data Scale and Diversity in Adapting Large   Language Models for Low-Resource Translation
**Authors**: Vivek Iyer, Bhavitvya Malik, Pavel Stepachev, Pinzhen Chen, Barry Haddow, Alexandra Birch

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T00:59:38Z

**Summary**: Despite the recent popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Machine Translation (MT), their performance in low-resource translation still lags significantly behind Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models. In this paper, we explore what it would take to adapt LLMs for low-resource settings. In particular, we re-examine the role of two factors: a) the importance and application of parallel data, and b) diversity in Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Recently, parallel data has been shown to be less important for MT using LLMs than in previous MT research. Similarly, diversity during SFT has been shown to promote significant transfer in LLMs across languages and tasks. However, for low-resource LLM-MT, we show that the opposite is true for both of these considerations: a) parallel data is critical during both pretraining and SFT, and b) diversity tends to cause interference, not transfer. Our experiments, conducted with 3 LLMs across 2 low-resourced language groups - indigenous American and North-East Indian - reveal consistent patterns in both cases, underscoring the generalizability of our findings. We believe these insights will be valuable for scaling to massively multilingual LLM-MT models that can effectively serve lower-resource languages.

### Investigating LLM Applications in E-Commerce
**Authors**: Chester Palen-Michel, Ruixiang Wang, Yipeng Zhang, David Yu, Canran Xu, Zhe Wu

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T00:57:37Z

**Summary**: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing in various applications especially in e-commerce. One crucial step before the application of such LLMs in these fields is to understand and compare the performance in different use cases in such tasks. This paper explored the efficacy of LLMs in the e-commerce domain, focusing on instruction-tuning an open source LLM model with public e-commerce datasets of varying sizes and comparing the performance with the conventional models prevalent in industrial applications. We conducted a comprehensive comparison between LLMs and traditional pre-trained language models across specific tasks intrinsic to the e-commerce domain, namely classification, generation, summarization, and named entity recognition (NER). Furthermore, we examined the effectiveness of the current niche industrial application of very large LLM, using in-context learning, in e-commerce specific tasks. Our findings indicate that few-shot inference with very large LLMs often does not outperform fine-tuning smaller pre-trained models, underscoring the importance of task-specific model optimization.Additionally, we investigated different training methodologies such as single-task training, mixed-task training, and LoRA merging both within domain/tasks and between different tasks. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, this paper offers valuable insights into the potential effectiveness of LLMs to advance natural language processing capabilities within the e-commerce industry.

**Summary**: Advancements in chip design and manufacturing have enabled the processing of complex tasks such as deep learning and natural language processing, paving the way for the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). AI, on the other hand, can be leveraged to innovate and streamline semiconductor technology from planning and implementation to manufacturing. In this paper, we present \textit{Intelligent OPC Engineer Assistant}, an AI/LLM-powered methodology designed to solve the core manufacturing-aware optimization problem known as optical proximity correction (OPC). The methodology involves a reinforcement learning-based OPC recipe search and a customized multi-modal agent system for recipe summarization. Experiments demonstrate that our methodology can efficiently build OPC recipes on various chip designs with specially handled design topologies, a task that typically requires the full-time effort of OPC engineers with years of experience.

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T00:38:34Z

**Summary**: Anonymity is an important principle online. However, malicious actors have long used misleading identities to conduct fraud, spread disinformation, and carry out other deceptive schemes. With the advent of increasingly capable AI, bad actors can amplify the potential scale and effectiveness of their operations, intensifying the challenge of balancing anonymity and trustworthiness online. In this paper, we analyze the value of a new tool to address this challenge: "personhood credentials" (PHCs), digital credentials that empower users to demonstrate that they are real people -- not AIs -- to online services, without disclosing any personal information. Such credentials can be issued by a range of trusted institutions -- governments or otherwise. A PHC system, according to our definition, could be local or global, and does not need to be biometrics-based. Two trends in AI contribute to the urgency of the challenge: AI's increasing indistinguishability from people online (i.e., lifelike content and avatars, agentic activity), and AI's increasing scalability (i.e., cost-effectiveness, accessibility). Drawing on a long history of research into anonymous credentials and "proof-of-personhood" systems, personhood credentials give people a way to signal their trustworthiness on online platforms, and offer service providers new tools for reducing misuse by bad actors. In contrast, existing countermeasures to automated deception -- such as CAPTCHAs -- are inadequate against sophisticated AI, while stringent identity verification solutions are insufficiently private for many use-cases. After surveying the benefits of personhood credentials, we also examine deployment risks and design challenges. We conclude with actionable next steps for policymakers, technologists, and standards bodies to consider in consultation with the public.

### A Survey on Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Yizheng Huang, Jimmy Huang

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T00:17:02Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) merges retrieval methods with deep learning advancements to address the static limitations of large language models (LLMs) by enabling the dynamic integration of up-to-date external information. This methodology, focusing primarily on the text domain, provides a cost-effective solution to the generation of plausible but possibly incorrect responses by LLMs, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of their outputs through the use of real-world data. As RAG grows in complexity and incorporates multiple concepts that can influence its performance, this paper organizes the RAG paradigm into four categories: pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation, offering a detailed perspective from the retrieval viewpoint. It outlines RAG's evolution and discusses the field's progression through the analysis of significant studies. Additionally, the paper introduces evaluation methods for RAG, addressing the challenges faced and proposing future research directions. By offering an organized framework and categorization, the study aims to consolidate existing research on RAG, clarify its technological underpinnings, and highlight its potential to broaden the adaptability and applications of LLMs.

**Authors**: Siyuan Wu, Yue Huang, Chujie Gao, Dongping Chen, Qihui Zhang, Yao Wan, Tianyi Zhou, Xiangliang Zhang, Jianfeng Gao, Chaowei Xiao, Lichao Sun

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T00:14:51Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama3 have significantly impacted various fields by enabling high-quality synthetic data generation and reducing dependence on expensive human-generated datasets. Despite this, challenges remain in the areas of generalization, controllability, diversity, and truthfulness within the existing generative frameworks. To address these challenges, this paper presents UniGen, a comprehensive LLM-powered framework designed to produce diverse, accurate, and highly controllable datasets. UniGen is adaptable, supporting all types of text datasets and enhancing the generative process through innovative mechanisms. To augment data diversity, UniGen incorporates an attribute-guided generation module and a group checking feature. For accuracy, it employs a code-based mathematical assessment for label verification alongside a retrieval-augmented generation technique for factual validation. The framework also allows for user-specified constraints, enabling customization of the data generation process to suit particular requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior quality of data generated by UniGen, and each module within UniGen plays a critical role in this enhancement. Additionally, UniGen is applied in two practical scenarios: benchmarking LLMs and data augmentation. The results indicate that UniGen effectively supports dynamic and evolving benchmarking, and that data augmentation improves LLM capabilities in various domains, including agent-oriented abilities and reasoning skills.

### NanoFlow: Towards Optimal Large Language Model Serving Throughput

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T23:00:40Z

**Summary**: The increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) has resulted in a surging demand for planet-scale serving systems, where tens of thousands of GPUs continuously serve hundreds of millions of users. Consequently, throughput (under reasonable latency constraints) has emerged as a key metric that determines serving systems' performance. To boost throughput, various methods of inter-device parallelism (e.g., data, tensor, pipeline) have been explored. However, existing methods do not consider overlapping the utilization of different resources within a single device, leading to underutilization and sub-optimal performance.   We propose NanoFlow, a novel serving framework that exploits intra-device parallelism, which overlaps the usage of resources including compute, memory, and network within a single device through operation co-scheduling. To exploit intra-device parallelism, NanoFlow introduces two key innovations: First, NanoFlow splits requests into nano-batches at the granularity of operations, which breaks the dependency of sequential operations in LLM inference and enables overlapping; then, to get benefit from overlapping, NanoFlow uses an operation-level pipeline with execution unit scheduling, which partitions the device's functional units and simultaneously executes different operations in each unit. NanoFlow automates the pipeline setup using a parameter search algorithm, which enables easily porting NanoFlow to different models. We implement NanoFlow on NVIDIA GPUs and evaluate end-to-end serving throughput on several popular models such as LLaMA-2-70B, Mixtral 8x7B, LLaMA-3-8B, etc.. With practical workloads, NanoFlow provides 1.91x throughput boost compared to state-of-the-art serving systems achieving 59% to 72% of optimal throughput across ported models.

### Quantum Many-Body Physics Calculations with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Haining Pan, Nayantara Mudur, Will Taranto, Maria Tikhanovskaya, Subhashini Venugopalan, Yasaman Bahri, Michael P. Brenner, Eun-Ah Kim

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T22:42:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an unprecedented ability to perform complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific reasoning. We demonstrate that with carefully designed prompts, LLMs can accurately carry out key calculations in research papers in theoretical physics. We focus on a broadly used approximation method in quantum physics: the Hartree-Fock method, requiring an analytic multi-step calculation deriving approximate Hamiltonian and corresponding self-consistency equations. To carry out the calculations using LLMs, we design multi-step prompt templates that break down the analytic calculation into standardized steps with placeholders for problem-specific information. We evaluate GPT-4's performance in executing the calculation for 15 research papers from the past decade, demonstrating that, with correction of intermediate steps, it can correctly derive the final Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian in 13 cases and makes minor errors in 2 cases. Aggregating across all research papers, we find an average score of 87.5 (out of 100) on the execution of individual calculation steps. Overall, the requisite skill for doing these calculations is at the graduate level in quantum condensed matter theory. We further use LLMs to mitigate the two primary bottlenecks in this evaluation process: (i) extracting information from papers to fill in templates and (ii) automatic scoring of the calculation steps, demonstrating good results in both cases. The strong performance is the first step for developing algorithms that automatically explore theoretical hypotheses at an unprecedented scale.

**Authors**: Mengya Hu, Rui Xu, Deren Lei, Yaxi Li, Mingyu Wang, Emily Ching, Eslam Kamal, Alex Deng

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T22:13:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are highly capable but face latency challenges in real-time applications, such as conducting online hallucination detection. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel framework that leverages a small language model (SLM) classifier for initial detection, followed by a LLM as constrained reasoner to generate detailed explanations for detected hallucinated content. This study optimizes the real-time interpretable hallucination detection by introducing effective prompting techniques that align LLM-generated explanations with SLM decisions. Empirical experiment results demonstrate its effectiveness, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.

### TReX- Reusing Vision Transformer's Attention for Efficient Xbar-based   Computing
**Authors**: Abhishek Moitra, Abhiroop Bhattacharjee, Youngeun Kim, Priyadarshini Panda

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T21:51:38Z

**Summary**: Due to the high computation overhead of Vision Transformers (ViTs), In-memory Computing architectures are being researched towards energy-efficient deployment in edge-computing scenarios. Prior works have proposed efficient algorithm-hardware co-design and IMC-architectural improvements to improve the energy-efficiency of IMC-implemented ViTs. However, all prior works have neglected the overhead and co-depencence of attention blocks on the accuracy-energy-delay-area of IMC-implemented ViTs. To this end, we propose TReX- an attention-reuse-driven ViT optimization framework that effectively performs attention reuse in ViT models to achieve optimal accuracy-energy-delay-area tradeoffs. TReX optimally chooses the transformer encoders for attention reuse to achieve near iso-accuracy performance while meeting the user-specified delay requirement. Based on our analysis on the Imagenet-1k dataset, we find that TReX achieves 2.3x (2.19x) EDAP reduction and 1.86x (1.79x) TOPS/mm2 improvement with ~1% accuracy drop in case of DeiT-S (LV-ViT-S) ViT models. Additionally, TReX achieves high accuracy at high EDAP reduction compared to state-of-the-art token pruning and weight sharing approaches. On NLP tasks such as CoLA, TReX leads to 2% higher non-ideal accuracy compared to baseline at 1.6x lower EDAP.

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T20:35:42Z

**Summary**: This paper explores the intersection of data visualization and Large Language Models (LLMs). Driven by the need to make a broader range of data visualization types accessible for novice users, we present a guided LLM-based pipeline designed to transform data, guided by high-level user questions (referred to as macro-queries), into a diverse set of useful visualizations. This approach leverages various prompting techniques, fine-tuning inspired by Abela's Chart Taxonomy, and integrated SQL tool usage.

**Authors**: Sheng Li, Geng Yuan, Yawen Wu, Yue Dai, Tianyu Wang, Chao Wu, Alex K. Jones, Jingtong Hu, Yanzhi Wang, Xulong Tang

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T19:46:37Z

**Summary**: Many emerging applications, such as robot-assisted eldercare and object recognition, generally employ deep learning neural networks (DNNs) and require the deployment of DNN models on edge devices. These applications naturally require i) handling streaming-in inference requests and ii) fine-tuning the deployed models to adapt to possible deployment scenario changes. Continual learning (CL) is widely adopted to satisfy these needs. CL is a popular deep learning paradigm that handles both continuous model fine-tuning and overtime inference requests. However, an inappropriate model fine-tuning scheme could involve significant redundancy and consume considerable time and energy, making it challenging to apply CL on edge devices. In this paper, we propose ETuner, an efficient edge continual learning framework that optimizes inference accuracy, fine-tuning execution time, and energy efficiency through both inter-tuning and intra-tuning optimizations. Experimental results show that, on average, ETuner reduces overall fine-tuning execution time by 64%, energy consumption by 56%, and improves average inference accuracy by 1.75% over the immediate model fine-tuning approach.

### LaMSUM: Creating Extractive Summaries of User Generated Content using   LLMs
**Authors**: Garima Chhikara, Anurag Sharma, V. Gurucharan, Kripabandhu Ghosh, Abhijnan Chakraborty

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T19:25:51Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, including summarization. LLMs inherently produce abstractive summaries by paraphrasing the original text, while the generation of extractive summaries - selecting specific subsets from the original text - remains largely unexplored. LLMs have a limited context window size, restricting the amount of data that can be processed at once. We tackle this challenge by introducing LaMSUM, a novel multi-level framework designed to generate extractive summaries from large collections of user-generated text using LLMs. LaMSUM integrates summarization with different voting methods to achieve robust summaries. Extensive evaluation using four popular LLMs (Llama 3, Mixtral, Gemini, GPT-4o) demonstrates that LaMSUM outperforms state-of-the-art extractive summarization methods. Overall, this work represents one of the first attempts to achieve extractive summarization by leveraging the power of LLMs, and is likely to spark further interest within the research community.

### Bridging the gap between natural user expression with complex automation   programming in smart homes
**Authors**: Yingtian Shi, Xiaoyi Liu, Chun Yu, Tianao Yang, Cheng Gao, Chen Liang, Yuanchun Shi

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T19:00:50Z

**Summary**: A long-standing challenge in end-user programming (EUP) is to trade off between natural user expression and the complexity of programming tasks. As large language models (LLMs) are empowered to handle semantic inference and natural language understanding, it remains under-explored how such capabilities can facilitate end-users to configure complex automation more naturally and easily. We propose AwareAuto, an EUP system that standardizes user expression and finishes two-step inference with the LLMs to achieve automation generation. AwareAuto allows contextual, multi-modality, and flexible user expression to configure complex automation tasks (e.g., dynamic parameters, multiple conditional branches, and temporal constraints), which are non-manageable in traditional EUP solutions. By studying realistic, complex rules data, AwareAuto gains 91.7% accuracy in matching user intentions and feasibility. We introduced user interaction to ensure system controllability and usability. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of incorporating LLMs in end-user programming techniques and grounding complex smart home contexts.

### Can LLMs Understand Social Norms in Autonomous Driving Games?
**Authors**: Boxuan Wang, Haonan Duan, Yanhao Feng, Xu Chen, Yongjie Fu, Zhaobin Mo, Xuan Di

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T18:39:00Z

**Summary**: Social norm is defined as a shared standard of acceptable behavior in a society. The emergence of social norms fosters coordination among agents without any hard-coded rules, which is crucial for the large-scale deployment of AVs in an intelligent transportation system. This paper explores the application of LLMs in understanding and modeling social norms in autonomous driving games. We introduce LLMs into autonomous driving games as intelligent agents who make decisions according to text prompts. These agents are referred to as LLM-based agents. Our framework involves LLM-based agents playing Markov games in a multi-agent system (MAS), allowing us to investigate the emergence of social norms among individual agents. We aim to identify social norms by designing prompts and utilizing LLMs on textual information related to the environment setup and the observations of LLM-based agents. Using the OpenAI Chat API powered by GPT-4.0, we conduct experiments to simulate interactions and evaluate the performance of LLM-based agents in two driving scenarios: unsignalized intersection and highway platoon. The results show that LLM-based agents can handle dynamically changing environments in Markov games, and social norms evolve among LLM-based agents in both scenarios. In the intersection game, LLM-based agents tend to adopt a conservative driving policy when facing a potential car crash. The advantage of LLM-based agents in games lies in their strong operability and analyzability, which facilitate experimental design.

### Enhancing Transferability of Adversarial Attacks with GE-AdvGAN+: A   Comprehensive Framework for Gradient Editing
**Authors**: Zhibo Jin, Jiayu Zhang, Zhiyu Zhu, Yuchen Zhang, Jiahao Huang, Jianlong Zhou, Fang Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T18:26:31Z

**Summary**: Transferable adversarial attacks pose significant threats to deep neural networks, particularly in black-box scenarios where internal model information is inaccessible. Studying adversarial attack methods helps advance the performance of defense mechanisms and explore model vulnerabilities. These methods can uncover and exploit weaknesses in models, promoting the development of more robust architectures. However, current methods for transferable attacks often come with substantial computational costs, limiting their deployment and application, especially in edge computing scenarios. Adversarial generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), are characterized by their ability to generate samples without the need for retraining after an initial training phase. GE-AdvGAN, a recent method for transferable adversarial attacks, is based on this principle. In this paper, we propose a novel general framework for gradient editing-based transferable attacks, named GE-AdvGAN+, which integrates nearly all mainstream attack methods to enhance transferability while significantly reducing computational resource consumption. Our experiments demonstrate the compatibility and effectiveness of our framework. Compared to the baseline AdvGAN, our best-performing method, GE-AdvGAN++, achieves an average ASR improvement of 47.8. Additionally, it surpasses the latest competing algorithm, GE-AdvGAN, with an average ASR increase of 5.9. The framework also exhibits enhanced computational efficiency, achieving 2217.7 FPS, outperforming traditional methods such as BIM and MI-FGSM. The implementation code for our GE-AdvGAN+ framework is available at https://github.com/GEAdvGANP

### Unmasking Context Injection on Interactive Large Language Models
**Authors**: Cheng'an Wei, Yue Zhao, Yujia Gong, Kai Chen, Lu Xiang, Shenchen Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T18:17:38Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Llama have become prevalent in real-world applications, exhibiting impressive text generation performance. LLMs are fundamentally developed from a scenario where the input data remains static and unstructured. To behave interactively, LLM-based chat systems must integrate prior chat history as context into their inputs, following a pre-defined structure. However, LLMs cannot separate user inputs from context, enabling context injection. This paper introduces a methodology to systematically inject misleading context (i.e., chat history) into LLM conversations without prior knowledge of the target model. We formalize context injection through a response retrieval task and propose an LLM-Guided Genetic Algorithm (LLMGA) to create effective injection prompts, leading the target LLM to recognize injected context as genuine. We explore how context injection can be used to elicit disallowed content, posing risks of illegal actions and inappropriate responses. Our elicitation strategies, including acceptance elicitation and word anonymization, can effectively elicit disallowed responses with success rates reaching 97% on ChatGPT. Comprehensive evaluations on real-world LLMs including ChatGPT and Llama-2/3 demonstrate the efficacy of LLMGA and our injection strategies. We also discuss potential countermeasures that can be adopted for detecting injection and developing more secure models. Our findings provide insights into the challenges associated with the real-world deployment of LLMs for interactive and structured data scenarios.

### Controllable Text Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey
**Authors**: Xun Liang, Hanyu Wang, Yezhaohui Wang, Shichao Song, Jiawei Yang, Simin Niu, Jie Hu, Dan Liu, Shunyu Yao, Feiyu Xiong, Zhiyu Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T17:59:04Z

**Summary**: In Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated high text generation quality. However, in real-world applications, LLMs must meet increasingly complex requirements. Beyond avoiding misleading or inappropriate content, LLMs are also expected to cater to specific user needs, such as imitating particular writing styles or generating text with poetic richness. These varied demands have driven the development of Controllable Text Generation (CTG) techniques, which ensure that outputs adhere to predefined control conditions--such as safety, sentiment, thematic consistency, and linguistic style--while maintaining high standards of helpfulness, fluency, and diversity.   This paper systematically reviews the latest advancements in CTG for LLMs, offering a comprehensive definition of its core concepts and clarifying the requirements for control conditions and text quality. We categorize CTG tasks into two primary types: content control and attribute control. The key methods are discussed, including model retraining, fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, prompt engineering, latent space manipulation, and decoding-time intervention. We analyze each method's characteristics, advantages, and limitations, providing nuanced insights for achieving generation control. Additionally, we review CTG evaluation methods, summarize its applications across domains, and address key challenges in current research, including reduced fluency and practicality. We also propose several appeals, such as placing greater emphasis on real-world applications in future research. This paper aims to offer valuable guidance to researchers and developers in the field.

### Understanding Reference Policies in Direct Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Yixin Liu, Pengfei Liu, Arman Cohan

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T17:56:15Z

**Summary**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a widely used training method for the instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we explore an under-investigated aspect of DPO - its dependency on the reference model or policy. Such reference policies, typically instantiated as the model to be further fine-tuned, are important since they can impose an upper limit on DPO's effectiveness. Therefore, we address three related research questions in this work. First, we explore the optimal strength of the KL divergence constraint in DPO, which penalizes deviations from the reference policy, and find that DPO is sensitive to this strength. Next, we examine the necessity of the KL-constraint from the reference policies in DPO by providing both theoretical and empirical comparisons between DPO and related learning objectives, demonstrating DPO's superiority in this controlled setting. Additionally, we investigate whether DPO benefits from stronger reference policies, finding that a stronger reference policy can lead to improved performance, but only when it is similar to the model being fine-tuned. Our findings highlight the confounding role of reference policies in DPO and offer insights for best practices, while also identifying open research questions for future studies.

### xGen-VideoSyn-1: High-fidelity Text-to-Video Synthesis with Compressed   Representations

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T17:55:22Z

**Summary**: We present xGen-VideoSyn-1, a text-to-video (T2V) generation model capable of producing realistic scenes from textual descriptions. Building on recent advancements, such as OpenAI's Sora, we explore the latent diffusion model (LDM) architecture and introduce a video variational autoencoder (VidVAE). VidVAE compresses video data both spatially and temporally, significantly reducing the length of visual tokens and the computational demands associated with generating long-sequence videos. To further address the computational costs, we propose a divide-and-merge strategy that maintains temporal consistency across video segments. Our Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model incorporates spatial and temporal self-attention layers, enabling robust generalization across different timeframes and aspect ratios. We have devised a data processing pipeline from the very beginning and collected over 13M high-quality video-text pairs. The pipeline includes multiple steps such as clipping, text detection, motion estimation, aesthetics scoring, and dense captioning based on our in-house video-LLM model. Training the VidVAE and DiT models required approximately 40 and 642 H100 days, respectively. Our model supports over 14-second 720p video generation in an end-to-end way and demonstrates competitive performance against state-of-the-art T2V models.

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T17:44:40Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, MedPaLM-2, and Med-Gemini achieve performance competitively with human experts across various medical benchmarks. However, they still face challenges in making professional diagnoses akin to physicians, particularly in efficiently gathering patient information and reasoning the final diagnosis. To this end, we introduce the RuleAlign framework, designed to align LLMs with specific diagnostic rules. We develop a medical dialogue dataset comprising rule-based communications between patients and physicians and design an alignment learning approach through preference learning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We hope that our work can serve as an inspiration for exploring the potential of LLMs as AI physicians.

### Good Modelling Software Practices
**Authors**: Carsten Lemmen, Philipp Sebastian Sommer

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T17:27:45Z

**Summary**: Frequently in socio-environmental sciences, models are used as tools to represent, understand, project and predict the behaviour of these complex systems. Along the modelling chain, Good Modelling Practices have been evolving that ensure -- amongst others -- that models are transparent and their results replicable. Whenever such models are represented in software, Good Modelling meet Good Software Practices, such as a tractable development workflow, good code, collaborative development and governance, continuous integration and deployment; and they meet Good Scientific Practices, such as attribution of copyrights and acknowledgement of intellectual property, publication of a software paper and archiving. Too often in existing socio-environmental model software, these practices have been regarded as an add-on to be considered at a later stage only; modellers have shied away from publishing their model as open source out of fear that having to add good practices is too demanding. We here argue for making a habit of following a list of simple and not so simple practices early on in the implementation of the model life cycle. We contextualise cherry-picked and hands-on practices for supporting Good Modelling Practice, and we demonstrate their application in the example context of the Viable North Sea fisheries socio-ecological systems model.

### Prefix Guidance: A Steering Wheel for Large Language Models to Defend   Against Jailbreak Attacks
**Authors**: Jiawei Zhao, Kejiang Chen, Xiaojian Yuan, Weiming Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T17:21:34Z

**Summary**: In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various tasks. However, research indicates that LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where adversaries can induce the generation of harmful content through meticulously crafted prompts. This vulnerability poses significant challenges to the secure use and promotion of LLMs. Existing defense methods offer protection from different perspectives but often suffer from insufficient effectiveness or a significant impact on the model's capabilities. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play and easy-to-deploy jailbreak defense framework, namely Prefix Guidance (PG), which guides the model to identify harmful prompts by directly setting the first few tokens of the model's output. This approach combines the model's inherent security capabilities with an external classifier to defend against jailbreak attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PG across three models and five attack methods. Compared to baselines, our approach is generally more effective on average. Additionally, results on the Just-Eval benchmark further confirm PG's superiority to preserve the model's performance. our code is available at https://github.com/weiyezhimeng/Prefix-Guidance.

### Towards Evaluating and Building Versatile Large Language Models for   Medicine
**Authors**: Chaoyi Wu, Pengcheng Qiu, Jinxin Liu, Hongfei Gu, Na Li, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, Weidi Xie

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T17:01:34Z

**Summary**: In this study, we present MedS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in clinical contexts. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on multiple-choice question answering, MedS-Bench spans 11 high-level clinical tasks, including clinical report summarization, treatment recommendations, diagnosis, named entity recognition, and medical concept explanation, among others. We evaluated six leading LLMs, e.g., MEDITRON, Mistral, InternLM 2, Llama 3, GPT-4, and Claude-3.5 using few-shot prompting, and found that even the most sophisticated models struggle with these complex tasks. To address these limitations, we developed MedS-Ins, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for medicine. MedS-Ins comprises 58 medically oriented language corpora, totaling 13.5 million samples across 122 tasks. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we conducted a proof-of-concept experiment by performing instruction tuning on a lightweight, open-source medical language model. The resulting model, MMedIns-Llama 3, significantly outperformed existing models across nearly all clinical tasks. To promote further advancements in the application of LLMs to clinical challenges, we have made the MedS-Ins dataset fully accessible and invite the research community to contribute to its expansion.Additionally, we have launched a dynamic leaderboard for MedS-Bench, which we plan to regularly update the test set to track progress and enhance the adaptation of general LLMs to the medical domain.

### Beyond Shortsighted Navigation: Merging Best View Trajectory Planning   with Robot Navigation
**Authors**: Srinath Tankasala, Roberto Martín-Martín, Mitch Pryor

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T16:08:45Z

**Summary**: Gathering visual information effectively to monitor known environments is a key challenge in robotics. To be as efficient as human surveyors, robotic systems must continuously collect observational data required to complete their survey task. Inspection personnel instinctively know to look at relevant equipment that happens to be ``along the way.'' In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for continuous long-horizon viewpoint planning, for ground robots, applied to tasks involving patrolling, monitoring or visual data gathering in known environments. Our approach to Long Horizon Viewpoint Planning (LHVP), enables the robot to autonomously navigate and collect environmental data optimizing for coverage over the horizon of the patrol. Leveraging a quadruped's mobility and sensory capabilities, our LHVP framework plans patrol paths that account for coupling the viewpoint planner for the arm camera with the mobile base's navigation planner. The viewpath optimization algorithm seeks a balance between comprehensive environmental coverage and dynamically feasible movements, thus ensuring prolonged and effective operation in scenarios including monitoring, security surveillance, and disaster response. We validate our approach through simulations and in the real world and show that our LHVP significantly outperforms naive patrolling methods in terms of area coverage generating information-gathering trajectories for the robot arm. Our results indicate a promising direction for the deployment of mobile robots in long-term, autonomous surveying, and environmental data collection tasks, highlighting the potential of intelligent robotic systems in challenging real-world applications.

### Uncovering Latent Arguments in Social Media Messaging by Employing   LLMs-in-the-Loop Strategy
**Authors**: Tunazzina Islam, Dan Goldwasser

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T15:52:13Z

**Summary**: The widespread use of social media has led to a surge in popularity for automated methods of analyzing public opinion. Supervised methods are adept at text categorization, yet the dynamic nature of social media discussions poses a continual challenge for these techniques due to the constant shifting of the focus. On the other hand, traditional unsupervised methods for extracting themes from public discourse, such as topic modeling, often reveal overarching patterns that might not capture specific nuances. Consequently, a significant portion of research into social media discourse still depends on labor-intensive manual coding techniques and a human-in-the-loop approach, which are both time-consuming and costly. In this work, we study the problem of discovering arguments associated with a specific theme. We propose a generic LLMs-in-the-Loop strategy that leverages the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract latent arguments from social media messaging. To demonstrate our approach, we apply our framework to contentious topics. We use two publicly available datasets: (1) the climate campaigns dataset of 14k Facebook ads with 25 themes and (2) the COVID-19 vaccine campaigns dataset of 9k Facebook ads with 14 themes. Additionally, we design a downstream task as stance prediction by leveraging talking points in climate debates. Furthermore, we analyze demographic targeting and the adaptation of messaging based on real-world events.

### The Oscars of AI Theater: A Survey on Role-Playing with Language Models
**Authors**: Nuo Chen, Yan Wang, Yang Deng, Jia Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T15:44:27Z

**Summary**: This survey explores the burgeoning field of role-playing with language models, focusing on their development from early persona-based models to advanced character-driven simulations facilitated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Initially confined to simple persona consistency due to limited model capabilities, role-playing tasks have now expanded to embrace complex character portrayals involving character consistency, behavioral alignment, and overall attractiveness. We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the critical components in designing these systems, including data, models and alignment, agent architecture and evaluation. This survey not only outlines the current methodologies and challenges, such as managing dynamic personal profiles and achieving high-level persona consistency but also suggests avenues for future research in improving the depth and realism of role-playing applications.

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have had a significant impact on diverse research domains, including medicine and healthcare. However, the potential of LLMs as copilots in medical education remains underexplored. Current AI-assisted educational tools are limited by their solitary learning approach and inability to simulate the multi-disciplinary and interactive nature of actual medical training. To address these limitations, we propose MEDCO (Medical EDucation COpilots), a novel multi-agent-based copilot system specially developed to emulate real-world medical training environments. MEDCO incorporates three primary agents: an agentic patient, an expert doctor, and a radiologist, facilitating a multi-modal and interactive learning environment. Our framework emphasizes the learning of proficient question-asking skills, multi-disciplinary collaboration, and peer discussions between students. Our experiments show that simulated virtual students who underwent training with MEDCO not only achieved substantial performance enhancements comparable to those of advanced models, but also demonstrated human-like learning behaviors and improvements, coupled with an increase in the number of learning samples. This work contributes to medical education by introducing a copilot that implements an interactive and collaborative learning approach. It also provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of AI-integrated training paradigms.

### GenderCARE: A Comprehensive Framework for Assessing and Reducing Gender   Bias in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Kunsheng Tang, Wenbo Zhou, Jie Zhang, Aishan Liu, Gelei Deng, Shuai Li, Peigui Qi, Weiming Zhang, Tianwei Zhang, Nenghai Yu

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T15:35:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in natural language generation, but they have also been observed to magnify societal biases, particularly those related to gender. In response to this issue, several benchmarks have been proposed to assess gender bias in LLMs. However, these benchmarks often lack practical flexibility or inadvertently introduce biases. To address these shortcomings, we introduce GenderCARE, a comprehensive framework that encompasses innovative Criteria, bias Assessment, Reduction techniques, and Evaluation metrics for quantifying and mitigating gender bias in LLMs. To begin, we establish pioneering criteria for gender equality benchmarks, spanning dimensions such as inclusivity, diversity, explainability, objectivity, robustness, and realisticity. Guided by these criteria, we construct GenderPair, a novel pair-based benchmark designed to assess gender bias in LLMs comprehensively. Our benchmark provides standardized and realistic evaluations, including previously overlooked gender groups such as transgender and non-binary individuals. Furthermore, we develop effective debiasing techniques that incorporate counterfactual data augmentation and specialized fine-tuning strategies to reduce gender bias in LLMs without compromising their overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate a significant reduction in various gender bias benchmarks, with reductions peaking at over 90% and averaging above 35% across 17 different LLMs. Importantly, these reductions come with minimal variability in mainstream language tasks, remaining below 2%. By offering a realistic assessment and tailored reduction of gender biases, we hope that our GenderCARE can represent a significant step towards achieving fairness and equity in LLMs. More details are available at https://github.com/kstanghere/GenderCARE-ccs24.
