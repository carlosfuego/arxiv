 ### Combinatorial Multi-Access Coded Caching with Private Caches under   Intersecting Index Constraints
**Authors**: Dhruv Pratap Singh, Anjana A. Mahesh, B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T17:07:59Z

**Summary**: We consider the coded caching system where each user, equipped with a private cache, accesses a distinct r-subset of access caches. A central server housing a library of files populates both private and access caches using uncoded placement. In this work, we focus on a constrained indexing regime, referred to as the intersection class, in which the sets used to index the demands of each user must have a nonempty intersection. This regime models resource-limited IoT scenarios such as edge-assisted IoT systems, where devices with small private caches connect to a small number of shared caches. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which the system parameters fall within this intersection class. Under this condition, we propose a centralized coded caching scheme and characterize its rate-memory trade-off. Next, we define a uniform-intersection subclass and establish a condition under which the system belongs to this subclass. Within this subclass, the proposed scheme has a regular structure, with each transmission benefiting the same number of users, and we characterize its rate-memory trade-off. Additionally, we derive an index coding-based lower bound on the minimum achievable worst-case rate under uncoded placement. Finally, we provide numerical comparisons between the rate of the proposed scheme, the new lower bound, and bounds from the original work.

### Full Version: (De/Re)-Composition of Data-Parallel Computations via   Multi-Dimensional Homomorphisms
**Authors**: Ari Rasch

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:23:35Z

**Summary**: We formally introduce a systematic (de/re)-composition approach, based on the algebraic formalism of "Multi-Dimensional Homomorphisms (MDHs)". Our approach is designed as general enough to be applicable to a wide range of data-parallel computations and for various kinds of target parallel architectures. To efficiently target the deep and complex memory and core hierarchies of contemporary architectures, we exploit our introduced (de/re)-composition approach for a correct-by-construction, parametrized cache blocking and parallelization strategy. We show that our approach is powerful enough to express, in the same formalism, the (de/re)-composition strategies of different classes of state-of-the-art approaches (scheduling-based, polyhedral, etc), and we demonstrate that the parameters of our strategies enable systematically generating code that can be fully automatically optimized (auto-tuned) for the particular target architecture and characteristics of the input and output data (e.g., their sizes and memory layouts). Particularly, our experiments confirm that via auto-tuning, we achieve higher performance than state-of-the-art approaches, including hand-optimized solutions provided by vendors (such as NVIDIA cuBLAS/cuDNN and Intel oneMKL/oneDNN), on real-world data sets and for a variety of data-parallel computations, including: linear algebra routines, stencil and quantum chemistry computations, data mining algorithms, and computations that recently gained high attention due to their relevance for deep learning.

**Authors**: Hongtao Xu, Zibo Wu, Mingzhen Li, Weile Jia

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T12:55:59Z

**Summary**: Solving quantum many-body problems is one of the fundamental challenges in quantum chemistry. While neural network quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a promising computational tool, its training process incurs exponentially growing computational demands, becoming prohibitively expensive for large-scale molecular systems and creating fundamental scalability barriers for real-world applications. To address above challenges, we present \ours, a high-performance NQS training framework for \textit{ab initio} electronic structure calculations. First, we propose a scalable sampling parallelism strategy with multi-layers workload division and hybrid sampling scheme, which break the scalability barriers for large-scale NQS training. Then, we introduce multi-level parallelism local energy parallelism, enabling more efficient local energy computation. Last, we employ cache-centric optimization for transformer-based \textit{ansatz} and incorporate it with sampling parallelism strategy, which further speedup up the NQS training and achieve stable memory footprint at scale. Experiments demonstrate that \ours accelerate NQS training with up to 8.41x speedup and attains a parallel efficiency up to 95.8\% when scaling to 1,536 nodes.

### VQ-LLM: High-performance Code Generation for Vector Quantization   Augmented LLM Inference
**Authors**: Zihan Liu, Xinhao Luo, Junxian Guo, Wentao Ni, Yangjie Zhou, Yue Guan, Cong Guo, Weihao Cui, Yu Feng, Minyi Guo, Yuhao Zhu, Minjia Zhang, Jingwen Leng, Chen Jin

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T05:54:40Z

**Summary**: In this work, we design and implement VQ-LLM, an efficient fused Vector Quantization (VQ) kernel generation framework. We first introduce a software abstraction called codebook cache to optimize codebook access efficiency and support the integration of VQ with various computations. The codebook cache adaptively stores different entries across the GPU's memory hierarchy, including off-chip global memory, on-chip shared memory, and registers. Centered around the codebook cache, we design an efficient computation engine that optimizes memory traffic during computations involving codebooks. This compute engine adopts the codebook-centric dataflow and fusion optimizations. Additionally, we provide adaptive heuristics to tailor parameter selection in our optimizations to diverse VQ configurations. Our optimizations achieve an average latency reduction of 46.13% compared to unoptimized versions. Compared to existing open-source implementations, our methods decrease latency by 64.36% to 99.1%. A final comparison with state-of-the-art element-wise quantization methods like AWQ and KVQuant shows that our VQ-LLM is practically viable, achieving latencies close or even better latencies to those at equivalent bit-widths, potentially offering greater accuracy.

**Authors**: Zhuocheng Zhang, Yang Feng, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T05:45:43Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a pivotal role in modern large language model applications, with numerous existing frameworks offering a wide range of functionalities to facilitate the development of RAG systems. However, we have identified several persistent challenges in these frameworks, including difficulties in algorithm reproduction and sharing, lack of new techniques, and high system overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{FlexRAG}, an open-source framework specifically designed for research and prototyping. FlexRAG supports text-based, multimodal, and network-based RAG, providing comprehensive lifecycle support alongside efficient asynchronous processing and persistent caching capabilities. By offering a robust and flexible solution, FlexRAG enables researchers to rapidly develop, deploy, and share advanced RAG systems.

### RetroInfer: A Vector-Storage Approach for Scalable Long-Context LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Yaoqi Chen, Jinkai Zhang, Baotong Lu, Qianxi Zhang, Chengruidong Zhang, Jingjia Luo, Di Liu, Huiqiang Jiang, Qi Chen, Jing Liu, Bailu Ding, Xiao Yan, Jiawei Jiang, Chen Chen, Mingxing Zhang, Yuqing Yang, Fan Yang, Mao Yang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T05:21:58Z

**Summary**: The growing context lengths of large language models (LLMs) pose significant challenges for efficient inference, primarily due to GPU memory and bandwidth constraints. We present RetroInfer, a novel system that reconceptualizes the key-value (KV) cache as a vector storage system which exploits the inherent attention sparsity to accelerate long-context LLM inference. At its core is the wave index, an Attention-aWare VEctor index that enables efficient and accurate retrieval of critical tokens through techniques such as tripartite attention approximation, accuracy-bounded attention estimation, and segmented clustering. Complementing this is the wave buffer, which coordinates KV cache placement and overlaps computation and data transfer across GPU and CPU to sustain high throughput. Unlike prior sparsity-based methods that struggle with token selection and hardware coordination, RetroInfer delivers robust performance without compromising model accuracy. Experiments on long-context benchmarks show up to 4.5X speedup over full attention within GPU memory limits and up to 10.5X over sparse attention baselines when KV cache is extended to CPU memory, all while preserving full-attention-level accuracy.

### Generative AI-enhanced Low-Altitude UAV-Mounted Stacked Intelligent   Metasurfaces
**Authors**: Geng Sun, Mingzhe Fan, Lei Zhang, Hongyang Pan, Jiahui Li, Chuang Zhang, Linyao Li, Changyuan Zhao, Chau Yuen

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T03:22:32Z

**Summary**: Wireless communication systems face significant challenges in meeting the increasing demands for higher data rates and more reliable connectivity in complex environments. Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a promising technology for realizing wave-domain signal processing, with mobile SIMs offering superior communication performance compared to their fixed counterparts. In this paper, we investigate a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted SIMs (UAV-SIMs) assisted communication system within the low-altitude economy (LAE) networks paradigm, where UAVs function as both base stations that cache SIM-processed data and mobile platforms that flexibly deploy SIMs to enhance uplink communications from ground users. To maximize network capacity, we formulate a UAV-SIM-based joint optimization problem (USBJOP) that comprehensively addresses three critical aspects: the association between UAV-SIMs and users, the three-dimensional positioning of UAV-SIMs, and the phase shifts across multiple SIM layers. Due to the inherent non-convexity and NP-hardness of USBJOP, we decompose it into three sub-optimization problems, \textit{i.e.}, association between UAV-SIMs and users optimization problem (AUUOP), UAV location optimization problem (ULOP), and UAV-SIM phase shifts optimization problem (USPSOP), and solve them using an alternating optimization strategy. Specifically, we transform AUUOP and ULOP into convex forms solvable by the CVX tool, while addressing USPSOP through a generative artificial intelligence (GAI)-based hybrid optimization algorithm. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms benchmark schemes, achieving approximately 1.5 times higher network capacity compared to suboptimal alternatives. Additionally, our proposed GAI method reduces the algorithm runtime by 10\% while maintaining solution quality.

### CMOS+X: Stacking Persistent Embedded Memories based on Oxide Transistors   upon GPGPU Platforms
**Authors**: Faaiq Waqar, Ming-Yen Lee, Seongwon Yoon, Seongkwang Lim, Shimeng Yu

**Updated**: 2025-06-29T21:55:58Z

**Summary**: In contemporary general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs), the continued increase in raw arithmetic throughput is constrained by the capabilities of the register file (single-cycle) and last-level cache (high bandwidth), which require the delivery of operands at a cadence demanded by wide single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) lanes. Enhancing the capacity, density, or bandwidth of these memories can unlock substantial performance gains; however, the recent stagnation of SRAM bit-cell scaling leads to inequivalent losses in compute density.   To address the challenges posed by SRAM's scaling and leakage power consumption, this paper explores the potential CMOS+X integration of amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) transistors in capacitive, persistent memory topologies (e.g., 1T1C eDRAM, 2T0C/3T0C Gain Cell) as alternative cells in multi-ported and high-bandwidth banked GPGPU memories. A detailed study of the density and energy tradeoffs of back-end-of-line (BEOL) integrated memories utilizing monolithic 3D (M3D)-integrated multiplexed arrays is conducted, while accounting for the macro-level limitations of integrating AOS candidate structures proposed by the device community (an aspect often overlooked in prior work). By exploiting the short lifetime of register operands, we propose a multi-ported AOS gain-cell capable of delivering 3x the read ports in ~76% of the footprint of SRAM with over 70% lower standby power, enabling enhancements to compute capacity, such as larger warp sizes or processor counts. Benchmarks run on a validated NVIDIA Ampere-class GPU model, using a modified version of Accel-Sim, demonstrate improvements of up to 5.2x the performance per watt and an average 8% higher geometric mean instruction per cycle (IPC) on various compute- and memory-bound tasks.

### ContextCache: Context-Aware Semantic Cache for Multi-Turn Queries in   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jianxin Yan, Wangze Ni, Lei Chen, Xuemin Lin, Peng Cheng, Zhan Qin, Kui Ren

**Updated**: 2025-06-28T07:25:12Z

**Summary**: Semantic caching significantly reduces computational costs and improves efficiency by storing and reusing large language model (LLM) responses. However, existing systems rely primarily on matching individual queries, lacking awareness of multi-turn dialogue contexts, which leads to incorrect cache hits when similar queries appear in different conversational settings. This demonstration introduces ContextCache, a context-aware semantic caching system for multi-turn dialogues. ContextCache employs a two-stage retrieval architecture that first executes vector-based retrieval on the current query to identify potential matches and then integrates current and historical dialogue representations through self-attention mechanisms for precise contextual matching. Evaluation of real-world conversations shows that ContextCache improves precision and recall compared to existing methods. Additionally, cached responses exhibit approximately 10 times lower latency than direct LLM invocation, enabling significant computational cost reductions for LLM conversational applications.

### PromptDSI: Prompt-based Rehearsal-free Continual Learning for Document   Retrieval
**Authors**: Tuan-Luc Huynh, Thuy-Trang Vu, Weiqing Wang, Yinwei Wei, Trung Le, Dragan Gasevic, Yuan-Fang Li, Thanh-Toan Do

**Updated**: 2025-06-28T06:24:44Z

**Summary**: Differentiable Search Index (DSI) utilizes pre-trained language models to perform indexing and document retrieval via end-to-end learning without relying on external indexes. However, DSI requires full re-training to index new documents, causing significant computational inefficiencies. Continual learning (CL) offers a solution by enabling the model to incrementally update without full re-training. Existing CL solutions in document retrieval rely on memory buffers or generative models for rehearsal, which is infeasible when accessing previous training data is restricted due to privacy concerns. To this end, we introduce PromptDSI, a prompt-based, rehearsal-free continual learning approach for document retrieval. PromptDSI follows the Prompt-based Continual Learning (PCL) framework, using learnable prompts to efficiently index new documents without accessing previous documents or queries. To improve retrieval latency, we remove the initial forward pass of PCL, which otherwise greatly increases training and inference time, with a negligible trade-off in performance. Additionally, we introduce a novel topic-aware prompt pool that employs neural topic embeddings as fixed keys, eliminating the instability of prompt key optimization while maintaining competitive performance with existing PCL prompt pools. In a challenging rehearsal-free continual learning setup, we demonstrate that PromptDSI variants outperform rehearsal-based baselines, match the strong cache-based baseline in mitigating forgetting, and significantly improving retrieval performance on new corpora.

### Efficiently Serving Large Multimodal Models Using EPD Disaggregation
**Authors**: Gursimran Singh, Xinglu Wang, Yifan Hu, Timothy Yu, Linzi Xing, Wei Jiang, Zhefeng Wang, Xiaolong Bai, Yi Li, Ying Xiong, Yong Zhang, Zhenan Fan

**Updated**: 2025-06-28T03:53:17Z

**Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models (LLMs) by handling diverse inputs such as images, audio, and video, but at the cost of adding a multimodal encoding stage that increases both computational and memory overhead. This step negatively affects key Service Level Objectives (SLOs), such as time to first token (TTFT) and time per output token (TPOT). We introduce Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) Disaggregation, a novel framework that separates the encoding, prefill, and decode stages onto dedicated resources. Unlike current systems, which bundle encoding and prefill together, our approach decouples these steps, unlocking new opportunities and optimizations. These include a mechanism to cache multimedia tokens for efficient transfer, a novel way to parallelize the encoding load within a request, a module for optimal resource allocation for disaggregated serving, and a novel role-switching method to handle changing workload characteristics. Experimental evaluations with popular LMMs show substantial gains in memory efficiency (up to 15x lower peak memory utilization), batch sizes (up to 22x larger), 10x more images per request, and 2.2x larger KV caches. Furthermore, it leads to significant improvements in SLO attainment (up to 90-100% improvement) and TTFT (up to 71% reduction), compared to systems that do not disaggregate. The code is available at https://github.com/vbdi/epdserve.

### QuickSilver -- Speeding up LLM Inference through Dynamic Token Halting,   KV Skipping, Contextual Token Fusion, and Adaptive Matryoshka Quantization
**Authors**: Danush Khanna, Aditya Kumar Guru, Srivarshinee Sridhar, Zidan Ahmed, Rubhav Bahirwani, Meetu Malhotra, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha, Amitava Das, Kripabandhu Ghosh

**Updated**: 2025-06-27T17:10:32Z

**Summary**: Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in large language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost. While training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime optimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive decoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits, and speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or disrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular, token-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time without altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four synergistic mechanisms:   (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged representations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory writes to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which collapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.   Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on frozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP reduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).

### SiPipe: Bridging the CPU-GPU Utilization Gap for Efficient   Pipeline-Parallel LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yongchao He, Bohan Zhao, Zheng Cao

**Updated**: 2025-06-27T09:27:04Z

**Summary**: As inference workloads for large language models (LLMs) scale to meet growing user demand, pipeline parallelism (PP) has become a widely adopted strategy for multi-GPU deployment, particularly in cross-node setups, to improve key-value (KV) cache capacity and inference throughput. However, PP suffers from inherent inefficiencies caused by three types of execution bubbles-load-imbalance, intra-stage, and inter-stage-which limit pipeline saturation. We present SiPipe, a heterogeneous pipeline design that improves throughput by leveraging underutilized CPU resources to offload auxiliary computation and communication. SiPipe incorporates three key techniques-CPU sampling, a token-safe execution model, and structure-aware transmission-to mitigate pipeline bubbles and improve execution efficiency. Across diverse LLMs, SiPipe achieves up to 2.1 times higher throughput, 43% lower per-token latency, and up to 23% higher average GPU utilization compared to the state-of-the-art vLLM under the same PP configuration, demonstrating its generality across LLMs and deployment scenarios.

### ChunkKV: Semantic-Preserving KV Cache Compression for Efficient   Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Xiang Liu, Zhenheng Tang, Peijie Dong, Zeyu Li, Yue Liu, Bo Li, Xuming Hu, Xiaowen Chu

**Updated**: 2025-06-27T09:14:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant GPU memory when processing long texts, with the key value (KV) cache consuming up to 70\% of total memory during inference. Although existing compression methods reduce memory by evaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic relationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded performance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache compression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as basic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures and contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even under aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index reuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved indices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by 26.5\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench, Needle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\% in precision while maintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that semantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and performance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective solution to the memory bottleneck problem.

### A Survey of LLM Inference Systems
**Authors**: James Pan, Guoliang Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-27T04:38:20Z

**Summary**: The past few years has witnessed specialized large language model (LLM) inference systems, such as vLLM, SGLang, Mooncake, and DeepFlow, alongside rapid LLM adoption via services like ChatGPT. Driving these system design efforts is the unique autoregressive nature of LLM request processing, motivating new techniques for achieving high performance while preserving high inference quality over high-volume and high-velocity workloads. While many of these techniques are discussed across the literature, they have not been analyzed under the framework of a complete inference system, nor have the systems themselves been analyzed and compared.   In this survey, we review these techniques, starting from operators and algorithms for request processing, then moving on to techniques for model optimization and execution, including kernel design, batching, and scheduling, before ending with techniques for memory management, including paged memory, eviction and offloading techniques, quantization, and cache persistence. Through these discussions, we show that these techniques fundamentally rely on load prediction, adaptive mechanisms, and cost reduction in order to overcome the challenges introduced by autoregressive generation and achieve the goals of the system. We then discuss how these techniques can be combined to form single-replica and multi-replica inference systems, including disaggregated inference systems that offer more control over resource allocation and serverless systems that can be deployed over shared hardware infrastructure. We end with a discussion of remaining challenges.

### Round Attention: A Novel Round-Level Attention Mechanism to Accelerate   LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yaohua Tang, Zhicheng Hu, Kun Cheng, Fan Mo, Qiheng Lv, Hua Wang, Zhi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-06-27T03:43:24Z

**Summary**: The increasing context window size in large language models (LLMs) has improved their ability to handle complex, long-text tasks. However, as the conversation rounds continue, it is required to store a large amount of KV cache in GPU memory, which significantly affects the efficiency and even availability of the model serving systems. This paper analyzes dialogue data from real users on the granularity of round and discovers that the LLM inference manifests a watershed layer, after which the distribution of round-level attention shows notable similarity. Based on this, we propose Round Attention - a novel round-level attention mechanism that selectively processes the KV cache of top-k relevant rounds, where k is dynamically determined through the attention matrix in the watershed layer. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method reduces memory usage by 54\% to 82\%, while experimental results confirm that loading sparse critical-round KV cache maintains answer accuracy without performance degradation.

### FOCUS: Internal MLLM Representations for Efficient Fine-Grained Visual   Question Answering
**Authors**: Liangyu Zhong, Fabio Rosenthal, Joachim Sicking, Fabian Hüger, Thorsten Bagdonat, Hanno Gottschalk, Leo Schwinn

**Updated**: 2025-06-26T18:51:04Z

**Summary**: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong perception and reasoning capabilities for image-text input, Visual Question Answering (VQA) focusing on small image details still remains a challenge. Although visual cropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations: the need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed exhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations. We address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping method, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the search for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps: first, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute an object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and rank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the fine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed search strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA datasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping methods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing baseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.

### End-to-End Long Document Summarization using Gradient Caching
**Authors**: Rohit Saxena, Hao Tang, Frank Keller

**Updated**: 2025-06-26T18:40:55Z

**Summary**: Training transformer-based encoder-decoder models for long document summarization poses a significant challenge due to the quadratic memory consumption during training. Several approaches have been proposed to extend the input length at test time, but training with these approaches is still difficult, requiring truncation of input documents and causing a mismatch between training and test conditions. In this work, we propose CachED (Gradient $\textbf{Cach}$ing for $\textbf{E}$ncoder-$\textbf{D}$ecoder models), an approach that enables end-to-end training of existing transformer-based encoder-decoder models, using the entire document without truncation. Specifically, we apply non-overlapping sliding windows to input documents, followed by fusion in decoder. During backpropagation, the gradients are cached at the decoder and are passed through the encoder in chunks by re-computing the hidden vectors, similar to gradient checkpointing. In the experiments on long document summarization, we extend BART to CachED BART, processing more than 500K tokens during training and achieving superior performance without using any additional parameters.

### From Memories to Maps: Mechanisms of In-Context Reinforcement Learning   in Transformers
**Authors**: Ching Fang, Kanaka Rajan

**Updated**: 2025-06-26T17:18:54Z

**Summary**: Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new environments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by standard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value updates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to retrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts. Transformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of their ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value architecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a transformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning tasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms that emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is supported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where representations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli. We next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the model are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning. Instead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching intermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then accessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a computational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to support flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the model resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system in the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural cognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the rapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural settings.

### Measurements, simulations, and models of the point-spread function of   electron-beam lithography
**Authors**: Nikolaj B. Hougs, Kristian S. Knudsen, Marcus Albrechtsen, Taichi Suhara, Christian A. Rosiek, Søren Stobbe

**Updated**: 2025-06-26T13:22:30Z

**Summary**: When a sample is exposed using electron-beam lithography, the electrons scatter deep and far in the substrate, resulting in unwanted deposition of dose at both the nano- and the microscale. This proximity effect can be mitigated by proximity effect correction provided that accurate and validated models of the point-spread function of the electron scattering are available. Most works so far considered a double-Gaussian model of the electron point-spread function, which is very inaccurate for modern electron-beam writers with high acceleration voltages. We present measurements of the process point-spread function for chemically semi-amplified resist on silicon and indium phosphide substrates using a 150 kV electron-beam lithography system. We find that the double-Gaussian model deviates from experiments by up to four orders of magnitude. We propose instead a model comprising the sum of a power-law and a Gaussian, which is in excellent agreement with simulations of the electron scattering obtained by a Monte Carlo method. We apply the power-law plus Gaussian model to quantify the electron scattering and proximity effect correction parameters across material stacks, processing, and voltages from 5 kV to 150 kV. We find that the power-law term remains remarkably constant, whereas the long-range dose contributions and the clearing dose are significantly affected by the substrate and the acceleration voltage.

### Task-Aware KV Compression For Cost-Effective Long Video Understanding
**Authors**: Minghao Qin, Yan Shu, Peitian Zhang, Kun Lun, Huaying Yuan, Juenjie Zhou, Shitao Xiao, Bo Zhao, Zheng Liu

**Updated**: 2025-06-26T12:43:43Z

**Summary**: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs: low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage, Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness. Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while substantially saving the computation cost.

### LoRaConnect: Unlocking HTTP Potential on LoRa Backbones for Remote Areas   and Ad-Hoc Networks
**Authors**: Atonu Ghosh, Sudip Misra

**Updated**: 2025-06-26T05:12:22Z

**Summary**: Minimal infrastructure requirements make LoRa suitable for service delivery in remote areas. Additionally, web applications have become a de-facto standard for modern service delivery. However, Long Range (LoRa) fails to enable HTTP access due to its limited bandwidth, payload size limitations, and high collisions in multi-user setups. We propose LoRaConnect to enable HTTP access over LoRa. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which client devices connect and access HTTP resources over LoRa backhaul. It implements caching and synchronization mechanisms to address LoRa's aforementioned limitations. It also implements a message-slicing method in the application layer to overcome LoRa's payload limitations. We evaluate the proposed system using actual hardware in three experimental setups to assess the baseline performance, ideal scenario, and practical application scenario with Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS). Additionally, it implements a ping operation to demonstrate Internet capability and extensible nature. LoRaWeb achieves an average throughput of 1.18 KB/S approximately, with an access delay of only 1.3 S approximately for a 1.5KB webpage in the baseline setup. Moreover, it achieves an access delay of approximately 6.7 S for a 10KB webpage in the ideal case and an average end-to-end delay of only 612 ms approximately in the FHSS-based setup. Comparison with benchmark suggests multi-fold improvement.

### The electronic structures, magnetic transition and Fermi surface   instability of room-temperature altermagnet KV$_{2}$Se$_{2}$O
**Authors**: Yuanji Xu, Huiyuan Zhang, Maoyuan Feng, Fuyang Tian

**Updated**: 2025-06-26T03:13:33Z

**Summary**: Altermagnetism has recently emerged as a distinct and fundamental class of magnetic order. Exploring its interplay with quantum phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, density-wave instabilities, and many-body effects represents a compelling frontier. In this work, we theoretically confirm the presence of high-temperature metallic altermagnetism in KV$_2$Se$_2$O. We demonstrate that the anomalous metal-insulator-metal transition arises from a Lifshitz transition associated with Fermi surface reconstruction. The previously reported spin-density wave gap is found to lie below the Fermi level in our study and is now recognized to be attributed to the V-shaped density of states, originating from orbital-selective and sublattice-resolved half-metal-like behavior on a specific V atom. Furthermore, we identify the instability from the nesting of spin-momentum-locked two-dimensional Fermi surfaces, which induces the SDW state. These findings position KV$_2$Se$_2$O as a promising platform for investigating the interplay among altermagnetism, unconventional superconductivity, and density-wave order.

### AirCache: Activating Inter-modal Relevancy KV Cache Compression for   Efficient Large Vision-Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Kai Huang, Hao Zou, Bochen Wang, Ye Xi, Zhen Xie, Hao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-26T01:30:43Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable reasoning capabilities and proficiency in generalization. However, processing a large number of visual tokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational overhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression method aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically investigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the attention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable redundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these tokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context generation. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation window for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache, focusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced multi-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of token importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to uniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the full cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing decoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of inputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits increasing performance advantages over existing approaches.

### Omniwise: Predicting GPU Kernels Performance with LLMs
**Authors**: Zixian Wang, Cole Ramos, Muhammad A. Awad, Keith Lowery

**Updated**: 2025-06-25T23:36:44Z

**Summary**: In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) has revolutionized artificial intelligence, enabling models with unprecedented capabilities in understanding, generating, and processing complex data. These powerful architectures have transformed a wide range of downstream applications, tackling tasks beyond human reach. In this paper, we introduce Omniwise, the first end-to-end, self-supervised fine-tuning pipeline that applies large language models (LLMs) to GPU kernel performance prediction--a novel use case in performance profiling. Omniwise is model-agnostic and lightweight, achieving strong results even with a small 3B-parameter model. It can predict key performance metrics, including memory bandwidth, cache hit rates, GFLOPs, and arithmetic intensity, directly from kernel code without the need for code execution or profiling tools. Our approach achieves over 90% of predictions within 10% relative error on GPU kernels executed on AMD MI250 and MI300X architectures. In addition to the pipeline, we develop an online inference server and a Visual Studio Code plugin that seamlessly integrate LLM-based performance prediction into developers' workflows.

### A3 : an Analytical Low-Rank Approximation Framework for Attention
**Authors**: Jeffrey T. H. Wong, Cheng Zhang, Xinye Cao, Pedro Gimenes, George A. Constantinides, Wayne Luk, Yiren Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-06-25T23:03:54Z

**Summary**: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance; however, their massive parameter counts make deployment highly expensive. Low-rank approximation offers a promising compression solution, yet existing approaches have two main limitations: (1) They focus on minimizing the output error of individual linear layers, without considering the architectural characteristics of Transformers, and (2) they decompose a large weight matrix into two small low-rank matrices. Consequently, these methods often fall short compared to other compression techniques like pruning and quantization, and introduce runtime overhead such as the extra GEMM kernel launches for decomposed small matrices. To address these limitations, we propose $\tt A^\tt 3$, a post-training low-rank approximation framework. $\tt A^\tt 3$ splits a Transformer layer into three functional components, namely $\tt QK$, $\tt OV$, and $\tt MLP$. For each component, $\tt A^\tt 3$ provides an analytical solution that reduces the hidden dimension size inside each component while minimizing the component's functional loss ($\it i.e.$, error in attention scores, attention outputs, and MLP outputs). This approach directly reduces model sizes, KV cache sizes, and FLOPs without introducing any runtime overheads. In addition, it provides a new narrative in advancing the optimization problem from singular linear layer loss optimization toward improved end-to-end performance. Through extensive experiments, we show that $\tt A^\tt 3$ maintains superior performance compared to SoTAs. For example, under the same reduction budget in computation and memory, our low-rank approximated LLaMA 3.1-70B achieves a perplexity of 4.69 on WikiText-2, outperforming the previous SoTA's 7.87 by 3.18. We also demonstrate the versatility of $\tt A^\tt 3$, including KV cache compression, quantization, and mixed-rank assignments for enhanced performance.

### Generative Blocks World: Moving Things Around in Pictures
**Authors**: Vaibhav Vavilala, Seemandhar Jain, Rahul Vasanth, D. A. Forsyth, Anand Bhattad

**Updated**: 2025-06-25T17:59:55Z

**Summary**: We describe Generative Blocks World to interact with the scene of a generated image by manipulating simple geometric abstractions. Our method represents scenes as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, and the same scene can be represented by different numbers of primitives, allowing an editor to move either whole structures or small details. Once the scene geometry has been edited, the image is generated by a flow-based method which is conditioned on depth and a texture hint. Our texture hint takes into account the modified 3D primitives, exceeding texture-consistency provided by existing key-value caching techniques. These texture hints (a) allow accurate object and camera moves and (b) largely preserve the identity of objects depicted. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior works in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization.

**Authors**: Hafsa Akbar, Danish Athar, Muhammad Ayain Fida Rana, Chaudhary Hammad Javed, Zartash Afzal Uzmi, Ihsan Ayyub Qazi, Zafar Ayyub Qazi

**Updated**: 2025-06-25T13:35:25Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of web content has led to increasingly large webpages, posing significant challenges for Internet affordability, especially in developing countries where data costs remain prohibitively high. We propose semantic caching using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve web affordability by enabling reuse of semantically similar images within webpages. Analyzing 50 leading news and media websites, encompassing 4,264 images and over 40,000 image pairs, we demonstrate potential for significant data transfer reduction, with some website categories showing up to 37% of images as replaceable. Our proof-of-concept architecture shows users can achieve approximately 10% greater byte savings compared to exact caching. We evaluate both commercial and open-source multi-modal LLMs for assessing semantic replaceability. GPT-4o performs best with a low Normalized Root Mean Square Error of 0.1735 and a weighted F1 score of 0.8374, while the open-source LLaMA 3.1 model shows comparable performance, highlighting its viability for large-scale applications. This approach offers benefits for both users and website operators, substantially reducing data transmission. We discuss ethical concerns and practical challenges, including semantic preservation, user-driven cache configuration, privacy concerns, and potential resistance from website operators

### Do cell culturing influence the radiosensitizing effect of gold   nanoparticles part 2: scrutinizing the methodology producing recent evidence
**Authors**: Hans Rabus, Oswald Msosa Mkanda

**Updated**: 2025-06-25T09:44:25Z

**Summary**: When irradiation is performed with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), a different shape of cells in suspension or adherent to walls may result in different probability of cell survival. In a recent study, differences of up to a factor of 2 were found between the predicted survival of floating and adherent cells. The present work aims to quantify the biases introduced by the simulation setup and the use of voxelized geometry in conjunction with the local effect model for cell survival. The results show that simulated irradiation of a cell near the surface with an incident beam matched to the cell dimensions results in dose values that are by a factor of about 50 lower than the dose to cells deeper in the medium when irradiated with a Co-60 spectrum and lateral beam dimensions in the centimeter range. Furthermore, the number of ionizing photon interactions in gold nanoparticles in a cell near the surface is lower by a factor of about 2 than for cells at 5 mm and 1 cm depth. Using the average dose in voxels of size in the order of 200 nm for assessing cell survival with the local effect model (LEM) leads to an underestimation of the number of lesions from a single ionized AuNP by roughly two orders of magnitude and thus to an overestimation of cell survival. The effect of cell geometry on the survival rate was examined for approximate cell geometries and 100 kV x-ray irradiation, for which the probability of photon interaction in gold nanoparticles is by more than two orders of magnitude higher than for Co-60 irradiation. The results show that the effects are negligible for 5 nm nanoparticles at the concentration of AuNPs considered in preceding work. For 50 nm nanoparticles and thus a thousand times higher mass fraction of gold, significant reduction in cell survival is found, with a clear additional reduction predicted by the LEM as compared to the prediction based on mean dose to the nucleus.

### Breaking the Boundaries of Long-Context LLM Inference: Adaptive KV   Management on a Single Commodity GPU
**Authors**: He Sun, Li Li, Mingjun Xiao, Chengzhong Xu

**Updated**: 2025-06-25T07:26:42Z

**Summary**: Advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of complex and long-context natural language tasks. However, performing long-context LLM inference locally on a commodity GPU (a PC) with privacy concerns remains challenging due to the increasing memory demands of the key-value (KV) cache. Existing systems typically identify important tokens and selectively offload their KV data to GPU and CPU memory. The KV data needs to be offloaded to disk due to the limited memory on a commodity GPU, but the process is bottlenecked by token importance evaluation overhead and the disk's low bandwidth. In this paper, we present LeoAM, the first efficient importance-aware long-context LLM inference system for a single commodity GPU with adaptive hierarchical GPU-CPU-Disk KV management. Our system employs an adaptive KV management strategy that partitions KV data into variable-sized chunks based on the skewed distribution of attention weights across different layers to reduce computational and additional transmission overheads. Moreover, we propose a lightweight KV abstract method, which minimizes transmission latency by storing and extracting the KV abstract of each chunk on disk instead of the full KV data. LeoAM also leverages the dynamic compression and pipeline techniques to further accelerate inference. Experimental results demonstrate that LongInfer achieves an average inference latency speedup of 3.46x, while maintaining comparable LLM response quality. In scenarios with larger batch sizes, it achieves up to a 5.47x speedup.

### MegaFold: System-Level Optimizations for Accelerating Protein Structure   Prediction Models
**Authors**: Hoa La, Ahan Gupta, Alex Morehead, Jianlin Cheng, Minjia Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-24T23:30:49Z

**Summary**: Protein structure prediction models such as AlphaFold3 (AF3) push the frontier of biomolecular modeling by incorporating science-informed architectural changes to the transformer architecture. However, these advances come at a steep system cost, introducing: compute- and memory-intensive operators, 2D attention mechanisms, and retrieval-augmented data pipelines, which collectively hinder the scalability of AF3 training. In this work, we present MegaFold, a cross-platform system to accelerate AF3 training. MegaFold tackles key bottlenecks through ahead-of-time caching to eliminate GPU idle time from the retrieval-augmented data pipeline, Triton-based kernels for memory-efficient EvoAttention on heterogeneous devices, and deep fusion for common and critical small operators in AF3. Evaluation on both NVIDIA H200 and AMD MI250 GPUs shows that MegaFold reduces peak memory usage of AF3 training by up to 1.23$\times$ and improves per-iteration training time by up-to 1.73$\times$ and 1.62$\times$ respectively. More importantly, MegaFold enables training on 1.35$\times$ longer sequence lengths compared to PyTorch baselines without running out-of-memory, significantly improving the scalability of modern protein folding models. We open source our code at https://github.com/Supercomputing-System-AI-Lab/MegaFold/.

### GainSight: Application-Guided Profiling for Composing Heterogeneous   On-Chip Memories in AI Hardware Accelerators
**Authors**: Peijing Li, Matthew Hung, Yiming Tan, Konstantin Hoßfeld, Jake Cheng Jiajun, Shuhan Liu, Lixian Yan, Xinxin Wang, H. -S. Philip Wong, Thierry Tambe

**Updated**: 2025-06-24T19:02:08Z

**Summary**: As AI workloads drive soaring memory requirements, higher-density on-chip memory is needed for domain-specific accelerators beyond what current SRAM technology can provide. We motivate that algorithms and application behavior should guide the composition of heterogeneous on-chip memories. However, little work has incorporated dynamic application profiles into these design decisions, and no existing tools are expressly designed for this purpose. We present GainSight, a profiling framework that analyzes fine-grained memory access patterns and data lifetimes in domain-specific accelerators. By instrumenting retargetable architectural simulator backends with application- and device-agnostic analytical frontends, GainSight aligns workload-specific traffic and lifetime metrics with mockups of emerging memory devices, informing system-level heterogeneous memory design. We also present a set of case studies on MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads using simulated GPU and systolic array architectures, highlighting the utility of GainSight and the insights it provides: (1) 64% of L1 and 18% of L2 GPU cache accesses, and 79% of systolic array scratchpad accesses across profiled workloads are short-lived and suitable for silicon-based gain cell RAM (Si-GCRAM); (2) Heterogeneous memory arrays that augment SRAM with GCRAM can reduce active energy consumption by up to 66.8%. To facilitate further research in this domain, GainSight is open source at https://gainsight.stanford.edu/.

### CronusVLA: Transferring Latent Motion Across Time for Multi-Frame   Prediction in Manipulation
**Authors**: Hao Li, Shuai Yang, Yilun Chen, Yang Tian, Xiaoda Yang, Xinyi Chen, Hanqing Wang, Tai Wang, Feng Zhao, Dahua Lin, Jiangmiao Pang

**Updated**: 2025-06-24T17:30:27Z

**Summary**: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built on pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across manipulation tasks. However, they remain constrained by a single-frame observation paradigm and cannot fully benefit from the motion information offered by aggregated multi-frame historical observations, as the large vision-language backbone introduces substantial computational cost and inference latency. We propose CronusVLA, a unified framework that extends single-frame VLA models to the multi-frame paradigm through an efficient post-training stage. CronusVLA comprises three key components: (1) single-frame pretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive action tokens prediction, which establishes an embodied vision-language foundation; (2) multi-frame encoding, adapting the prediction of vision-language backbones from discrete action tokens to motion features during post-training, and aggregating motion features from historical frames into a feature chunking; (3) cross-frame decoding, which maps the feature chunking to accurate actions via a shared decoder with cross-attention. By reducing redundant token computation and caching past motion features, CronusVLA achieves efficient inference. As an application of motion features, we further propose an action adaptation mechanism based on feature-action retrieval to improve model performance during finetuning. CronusVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on SimplerEnv with 70.9% success rate, and 12.7% improvement over OpenVLA on LIBERO. Real-world Franka experiments also show the strong performance and robustness.

### RCStat: A Statistical Framework for using Relative Contextualization in   Transformers
**Authors**: Debabrata Mahapatra, Shubham Agarwal, Apoorv Saxena, Subrata Mitra

**Updated**: 2025-06-24T11:55:43Z

**Summary**: Prior work on input-token importance in auto-regressive transformers has relied on Softmax-normalized attention weights, which obscure the richer structure of pre-Softmax query-key logits. We introduce RCStat, a statistical framework that harnesses raw attention logits via Relative Contextualization (RC), a random variable measuring contextual alignment between token segments, and derive an efficient upper bound for RC. We demonstrate two applications: (i) Key-Value compression, where RC-based thresholds drive adaptive key-value eviction for substantial cache reduction with minimal quality loss; and (ii) Attribution, where RC yields higher-fidelity token-, sentence-, and chunk-level explanations than post-Softmax methods. Across question answering, summarization, and attribution benchmarks, RCStat achieves significant empirical gains, delivering state-of-the-art compression and attribution performance without any model retraining.

### AnTKV: Anchor Token-Aware Sub-Bit Vector Quantization for KV Cache in   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zeyu Li, Chuanfu Xiao, Yang Wang, Xiang Liu, Zhenheng Tang, Baotong Lu, Mao Yang, Xinyu Chen, Xiaowen Chu

**Updated**: 2025-06-24T10:45:48Z

**Summary**: Quantization has emerged as an effective and lightweight solution to reduce the memory footprint of the KV cache in Large Language Models (LLMs). Nevertheless, minimizing the performance degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV cache quantization remains a significant challenge. We observe that quantizing the KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of attention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform forward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score (AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to quantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS across tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision (FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive quantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel framework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the KV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a triton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast online Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context lengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x higher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment results demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI, SKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves significantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B, with only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of 4.73.

**Updated**: 2025-06-24T09:27:46Z

**Summary**: Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs have recently gained attention for their ability to enhance performance by selectively engaging specialized subnetworks or "experts" for each input. However, deploying MoEs on memory-constrained devices remains challenging, particularly when generating tokens sequentially with a batch size of one, as opposed to typical high-throughput settings involving long sequences or large batches. In this work, we optimize MoE on memory-constrained devices where only a subset of expert weights fit in DRAM. We introduce a novel cache-aware routing strategy that leverages expert reuse during token generation to improve cache locality. We evaluate our approach on language modeling, MMLU, and GSM8K benchmarks and present on-device results demonstrating 2$\times$ speedups on mobile devices, offering a flexible, training-free solution to extend MoE's applicability across real-world applications.

### Mem4Nav: Boosting Vision-and-Language Navigation in Urban Environments   with a Hierarchical Spatial-Cognition Long-Short Memory System
**Authors**: Lixuan He, Haoyu Dong, Zhenxing Chen, Yangcheng Yu, Jie Feng, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-24T09:00:43Z

**Summary**: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/Mem4Nav.

### PBFT-Backed Semantic Voting for Multi-Agent Memory Pruning
**Authors**: Duong Bach

**Updated**: 2025-06-24T06:44:47Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex, dynamic environments necessitates robust and efficient mechanisms for managing shared knowledge. A critical challenge is ensuring that distributed memories remain synchronized, relevant, and free from the accumulation of outdated or inconsequential data - a process analogous to biological forgetting. This paper introduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework designed to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in MAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic voting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the relevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational context; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing importance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different time horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based consensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items are agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in the presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N greater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient inter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage and similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations in a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's efficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88% voting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a 92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an 82% cache hit rate for memory access.

### Video-XL-2: Towards Very Long-Video Understanding Through Task-Aware KV   Sparsification
**Authors**: Minghao Qin, Xiangrui Liu, Zhengyang Liang, Yan Shu, Huaying Yuan, Juenjie Zhou, Shitao Xiao, Bo Zhao, Zheng Liu

**Updated**: 2025-06-24T01:19:56Z

**Summary**: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) models have made significant progress in video understanding over the past few years. However, processing long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few seconds.

### Binsparse: A Specification for Cross-Platform Storage of Sparse Matrices   and Tensors
**Authors**: Benjamin Brock, Willow Ahrens, Hameer Abbasi, Timothy A. Davis, Juni Kim, James Kitchen, Spencer Patty, Isaac Virshup, Erik Welch

**Updated**: 2025-06-23T22:33:58Z

**Summary**: Sparse matrices and tensors are ubiquitous throughout multiple subfields of computing. The widespread usage of sparse data has inspired many in-memory and on-disk storage formats, but the only widely adopted storage specifications are the Matrix Market and FROSTT file formats, which both use ASCII text. Due to the inefficiency of text storage, these files typically have larger file sizes and longer parsing times than binary storage formats, which directly store an in-memory representation to disk. This can be a major bottleneck; since sparse computation is often bandwidth-bound, the cost of loading or storing a matrix to disk often exceeds the cost of performing a sparse computation. While it is common practice for practitioners to develop their own, custom, non-portable binary formats for high-performance sparse matrix storage, there is currently no cross-platform binary sparse matrix storage format. We present Binsparse, a cross-platform binary sparse matrix and tensor format specification. Binsparse is a modular, embeddable format, consisting of a JSON descriptor, which describes the matrix or tensor dimensions, type, and format, and a series of binary arrays, which can be stored in all modern binary containers, such as HDF5, Zarr, or NPZ. We provide several reference implementations of Binsparse spanning 5 languages, 5 frameworks, and 4 binary containers. We evaluate our Binsparse format on every matrix in the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection and a selection of tensors from the FROSTT collection. The Binsparse HDF5 CSR format shows file size reductions of 2.4x on average without compression and 7.5x with compression. We evaluate our parser's read/write performance against a state-of-the-art Matrix Market parser, demonstrating warm cache mean read speedups of 26.5x without compression and 2.6x with compression, and write speedups of 31x without compression and 1.4x with compression.

### CommVQ: Commutative Vector Quantization for KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Junyan Li, Yang Zhang, Muhammad Yusuf Hassan, Talha Chafekar, Tianle Cai, Zhile Ren, Pengsheng Guo, Foroozan Karimzadeh, Colorado Reed, Chong Wang, Chuang Gan

**Updated**: 2025-06-23T17:50:11Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring long context lengths, but the key-value (KV) cache often becomes a memory bottleneck on GPUs as context grows. To address this, we propose Commutative Vector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for long-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a lightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded via simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during decoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention mechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and low overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5% with 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with minimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context length on a single RTX 4090 GPU. The source code is available at: https://github.com/UMass-Embodied-AGI/CommVQ.

### Persistent Sampling: Enhancing the Efficiency of Sequential Monte Carlo
**Authors**: Minas Karamanis, Uroš Seljak

**Updated**: 2025-06-23T07:59:17Z

**Summary**: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers are powerful tools for Bayesian inference but suffer from high computational costs due to their reliance on large particle ensembles for accurate estimates. We introduce persistent sampling (PS), an extension of SMC that systematically retains and reuses particles from all prior iterations to construct a growing, weighted ensemble. By leveraging multiple importance sampling and resampling from a mixture of historical distributions, PS mitigates the need for excessively large particle counts, directly addressing key limitations of SMC such as particle impoverishment and mode collapse. Crucially, PS achieves this without additional likelihood evaluations-weights for persistent particles are computed using cached likelihood values. This framework not only yields more accurate posterior approximations but also produces marginal likelihood estimates with significantly lower variance, enhancing reliability in model comparison. Furthermore, the persistent ensemble enables efficient adaptation of transition kernels by leveraging a larger, decorrelated particle pool. Experiments on high-dimensional Gaussian mixtures, hierarchical models, and non-convex targets demonstrate that PS consistently outperforms standard SMC and related variants, including recycled and waste-free SMC, achieving substantial reductions in mean squared error for posterior expectations and evidence estimates, all at reduced computational cost. PS thus establishes itself as a robust, scalable, and efficient alternative for complex Bayesian inference tasks.

### FutureFill: Fast Generation from Convolutional Sequence Models
**Authors**: Naman Agarwal, Xinyi Chen, Evan Dogariu, Devan Shah, Hubert Strauss, Vlad Feinberg, Daniel Suo, Peter Bartlett, Elad Hazan

**Updated**: 2025-06-23T03:20:46Z

**Summary**: We address the challenge of efficient auto-regressive generation in sequence prediction models by introducing FutureFill, a general-purpose fast generation method for any sequence prediction algorithm based on convolutional operators. FutureFill reduces generation time from quadratic to quasilinear in the context length. Moreover, when generating from a prompt, it requires a prefill cache whose size grows only with the number of tokens to be generated, often much smaller than the caches required by standard convolutional or attention based models. We validate our theoretical claims with experiments on synthetic tasks and demonstrate substantial efficiency gains when generating from a deep convolutional sequence prediction model.

### RAPID: Long-Context Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Speculative   Decoding
**Authors**: Guanzheng Chen, Qilong Feng, Jinjie Ni, Xin Li, Michael Qizhe Shieh

**Updated**: 2025-06-23T03:05:26Z

**Summary**: The emergence of long-context large language models (LLMs) offers a promising alternative to traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for processing extensive documents. However, the computational overhead of long-context inference presents significant efficiency challenges. While Speculative Decoding (SD) traditionally accelerates inference using smaller draft models, its effectiveness diminishes substantially in long-context scenarios due to memory-bound KV cache operations. We introduce Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding (RAPID), which leverages RAG for both accelerating and enhancing generation quality in long-context inference. RAPID introduces the RAG drafter-a draft LLM operating on shortened retrieval contexts-to speculate on the generation of long-context target LLMs. Our approach enables a new paradigm where same-scale or even larger LLMs can serve as RAG drafters while maintaining computational efficiency. To fully leverage the potentially superior capabilities from stronger RAG drafters, we develop an inference-time knowledge transfer that enriches the target distribution by RAG. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen2.5 backbones demonstrate that RAPID effectively integrates the strengths of both RAG and long-context LLMs, achieving significant performance improvements (e.g., from 39.33 to 42.83 on InfiniteBench for LLaMA-3.1-8B) with more than 2x speedups for long-context inference. Our analyses also reveal the robustness of RAPID across various context lengths and retrieval quality.

### Make It Efficient: Dynamic Sparse Attention for Autoregressive Image   Generation
**Authors**: Xunzhi Xiang, Qi Fan

**Updated**: 2025-06-23T01:27:06Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive conditional image generation models have emerged as a dominant paradigm in text-to-image synthesis. These methods typically convert images into one-dimensional token sequences and leverage the self-attention mechanism, which has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, to capture long-range dependencies, model global context, and ensure semantic coherence. However, excessively long contexts during inference lead to significant memory overhead caused by KV-cache and computational delays. To alleviate these challenges, we systematically analyze how global semantics, spatial layouts, and fine-grained textures are formed during inference, and propose a novel training-free context optimization method called Adaptive Dynamic Sparse Attention (ADSA). Conceptually, ADSA dynamically identifies historical tokens crucial for maintaining local texture consistency and those essential for ensuring global semantic coherence, thereby efficiently streamlining attention computation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic KV-cache update mechanism tailored for ADSA, reducing GPU memory consumption during inference by approximately $50\%$. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach in terms of both generation quality and resource efficiency.

### Cramming 1568 Tokens into a Single Vector and Back Again: Exploring the   Limits of Embedding Space Capacity
**Authors**: Yuri Kuratov, Mikhail Arkhipov, Aydar Bulatov, Mikhail Burtsev

**Updated**: 2025-06-22T15:07:37Z

**Summary**: A range of recent works addresses the problem of compression of sequence of tokens into a shorter sequence of real-valued vectors to be used as inputs instead of token embeddings or key-value cache. These approaches are focused on reduction of the amount of compute in existing language models rather than minimization of number of bits needed to store text. Despite relying on powerful models as encoders, the maximum attainable lossless compression ratio is typically not higher than x10. This fact is highly intriguing because, in theory, the maximum information capacity of large real-valued vectors is far beyond the presented rates even for 16-bit precision and a modest vector size. In this work, we explore the limits of compression by replacing the encoder with a per-sample optimization procedure. We show that vectors with compression ratios up to x1500 exist, which highlights two orders of magnitude gap between existing and practically attainable solutions. Furthermore, we empirically show that the compression limits are determined not by the length of the input but by the amount of uncertainty to be reduced, namely, the cross-entropy loss on this sequence without any conditioning. The obtained limits highlight the substantial gap between the theoretical capacity of input embeddings and their practical utilization, suggesting significant room for optimization in model design.

### Secure User-friendly Blockchain Modular Wallet Design Using Android &   OP-TEE
**Authors**: Seongjin Kim, Sanguk Yun, Jungho Jang

**Updated**: 2025-06-22T10:57:57Z

**Summary**: Emerging crypto economies still hemorrhage digital assets because legacy wallets leak private keys at almost every layer of the software stack, from user-space libraries to kernel memory dumps. This paper solves that twin crisis of security and interoperability by re-imagining key management as a platform-level service anchored in ARM TrustZone through OP-TEE. Our architecture fractures the traditional monolithic Trusted Application into per-chain modules housed in a multi-tenant TA store, finally breaking OP-TEE's single-binary ceiling. A cryptographically sealed firmware-over-the-air pipeline welds each TA set to an Android system image, enabling hot-swap updates while Verified Boot enforces rollback protection. Every package carries a chained signature developer first, registry second so even a compromised supply chain cannot smuggle malicious code past the Secure World's RSA-PSS gatekeeper. Inside the TEE, strict inter-TA isolation, cache partitioning, and GP-compliant crypto APIs ensure secrets never bleed across trust boundaries or timing domains. The Rich Execution Environment can interact only via hardware-mediated Secure Monitor Calls, collapsing the surface exposed to malware in Android space. End-users enjoy a single polished interface yet can install or retire Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, or tomorrow's chain with one tap, shrinking both storage footprint and audit scope. For auditors, the composition model slashes duplicated verification effort by quarantining blockchain logic inside narrowly scoped modules that share formally specified interfaces. Our threat analysis spans six adversary layers and shows how the design neutralizes REE malware sniffing, OTA injection, and cross-module side channels without exotic hardware. A reference implementation on AOSP exports a Wallet Manager HAL, custom SELinux domains, and a CI/CD pipeline that vet community modules before release. The result is not merely another hardware wallet but a programmable substrate that can evolve at the velocity of the blockchain ecosystem. By welding radical extensibility to hardware-anchored assurance, the platform closes the security-usability gap that has long stymied mass-market self-custody. We posit that modular TEEs are the missing OS primitive for Web3, much as virtual memory unlocked multi-tasking in classical computing. Together, these contributions sketch a blueprint for multi-chain asset management that is auditable, resilient, and poised for global deployment.

**Updated**: 2025-06-22T03:46:11Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces ECHO-LLaMA, an efficient LLaMA architecture designed to improve both the training speed and inference throughput of LLaMA architectures while maintaining its learning capacity. ECHO-LLaMA transforms LLaMA models into shared KV caching across certain layers, significantly reducing KV computational complexity while maintaining or improving language performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ECHO-LLaMA achieves up to 77\% higher token-per-second throughput during training, up to 16\% higher Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU), and up to 14\% lower loss when trained on an equal number of tokens. Furthermore, on the 1.1B model, ECHO-LLaMA delivers approximately 7\% higher test-time throughput compared to the baseline. By introducing a computationally efficient adaptation mechanism, ECHO-LLaMA offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for pretraining and finetuning large language models, enabling faster and more resource-efficient training without compromising performance.

### RPLKG: Robust Prompt Learning with Knowledge Graph
**Authors**: YongTaek Lim, Yewon Kim, Suho Kang, Dokyung Yoon, KyungWoo Song

**Updated**: 2025-06-21T08:27:10Z

**Summary**: Large-scale pre-trained models surpass in transferability and robust generalization across diverse datasets. The emergence of multimodal pre-trained models like CLIP has significantly boosted performance in various experiments. However, generalizing to new datasets or domains remains challenging, especially with limited labeled data. Also, existing methods often lack interpretability and impose high computational costs. To address this, we propose Robust Prompt Learning with Knowledge Graph (RPLKG), leveraging the knowledge graph to curate diverse, interpretable prompt sets automatically. Our method autonomously selects the optimal interpretable prompt based on dataset characteristics, achieving performance improvements over zero-shot learning and competitive performance compared to various prompt learning methods. Also, RPLKG efficiently reuses cached prompt embeddings from a single model pass and optimizes prompt selection via Gumbel-Softmax, enabling low-memory, fast training. Moreover, RPLKG advances few-shot learning effectiveness while enhancing interpretability and efficiency in model adaptation. Our

### A Minimalist Method for Fine-tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Yanting Miao, William Loh, Pacal Poupart, Suraj Kothawade

**Updated**: 2025-07-01T05:46:31Z

**Summary**: Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image diffusion models, improving text-image alignment and sample quality. However, existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present. These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion models.

### Cache Me If You Can: How Many KVs Do You Need for Effective Long-Context   LMs?
**Authors**: Adithya Bhaskar, Alexander Wettig, Tianyu Gao, Yihe Dong, Danqi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:21:12Z

**Summary**: Language models handle increasingly long contexts for tasks such as book summarization, but this leads to growing memory costs for the key-value (KV) cache. Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but their approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like high peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between methods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified metric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their lifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they attain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and generation, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the high peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods -- *post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with eviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs during pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn to *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end optimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full KV cache and which do not. PruLong saves memory while preserving long-context performance, achieving 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while retaining performance in challenging recall tasks. Our paper clarifies the complex tangle of long-context inference methods and paves the way for future development to minimize the KV footprint.

### PUL: Pre-load in Software for Caches Wouldn't Always Play Along
**Authors**: Arthur Bernhardt, Sajjad Tamimi, Florian Stock, Andreas Koch, Ilia Petrov

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:09:26Z

**Summary**: Memory latencies and bandwidth are major factors, limiting system performance and scalability. Modern CPUs aim at hiding latencies by employing large caches, out-of-order execution, or complex hardware prefetchers. However, software-based prefetching exhibits higher efficiency, improving with newer CPU generations.   In this paper we investigate software-based, post-Moore systems that offload operations to intelligent memories. We show that software-based prefetching has even higher potential in near-data processing settings by maximizing compute utilization through compute/IO interleaving.

**Updated**: 2025-06-19T12:27:10Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), driven by growing parameter scales, adoption of mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, and expanding context lengths, imposes unprecedented demands on AI infrastructure. Traditional AI clusters face limitations in compute intensity, memory bandwidth, inter-chip communication, and latency, compounded by variable workloads and strict service-level objectives. Addressing these issues requires fundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces Huawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in the production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode. It integrates 384 Ascend 910 NPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified Bus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling of resources. These features optimize performance for communication-intensive operations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed key-value cache access. To fully leverage CloudMatrix384, we propose CloudMatrix-Infer, an advanced LLM serving solution incorporating three core innovations: a peer-to-peer serving architecture that independently scales prefill, decode, and caching; a large-scale expert parallelism strategy supporting EP320 via efficient UB-based token dispatch; and hardware-aware optimizations including specialized operators, microbatch-based pipelining, and INT8 quantization. Evaluation with the DeepSeek-R1 model shows CloudMatrix-Infer achieves state-of-the-art efficiency: prefill throughput of 6,688 tokens/s per NPU and decode throughput of 1,943 tokens/s per NPU (<50 ms TPOT). It effectively balances throughput and latency, sustaining 538 tokens/s per NPU even under stringent 15 ms latency constraints, while INT8 quantization maintains model accuracy across benchmarks.

**Updated**: 2025-06-19T10:17:28Z

**Summary**: Plasma accelerators utilize strong electric fields in plasma waves to accelerate charged particles, making them a compact alternative to radiofrequency technologies. Discharge capillaries are plasma sources used in plasma accelerator research to provide acceleration targets, or as plasma lenses to capture or focus accelerated beams. They have applications for beam-driven and laser-driven plasma accelerators and can sustain high repetition rates for extended periods of time. Despite these advantages, high-fidelity simulations of discharge capillaries remain challenging due to the range of mechanisms involved and the difficulty to diagnose them in experiments. In this work, we utilize hydrodynamic plasma simulations to examine the discharge process of a plasma cell and discuss implications for future accelerator systems. The simulation model is validated with experimental measurements in a 50-mm-long, 1-mm-wide plasma capillary operating a 12-27 kV discharge at 2-12mbar hydrogen pressure. For 20 kV at 8.7mbar the discharge is shown to deposit 178mJ of energy in the plasma. Potential difficulties with the common density measurement method using H{\alpha} emission spectroscopy are discussed. This simulation model enables investigations of repeatability, heat flow management and fine tailoring of the plasma profile with discharges.

### Resource Allocation for Twin Maintenance and Computing Task Processing   in Digital Twin Vehicular Edge Computing Network
**Authors**: Yu Xie, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Nan Cheng, Wen Chen, Jiangzhou Wang, Khaled B. Letaief

**Updated**: 2025-06-19T07:29:09Z

**Summary**: As a promising technology, vehicular edge computing (VEC) can provide computing and caching services by deploying VEC servers near vehicles. However, VEC networks still face challenges such as high vehicle mobility. Digital twin (DT), an emerging technology, can predict, estimate, and analyze real-time states by digitally modeling objects in the physical world. By integrating DT with VEC, a virtual vehicle DT can be created in the VEC server to monitor the real-time operating status of vehicles. However, maintaining the vehicle DT model requires ongoing attention from the VEC server, which also needs to offer computing services for the vehicles. Therefore, effective allocation and scheduling of VEC server resources are crucial. This study focuses on a general VEC network with a single VEC service and multiple vehicles, examining the two types of delays caused by twin maintenance and computational processing within the network. By transforming the problem using satisfaction functions, we propose an optimization problem aimed at maximizing each vehicle's resource utility to determine the optimal resource allocation strategy. Given the non-convex nature of the issue, we employ multi-agent Markov decision processes to reformulate the problem. Subsequently, we propose the twin maintenance and computing task processing resource collaborative scheduling (MADRL-CSTC) algorithm, which leverages multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. Through experimental comparisons with alternative algorithms, it demonstrates that our proposed approach is effective in terms of resource allocation.

### LazyEviction: Lagged KV Eviction with Attention Pattern Observation for   Efficient Long Reasoning
**Authors**: Haoyue Zhang, Hualei Zhang, Xiaosong Ma, Jie Zhang, Song Guo

**Updated**: 2025-06-19T02:25:04Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced reasoning capabilities by employing Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the extended reasoning sequences introduce significant GPU memory overhead due to increased key-value (KV) cache size, particularly in tasks requiring long reasoning sequences, such as mathematics and programming. Existing KV cache compression methods mitigate memory bottlenecks but struggle in long reasoning tasks. In this paper, we analyze attention patterns in reasoning tasks and reveal a Token Importance Recurrence phenomenon: a large proportion of tokens receive renewed attention after multiple decoding steps, which is failed to capture by existing works and may lead to unpredictable eviction on such periodically critical tokens. To address this, we propose LazyEviction, a lagged KV eviction framework designed to maintain reasoning performance while reducing KV memory. LazyEviction is an Observation Window-based Lagged Eviction Mechanism retaining latent recurring tokens by performing lagged evictions across decoding steps, which contains two key components: (1) Recurrence Interval Tracking for capturing temporal variations in token importance, and (2) an Maximum Recurrence Interval-Centric Eviction Policy that prioritizes eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyEviction reduces KV cache size by 50% while maintaining comparable accuracy on mathematics reasoning datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the importance of preserving recurring tokens, which are critical for maintaining knowledge continuity in multi-step reasoning tasks.

### KVCache Cache in the Wild: Characterizing and Optimizing KVCache Cache   at a Large Cloud Provider
**Authors**: Jiahao Wang, Jinbo Han, Xingda Wei, Sijie Shen, Dingyan Zhang, Chenguang Fang, Rong Chen, Wenyuan Yu, Haibo Chen

**Summary**: Serving large language models (LLMs) is important for cloud providers, and caching intermediate results (KV\$) after processing each request substantially improves serving throughput and latency. However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV\$ caching, where system design decisions like cache eviction policies are highly workload-dependent. In this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV\$ workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic workloads, including: KV\$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

### Medha: Efficiently Serving Multi-Million Context Length LLM Inference   Requests Without Approximations
**Authors**: Amey Agrawal, Haoran Qiu, Junda Chen, Íñigo Goiri, Chaojie Zhang, Rayyan Shahid, Ramachandran Ramjee, Alexey Tumanov, Esha Choukse

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T22:51:06Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) handle increasingly longer contexts, serving long inference requests of millions of tokens presents unique challenges. We show that existing work for long context inference is largely based on techniques from long context training, and does not handle the high variability in input lengths during inference. This leads to inefficient resource utilization, server fragmentation, and head-of-line (HOL) blocking.   We present Medha, an end-to-end system for efficient long-context LLM inference that addresses these challenges through fine-grained time sharing. Medha introduces three key innovations: (1) the mechanism of adaptive prefill chunking to help mitigate HOL blocking with preemption; (2) two new parallelism strategies: Sequence Pipeline Parallelism (SPP) to reduce time-to-first-token by pipelining prefill chunks, and KV-Cache Parallelism (KVP) to lower time-peroutput-token by distributing decoding across servers; and (3) a novel input-length aware least remaining slack scheduling to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs).   Medha enables exact inference scaling beyond 10 million tokens, maintaining high throughput and low latency across mixed-length workloads. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, Medha reduces server fragmentation, cuts median latency by up to 30x, and improves throughput by over 5x, delivering production-scale long-context inference without compromising performance on shorter requests.

### Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Your Off-the-Shelf Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Anirud Aggarwal, Abhinav Shrivastava, Matthew Gwilliam

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:59:50Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available at https://aniaggarwal.github.io/ecad and our code is available at https://github.com/aniaggarwal/ecad.

### Demystifying the Visual Quality Paradox in Multimodal Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Shuo Xing, Lanqing Guo, Hongyuan Hua, Seoyoung Lee, Peiran Li, Yufei Wang, Zhangyang Wang, Zhengzhong Tu

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:14:07Z

**Summary**: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity. Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable, low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content; and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets, VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally ``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

### From Block to Byte: Transforming PCIe SSDs with CXL Memory Protocol and   Instruction Annotation
**Authors**: Miryeong Kwon, Donghyun Gouk, Junhyeok Jang, Jinwoo Baek, Hyunwoo You, Sangyoon Ji, Hongjoo Jung, Junseok Moon, Seungkwan Kang, Seungjun Lee, Myoungsoo Jung

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:44:04Z

**Summary**: This paper explores how Compute Express Link (CXL) can transform PCIe-based block storage into a scalable, byte-addressable working memory. We address the challenges of adapting block storage to CXL's memory-centric model by emphasizing cacheability as a key enabler and advocating for Type 3 endpoint devices, referred to as CXL-SSDs. To validate our approach, we prototype a CXL-SSD on a custom FPGA platform and propose annotation mechanisms, Determinism and Bufferability, to enhance performance while preserving data persistency. Our simulation-based evaluation demonstrates that CXL-SSD achieves 10.9x better performance than PCIe-based memory expanders and further reduces latency by 5.4x with annotation enhancements. In workloads with high locality, CXL-SSD approaches DRAM-like performance due to efficient on-chip caching. This work highlights the feasibility of integrating block storage into CXL's ecosystem and provides a foundation for future memory-storage convergence.

**Authors**: Shufan Li, Konstantinos Kallidromitis, Hritik Bansal, Akash Gokul, Yusuke Kato, Kazuki Kozuka, Jason Kuen, Zhe Lin, Kai-Wei Chang, Aditya Grover

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:17:40Z

**Summary**: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve a wide range of tasks requiring visual reasoning. In real-world scenarios, desirable properties for VLMs include fast inference and controllable generation (e.g., constraining outputs to adhere to a desired format). However, existing autoregressive (AR) VLMs like LLaVA struggle in these aspects. Discrete diffusion models (DMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling parallel decoding for faster inference and bidirectional context for controllable generation through text-infilling. While effective in language-only settings, DMs' potential for multimodal tasks is underexplored. We introduce LaViDa, a family of VLMs built on DMs. We build LaViDa by equipping DMs with a vision encoder and jointly fine-tune the combined parts for multimodal instruction following. To address challenges encountered, LaViDa incorporates novel techniques such as complementary masking for effective training, prefix KV cache for efficient inference, and timestep shifting for high-quality sampling. Experiments show that LaViDa achieves competitive or superior performance to AR VLMs on multi-modal benchmarks such as MMMU, while offering unique advantages of DMs, including flexible speed-quality tradeoff, controllability, and bidirectional reasoning. On COCO captioning, LaViDa surpasses Open-LLaVa-Next-8B by +4.1 CIDEr with 1.92x speedup. On bidirectional tasks, it achieves +59% improvement on Constrained Poem Completion. These results demonstrate LaViDa as a strong alternative to AR VLMs. Code and models will be released in the camera-ready version.

### VideoMAR: Autoregressive Video Generatio with Continuous Tokens
**Authors**: Hu Yu, Biao Gong, Hangjie Yuan, DanDan Zheng, Weilong Chai, Jingdong Chen, Kecheng Zheng, Feng Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:44:09Z

**Summary**: Masked-based autoregressive models have demonstrated promising image generation capability in continuous space. However, their potential for video generation remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VideoMAR}, a concise and efficient decoder-only autoregressive image-to-video model with continuous tokens, composing temporal frame-by-frame and spatial masked generation. We first identify temporal causality and spatial bi-directionality as the first principle of video AR models, and propose the next-frame diffusion loss for the integration of mask and video generation. Besides, the huge cost and difficulty of long sequence autoregressive modeling is a basic but crucial issue. To this end, we propose the temporal short-to-long curriculum learning and spatial progressive resolution training, and employ progressive temperature strategy at inference time to mitigate the accumulation error. Furthermore, VideoMAR replicates several unique capacities of language models to video generation. It inherently bears high efficiency due to simultaneous temporal-wise KV cache and spatial-wise parallel generation, and presents the capacity of spatial and temporal extrapolation via 3D rotary embeddings. On the VBench-I2V benchmark, VideoMAR surpasses the previous state-of-the-art (Cosmos I2V) while requiring significantly fewer parameters ($9.3\%$), training data ($0.5\%$), and GPU resources ($0.2\%$).

### PentaRAG: Large-Scale Intelligent Knowledge Retrieval for Enterprise LLM   Applications
**Authors**: Abu Hanif Muhammad Syarubany, Chang Dong Yoo

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T07:54:53Z

**Summary**: Enterprise deployments of large-language model (LLM) demand continuously changing document collections with sub-second latency and predictable GPU cost requirements that classical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines only partially satisfy. We present PentaRAG, a five-layer module that routes each query through two instant caches (fixed key-value and semantic), a memory-recall mode that exploits the LLM's own weights, an adaptive session memory, and a conventional retrieval-augmentation layer. Implemented with Mistral-8B, Milvus and vLLM, the system can answer most repeated or semantically similar questions from low-latency caches while retaining full retrieval for novel queries. On the TriviaQA domain, LoRA fine-tuning combined with the memory-recall layer raises answer similarity by approximately 8% and factual correctness by approximately 16% over the base model. Under a nine-session runtime simulation, cache warming reduces mean latency from several seconds to well below one second and shifts traffic toward the fast paths. Resource-efficiency tests show that PentaRAG cuts average GPU time to 0.248 seconds per query, roughly half that of a naive RAG baseline, and sustains an aggregate throughput of approximately 100,000 queries per second on our setup. These results demonstrate that a layered routing strategy can deliver freshness, speed, and efficiency simultaneously in production-grade RAG systems.

### A Novel Compiler Transformation for Fast Sparse Matrix Multiplication in   GPUs
**Authors**: Hossein Albakri, Kazem Cheshmi

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T06:41:35Z

**Summary**: Sparse data structures are commonly used in neural networks to reduce the memory footprint. These data structures are compact but cause irregularities such as random memory accesses, which prevent efficient use of the memory hierarchy. GPUs are a common platform for machine learning practitioners, but running compact data structures on these devices often leads to slow-downs due to inefficient use of computing and memory resources. This paper proposes a new compiler transformation, enumerate-and-sparse-coarsen, that accelerates sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SPMM) on GPU devices. The transformation increases data reuse in registers and caches while creating more balanced workloads for GPU computing resources. The transformation is tested on sparse neural networks in convolutional and transformer models. On an A100 GPU and across a columns of matrix B (bCols) in $ A \times B = C$ from range of 32 to 128, the transformation yields a geometric mean speedup of 1.84$\times$ to 2.27$\times$ compared to cuBLAS and cuSPARSE baselines, respectively.

### eLLM: Elastic Memory Management Framework for Efficient LLM Serving
**Authors**: Jiale Xu, Rui Zhang, Yi Xiong, Cong Guo, Zihan Liu, Yangjie Zhou, Weiming Hu, Hao Wu, Changxu Shao, Ziqing Wang, Yongjie Yuan, Junping Zhao, Minyi Guo, Jingwen Leng

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T05:56:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models are increasingly being deployed in datacenters. Serving these models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes static weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches. While static weights are constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV caches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for efficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle runtime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory management relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a page table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction. This virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory fragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime memory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization under dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput.   To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management framework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating systems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction, which decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU memory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory Mechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory inflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3) a Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize memory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under stringent SLO constraints. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that eLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems, 2.32x higher decoding throughput, and supporting 3x larger batch sizes for 128K-token inputs.

### Representation Consistency for Accurate and Coherent LLM Answer   Aggregation
**Authors**: Junqi Jiang, Tom Bewley, Salim I. Amoukou, Francesco Leofante, Antonio Rago, Saumitra Mishra, Francesca Toni

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T05:07:47Z

**Summary**: Test-time scaling improves large language models' (LLMs) performance by allocating more compute budget during inference. To achieve this, existing methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%) over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent reasoning.

### Modulated Diffusion: Accelerating Generative Modeling with Modulated   Quantization
**Authors**: Weizhi Gao, Zhichao Hou, Junqi Yin, Feiyi Wang, Linyu Peng, Xiaorui Liu

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T03:31:53Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, but their high computation cost in iterative sampling remains a significant bottleneck. In this work, we present an in-depth and insightful study of state-of-the-art acceleration techniques for diffusion models, including caching and quantization, revealing their limitations in computation error and generation quality. To break these limits, this work introduces Modulated Diffusion (MoDiff), an innovative, rigorous, and principled framework that accelerates generative modeling through modulated quantization and error compensation. MoDiff not only inherents the advantages of existing caching and quantization methods but also serves as a general framework to accelerate all diffusion models. The advantages of MoDiff are supported by solid theoretical insight and analysis. In addition, extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and LSUN demonstrate that MoDiff significant reduces activation quantization from 8 bits to 3 bits without performance degradation in post-training quantization (PTQ). Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/WeizhiGao/MoDiff.

### InfiniPot-V: Memory-Constrained KV Cache Compression for Streaming Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Minsoo Kim, Kyuhong Shim, Jungwook Choi, Simyung Chang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T02:22:14Z

**Summary**: Modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can reason over hour-long video, yet their key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with time--quickly exceeding the fixed memory of phones, AR glasses, and edge robots. Prior compression schemes either assume the whole video and user query are available offline or must first build the full cache, so memory still scales with stream length. InfiniPot-V is the first training-free, query-agnostic framework that enforces a hard, length-independent memory cap for streaming video understanding. During video encoding it monitors the cache and, once a user-set threshold is reached, runs a lightweight compression pass that (i) removes temporally redundant tokens via Temporal-axis Redundancy (TaR) metric and (ii) keeps semantically significant tokens via Value-Norm (VaN) ranking. Across four open-source MLLMs and four long-video and two streaming-video benchmarks, InfiniPot-V cuts peak GPU memory by up to 94%, sustains real-time generation, and matches or surpasses full-cache accuracy--even in multi-turn dialogues. By dissolving the KV cache bottleneck without retraining or query knowledge, InfiniPot-V closes the gap for on-device streaming video assistants.

### Compatibility of trapped ions and dielectrics at cryogenic temperatures
**Authors**: M. Bruff, L. Sonderhouse, K. N. David, J. Stuart, D. H. Slichter, D. Leibfried

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T01:37:55Z

**Summary**: We study the impact of an unshielded dielectric $\unicode{x2013}$ here, a bare optical fiber $\unicode{x2013}$ on a $^{40}$Ca${^+}$ ion held several hundred $\mu$m away in a cryogenic surface electrode trap. We observe distance-dependent stray electric fields of up to a few kV/m due to the dielectric, which drift on average less than 10% per month and can be fully compensated with reasonable voltages on the trap electrodes. We observe ion motional heating rates attributable to the dielectric of $\approx$30 quanta per second at an ion-fiber distance of 215(4) $\mu$m and $\approx$1.5 MHz motional frequency. These results demonstrate the viability of using unshielded, trap-integrated dielectric objects such as miniature optical cavities or other optical elements in cryogenic surface electrode ion traps.

### CDP: Towards Robust Autoregressive Visuomotor Policy Learning via Causal   Diffusion
**Authors**: Jiahua Ma, Yiran Qin, Yixiong Li, Xuanqi Liao, Yulan Guo, Ruimao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T17:59:12Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Policy (DP) enables robots to learn complex behaviors by imitating expert demonstrations through action diffusion. However, in practical applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even when faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its practical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.

### Keigo: Co-designing Log-Structured Merge Key-Value Stores with a   Non-Volatile, Concurrency-aware Storage Hierarchy (Extended Version)
**Authors**: Rúben Adão, Zhongjie Wu, Changjun Zhou, Oana Balmau, João Paulo, Ricardo Macedo

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T15:25:11Z

**Summary**: We present Keigo, a concurrency- and workload-aware storage middleware that enhances the performance of log-structured merge key-value stores (LSM KVS) when they are deployed on a hierarchy of storage devices. The key observation behind Keigo is that there is no one-size-fits-all placement of data across the storage hierarchy that optimizes for all workloads. Hence, to leverage the benefits of combining different storage devices, Keigo places files across different devices based on their parallelism, I/O bandwidth, and capacity. We introduce three techniques - concurrency-aware data placement, persistent read-only caching, and context-based I/O differentiation. Keigo is portable across different LSMs, is adaptable to dynamic workloads, and does not require extensive profiling. Our system enables established production KVS such as RocksDB, LevelDB, and Speedb to benefit from heterogeneous storage setups. We evaluate Keigo using synthetic and realistic workloads, showing that it improves the throughput of production-grade LSMs up to 4x for write- and 18x for read-heavy workloads when compared to general-purpose storage systems and specialized LSM KVS.

### LongSpec: Long-Context Lossless Speculative Decoding with Efficient   Drafting and Verification
**Authors**: Penghui Yang, Cunxiao Du, Fengzhuo Zhang, Haonan Wang, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Bo An

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T05:58:01Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) can now process extremely long contexts, efficient inference over these extended inputs has become increasingly important, especially for emerging applications like LLM agents that highly depend on this capability. Speculative decoding (SD) offers a promising lossless acceleration technique compared to lossy alternatives such as quantization and model cascades. However, most state-of-the-art SD methods are trained on short texts (typically fewer than 4k tokens), making them unsuitable for long-context scenarios. Specifically, adapting these methods to long contexts presents three key challenges: (1) the excessive memory demands posed by draft models due to large Key-Value (KV) cache; (2) performance degradation resulting from the mismatch between short-context training and long-context inference; and (3) inefficiencies in tree attention mechanisms when managing long token sequences. This work introduces LongSpec, a framework that addresses these challenges through three core innovations: a memory-efficient draft model with a constant-sized KV cache; novel position indices that mitigate the training-inference mismatch; and an attention aggregation strategy that combines fast prefix computation with standard tree attention to enable efficient decoding. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LongSpec, achieving up to a 3.26x speedup over strong Flash Attention baselines across five long-context understanding datasets, as well as a 2.25x reduction in wall-clock time on the AIME24 long reasoning task with the QwQ model, demonstrating significant latency improvements for long-context applications. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/LongSpec.

### Cost-Efficient Serving of LLM Agents via Test-Time Plan Caching
**Authors**: Qizheng Zhang, Michael Wornow, Kunle Olukotun

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T04:42:30Z

**Summary**: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots, are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

### CXLMemSim: A pure software simulated CXL.mem for performance   characterization
**Authors**: Yiwei Yang, Brian Zhao, Yusheng Zheng, Pooneh Safayenikoo, Tanvir Ahmed Khan, Andi Quinn

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T04:00:42Z

**Summary**: CXLMemSim is a fast, lightweight simulation framework that enables performance characterization of memory systems based on Compute Express Link (CXL) .mem technology. CXL.mem allows disaggregation and pooling of memory to mitigate memory stranding (underutilized memory trapped on fully loaded servers) in cloud and datacenter environments. However, CXL-attached memory introduces additional latency and bandwidth constraints compared to local DRAM, and real CXL .mem hardware is not yet widely available for empirical evaluation. CXLMemSim addresses this gap by attaching to unmodified applications and simulating CXL-based memory pools in software. It operates by tracing memory allocations and accesses using efficient kernel probes and hardware performance counters, dividing execution into epochs, and injecting timing delays to emulate various CXL .mem latency/bandwidth characteristics. This approach incurs modest runtime overhead while preserving realistic load/store memory access patterns. We implement CXLMemSim on commodity hardware without special devices, and our evaluation shows that it runs orders of magnitude faster than cycle-accurate simulators (e.g., Gem5) for real-world workloads, while accurately modeling the performance impact of CXL .mem. We demonstrate use cases where CXLMemSim enables experimentation with memory pooling configurations, scheduling policies, data migration strategies, and caching techniques that were previously infeasible to evaluate at scale. Key findings include the viability of software-based CXL .mem emulation with low overhead, insights into latency and congestion effects in memory pools, and guidance for system designers to optimize memory disaggregation. Overall, CXLMemSim provides a practical and extensible platform for researchers and practitioners to explore CXL.mem innovations before real hardware becomes commonplace.

### Batch-Max: Higher LLM Throughput using Larger Batch Sizes and KV Cache   Compression
**Authors**: Michael R. Metel, Boxing Chen, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T02:24:51Z

**Summary**: Several works have developed eviction policies to remove key-value (KV) pairs from the KV cache for more efficient inference. The focus has been on compressing the KV cache after the input prompt has been processed for faster token generation. In settings with limited GPU memory, and when the input context is longer than the generation length, we show that by also compressing the KV cache during the input processing phase, larger batch sizes can be used resulting in significantly higher throughput while still maintaining the original model's accuracy.

**Summary**: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is a photoluminescent defect in diamond that exists in different charge states, NV$^-$ and NV$^0$, that are sensitive to the NV's nanoscale environment. Here, we show that photoluminescence (PL) from NV centers in fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) can be employed for all-optical voltage sensing based on electric field-induced NV charge state modulation. More than 95% of FNDs integrated into a capacitor device show a transient increase in NV$^-$ PL intensity of up to 31% within 0.1 ms after application of an external voltage, accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in NV$^0$ PL. The change in NV$^-$ PL increases with increasing applied voltage from 0 to 100 V, corresponding to an electric field of 0 to 625 kV cm$^ {-1}$ in our devices. The electric field sensitivity of a single FND is 19 V cm$^{-1}$ Hz$^ {-1/2}$. We investigate the NV charge state photodynamics on the millisecond timescale and find that the change in NV PL strongly depends on the rate of photoexcitation. We propose a model that qualitatively explains the observed changes in NV PL based on an electric field-induced redistribution of photoexcited electrons from substitutional nitrogen defects to NV centers, leading to a transient conversion of NV$^0$ to NV$^-$ centers upon application of an external voltage. Our results contribute to the development of FNDs as reliable, all-optical, nanoscale electric field sensors in solid-state systems.

### glass: ordered set data structure for client-side order books
**Authors**: Viktor Krapivensky

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T20:46:20Z

**Summary**: The "ordered set" abstract data type with operations "insert", "erase", "find", "min", "max", "next" and "prev" is ubiquitous in computer science. It is usually implemented with red-black trees, $B$-trees, or $B^+$-trees. We present our implementation of ordered set based on a trie. It only supports integer keys (as opposed to keys of any strict weakly ordered type) and is optimized for market data, namely for what we call sequential locality. The following is the list of what we believe to be novelties:   * Cached path to exploit sequential locality, and fast truncation thereof on erase operation;   * A hash table (or, rather, a cache table) with hard O(1) time guarantees on any operation to speed up key lookup (up to a pre-leaf node);   * Hardware-accelerated "find next/previous set bit" operations with BMI2 instruction set extension on x86-64;   * Order book-specific features: the preemption principle and the tree restructure operation that prevent the tree from consuming too much memory.   We achieve the following speedups over C++'s standard std::map container: 6x-20x on modifying operations, 30x on lookup operations, 9x-15x on real market data, and a more modest 2x-3x speedup on iteration. In this paper, we discuss our implementation.

### Cache-Aided Variable-Length Coding with Perfect Privacy
**Authors**: Amirreza Zamani, Mikael Skoglund

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T17:17:38Z

**Summary**: A cache-aided compression problem with perfect privacy is studied, where a server has access to a database of $N$ files, $(Y_1,...,Y_N)$, each of size $F$ bits. The server is connected to $K$ users through a shared link, where each user has access to a local cache of size $MF$ bits. In the placement phase, the server fills the users$'$ caches without prior knowledge of their future demands, while the delivery phase takes place after the users send their demands to the server. We assume that each file $Y_i$ is arbitrarily correlated with a private attribute $X$, and an adversary is assumed to have access to the shared link. The users and the server have access to a shared secret key $W$. The goal is to design the cache contents and the delivered message $\cal C$ such that the average length of $\mathcal{C}$ is minimized, while satisfying: i. The response $\cal C$ does not disclose any information about $X$, i.e., $X$ and $\cal C$ are statistically independent yielding $I(X;\mathcal{C})=0$, which corresponds to the perfect privacy constraint; ii. User $i$ is able to decode its demand, $Y_{d_i}$, by using its local cache $Z_i$, delivered message $\cal C$, and the shared secret key $W$. Due to the correlation of database with the private attribute, existing codes for cache-aided delivery do not fulfill the perfect privacy constraint. Indeed, in this work, we propose a lossless variable-length coding scheme that combines privacy-aware compression with coded caching techniques. In particular, we use two-part code construction and Functional Representation Lemma. Furthermore, we propose an alternative coding scheme based on the minimum entropy coupling concept and a greedy entropy-based algorithm. We show that the proposed scheme improves the previous results obtained by Functional Representation Lemma.

### Mixture of Weight-shared Heterogeneous Group Attention Experts for   Dynamic Token-wise KV Optimization
**Authors**: Guanghui Song, Dongping Liao, Yiren Zhao, Kejiang Ye, Cheng-zhong Xu, Xitong Gao

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T14:30:17Z

**Summary**: Transformer models face scalability challenges in causal language modeling (CLM) due to inefficient memory allocation for growing key-value (KV) caches, which strains compute and storage resources. Existing methods like Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and token-level KV optimization improve efficiency but rely on rigid resource allocation, often discarding "low-priority" tokens or statically grouping them, failing to address the dynamic spectrum of token importance. We propose mixSGA, a novel mixture-of-expert (MoE) approach that dynamically optimizes token-wise computation and memory allocation. Unlike prior approaches, mixSGA retains all tokens while adaptively routing them to specialized experts with varying KV group sizes, balancing granularity and efficiency. Our key novelties include: (1) a token-wise expert-choice routing mechanism guided by learned importance scores, enabling proportional resource allocation without token discard; (2) weight-sharing across grouped attention projections to minimize parameter overhead; and (3) an auxiliary loss to ensure one-hot routing decisions for training-inference consistency in CLMs. Extensive evaluations across Llama3, TinyLlama, OPT, and Gemma2 model families show mixSGA's superiority over static baselines. On instruction-following and continued pretraining tasks, mixSGA achieves higher ROUGE-L and lower perplexity under the same KV budgets.

### Block-wise Adaptive Caching for Accelerating Diffusion Policy
**Authors**: Kangye Ji, Yuan Meng, Hanyun Cui, Ye Li, Shengjia Hua, Lei Chen, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T13:14:58Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Policy has demonstrated strong visuomotor modeling capabilities, but its high computational cost renders it impractical for real-time robotic control. Despite huge redundancy across repetitive denoising steps, existing diffusion acceleration techniques fail to generalize to Diffusion Policy due to fundamental architectural and data divergences. In this paper, we propose Block-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by caching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation acceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block level, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly across timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose the Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps by maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped features. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant error surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly within Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop the Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the upstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a training-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based Diffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference speedup for free.

### On Immutable Memory Systems for Artificial Agents: A Blockchain-Indexed   Automata-Theoretic Framework Using ECDH-Keyed Merkle Chains
**Authors**: Craig Steven Wright

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T08:43:56Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a formalised architecture for synthetic agents designed to retain immutable memory, verifiable reasoning, and constrained epistemic growth. Traditional AI systems rely on mutable, opaque statistical models prone to epistemic drift and historical revisionism. In contrast, we introduce the concept of the Merkle Automaton, a cryptographically anchored, deterministic computational framework that integrates formal automata theory with blockchain-based commitments. Each agent transition, memory fragment, and reasoning step is committed within a Merkle structure rooted on-chain, rendering it non-repudiable and auditably permanent. To ensure selective access and confidentiality, we derive symmetric encryption keys from ECDH exchanges contextualised by hierarchical privilege lattices. This enforces cryptographic access control over append-only DAG-structured knowledge graphs. Reasoning is constrained by formal logic systems and verified through deterministic traversal of policy-encoded structures. Updates are non-destructive and historied, preserving epistemic lineage without catastrophic forgetting. Zero-knowledge proofs facilitate verifiable, privacy-preserving inclusion attestations. Collectively, this architecture reframes memory not as a cache but as a ledger - one whose contents are enforced by protocol, bound by cryptography, and constrained by formal logic. The result is not an intelligent agent that mimics thought, but an epistemic entity whose outputs are provably derived, temporally anchored, and impervious to post hoc revision. This design lays foundational groundwork for legal, economic, and high-assurance computational systems that require provable memory, unforgeable provenance, and structural truth.

### InfiniSST: Simultaneous Translation of Unbounded Speech with Large   Language Model
**Authors**: Siqi Ouyang, Xi Xu, Lei Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T06:38:23Z

**Summary**: Simultaneous translation of unbounded streaming speech remains a challenging problem due to the need for effectively processing the history speech context and past translations so that quality and latency, including computation overhead, can be balanced. Most prior works assume pre-segmented speech, limiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we propose InfiniSST, a novel approach that formulates SST as a multi-turn dialogue task, enabling seamless translation of unbounded speech. We construct translation trajectories and robust segments from MuST-C with multi-latency augmentation during training and develop a key-value (KV) cache management strategy to facilitate efficient inference. Experiments on MuST-C En-Es, En-De, and En-Zh demonstrate that InfiniSST reduces computation-aware latency by 0.5 to 1 second while maintaining the same translation quality compared to baselines. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of our data construction and cache management strategy. We release the code and demo at https://github.com/LeiLiLab/InfiniSST

### Multipole Attention for Efficient Long Context Reasoning
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sebastian Zhao, Luca Manolache, Sehoon Kim, Michael W. Mahoney, Yakun Sophia Shao, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T03:00:40Z

**Summary**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown promising accuracy improvements on complex problem-solving tasks. While these models have attained high accuracy by leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long chain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires generating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce the KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these methods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally, prior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the important prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this pre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning tokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention, which accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention for the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations for the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group together semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids both to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key vectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update process to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens, thereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We evaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our approach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive attention sparsity settings. We also provide kernel implementations to demonstrate the practical efficiency gains from our method, achieving up to 4.5$\times$ speedup for attention in long-context reasoning applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/MultipoleAttention.

### Latent Multi-Head Attention for Small Language Models
**Authors**: Sushant Mehta, Raj Dandekar, Rajat Dandekar, Sreedath Panat

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T02:57:37Z

**Summary**: We present the first comprehensive study of latent multi-head attention (MLA) for small language models, revealing interesting efficiency-quality trade-offs. Training 30M-parameter GPT models on 100,000 synthetic stories, we benchmark three architectural variants: standard multi-head attention (MHA), MLA, and MLA with rotary positional embeddings (MLA+RoPE). Our key finding is that MLA+RoPE with half-rank latent dimensions (r = d/2) achieves a 45% KV-cache memory reduction while incurring only a 0.3% increase in validation loss (essentially matching MHA quality)- a Pareto improvement for memory constrained deployment. We further show that RoPE is crucial for MLA in small models: without it, MLA underperforms vanilla attention by 3-5%, but with RoPE, it surpasses vanilla by 2%. Inference benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs reveal that MLA with r=d/2 achieves a 1.4 times speedup over full-rank MLA while maintaining the memory savings. GPT-4 evaluations corroborate perplexity results, with ours achieving the highest quality scores (7.4/10) across grammar, creativity, and consistency metrics. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

### BLITZSCALE: Fast and Live Large Model Autoscaling with O(1) Host Caching
**Authors**: Dingyan Zhang, Haotian Wang, Yang Liu, Xingda Wei, Yizhou Shan, Rong Chen, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-06-15T13:04:14Z

**Summary**: Model autoscaling is the key mechanism to achieve serverless model-as-a-service, but it faces a fundamental trade-off between scaling speed and storage/memory usage to cache parameters, and cannot meet frequent scaling requirements across multiple hosts. The key problem is that data plane performance is slow, and scaled instances remain stopped while parameters are loading. In this paper, we first show that the data plane can be made fast with no or O(1) caching by loading parameters through the compute network between GPUs because: (1) its speed is comparable to host cache and is underutilized, and (2) scaling multiple instances requires no or O(1) caching with network-optimized multicast. Second, autoscaling can be made live by breaking the scaling abstraction for inference from a coarse-grained instance-level to a fine-grained layer-level. This allows us to offload the layer computation from the overloaded serving instances to the scaled ones without waiting for the parameters to be fully loaded. Under real-world workloads, our system BLITZSCALE achieves up to 94 % lower tail latency reductions compared to state-of-the-art autoscaling system (ServerlessLLM), and it reduces the GPU time used for serving by 49 % when compared with serving systems that do not support autoscaling like DistServe and vLLM with the same service-level-agreement.

### I Know What You Said: Unveiling Hardware Cache Side-Channels in Local   Large Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Zibo Gao, Junjie Hu, Feng Guo, Yixin Zhang, Yinglong Han, Siyuan Liu, Haiyang Li, Zhiqiang Lv

**Updated**: 2025-06-15T08:41:09Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be deployed locally have recently gained popularity for privacy-sensitive tasks, with companies such as Meta, Google, and Intel playing significant roles in their development. However, the security of local LLMs through the lens of hardware cache side-channels remains unexplored. In this paper, we unveil novel side-channel vulnerabilities in local LLM inference: token value and token position leakage, which can expose both the victim's input and output text, thereby compromising user privacy. Specifically, we found that adversaries can infer the token values from the cache access patterns of the token embedding operation, and deduce the token positions from the timing of autoregressive decoding phases. To demonstrate the potential of these leaks, we design a novel eavesdropping attack framework targeting both open-source and proprietary LLM inference systems. The attack framework does not directly interact with the victim's LLM and can be executed without privilege.   We evaluate the attack on a range of practical local LLM deployments (e.g., Llama, Falcon, and Gemma), and the results show that our attack achieves promising accuracy. The restored output and input text have an average edit distance of 5.2% and 17.3% to the ground truth, respectively. Furthermore, the reconstructed texts achieve average cosine similarity scores of 98.7% (input) and 98.0% (output).

### GTA: Grouped-head latenT Attention
**Authors**: Luoyang Sun, Jiwen Jiang, Cheng Deng, Xinjian Wu, Haifeng Zhang, Lei Chen, Lionel Ni, Jun Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-15T07:19:33Z

**Summary**: Attention mechanisms underpin the success of large language models (LLMs), yet their substantial computational and memory overhead poses challenges for optimizing efficiency and performance. A critical bottleneck arises as KV cache and attention computations scale rapidly with text length, challenging deployment on hardware with limited computational and memory resources. We observe that attention mechanisms exhibit substantial redundancy, since the KV cache can be significantly compressed and attention maps across heads display high similarity, revealing that much of the computation and storage is unnecessary. Leveraging these insights, we propose \textbf{G}rouped-Head Laten\textbf{T} \textbf{A}ttention (GTA), a novel attention mechanism that reduces memory usage and computational complexity while maintaining performance. GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism that reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache size; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that compresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs. GTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \emph{62.5\%} versus Grouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \emph{70\%}, all while avoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM deployment efficiency. Consequently, GTA models achieve a \emph{2x} increase in end-to-end inference speed, with prefill benefiting from reduced computational cost and decoding benefiting from the smaller cache footprint.

### ReFrame: Layer Caching for Accelerated Inference in Real-Time Rendering
**Authors**: Lufei Liu, Tor M. Aamodt

**Updated**: 2025-06-14T20:17:43Z

**Summary**: Graphics rendering applications increasingly leverage neural networks in tasks such as denoising, supersampling, and frame extrapolation to improve image quality while maintaining frame rates. The temporal coherence inherent in these tasks presents an opportunity to reuse intermediate results from previous frames and avoid redundant computations. Recent work has shown that caching intermediate features to be reused in subsequent inferences is an effective method to reduce latency in diffusion models. We extend this idea to real-time rendering and present ReFrame, which explores different caching policies to optimize trade-offs between quality and performance in rendering workloads. ReFrame can be applied to a variety of encoder-decoder style networks commonly found in rendering pipelines. Experimental results show that we achieve 1.4x speedup on average with negligible quality loss in three real-time rendering tasks.

### Real-Time Agile Software Management for Edge and Fog Computing Based   Smart City Infrastructure
**Authors**: Debasish Jana, Pinakpani Pal, Pawan Kumar

**Updated**: 2025-06-14T20:00:53Z

**Summary**: The evolution of smart cities demands scalable, secure, and energy-efficient architectures for real-time data processing. With the number of IoT devices expected to exceed 40 billion by 2030, traditional cloud-based systems are increasingly constrained by bandwidth, latency, and energy limitations. This paper leverages the ROOF (Real-time Onsite Operations Facilitation) framework with decentralized computing at intermediary fog and peripheral edge network layers to reduce latency by processing data near its point of origin. ROOF features fog caching to avoid redundancy, ultra-low-power wireless transmission for energy savings, and AI-driven resource allocation for efficiency. Security is enhanced through TLS encryption, blockchain-based authentication, and edge-level access control. Case studies from Bhubaneswar, Barcelona and Copenhagen validate the use of ROOF in traffic systems and environmental monitoring. The paper concludes by outlining key challenges and prospects of AI-driven analytics in smart urban infrastructure.

### Efficient Unified Caching for Accelerating Heterogeneous AI Workloads
**Authors**: Tianze Wang, Yifei Liu, Chen Chen, Pengfei Zuo, Jiawei Zhang, Qizhen Weng, Yin Chen, Zhenhua Han, Jieru Zhao, Quan Chen, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2025-06-14T06:36:54Z

**Summary**: Modern AI clusters, which host diverse workloads like data pre-processing, training and inference, often store the large-volume data in cloud storage and employ caching frameworks to facilitate remote data access. To avoid code-intrusion complexity and minimize cache space wastage, it is desirable to maintain a unified cache shared by all the workloads. However, existing cache management strategies, designed for specific workloads, struggle to handle the heterogeneous AI workloads in a cluster -- which usually exhibit heterogeneous access patterns and item storage granularities. In this paper, we propose IGTCache, a unified, high-efficacy cache for modern AI clusters. IGTCache leverages a hierarchical access abstraction, AccessStreamTree, to organize the recent data accesses in a tree structure, facilitating access pattern detection at various granularities. Using this abstraction, IGTCache applies hypothesis testing to categorize data access patterns as sequential, random, or skewed. Based on these detected access patterns and granularities, IGTCache tailors optimal cache management strategies including prefetching, eviction, and space allocation accordingly. Experimental results show that IGTCache increases the cache hit ratio by 55.6% over state-of-the-art caching frameworks, reducing the overall job completion time by 52.2%.

### ClusterKV: Manipulating LLM KV Cache in Semantic Space for Recallable   Compression
**Authors**: Guangda Liu, Chengwei Li, Jieru Zhao, Chenqi Zhang, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2025-06-14T06:17:33Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in a variety of applications, and the context length is rapidly increasing to handle tasks such as long-document QA and complex logical reasoning. However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/sjtu-zhao-lab/ClusterKV.

### Federated Learning Assisted Edge Caching Scheme Based on Lightweight   Architecture DDPM
**Authors**: Xun Li, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Kezhi Wang, Nan Cheng, Khaled B. Letaief

**Updated**: 2025-06-14T00:52:10Z

**Summary**: Edge caching is an emerging technology that empowers caching units at edge nodes, allowing users to fetch contents of interest that have been pre-cached at the edge nodes. The key to pre-caching is to maximize the cache hit percentage for cached content without compromising users' privacy. In this letter, we propose a federated learning (FL) assisted edge caching scheme based on lightweight architecture denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). Our simulation results verify that our proposed scheme achieves a higher cache hit percentage compared to existing FL-based methods and baseline methods.

**Authors**: Zefan Cai, Wen Xiao, Hanshi Sun, Cheng Luo, Yikai Zhang, Ke Wan, Yucheng Li, Yeyang Zhou, Li-Wen Chang, Jiuxiang Gu, Zhen Dong, Anima Anandkumar, Abedelkadir Asi, Junjie Hu

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T21:01:43Z

**Summary**: Reasoning models have demonstrated impressive performance in self-reflection and chain-of-thought reasoning. However, they often produce excessively long outputs, leading to prohibitively large key-value (KV) caches during inference. While chain-of-thought inference significantly improves performance on complex reasoning tasks, it can also lead to reasoning failures when deployed with existing KV cache compression approaches. To address this, we propose Redundancy-aware KV Cache Compression for Reasoning models (R-KV), a novel method specifically targeting redundant tokens in reasoning models. Our method preserves nearly 100% of the full KV cache performance using only 10% of the KV cache, substantially outperforming existing KV cache baselines, which reach only 60% of the performance. Remarkably, R-KV even achieves 105% of full KV cache performance with 16% of the KV cache. This KV-cache reduction also leads to a 90% memory saving and a 6.6X throughput over standard chain-of-thought reasoning inference. Experimental results show that R-KV consistently outperforms existing KV cache compression baselines across two mathematical reasoning datasets.

### Cartridges: Lightweight and general-purpose long context representations   via self-study
**Authors**: Sabri Eyuboglu, Ryan Ehrlich, Simran Arora, Neel Guha, Dylan Zinsley, Emily Liu, Will Tennien, Atri Rudra, James Zou, Azalia Mirhoseini, Christopher Re

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T17:58:55Z

**Summary**: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL). Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However, we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective. We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference time without retraining.

### CnC-PRAC: Coalesce, not Cache, Per Row Activation Counts for an   Efficient in-DRAM Rowhammer Mitigation
**Authors**: Chris S. Lin, Jeonghyun Woo, Prashant J. Nair, Gururaj Saileshwar

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T17:28:38Z

**Summary**: JEDEC has introduced the Per Row Activation Counting (PRAC) framework for DDR5 and future DRAMs to enable precise counting of DRAM row activations using per-row activation counts. While recent PRAC implementations enable holistic mitigation of Rowhammer attacks, they impose slowdowns of up to 10% due to the increased DRAM timings for performing a read-modify-write of the counter. Alternatively, recent work, Chronus, addresses these slowdowns, but incurs energy overheads due to the additional DRAM activations for counters. In this paper, we propose CnC-PRAC, a PRAC implementation that addresses both performance and energy overheads. Unlike prior works focusing on caching activation counts to reduce their overheads, our key idea is to reorder and coalesce accesses to activation counts located in the same physical row. Our design achieves this by decoupling counter access from the critical path of data accesses. This enables optimizations such as buffering counter read-modify-write requests and coalescing requests to the same row. Together, these enable a reduction in row activations for counter accesses by almost 75%-83% compared to state-of-the-art solutions like Chronus and enable a PRAC implementation with negligible slowdown and a minimal dynamic energy overhead of 0.84%-1% compared to insecure DDR5 DRAM.

### Beyond Homogeneous Attention: Memory-Efficient LLMs via   Fourier-Approximated KV Cache
**Authors**: Xiaoran Liu, Siyang He, Qiqi Wang, Ruixiao Li, Yuerong Song, Zhigeng Liu, Linlin Li, Qun Liu, Zengfeng Huang, Qipeng Guo, Ziwei He, Xipeng Qiu

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T15:35:54Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models struggle with memory demands from the growing Key-Value (KV) cache as context lengths increase. Existing compression methods homogenize head dimensions or rely on attention-guided token pruning, often sacrificing accuracy or introducing computational overhead. We propose FourierAttention, a training-free framework that exploits the heterogeneous roles of transformer head dimensions: lower dimensions prioritize local context, while upper ones capture long-range dependencies. By projecting the long-context-insensitive dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their temporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on LLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH). Besides, a custom Triton kernel, FlashFourierAttention, is designed to optimize memory via streamlined read-write operations, enabling efficient deployment without performance compromise.

### FlashBack:Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Language Modeling for Long   Context Inference
**Authors**: Runheng Liu, Xingchen Xiao, Heyan Huang, Zewen Chi, Zhijing Wu

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T08:32:26Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Language Modeling (RALM) by integrating large language models (LLM) with relevant documents from an external corpus is a proven method for enabling the LLM to generate information beyond the scope of its pre-training corpus. Previous work utilizing retrieved content by simply prepending it to the input poses a high runtime issue, which degrades the inference efficiency of the LLMs because they fail to use the Key-Value (KV) cache efficiently. In this paper, we propose FlashBack, a modular RALM designed to improve the inference efficiency of RALM with appending context pattern while maintaining decent performance after fine-tuning by Low-Rank Adaption. FlashBack appends retrieved documents at the end of the context for efficiently utilizing the KV cache instead of prepending them. And we introduce Marking Token as two special prompt tokens for marking the boundary of the appending context during fine-tuning. Our experiments on testing generation quality show that FlashBack can remain decent generation quality in perplexity. And the inference speed of FlashBack is up to $4\times$ faster than the prepending counterpart on a 7B LLM (Llama 2) in the runtime test. Via bypassing unnecessary re-computation, it demonstrates an advancement by achieving significantly faster inference speed, and this heightened efficiency will substantially reduce inferential cost.

**Authors**: Mahir Labib Dihan, Mohammed Eunus Ali, Md Rizwan Parvez

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T07:04:46Z

**Summary**: Mapping and navigation services like Google Maps, Apple Maps, OpenStreetMap, are essential for accessing various location-based data, yet they often struggle to handle natural language geospatial queries. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in question answering (QA), but creating reliable geospatial QA datasets from map services remains challenging. We introduce MapQaTor, an extensible open-source framework that streamlines the creation of reproducible, traceable map-based QA datasets. MapQaTor enables seamless integration with any maps API, allowing users to gather and visualize data from diverse sources with minimal setup. By caching API responses, the platform ensures consistent ground truth, enhancing the reliability of the data even as real-world information evolves. MapQaTor centralizes data retrieval, annotation, and visualization within a single platform, offering a unique opportunity to evaluate the current state of LLM-based geospatial reasoning while advancing their capabilities for improved geospatial understanding. Evaluation metrics show that, MapQaTor speeds up the annotation process by at least 30 times compared to manual methods, underscoring its potential for developing geospatial resources, such as complex map reasoning datasets.

 ### Teaching Time Series to See and Speak: Forecasting with Aligned Visual   and Textual Perspectives
**Authors**: Sixun Dong, Wei Fan, Teresa Wu, Yanjie Fu

**Updated**: 2025-07-01T03:40:22Z

**Summary**: Time series forecasting traditionally relies on unimodal numerical inputs, which often struggle to capture high-level semantic patterns due to their dense and unstructured nature. While recent approaches have explored representing time series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain limited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual intuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms raw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than using natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities directly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared semantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer and more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate selection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the most informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments on fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing time series forecasting.

### Data Uniformity Improves Training Efficiency and More, with a   Convergence Framework Beyond the NTK Regime
**Authors**: Yuqing Wang, Shangding Gu

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T17:58:30Z

**Summary**: Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including in large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties such as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known to enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist other quantitative and general principles of data selection that can consistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited prior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly distributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance. Specifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads to a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by $h_{\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\min}$ can slow down the training dynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the approximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\min}$ increases. Our analysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including transformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further provides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and function compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct comprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings, including different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by maximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves comparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets.

### SPIRAL: Self-Play on Zero-Sum Games Incentivizes Reasoning via   Multi-Agent Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Bo Liu, Leon Guertler, Simon Yu, Zichen Liu, Penghui Qi, Daniel Balcells, Mickel Liu, Cheston Tan, Weiyan Shi, Min Lin, Wee Sun Lee, Natasha Jaques

**Updated**: 2025-07-01T02:29:52Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision. Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online, multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training. Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6% improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000 expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation, and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous reasoning development.

### Scaling Human Judgment in Community Notes with LLMs
**Authors**: Haiwen Li, Soham De, Manon Revel, Andreas Haupt, Brad Miller, Keith Coleman, Jay Baxter, Martin Saveski, Michiel A. Bakker

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T17:57:32Z

**Summary**: This paper argues for a new paradigm for Community Notes in the LLM era: an open ecosystem where both humans and LLMs can write notes, and the decision of which notes are helpful enough to show remains in the hands of humans. This approach can accelerate the delivery of notes, while maintaining trust and legitimacy through Community Notes' foundational principle: A community of diverse human raters collectively serve as the ultimate evaluator and arbiter of what is helpful. Further, the feedback from this diverse community can be used to improve LLMs' ability to produce accurate, unbiased, broadly helpful notes--what we term Reinforcement Learning from Community Feedback (RLCF). This becomes a two-way street: LLMs serve as an asset to humans--helping deliver context quickly and with minimal effort--while human feedback, in turn, enhances the performance of LLMs. This paper describes how such a system can work, its benefits, key new risks and challenges it introduces, and a research agenda to solve those challenges and realize the potential of this approach.

### Knowing You Don't Know: Learning When to Continue Search in Multi-round   RAG through Self-Practicing
**Authors**: Diji Yang, Linda Zeng, Jinmeng Rao, Yi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T17:46:40Z

**Summary**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown strong capability in enhancing language models' knowledge and reducing AI generative hallucinations, driving its widespread use. However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, SIM-RAG, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.

### SEUF: Is Unlearning One Expert Enough for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs?
**Authors**: Haomin Zhuang, Yihua Zhang, Kehan Guo, Jinghan Jia, Gaowen Liu, Sijia Liu, Xiangliang Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T17:45:54Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in LLMs unlearning have shown remarkable success in removing unwanted data-model influences while preserving the model's utility for legitimate knowledge. Despite these strides, sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs--a key subset of the LLM family--have remained unexplored in the context of unlearning. As MoE LLMs are celebrated for their exceptional performance, we ask:How can unlearning be performed effectively and efficiently on MoE LLMs? Our pilot study shows that the dynamic routing nature of MoE LLMs introduces unique challenges, leading to excessive forgetting, uncontrolled knowledge erasure and substantial utility drops when existing unlearning methods are applied. To address this, we propose a novel Selected-Expert Unlearning Framework (SEUF). Through expert attribution, unlearning is concentrated on the most actively engaged experts for the specified knowledge. Concurrently, an anchor loss is applied to the router to stabilize the active state of this targeted expert, ensuring focused and controlled unlearning. SEUF is compatible with various standard unlearning algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEUF enhances both forget quality up to 5% and model utility by 35% on MoE LLMs across various benchmarks and LLM architectures (compared to standard unlearning algorithms), while only unlearning 0.06% of the model parameters.

### Accounting for motion of supernova host galaxy in statistical inference   from SNIa data
**Authors**: Ujjwal Upadhyay, Tarun Deep Saini, Shiv K. Sethi

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T17:42:13Z

**Summary**: We introduce a Bayesian method to estimate peculiar velocities of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) host galaxies by employing the magnitude-redshift relationship of SNIa. Random peculiar motions act as noise in the estimation of redshift, and constitute independent variables in the SNIa data. We develop a method to take into account errors in independent variables for general nonlinear models. Using the MCMC sampling technique, we implement numerical codes to estimate peculiar velocities along with other cosmological parameters. In this paper, we study the impact of these velocities on cosmological parameters by treating them as nuisance parameters. We apply our proposed method on the Pantheon sample of SNIa and show a few percent shift on the central values of inferred cosmological parameters. Although the current data are not particularly sensitive to this error, using simulated data, we also gauge the efficacy of our method on the future SNIa observations and show that future data require the inclusion of this error in cosmological parameter estimation. Our method complements several existing methods that seek to estimate peculiar velocities using galaxy data and N-body simulations and extends to higher redshifts.

### INSIGHT: Bridging the Student-Teacher Gap in Times of Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Jarne Thys, Sebe Vanbrabant, Davy Vanacken, Gustavo Rovelo Ruiz

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T17:30:39Z

**Summary**: The rise of AI, especially Large Language Models, presents challenges and opportunities to integrate such technology into the classroom. AI has the potential to revolutionize education by helping teaching staff with various tasks, such as personalizing their teaching methods, but it also raises concerns, for example, about the degradation of student-teacher interactions and user privacy. Based on interviews with teaching staff, this paper introduces INSIGHT, a proof of concept to combine various AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of solving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated into various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM by extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students' questions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more personalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by using the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based on student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and inclusive learning experience.

### What Makes Treatment Effects Identifiable? Characterizations and   Estimators Beyond Unconfoundedness
**Authors**: Yang Cai, Alkis Kalavasis, Katerina Mamali, Anay Mehrotra, Manolis Zampetakis

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T17:21:41Z

**Summary**: Most of the widely used estimators of the average treatment effect (ATE) in causal inference rely on the assumptions of unconfoundedness and overlap. Unconfoundedness requires that the observed covariates account for all correlations between the outcome and treatment. Overlap requires the existence of randomness in treatment decisions for all individuals. Nevertheless, many types of studies frequently violate unconfoundedness or overlap, for instance, observational studies with deterministic treatment decisions - popularly known as Regression Discontinuity designs - violate overlap.   In this paper, we initiate the study of general conditions that enable the identification of the average treatment effect, extending beyond unconfoundedness and overlap. In particular, following the paradigm of statistical learning theory, we provide an interpretable condition that is sufficient and necessary for the identification of ATE. Moreover, this condition also characterizes the identification of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and can be used to characterize other treatment effects as well. To illustrate the utility of our condition, we present several well-studied scenarios where our condition is satisfied and, hence, we prove that ATE can be identified in regimes that prior works could not capture. For example, under mild assumptions on the data distributions, this holds for the models proposed by Tan (2006) and Rosenbaum (2002), and the Regression Discontinuity design model introduced by Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960). For each of these scenarios, we also show that, under natural additional assumptions, ATE can be estimated from finite samples.   We believe these findings open new avenues for bridging learning-theoretic insights and causal inference methodologies, particularly in observational studies with complex treatment mechanisms.

### STACK: Adversarial Attacks on LLM Safeguard Pipelines
**Authors**: Ian R. McKenzie, Oskar J. Hollinsworth, Tom Tseng, Xander Davies, Stephen Casper, Aaron D. Tucker, Robert Kirk, Adam Gleave

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T17:21:08Z

**Summary**: Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus model using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including Google DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second, we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33% ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.

### Analysis of quasi-planar defects using the Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker   model
**Authors**: Dharamveer Kumar, Amuthan A. Ramabathiran

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T17:17:11Z

**Summary**: We analyze the convergence of the electron density and relative energy with respect to a perfect crystal of a class of volume defects that are compactly contained along one direction while being of infinite extent along the other two using the Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker (TFW) model. We take advantage of prior work on the thermodynamic limit and stability estimates in the TFW setting, and specialize it to the case of quasi-planar defects. In particular, we prove that the relative energy of the defective crystal with respect to a perfect crystal is finite, and in fact conforms to a well-posed minimization problem. In order to show the existence of the minimization problem, we modify the TFW theory for thin films and establish convergence of the electronic fields due to the perturbation caused by the quasi-planar defect. We also show that perturbations to both the density and electrostatic potential due to the presence of the quasi-planar defect decay exponentially away from the defect, in agreement with the known locality property of the TFW model. We use these results to infer bounds on the generalized stacking fault energy, in particular the finiteness of this energy, and discuss its implications for numerical calculations. We conclude with a brief presentation of numerical results on the (non-convex) Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker-Dirac (TFWD) model that includes the Dirac exchange in the universal functional, and discuss its implications for future work.

### Scout-Dose-TCM: Direct and Prospective Scout-Based Estimation of   Personalized Organ Doses from Tube Current Modulated CT Exams
**Authors**: Maria Jose Medrano, Sen Wang, Liyan Sun, Abdullah-Al-Zubaer Imran, Jennie Cao, Grant Stevens, Justin Ruey Tse, Adam S. Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T17:13:00Z

**Summary**: This study proposes Scout-Dose-TCM for direct, prospective estimation of organ-level doses under tube current modulation (TCM) and compares its performance to two established methods. We analyzed contrast-enhanced chest-abdomen-pelvis CT scans from 130 adults (120 kVp, TCM). Reference doses for six organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, bladder, spleen) were calculated using MC-GPU and TotalSegmentator. Based on these, we trained Scout-Dose-TCM, a deep learning model that predicts organ doses corresponding to discrete cosine transform (DCT) basis functions, enabling real-time estimates for any TCM profile. The model combines a feature learning module that extracts contextual information from lateral and frontal scouts and scan range with a dose learning module that output DCT-based dose estimates. A customized loss function incorporated the DCT formulation during training. For comparison, we implemented size-specific dose estimation per AAPM TG 204 (Global CTDIvol) and its organ-level TCM-adapted version (Organ CTDIvol). A 5-fold cross-validation assessed generalizability by comparing mean absolute percentage dose errors and r-squared correlations with benchmark doses. Average absolute percentage errors were 13% (Global CTDIvol), 9% (Organ CTDIvol), and 7% (Scout-Dose-TCM), with bladder showing the largest discrepancies (15%, 13%, and 9%). Statistical tests confirmed Scout-Dose-TCM significantly reduced errors vs. Global CTDIvol across most organs and improved over Organ CTDIvol for the liver, bladder, and pancreas. It also achieved higher r-squared values, indicating stronger agreement with Monte Carlo benchmarks. Scout-Dose-TCM outperformed Global CTDIvol and was comparable to or better than Organ CTDIvol, without requiring organ segmentations at inference, demonstrating its promise as a tool for prospective organ-level dose estimation in CT.

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:54:48Z

**Summary**: The increasing demand for mental health services has led to the rise of AI-driven mental health chatbots, though challenges related to privacy, data collection, and expertise persist. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is gaining attention as a theoretical basis for boosting expertise in the development of these chatbots. However, existing datasets are showing limitations for training chatbots, leading to a substantial demand for publicly available resources in the field of MI and psychotherapy. These challenges are even more pronounced in non-English languages, where they receive less attention. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that simulates MI sessions enriched with the expertise of professional therapists. We train an MI forecaster model that mimics the behavioral choices of professional therapists and employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate utterances through prompt engineering. Then, we present KMI, the first synthetic dataset theoretically grounded in MI, containing 1,000 high-quality Korean Motivational Interviewing dialogues. Through an extensive expert evaluation of the generated dataset and the dialogue model trained on it, we demonstrate the quality, expertise, and practicality of KMI. We also introduce novel metrics derived from MI theory in order to evaluate dialogues from the perspective of MI.

### Agent.xpu: Efficient Scheduling of Agentic LLM Workloads on   Heterogeneous SoC
**Authors**: Xinming Wei, Jiahao Zhang, Haoran Li, Jiayu Chen, Rui Qu, Maoliang Li, Xiang Chen, Guojie Luo

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:50:48Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on personal devices introduces a new class of workloads characterized by a dichotomy of objectives. Reactive tasks, initiated by users, demand immediate, low-latency responses, while proactive tasks operate invisibly and prioritize throughput. Existing on-device LLM engines, designed for isolated inferences, fail to efficiently manage these concurrent and conflicting requests on consumer-grade heterogeneous SoCs with CPU, integrated GPU, and NPU. This paper introduces Agent.xpu, an efficient serving system for agentic LLM workloads on memory-unified heterogeneous SoCs. With dedicated offline profiling, Agent.xpu first constructs a heterogeneous execution graph, which fuses and chunks model kernels for affinity-guided, elastic accelerator mapping with predictive kernel annotation. At runtime, its online scheduler enables fine-grained, kernel-level preemption to guarantee the responsiveness of reactive tasks. To maximize SoC utilization, it adopts slack-aware kernel backfill to opportunistically append proactive tasks, and mitigates NPU-iGPU contention via bandwidth-aware dispatch. Evaluation on an Intel Core Ultra SoC shows that Agent.xpu achieves 4.6$\times$ lower latency for reactive tasks and sustains 1.6$\times$-6.8$\times$ higher throughput for proactive tasks compared to state-of-the-art inference engines.

**Authors**: Alexis Melot, Sean U. N. Wood, Yannick Coffinier, Pierre Yger, Fabien Alibart

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:48:49Z

**Summary**: Spike sorting is a crucial step in decoding multichannel extracellular neural signals, enabling the identification of individual neuronal activity. A key challenge in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) is achieving real-time, low-power spike sorting at the edge while keeping high neural decoding performance. This study introduces the Neuromorphic Sparse Sorter (NSS), a compact two-layer spiking neural network optimized for efficient spike sorting. NSS leverages the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for sparse coding to extract relevant features from noisy events with reduced computational demands. NSS learns to sort detected spike waveforms in an online fashion and operates entirely unsupervised. To exploit multi-bit spike coding capabilities of neuromorphic platforms like Intel's Loihi 2, a custom neuron model was implemented, enabling flexible power-performance trade-offs via adjustable spike bit-widths. Evaluations on simulated and real-world tetrode signals with biological drift showed NSS outperformed established pipelines such as WaveClus3 and PCA+KMeans. With 2-bit graded spikes, NSS on Loihi 2 outperformed NSS implemented with leaky integrate-and-fire neuron and achieved an F1-score of 77% (+10% improvement) while consuming 8.6mW (+1.65mW) when tested on a drifting recording, with a computational processing time of 0.25ms (+60 us) per inference.

### Riddle Me This! Stealthy Membership Inference for Retrieval-Augmented   Generation
**Authors**: Ali Naseh, Yuefeng Peng, Anshuman Suri, Harsh Chaudhari, Alina Oprea, Amir Houmansadr

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:37:59Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate grounded responses by leveraging external knowledge databases without altering model parameters. Although the absence of weight tuning prevents leakage via model parameters, it introduces the risk of inference adversaries exploiting retrieved documents in the model's context. Existing methods for membership inference and data extraction often rely on jailbreaking or carefully crafted unnatural queries, which can be easily detected or thwarted with query rewriting techniques common in RAG systems. In this work, we present Interrogation Attack (IA), a membership inference technique targeting documents in the RAG datastore. By crafting natural-text queries that are answerable only with the target document's presence, our approach demonstrates successful inference with just 30 queries while remaining stealthy; straightforward detectors identify adversarial prompts from existing methods up to ~76x more frequently than those generated by our attack. We observe a 2x improvement in TPR@1%FPR over prior inference attacks across diverse RAG configurations, all while costing less than $0.02 per document inference.

**Authors**: Zekun Wu, Seonglae Cho, Umar Mohammed, Cristian Munoz, Kleyton Costa, Xin Guan, Theo King, Ze Wang, Emre Kazim, Adriano Koshiyama

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:31:53Z

**Summary**: Open-source AI libraries are foundational to modern AI systems, yet they present significant, underexamined risks spanning security, licensing, maintenance, supply chain integrity, and regulatory compliance. We introduce LibVulnWatch, a system that leverages recent advances in large language models and agentic workflows to perform deep, evidence-based evaluations of these libraries. Built on a graph-based orchestration of specialized agents, the framework extracts, verifies, and quantifies risk using information from repositories, documentation, and vulnerability databases. LibVulnWatch produces reproducible, governance-aligned scores across five critical domains, publishing results to a public leaderboard for ongoing ecosystem monitoring. Applied to 20 widely used libraries, including ML frameworks, LLM inference engines, and agent orchestration tools, our approach covers up to 88% of OpenSSF Scorecard checks while surfacing up to 19 additional risks per library, such as critical RCE vulnerabilities, missing SBOMs, and regulatory gaps. By integrating advanced language technologies with the practical demands of software risk assessment, this work demonstrates a scalable, transparent mechanism for continuous supply chain evaluation and informed library selection.

### Semiparametric Double Reinforcement Learning with Applications to   Long-Term Causal Inference
**Authors**: Lars van der Laan, David Hubbard, Allen Tran, Nathan Kallus, Aurélien Bibaut

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:30:42Z

**Summary**: Long-term causal effects often must be estimated from short-term data due to limited follow-up in healthcare, economics, and online platforms. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a natural framework for capturing such long-term dynamics through sequences of states, actions, and rewards. Double Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables efficient inference on policy values in MDPs, but nonparametric implementations require strong intertemporal overlap assumptions and often exhibit high variance and instability. We propose a semiparametric extension of DRL for efficient inference on linear functionals of the Q-function--such as policy values--in infinite-horizon, time-homogeneous MDPs. By imposing structural restrictions on the Q-function, our approach relaxes the strong overlap conditions required by nonparametric methods and improves statistical efficiency. Under model misspecification, our estimators target the functional of the best-approximating Q-function, with only second-order bias. We provide conditions for valid inference using sieve methods and data-driven model selection. A central challenge in DRL is the estimation of nuisance functions, such as density ratios, which often involve difficult minimax optimization. To address this, we introduce a novel plug-in estimator based on isotonic Bellman calibration, which combines fitted Q-iteration with an isotonic regression adjustment. The estimator is debiased without requiring estimation of additional nuisance functions and reduces high-dimensional overlap assumptions to a one-dimensional condition. Bellman calibration extends isotonic calibration--widely used in prediction and classification--to the MDP setting and may be of independent interest.

### Bug Fixing with Broader Context: Enhancing LLM-Based Program Repair via   Layered Knowledge Injection
**Authors**: Ramtin Ehsani, Esteban Parra, Sonia Haiduc, Preetha Chatterjee

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:19:38Z

**Summary**: Prompting LLMs with bug-related context (e.g., error messages, stack traces) improves automated program repair, but many bugs still remain unresolved. In real-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and project-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this paper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge can improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection framework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts with the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy function and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which adds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally injects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from documentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a dataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini), and analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting knowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314) using Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug types show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while only a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that different bug types require different levels of contextual information for effective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that more complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI bugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our results show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest the need for interactive and adaptive APR systems.

### CoMMiT: Co-informed inference of microbiome-metabolome interactions via   transfer learning
**Authors**: Leiyue Li, Chenglong Ye, Tim Randolph, Meredith Hullar, Johanna Lampe, Marian Neuhouser, Daniel Raftery, Yue Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:18:06Z

**Summary**: Recent multi-omic microbiome studies enable integrative analysis of microbes and metabolites, uncovering their associations with various host conditions. Such analyses require multivariate models capable of accounting for the complex correlation structures between microbes and metabolites. However, existing multivariate models often suffer from low statistical power for detecting microbiome-metabolome interactions due to small sample sizes and weak biological signals. To address these challenges, we introduce CoMMiT, Co-informed inference of Microbiome-Metabolome Interactions via novel Transfer learning models. Unlike conventional transfer-learning methods that borrow information from external datasets, CoMMiT leverages similarities across metabolites within a single cohort, reducing the risk of negative transfer often caused by differences in sequencing platforms and bioinformatic pipelines across studies. CoMMiT operates under the flexible assumption that auxiliary metabolites are collectively informative for the target metabolite, without requiring individual auxiliary metabolites to be informative. CoMMiT uses a novel data-driven approach to selecting the optimal set of auxiliary metabolites. Using this optimal set, CoMMiT employs a de-biasing framework to enable efficient calculation of p-values, facilitating the identification of statistically significant microbiome-metabolome interactions. Applying CoMMiT to a feeding study reveals biologically meaningful microbiome-metabolome interactions under a low glycemic load diet, demonstrating the diet-host link through gut metabolism.

### Pixel super-resolved virtual staining of label-free tissue using   diffusion models
**Authors**: Yijie Zhang, Luzhe Huang, Nir Pillar, Yuzhu Li, Hanlong Chen, Aydogan Ozcan

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:15:48Z

**Summary**: Virtual staining of tissue offers a powerful tool for transforming label-free microscopy images of unstained tissue into equivalents of histochemically stained samples. This study presents a diffusion model-based super-resolution virtual staining approach utilizing a Brownian bridge process to enhance both the spatial resolution and fidelity of label-free virtual tissue staining, addressing the limitations of traditional deep learning-based methods. Our approach integrates novel sampling techniques into a diffusion model-based image inference process to significantly reduce the variance in the generated virtually stained images, resulting in more stable and accurate outputs. Blindly applied to lower-resolution auto-fluorescence images of label-free human lung tissue samples, the diffusion-based super-resolution virtual staining model consistently outperformed conventional approaches in resolution, structural similarity and perceptual accuracy, successfully achieving a super-resolution factor of 4-5x, increasing the output space-bandwidth product by 16-25-fold compared to the input label-free microscopy images. Diffusion-based super-resolved virtual tissue staining not only improves resolution and image quality but also enhances the reliability of virtual staining without traditional chemical staining, offering significant potential for clinical diagnostics.

### Anchoring Stellar Age Indicators: A Cross-Calibration of [C/N] and   Gyrochronology Ages via the Age-Velocity-Dispersion Relation
**Authors**: Yuxi Lu, Marc H. Pinsonneault, Yuan-Sen Ting, Phil R. Van-Lane, John D Roberts, Jamie Tayar, Alexander Stone-Martinez

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:14:09Z

**Summary**: Determining stellar ages is challenging, as it depends on other stellar parameters in a non-linear way and often relies on stellar evolution models to infer the underlying relation between these parameters and age. This complexity increases when comparing different age-dating methods, as they rely on distinct indicators and are often applicable to non-overlapping regions of the color-magnitude diagram. Moreover, many empirical calibration methods rely on pre-determined ages, often from open clusters or asteroseismology, which only cover a limited parameter space. Fortunately, the age-velocity-dispersion relation (AVR), in which the velocity dispersion increases with age, is a universal feature among stars of all evolutionary stages. In this paper, we 1) explore the parameter space in which [C/N] and gyrochronology are applicable, extending beyond the domains probed by asteroseismology and open clusters, and 2) assess whether the traditionally assumed [C/N] and gyrochronology relations yield ages on a consistent physical scale, after calibrating both using the same AVR. We find gyrochronology can be applied to all partially convective stars after they have converged onto the slow rotating sequence and before they experience weakened magnetic braking; [C/N] can be used to infer ages for all giants with metallicity > -0.8 dex and [C/N] < -0.05 dex, and can be used as an age-indicator down to [Fe/H] of -1 dex if only selecting the low-$\alpha$ disk. Lastly, ages obtained from [C/N] and gyrochronology agree within uncertainty after accounting for systematic offsets.

### Large Language Models Don't Make Sense of Word Problems. A Scoping   Review from a Mathematics Education Perspective
**Authors**: Anselm R. Strohmaier, Wim Van Dooren, Kathrin Seßler, Brian Greer, Lieven Verschaffel

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:10:42Z

**Summary**: The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question of how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support mathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle textual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word problems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the real-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We conducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including three parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in research, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical word problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the conceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs and students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled mathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics education. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most popular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require a consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our evaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems shows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy, including a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed weaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or non-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have mastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems, which potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics classrooms.

### ReferDINO: Referring Video Object Segmentation with Visual Grounding   Foundations
**Authors**: Tianming Liang, Kun-Yu Lin, Chaolei Tan, Jianguo Zhang, Wei-Shi Zheng, Jian-Fang Hu

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:09:19Z

**Summary**: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects throughout a video based on a text description. This is challenging as it involves deep vision-language understanding, pixel-level dense prediction and spatiotemporal reasoning. Despite notable progress in recent years, existing methods still exhibit a noticeable gap when considering all these aspects. In this work, we propose \textbf{ReferDINO}, a strong RVOS model that inherits region-level vision-language alignment from foundational visual grounding models, and is further endowed with pixel-level dense perception and cross-modal spatiotemporal reasoning. In detail, ReferDINO integrates two key components: 1) a grounding-guided deformable mask decoder that utilizes location prediction to progressively guide mask prediction through differentiable deformation mechanisms; 2) an object-consistent temporal enhancer that injects pretrained time-varying text features into inter-frame interaction to capture object-aware dynamic changes. Moreover, a confidence-aware query pruning strategy is designed to accelerate object decoding without compromising model performance. Extensive experimental results on five benchmarks demonstrate that our ReferDINO significantly outperforms previous methods (e.g., +3.9% (\mathcal{J}&\mathcal{F}) on Ref-YouTube-VOS) with real-time inference speed (51 FPS).

### The Illusion of Progress? A Critical Look at Test-Time Adaptation for   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Lijun Sheng, Jian Liang, Ran He, Zilei Wang, Tieniu Tan

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:05:55Z

**Summary**: Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have gained significant attention for enhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP during inference, without requiring additional labeled data. However, current TTA researches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of baseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental settings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons between TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To address these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7 online TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates them across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on CLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid loss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA to assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates various evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic assessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1) existing TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering work; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time fine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced model trustworthiness. We release TTA-VLM to provide fair comparison and comprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the community to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies.

### Auto-TA: Towards Scalable Automated Thematic Analysis (TA) via   Multi-Agent Large Language Models with Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Seungjun Yi, Joakim Nguyen, Huimin Xu, Terence Lim, Andrew Well, Mia Markey, Ying Ding

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:02:28Z

**Summary**: Congenital heart disease (CHD) presents complex, lifelong challenges often underrepresented in traditional clinical metrics. While unstructured narratives offer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic analysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully automated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on clinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full transcript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where specialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with human analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable, patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts.

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T15:59:26Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates Reinforcement Learning (RL) on data without explicit labels for reasoning tasks in Large Language Models (LLMs). The core challenge of the problem is reward estimation during inference while not having access to ground-truth information. While this setting appears elusive, we find that common practices in Test-Time Scaling (TTS), such as majority voting, yield surprisingly effective rewards suitable for driving RL training. In this work, we introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), a novel method for training LLMs using RL on unlabeled data. TTRL enables self-evolution of LLMs by utilizing the priors in the pre-trained models. Our experiments demonstrate that TTRL consistently improves performance across a variety of tasks and models. Notably, TTRL boosts the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-Math-7B by approximately 211% on the AIME 2024 with only unlabeled test data. Furthermore, although TTRL is only supervised by the maj@n metric, TTRL has demonstrated performance to consistently surpass the upper limit of the initial model maj@n, and approach the performance of models trained directly on test data with ground-truth labels. Our experimental findings validate the general effectiveness of TTRL across various tasks and highlight TTRL's potential for broader tasks and domains. GitHub: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/TTRL

### StreamFlow: Streaming Flow Matching with Block-wise Guided Attention   Mask for Speech Token Decoding
**Authors**: Dake Guo, Jixun Yao, Linhan Ma, Wang He, Lei Xie

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T15:50:08Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in discrete token-based speech generation have highlighted the importance of token-to-waveform generation for audio quality, particularly in real-time interactions. Traditional frameworks integrating semantic tokens with flow matching (FM) struggle with streaming capabilities due to their reliance on a global receptive field. Additionally, directly implementing token-by-token streaming speech generation often results in degraded audio quality. To address these challenges, we propose StreamFlow, a novel neural architecture that facilitates streaming flow matching with diffusion transformers (DiT). To mitigate the long-sequence extrapolation issues arising from lengthy historical dependencies, we design a local block-wise receptive field strategy. Specifically, the sequence is first segmented into blocks, and we introduce block-wise attention masks that enable the current block to receive information from the previous or subsequent block. These attention masks are combined hierarchically across different DiT-blocks to regulate the receptive field of DiTs. Both subjective and objective experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to non-streaming methods while surpassing other streaming methods in terms of speech quality, all the while effectively managing inference time during long-sequence generation. Furthermore, our method achieves a notable first-packet latency of only 180 ms.\footnote{Speech samples: https://dukguo.github.io/StreamFlow/}

### StyleDrive: Towards Driving-Style Aware Benchmarking of End-To-End   Autonomous Driving
**Authors**: Ruiyang Hao, Bowen Jing, Haibao Yu, Zaiqing Nie

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T15:48:38Z

**Summary**: While personalization has been explored in traditional autonomous driving systems, it remains largely overlooked in end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD), despite its growing prominence. This gap is critical, as user-aligned behavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets annotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we present the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations capturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for personalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from real-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned visual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario construction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference annotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics. To address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the VLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and driver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a human-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building on this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized E2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without preference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized preferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving. Our work lays the foundation for personalized E2EAD by providing a standardized platform to systematically integrate human preferences into data-driven E2EAD systems, catalyzing future research in human-centric autonomy.

### TaP: A Taxonomy-Guided Framework for Automated and Scalable Preference   Data Generation
**Authors**: Renren Jin, Tianhao Shen, Xinwei Wu, Dan Shi, Haoran Sun, Wuwei Huang, Quandong Wang, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Deyi Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T15:45:28Z

**Summary**: Conducting supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning on large language models (LLMs) requires high-quality datasets to improve their ability to follow instructions and align with human preferences and values. However, constructing such datasets is resource-intensive, and most available datasets for supervised and preference fine-tuning are in English. To address these challenges, we propose the \underline{\textbf{Ta}}xonomy-Guided \underline{\textbf{P}}reference Data Generation (TaP) framework, which facilitates automated and scalable construction of preference datasets across various languages. TaP is grounded in a structured taxonomy that allows fine-grained control over dataset composition, thereby ensuring both diversity and comprehensive coverage. We employ TaP-generated datasets to perform supervised and preference fine-tuning on various LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets outperform those trained on existing open-source datasets. Remarkably, LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets surpass the performance of those trained on an open-source dataset that is 180 times larger.

### LLM Agents Are the Antidote to Walled Gardens
**Authors**: Samuele Marro, Philip Torr

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T15:45:17Z

**Summary**: While the Internet's core infrastructure was designed to be open and universal, today's application layer is dominated by closed, proprietary platforms. Open and interoperable APIs require significant investment, and market leaders have little incentive to enable data exchange that could erode their user lock-in. We argue that LLM-based agents fundamentally disrupt this status quo. Agents can automatically translate between data formats and interact with interfaces designed for humans: this makes interoperability dramatically cheaper and effectively unavoidable. We name this shift universal interoperability: the ability for any two digital services to exchange data seamlessly using AI-mediated adapters. Universal interoperability undermines monopolistic behaviours and promotes data portability. However, it can also lead to new security risks and technical debt. Our position is that the ML community should embrace this development while building the appropriate frameworks to mitigate the downsides. By acting now, we can harness AI to restore user freedom and competitive markets without sacrificing security.

### Green Metrics Tool: Measuring for fun and profit
**Authors**: Geerd-Dietger Hoffmann, Verena Majuntke

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T15:36:53Z

**Summary**: The environmental impact of software is gaining increasing attention as the demand for computational resources continues to rise. In order to optimize software resource consumption and reduce carbon emissions, measuring and evaluating software is a first essential step. In this paper we discuss what metrics are important for fact base decision making. We introduce the Green Metrics Tool (GMT), a novel framework for accurately measuring the resource consumption of software. The tool provides a containerized, controlled, and reproducible life cycle-based approach, assessing the resource use of software during key phases. Finally, we discuss GMT features like visualization, comparability and rule- and LLM-based optimisations highlighting its potential to guide developers and researchers in reducing the environmental impact of their software.

### Learning Constraints Directly from Network Data
**Authors**: Hongyu Hè, Minhao Jin, Maria Apostolaki

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T15:36:22Z

**Summary**: Network data conforms to a wide range of rules that arise from protocols, design principles, and deployment decisions (e.g., a packet's queuing delay must be less than its end-to-end delay). Formalizing such rules as logic constraints can (i) improve the quality of synthetic data, (ii) reduce the brittleness of machine learning (ML) models, and (iii) improve semantic understanding of network measurements. However, these benefits remain out of reach if rule extraction is manual or solely reliant on ML, as both approaches yield incomplete, unreliable, and/or inaccurate rules.   This paper formulates rule extraction as a constraint modeling problem and introduces NetNomos that learns propositional logic constraints directly from raw network measurements. Constraint modeling in this domain is uniquely challenging due to the scale of the data, the inherent learning complexity and passive environment, and the lack of ground truth supervision. NetNomos addresses these challenges via a lattice-based search structured by constraint specificity and succinctness. Our approach reduces learning complexity from superquadratic to logarithmic and enables efficient traversal in combinatorial search space.   Our evaluations on diverse network datasets show that NetNomos learns all benchmark rules, including those associated with as little as 0.01% of data points, in under three hours. In contrast, baseline methods discover less than 25% of the rules and require several days to run. Through three case studies, we show that: NetNomos (i) finds rule violations in the outputs of all seven synthetic traffic generators, hence can be used to assess and guide their generation process; (ii) detects semantic differences in traffic, hence can be used for anomaly detection; and (iii) automatically finds rules used for telemetry imputation, hence can support monitoring through inference.

### Learning Li-ion battery health and degradation modes from data with   aging-aware circuit models
**Authors**: Zihao Zhou, Antti Aitio, David Howey

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T15:35:03Z

**Summary**: Non-invasive estimation of Li-ion battery state-of-health from operational data is valuable for battery applications, but remains challenging. Pure model-based methods may suffer from inaccuracy and long-term instability of parameter estimates, whereas pure data-driven methods rely heavily on training data quality and quantity, causing lack of generality when extrapolating to unseen cases. We apply an aging-aware equivalent circuit model for health estimation, combining the flexibility of data-driven techniques within a model-based approach. A simplified electrical model with voltage source and resistor incorporates Gaussian process regression to learn capacity fade over time and also the dependence of resistance on operating conditions and time. The approach was validated against two datasets and shown to give accurate performance with less than 1% relative root mean square error (RMSE) in capacity and less than 2% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Critically, we show that the open circuit voltage versus state-of-charge function must be accurately known, and any inaccuracies or changes in this over time strongly influence the inferred resistance. However, this feature (or bug) may also be used to estimate in operando differential voltage curves from operational data.

### Intelligent Orchestration of Distributed Large Foundation Model   Inference at the Edge
**Authors**: Fernando Koch, Aladin Djuhera, Alecio Binotto

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T15:26:30Z

**Summary**: Large Foundation Models (LFMs), including multi-modal and generative models, promise to unlock new capabilities for next-generation Edge AI applications. However, performing inference with LFMs in resource-constrained and heterogeneous edge environments, such as Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), presents significant challenges for workload orchestration due to time-varying network, compute, and storage conditions. In particular, current split inference strategies, which partition LFM layers across nodes, are not designed to adapt to fluctuating workloads, dynamic bandwidth conditions, or evolving privacy constraints in high-utilization MEC environments. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive split inference orchestration framework that elevates both the placement and partitioning of LFM layers to runtime-tunable variables. Specifically, our framework enables real-time, quality-of-service (QoS)-aware management of inference workloads by extending conventional orchestrators with three key services: (1) Capacity-aware workload distribution, which continuously profiles node resources and selects an optimal subset of MEC nodes; (2) Dynamic partition migration, which transparently relocates pre-cut LFM segments in response to changes in utilization or network conditions; (3) Real-time reconfiguration, which dynamically re-splits LFM layers to balance latency, throughput, and privacy. We formalize the joint placement-partitioning problem, outline a reference architecture and algorithmic workflow, and discuss applicability in representative smart city, V2X, and industrial edge scenarios.

### Unveiling Decision-Making in LLMs for Text Classification : Extraction   of influential and interpretable concepts with Sparse Autoencoders
**Authors**: Mathis Le Bail, Jérémie Dentan, Davide Buscaldi, Sonia Vanier

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T15:18:50Z

**Summary**: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been successfully used to probe Large Language Models (LLMs) and extract interpretable concepts from their internal representations. These concepts are linear combinations of neuron activations that correspond to human-interpretable features. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of SAE-based explainability approaches for sentence classification, a domain where such methods have not been extensively explored. We present a novel SAE-based architecture tailored for text classification, leveraging a specialized classifier head and incorporating an activation rate sparsity loss. We benchmark this architecture against established methods such as ConceptShap, Independent Component Analysis, and other SAE-based concept extraction techniques. Our evaluation covers two classification benchmarks and four fine-tuned LLMs from the Pythia family. We further enrich our analysis with two novel metrics for measuring the precision of concept-based explanations, using an external sentence encoder. Our empirical results show that our architecture improves both the causality and interpretability of the extracted features.

### Graft: Integrating the Domain Knowledge via Efficient Parameter Synergy   for MLLMs
**Authors**: Yang Dai, Jianxiang An, Tianwei Lin, Hongyang He, Hongzhe Huang, Wenqiao Zhang, Zheqi Lv, Siliang Tang, Yueting Zhuang

**Updated**: 2025-07-01T03:26:52Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved success across various domains. However, their applicability tends to degrade when confronted with different types of data inputs, especially for MLLMs that have been fine-tuned for specific tasks. Despite its importance, the study of knowledge sharing among domain-specific MLLMs--such as those trained for mathematics or code--remains largely underexplored. To address the fragmentation of knowledge across domain-specialized MLLMs, we propose a unified parameter integration framework that enables modular composition of expert capabilities. Our method is grounded in a novel Compatibility-Aware Parameter Splicing (CAPS) strategy, which leverages both local functional attribution and global information-theoretic signals to guide selective parameter fusion. By extending this mechanism to the low-rank adaptation layer granularity, we ensure efficient integration with minimal inference overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a domain compatibility scoring mechanism that quantifies inter-expert alignment at the activation level and correlates with downstream task utility. This principled fusion protocol allows the final model to synergize heterogeneous expertise while preserving structural modularity. Extensive evaluations across diverse multimodal benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our framework, offering a scalable path toward compositional, domain-adaptive MLLMs.

### QPART: Adaptive Model Quantization and Dynamic Workload Balancing for   Accuracy-aware Edge Inference
**Authors**: Xiangchen Li, Saeid Ghafouri, Bo Ji, Hans Vandierendonck, Deepu John, Dimitrios S. Nikolopoulos

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T15:03:35Z

**Summary**: As machine learning inferences increasingly move to edge devices, adapting to diverse computational capabilities, hardware, and memory constraints becomes more critical. Instead of relying on a pre-trained model fixed for all future inference queries across diverse edge devices, we argue that planning an inference pattern with a request-specific model tailored to the device's computational capacity, accuracy requirements, and time constraints is more cost-efficient and robust to diverse scenarios. To this end, we propose an accuracy-aware and workload-balanced inference system that integrates joint model quantization and inference partitioning. In this approach, the server dynamically responds to inference queries by sending a quantized model and adaptively sharing the inference workload with the device. Meanwhile, the device's computational power, channel capacity, and accuracy requirements are considered when deciding.   Furthermore, we introduce a new optimization framework for the inference system, incorporating joint model quantization and partitioning. Our approach optimizes layer-wise quantization bit width and partition points to minimize time consumption and cost while accounting for varying accuracy requirements of tasks through an accuracy degradation metric in our optimization model. To our knowledge, this work represents the first exploration of optimizing quantization layer-wise bit-width in the inference serving system, by introducing theoretical measurement of accuracy degradation. Simulation results demonstrate a substantial reduction in overall time and power consumption, with computation payloads decreasing by over 80% and accuracy degradation kept below 1%.

### Leveraging the Potential of Prompt Engineering for Hate Speech Detection   in Low-Resource Languages
**Authors**: Ruhina Tabasshum Prome, Tarikul Islam Tamiti, Anomadarshi Barua

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:59:25Z

**Summary**: The rapid expansion of social media leads to a marked increase in hate speech, which threatens personal lives and results in numerous hate crimes. Detecting hate speech presents several challenges: diverse dialects, frequent code-mixing, and the prevalence of misspelled words in user-generated content on social media platforms. Recent progress in hate speech detection is typically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource languages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this limitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on low-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies - zero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot prompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to detect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the metaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that marks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. We investigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and compare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe, Word2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU). To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in the low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource language - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German. The performance of all prompting techniques is evaluated using the F1 score, and environmental impact factor (IF), which measures CO$_2$ emissions, electricity usage, and computational time.

### IMPACT: Inflectional Morphology Probes Across Complex Typologies
**Authors**: Mohammed J. Saeed, Tommi Vehvilainen, Evgeny Fedoseev, Sevil Caliskan, Tatiana Vodolazova

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:58:23Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress on various multilingual benchmarks and are increasingly used to generate and evaluate text in non-English languages. However, while they may produce fluent outputs, it remains unclear to what extent these models truly grasp the underlying linguistic complexity of those languages, particularly in morphology. To investigate this, we introduce IMPACT, a synthetically generated evaluation framework focused on inflectional morphology, which we publicly release, designed to evaluate LLM performance across five morphologically rich languages: Arabic, Russian, Finnish, Turkish, and Hebrew. IMPACT includes unit-test-style cases covering both shared and language-specific phenomena, from basic verb inflections (e.g., tense, number, gender) to unique features like Arabic's reverse gender agreement and vowel harmony in Finnish and Turkish. We assess eight multilingual LLMs that, despite strong English performance, struggle with other languages and uncommon morphological patterns, especially when judging ungrammatical examples. We also show that Chain of Thought and Thinking Models can degrade performance. Our work exposes gaps in LLMs' handling of linguistic complexity, pointing to clear room for improvement. To support further research, we publicly release the IMPACT framework.

### Industrial brain: a human-like autonomous neuro-symbolic cognitive   decision-making system
**Authors**: Junping Wang, Bicheng Wang, Yibo Xuea, Yuan Xie

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:54:52Z

**Summary**: Resilience non-equilibrium measurement, the ability to maintain fundamental functionality amidst failures and errors, is crucial for scientific management and engineering applications of industrial chain. The problem is particularly challenging when the number or types of multiple co-evolution of resilience (for example, randomly placed) are extremely chaos. Existing end-to-end deep learning ordinarily do not generalize well to unseen full-feld reconstruction of spatiotemporal co-evolution structure, and predict resilience of network topology, especially in multiple chaos data regimes typically seen in real-world applications. To address this challenge, here we propose industrial brain, a human-like autonomous cognitive decision-making and planning framework integrating higher-order activity-driven neuro network and CT-OODA symbolic reasoning to autonomous plan resilience directly from observational data of global variable. The industrial brain not only understands and model structure of node activity dynamics and network co-evolution topology without simplifying assumptions, and reveal the underlying laws hidden behind complex networks, but also enabling accurate resilience prediction, inference, and planning. Experimental results show that industrial brain significantly outperforms resilience prediction and planning methods, with an accurate improvement of up to 10.8\% over GoT and OlaGPT framework and 11.03\% over spectral dimension reduction. It also generalizes to unseen topologies and dynamics and maintains robust performance despite observational disturbances. Our findings suggest that industrial brain addresses an important gap in resilience prediction and planning for industrial chain.

### Performance of LLMs on Stochastic Modeling Operations Research Problems:   From Theory to Practice
**Authors**: Akshit Kumar, Tianyi Peng, Yuhang Wu, Assaf Zeevi

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:54:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited expert-level capabilities across various domains. However, their abilities to solve problems in Operations Research (OR) -- the analysis and optimization of mathematical models derived from real-world problems or their verbal descriptions -- remain underexplored. In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating LLMs' abilities to solve stochastic modeling problems, a core class of OR problems characterized by uncertainty and typically involving tools from probability, statistics, and stochastic processes. We manually procure a representative set of graduate-level homework and doctoral qualification-exam problems and test LLMs' abilities to solve them. We further leverage SimOpt, an open-source library of simulation-optimization problems and solvers, to investigate LLMs' abilities to make real-world decisions under uncertainty. Our results show that, though a nontrivial amount of work is still needed to reliably automate the stochastic modeling pipeline in reality, state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate proficiency on par with human experts in both classroom and practical settings. These findings highlight the potential of building AI agents that assist OR researchers and amplify the real-world impact of OR through automation.

### The Trilemma of Truth in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Germans Savcisens, Tina Eliassi-Rad

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:49:28Z

**Summary**: We often attribute human characteristics to large language models (LLMs) and claim that they "know" certain things. LLMs have an internal probabilistic knowledge that represents information retained during training. How can we assess the veracity of this knowledge? We examine two common methods for probing the veracity of LLMs and discover several assumptions that are flawed. To address these flawed assumptions, we introduce sAwMIL (short for Sparse Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a probing method that utilizes the internal activations of LLMs to separate statements into true, false, and neither. sAwMIL is based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. We evaluate sAwMIL on 5 validity criteria across 16 open-source LLMs, including both default and chat-based variants, as well as on 3 new datasets. Among the insights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the third quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always symmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default models; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for some LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge distillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from true and false and is neither true nor false. These findings provide a reliable method for verifying what LLMs "know" and how certain they are of their probabilistic internal knowledge.

### Intrinsic Dimensionality of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou High-Dimensional   Trajectories Through Manifold Learning: A Linear Approach
**Authors**: Gionni Marchetti

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:49:26Z

**Summary**: A data-driven approach based on unsupervised machine learning is proposed to infer the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ of the high-dimensional trajectories of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.

### Learning robust parameter inference and density reconstruction in flyer   plate impact experiments
**Authors**: Evan Bell, Daniel A. Serino, Ben S. Southworth, Trevor Wilcox, Marc L. Klasky

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:43:33Z

**Summary**: Estimating physical parameters or material properties from experimental observations is a common objective in many areas of physics and material science. In many experiments, especially in shock physics, radiography is the primary means of observing the system of interest. However, radiography does not provide direct access to key state variables, such as density, which prevents the application of traditional parameter estimation approaches. Here we focus on flyer plate impact experiments on porous materials, and resolving the underlying parameterized equation of state (EoS) and crush porosity model parameters given radiographic observation(s). We use machine learning as a tool to demonstrate with high confidence that using only high impact velocity data does not provide sufficient information to accurately infer both EoS and crush model parameters, even with fully resolved density fields or a dynamic sequence of images. We thus propose an observable data set consisting of low and high impact velocity experiments/simulations that capture different regimes of compaction and shock propagation, and proceed to introduce a generative machine learning approach which produces a posterior distribution of physical parameters directly from radiographs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in estimating parameters from simulated flyer plate impact experiments, and show that the obtained estimates of EoS and crush model parameters can then be used in hydrodynamic simulations to obtain accurate and physically admissible density reconstructions. Finally, we examine the robustness of the approach to model mismatches, and find that the learned approach can provide useful parameter estimates in the presence of out-of-distribution radiographic noise and previously unseen physics, thereby promoting a potential breakthrough in estimating material properties from experimental radiographic images.

### Empirical evidence of Large Language Model's influence on human spoken   communication
**Authors**: Hiromu Yakura, Ezequiel Lopez-Lopez, Levin Brinkmann, Ignacio Serna, Prateek Gupta, Ivan Soraperra, Iyad Rahwan

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:43:32Z

**Summary**: From the invention of writing and the printing press, to television and social media, human history is punctuated by major innovations in communication technology, which fundamentally altered how ideas spread and reshaped our culture. Recent chatbots powered by generative artificial intelligence constitute a novel medium that encodes cultural patterns in their neural representations and disseminates them in conversations with hundreds of millions of people. Understanding whether these patterns transmit into human language, and ultimately shape human culture, is a fundamental question. While fully quantifying the causal impact of a chatbot like ChatGPT on human culture is very challenging, lexicographic shift in human spoken communication may offer an early indicator of such broad phenomenon. Here, we apply econometric causal inference techniques to 740,249 hours of human discourse from 360,445 YouTube academic talks and 771,591 conversational podcast episodes across multiple disciplines. We detect a measurable and abrupt increase in the use of words preferentially generated by ChatGPT, such as delve, comprehend, boast, swift, and meticulous, after its release. These findings suggest a scenario where machines, originally trained on human data and subsequently exhibiting their own cultural traits, can, in turn, measurably reshape human culture. This marks the beginning of a closed cultural feedback loop in which cultural traits circulate bidirectionally between humans and machines. Our results motivate further research into the evolution of human-machine culture, and raise concerns over the erosion of linguistic and cultural diversity, and the risks of scalable manipulation.

### Adaptive Domain Modeling with Language Models: A Multi-Agent Approach to   Task Planning
**Authors**: Harisankar Babu, Philipp Schillinger, Tamim Asfour

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:40:24Z

**Summary**: We introduce TAPAS (Task-based Adaptation and Planning using AgentS), a multi-agent framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic planning to solve complex tasks without the need for manually defined environment models. TAPAS employs specialized LLM-based agents that collaboratively generate and adapt domain models, initial states, and goal specifications as needed using structured tool-calling mechanisms. Through this tool-based interaction, downstream agents can request modifications from upstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints without manual domain redefinition. A ReAct (Reason+Act)-style execution agent, coupled with natural language plan translation, bridges the gap between dynamically generated plans and real-world robot capabilities. TAPAS demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and in the VirtualHome simulated real-world environment.

### Interdependent Bilateral Trade: Information vs Approximation
**Authors**: Shahar Dobzinski, Alon Eden, Kira Goldner, Ariel Shaulker, Thodoris Tsilivis

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:29:47Z

**Summary**: Welfare maximization in bilateral trade has been extensively studied in recent years. Previous literature obtained incentive-compatible approximation mechanisms only for the private values case. In this paper, we study welfare maximization in bilateral trade with interdependent values. Designing mechanisms for interdependent settings is much more challenging because the values of the players depend on the private information of the others, requiring complex belief updates and strategic inference. We propose to classify information structures by quantifying the influence that a player's private signal has on their own valuation. We then paint a picture of where approximations are possible and impossible based on these information structures. Finally, we also study the possible approximation ratios for a natural family of information structures.

### Dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse   problems with rank-deficient prior covariances
**Authors**: Josie König, Elizabeth Qian, Melina A. Freitag

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:20:58Z

**Summary**: Bayesian inverse problems use observed data to update a prior probability distribution for an unknown state or parameter of a scientific system to a posterior distribution conditioned on the data. In many applications, the unknown parameter is high-dimensional, making computation of the posterior expensive due to the need to sample in a high-dimensional space and the need to evaluate an expensive high-dimensional forward model relating the unknown parameter to the data. However, inverse problems often exhibit low-dimensional structure due to the fact that the available data are only informative in a low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space. Dimension reduction approaches exploit this structure by restricting inference to the low-dimensional subspace informed by the data, which can be sampled more efficiently. Further computational cost reductions can be achieved by replacing expensive high-dimensional forward models with cheaper lower-dimensional reduced models. In this work, we propose new dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse problems with rank-deficient prior covariances, which arise in many practical inference settings. The dimension reduction approach is applicable to general linear Bayesian inverse problems whereas the model reduction approaches are specific to the problem of inferring the initial condition of a linear dynamical system. We provide theoretical approximation guarantees as well as numerical experiments demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approaches.

### Advancing Multi-Step Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models   through Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting
**Authors**: André de Souza Loureiro, Jorge Valverde-Rebaza, Julieta Noguez, David Escarcega, Ricardo Marcacini

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:18:35Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved their problem-solving capabilities. However, these models still struggle when faced with complex multi-step reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting (MAPS) framework, a novel approach designed to enhance multi-step mathematical reasoning in LLMs by integrating techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and Auto-Prompting. Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an iterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using CoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism identifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections. These dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its reasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs show that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive results with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables general-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized reasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also increase token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically limits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning performance.

### Green AI in Action: Strategic Model Selection for Ensembles in   Production
**Authors**: Nienke Nijkamp, June Sallou, Niels van der Heijden, Luís Cruz

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:17:09Z

**Summary**: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into software systems has significantly enhanced their capabilities while escalating energy demands. Ensemble learning, combining predictions from multiple models to form a single prediction, intensifies this problem due to cumulative energy consumption. This paper presents a novel approach to model selection that addresses the challenge of balancing the accuracy of AI models with their energy consumption in a live AI ensemble system. We explore how reducing the number of models or improving the efficiency of model usage within an ensemble during inference can reduce energy demands without substantially sacrificing accuracy. This study introduces and evaluates two model selection strategies, Static and Dynamic, for optimizing ensemble learning systems performance while minimizing energy usage. Our results demonstrate that the Static strategy improves the F1 score beyond the baseline, reducing average energy usage from 100% from the full ensemble to 62%. The Dynamic strategy further enhances F1 scores, using on average 76% compared to 100% of the full ensemble. Moreover, we propose an approach that balances accuracy with resource consumption, significantly reducing energy usage without substantially impacting accuracy. This method decreased the average energy usage of the Static strategy from approximately 62% to 14%, and for the Dynamic strategy, from around 76% to 57%. Our field study of Green AI using an operational AI system developed by a large professional services provider shows the practical applicability of adopting energy-conscious model selection strategies in live production environments.

### Spectropolarimetric synthesis of forbidden lines in MHD models of   coronal bright points
**Authors**: Ernest Alsina Ballester, Daniel Nóbrega-Siverio, Fernando Moreno-Insertis, Supriya Hebbur Dayananda

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:13:34Z

**Summary**: The inference of the magnetic field vector from spectropolarimetric observations is crucial for understanding the physical processes governing the solar corona. We investigate which information on the magnetic fields of coronal bright points (CBP) can be gained from the intensity and polarization of the Fe XIII 10747 A, Fe XIV 5303 A, Si X 14301 A, and Si IX 39343 A forbidden lines. We apply the P-CORONA synthesis code to a CBP model in the very low corona, obtained with the Bifrost code, and to a larger global model to study the impact of the outer coronal material along the line of sight (LoS). The enhanced density within the CBP produces an intensity brightening, but suppresses the linear polarization. The circular polarization from such regions often approaches 0.1% of the intensity. The contribution from the coronal material along the LoS depends strongly on its temperature, and is weaker for lines with a peak response at higher temperatures (Fe10747 at 1.7 MK; Fe5303 at 2 MK). The weak field approximation (WFA) provides information on the longitudinal magnetic fields in the strongest-emitting spatial intervals along the LoS, and is more reliable in the regions of the CBP where the field does not change sign. This tends to coincide with the regions where there is a strong correlation between the circular polarization and the wavelength derivative of the intensity. Considering roughly 30 minutes of time evolution, the CBP signals are somewhat attenuated but are still identifiable, while the area where the WFA can be suitably applied remains substantial. The circular polarization of the Fe5303 and especially Fe10747 lines are valuable diagnostics for the magnetic fields in the higher-temperature regions of the CBP, which could be exploited with future coronagraphs with similar capabilities to Cryo-NIRSP/DKIST, but designed to observe below 1.05 solar radii.

### WeatherEdit: Controllable Weather Editing with 4D Gaussian Field
**Authors**: Chenghao Qian, Wenjing Li, Yuhu Guo, Gustav Markkula

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:05:39Z

**Summary**: In this work, we present WeatherEdit, a novel weather editing pipeline for generating realistic weather effects with controllable types and severity in 3D scenes. Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background editing and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we introduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a single pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather effects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View (TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal and spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and multi-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a 3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field to generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and dynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based modelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and flexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with the 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects. Experiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can generate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity, highlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse weather.

### Statistical Inference for Privatized Data with Unknown Sample Size
**Authors**: Jordan Awan, Andres Felipe Barrientos, Nianqiao Ju

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:04:25Z

**Summary**: We develop both theory and algorithms to analyze privatized data in the unbounded differential privacy(DP), where even the sample size is considered a sensitive quantity that requires privacy protection. We show that the distance between the sampling distributions under unbounded DP and bounded DP goes to zero as the sample size $n$ goes to infinity, provided that the noise used to privatize $n$ is at an appropriate rate; we also establish that Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)-type posterior distributions converge under similar assumptions. We further give asymptotic results in the regime where the privacy budget for $n$ goes to zero, establishing similarity of sampling distributions as well as showing that the MLE in the unbounded setting converges to the bounded-DP MLE. In order to facilitate valid, finite-sample Bayesian inference on privatized data in the unbounded DP setting, we propose a reversible jump MCMC algorithm which extends the data augmentation MCMC of Ju et al. (2022). We also propose a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to compute the MLE from privatized data in both bounded and unbounded DP. We apply our methodology to analyze a linear regression model as well as a 2019 American Time Use Survey Microdata File which we model using a Dirichlet distribution.

### Garbage In, Reasoning Out? Why Benchmark Scores are Unreliable and What   to Do About It
**Authors**: Seyed Mahed Mousavi, Edoardo Cecchinato, Lucia Hornikova, Giuseppe Riccardi

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:57:28Z

**Summary**: We conduct a systematic audit of three widely used reasoning benchmarks, SocialIQa, FauxPas-EAI, and ToMi, and uncover pervasive flaws in both benchmark items and evaluation methodology. Using five LLMs (GPT-{3, 3.5, 4, o1}, and LLaMA 3.1) as diagnostic tools, we identify structural, semantic, and pragmatic issues in benchmark design (e.g., duplicated items, ambiguous wording, and implausible answers), as well as scoring procedures that prioritize output form over reasoning process. Through systematic human annotation and re-evaluation on cleaned benchmark subsets, we find that model scores often improve not due to due to erratic surface wording variations and not to improved reasoning. Infact, further analyses show that model performance is highly sensitive to minor input variations such as context availability and phrasing, revealing that high scores may reflect alignment with format-specific cues rather than consistent inference based on the input. These findings challenge the validity of current benchmark-based claims about reasoning in LLMs, and highlight the need for evaluation protocols that assess reasoning as a process of drawing inference from available information, rather than as static output selection. We release audited data and evaluation tools to support more interpretable and diagnostic assessments of model reasoning.

### Large Language Models for Statistical Inference: Context Augmentation   with Applications to the Two-Sample Problem and Regression
**Authors**: Marc Ratkovic

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:57:11Z

**Summary**: We introduce context augmentation, a data-augmentation approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate contexts around observed strings as a means of facilitating valid frequentist inference. These generated contexts serve to reintroduce uncertainty, incorporate auxiliary information, and facilitate interpretability. For example, in the two-sample test, we compare the log-probability of strings under contexts from its own versus the other group. We show on synthetic data that the method's t-statistics exhibit the expected null behaviour while maintaining power and, through a replication, that the method is powerful and interpretable. We next introduce text-on-text regression. Contexts generated around the predictor string are treated as mediating variables between the predictor and outcome strings. Using negative controls, we then distinguish between semantic and syntactic dimensions of prediction. Analysis of real-world dialogic data illustrates behaviour predicted from a psycholinguistic framework. Theoretically, we provide identification conditions, derive an influence-function decomposition, and show that repeated cross-fitting of a pivotal statistic yields higher-order efficiency. We derive bounds linking estimation error, context count, and number of cross-fits. Taken together, context augmentation offers the ability to connect LLMs with longstanding statistical practice.

### VMoBA: Mixture-of-Block Attention for Video Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Jianzong Wu, Liang Hou, Haotian Yang, Xin Tao, Ye Tian, Pengfei Wan, Di Zhang, Yunhai Tong

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:52:31Z

**Summary**: The quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms poses a significant bottleneck for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) aiming to generate long-duration, high-resolution videos. While various sparse attention methods have been proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality, varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and 1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for high-res video generation.

### Email as the Interface to Generative AI Models: Seamless Administrative   Automation
**Authors**: Andres Navarro, Carlos de Quinto, José Alberto Hernández

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:39:54Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a novel architectural framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with email interfaces to automate administrative tasks, specifically targeting accessibility barriers in enterprise environments. The system connects email communication channels with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and intelligent automation, enabling non-technical administrative staff to delegate complex form-filling and document processing tasks using familiar email interfaces. By treating the email body as a natural language prompt and attachments as contextual information, the workflow bridges the gap between advanced AI capabilities and practical usability. Empirical evaluation shows that the system can complete complex administrative forms in under 8 seconds of automated processing, with human supervision reducing total staff time by a factor of three to four compared to manual workflows. The top-performing LLM accurately filled 16 out of 29 form fields and reduced the total cost per processed form by 64% relative to manual completion. These findings demonstrate that email-based LLM integration is a viable and cost-effective approach for democratizing advanced automation in organizational settings, supporting widespread adoption without requiring specialized technical knowledge or major workflow changes. This aligns with broader trends in leveraging LLMs to enhance accessibility and automate complex tasks for non-technical users, making technology more inclusive and efficient.

### GeometryZero: Improving Geometry Solving for LLM with Group Contrastive   Policy Optimization
**Authors**: Yikun Wang, Yibin Wang, Dianyi Wang, Zimian Peng, Qipeng Guo, Dacheng Tao, Jiaqi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:36:32Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, particularly in mathematical reasoning, amid which geometry problem solving remains a challenging area where auxiliary construction plays a enssential role. Existing approaches either achieve suboptimal performance or rely on massive LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), incurring massive computational costs. We posit that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training smaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust geometric reasoning. However, directly applying GRPO to geometric reasoning presents fundamental limitations due to its dependence on unconditional rewards, which leads to indiscriminate and counterproductive auxiliary constructions. To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key innovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive or negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual utility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains. Building on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size geometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary construction. Our extensive empirical evaluation across popular geometric benchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVista) demonstrates that GeometryZero models consistently outperform baselines (e.g. GRPO), achieving an average improvement of 4.29% across all benchmarks.

### A hierarchical Bayesian approach to point source analysis in high-energy   neutrino telescopes
**Authors**: F. Capel, J. Kuhlmann, C. Haack, M. Ha Minh, H. Niederhausen, L. Schumacher

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:35:05Z

**Summary**: We propose a novel approach to the detection of point-like sources of high-energy neutrinos. Motivated by evidence for emerging sources in existing data, we focus on the characterization and interpretation of these sources rather than the rejection of the background-only hypothesis. The hierarchical Bayesian model is implemented in the Stan platform, enabling computation of the posterior distribution with a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. We simulate a population of weak neutrino sources detected by the IceCube experiment and use the resulting data set to demonstrate and validate our framework. We show that even for the challenging case of sources at the threshold of detection and using limited prior information, it is possible to correctly infer the source properties. Additionally, we demonstrate how modeling flexible connections between similar sources can be used to recover the contribution of sources that would not be detectable individually. While a direct comparison of our method to existing approaches is challenged by the fundamental differences in frequentist and Bayesian frameworks, we draw parallels where possible. In particular, we highlight how including more complexity into the source modeling can increase the sensitivity to sources and their populations.

### A Survey on Autonomy-Induced Security Risks in Large Model-Based Agents
**Authors**: Hang Su, Jun Luo, Chang Liu, Xiao Yang, Yichi Zhang, Yinpeng Dong, Jun Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:34:34Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the rise of autonomous AI agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in dynamic, open-ended environments. These large-model agents mark a paradigm shift from static inference systems to interactive, memory-augmented entities. While these capabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also introduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool misuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the threat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we first examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin increasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention, modular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze the corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying failure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and deceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment. These risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across perception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges, we systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different autonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control, constrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective reflection. We introduce the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), a unified cognitive framework grounded in Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs), which incorporates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation, and joint reward-risk optimization to enable principled, proactive safety across the agent's decision-making loop.

### Robustness of Decentralised Learning to Nodes and Data Disruption
**Authors**: Luigi Palmieri, Chiara Boldrini, Lorenzo Valerio, Andrea Passarella, Marco Conti, János Kertész

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:27:03Z

**Summary**: In the vibrant landscape of AI research, decentralised learning is gaining momentum. Decentralised learning allows individual nodes to keep data locally where they are generated and to share knowledge extracted from local data among themselves through an interactive process of collaborative refinement. This paradigm supports scenarios where data cannot leave local nodes due to privacy or sovereignty reasons or real-time constraints imposing proximity of models to locations where inference has to be carried out. The distributed nature of decentralised learning implies significant new research challenges with respect to centralised learning. Among them, in this paper, we focus on robustness issues. Specifically, we study the effect of nodes' disruption on the collective learning process. Assuming a given percentage of "central" nodes disappear from the network, we focus on different cases, characterised by (i) different distributions of data across nodes and (ii) different times when disruption occurs with respect to the start of the collaborative learning task. Through these configurations, we are able to show the non-trivial interplay between the properties of the network connecting nodes, the persistence of knowledge acquired collectively before disruption or lack thereof, and the effect of data availability pre- and post-disruption. Our results show that decentralised learning processes are remarkably robust to network disruption. As long as even minimum amounts of data remain available somewhere in the network, the learning process is able to recover from disruptions and achieve significant classification accuracy. This clearly varies depending on the remaining connectivity after disruption, but we show that even nodes that remain completely isolated can retain significant knowledge acquired before the disruption.

### Group Accretion in Milky Way-like Stellar Haloes
**Authors**: Thomas M. Callingham, Amina Helmi

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:26:57Z

**Summary**: As galaxies form hierarchically, larger satellites may accrete alongside smaller companions in group infall events. This coordinated accretion is likely to have left signatures in the Milky Way's stellar halo at the present day. Our goal is to characterise the possible groups of companions that accompanied larger known accretion events of our Galaxy, and infer where their stellar material could be in physical and dynamical space at present day. We use the AURIGA simulation suite of Milky Way-like haloes to identify analogues to these large accretion events and their group infall companions, and we follow their evolution in time. We find that most of the material from larger accretion events is deposited on much more bound orbits than their companions. This implies a weak dynamical association between companions and debris, but it is strongest with the material lost first. As a result, the companions of the Milky Way's earliest building blocks are likely to contribute stars to the solar neighbourhood, whilst the companions of our last major merger are likely found in both the solar neighbourhood and the outer halo. More recently infallen groups of satellites, or those of a smaller mass, are more likely to retain dynamical coherence, for example, through clustering in the orientation of angular momentum. We conclude that group infall has likely shaped the Milky Way's stellar halo. Disentangling this will be challenging for the earliest accretion events, although overlap with their less-bound debris may be particularly telling.

### Robust Inference with High-Dimensional Instruments
**Authors**: Qu Feng, Sombut Jaidee, Wenjie Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:25:31Z

**Summary**: We propose a weak-identification-robust test for linear instrumental variable (IV) regressions with high-dimensional instruments, whose number is allowed to exceed the sample size. In addition, our test is robust to general error dependence, such as network dependence and spatial dependence. The test statistic takes a self-normalized form and the asymptotic validity of the test is established by using random matrix theory. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the numerical performance of the test, confirming good size control and satisfactory testing power across a range of various error dependence structures.

### Mathematical Reasoning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: A RAG-Based   Approach for Complex Arithmetic Reasoning
**Authors**: Mehdi Azarafza, Mojtaba Nayyeri, Faezeh Pasandideh, Steffen Staab, Achim Rettberg

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:18:47Z

**Summary**: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a 20-question problem set of UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5\% with RAG), and decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, questions, and answers are publicly available.

### Flash-VStream: Efficient Real-Time Understanding for Long Video Streams
**Authors**: Haoji Zhang, Yiqin Wang, Yansong Tang, Yong Liu, Jiashi Feng, Xiaojie Jin

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:17:49Z

**Summary**: Benefiting from the advances in large language models and cross-modal alignment, existing multimodal large language models have achieved prominent performance in image and short video understanding. However, the understanding of long videos is still challenging, as their long-context nature results in significant computational and memory overhead. Most existing work treats long videos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world applications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these issues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of processing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time. Particularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity context memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the distribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to retrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to existing models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference latency. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks and comprehensive video benchmarks, i.e., EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench and Video-MME, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and outstanding efficiency of our method. Code is available at https://github.com/IVGSZ/Flash-VStream.

### Public Service Algorithm: towards a transparent, explainable, and   scalable content curation for news content based on editorial values
**Authors**: Ahmad Mel, Sebastien Noir

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:16:54Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of disinformation challenges traditional, unscalable editorial processes and existing automated systems that prioritize engagement over public service values. To address this, we introduce the Public Service Algorithm (PSA), a novel framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) for scalable, transparent content curation based on Public Service Media (PSM) inspired values. Utilizing a large multilingual news dataset from the 'A European Perspective' project, our experiment directly compared article ratings from a panel of experienced editors from various European PSMs, with those from several LLMs, focusing on four criteria: diversity, in-depth analysis, forward-looking, and cross-border relevance. Utilizing criterion-specific prompts, our results indicate a promising alignment between human editorial judgment and LLM assessments, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to automate value-driven curation at scale without sacrificing transparency. This research constitutes a first step towards a scalable framework for the automatic curation of trustworthy news content.

### An Improved Inference for IV Regressions
**Authors**: Liyu Dou, Pengjin Min, Wenjie Wang, Yichong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:05:10Z

**Summary**: Researchers often report empirical results that are based on low-dimensional IVs, such as the shift-share IV, together with many IVs. Could we combine these results in an efficient way and take advantage of the information from both sides? In this paper, we propose a combination inference procedure to solve the problem. Specifically, we consider a linear combination of three test statistics: a standard cluster-robust Wald statistic based on the low-dimensional IVs, a leave-one-cluster-out Lagrangian Multiplier (LM) statistic, and a leave-one-cluster-out Anderson-Rubin (AR) statistic. We first establish the joint asymptotic normality of the Wald, LM, and AR statistics and derive the corresponding limit experiment under local alternatives. Then, under the assumption that at least the low-dimensional IVs can strongly identify the parameter of interest, we derive the optimal combination test based on the three statistics and establish that our procedure leads to the uniformly most powerful (UMP) unbiased test among the class of tests considered. In particular, the efficiency gain from the combined test is of ``free lunch" in the sense that it is always at least as powerful as the test that is only based on the low-dimensional IVs or many IVs.

### The Impact of AI on Educational Assessment: A Framework for Constructive   Alignment
**Authors**: Patrick Stokkink

**Updated**: 2025-07-01T07:51:20Z

**Summary**: The influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Large Language Models (LLM), on education is continuously increasing. These models are frequently used by students, giving rise to the question whether current forms of assessment are still a valid way to evaluate student performance and comprehension. The theoretical framework developed in this paper is grounded in Constructive Alignment (CA) theory and Bloom's taxonomy for defining learning objectives. We argue that AI influences learning objectives of different Bloom levels in a different way, and assessment has to be adopted accordingly. Furthermore, in line with Bloom's vision, formative and summative assessment should be aligned on whether the use of AI is permitted or not.   Although lecturers tend to agree that education and assessment need to be adapted to the presence of AI, a strong bias exists on the extent to which lecturers want to allow for AI in assessment. This bias is caused by a lecturer's familiarity with AI and specifically whether they use it themselves. To avoid this bias, we propose structured guidelines on a university or faculty level, to foster alignment among the staff. Besides that, we argue that teaching staff should be trained on the capabilities and limitations of AI tools. In this way, they are better able to adapt their assessment methods.

### Learning World Models With Hierarchical Temporal Abstractions: A   Probabilistic Perspective
**Authors**: Vaisakh Shaj

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:01:16Z

**Summary**: Machines that can replicate human intelligence with type 2 reasoning capabilities should be able to reason at multiple levels of spatio-temporal abstractions and scales using internal world models. Devising formalisms to develop such internal world models, which accurately reflect the causal hierarchies inherent in the dynamics of the real world, is a critical research challenge in the domains of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This thesis identifies several limitations with the prevalent use of state space models (SSMs) as internal world models and propose two new probabilistic formalisms namely Hidden-Parameter SSMs and Multi-Time Scale SSMs to address these drawbacks. The structure of graphical models in both formalisms facilitates scalable exact probabilistic inference using belief propagation, as well as end-to-end learning via backpropagation through time. This approach permits the development of scalable, adaptive hierarchical world models capable of representing nonstationary dynamics across multiple temporal abstractions and scales. Moreover, these probabilistic formalisms integrate the concept of uncertainty in world states, thus improving the system's capacity to emulate the stochastic nature of the real world and quantify the confidence in its predictions. The thesis also discuss how these formalisms are in line with related neuroscience literature on Bayesian brain hypothesis and predicitive processing. Our experiments on various real and simulated robots demonstrate that our formalisms can match and in many cases exceed the performance of contemporary transformer variants in making long-range future predictions. We conclude the thesis by reflecting on the limitations of our current models and suggesting directions for future research.

### Explainable Sentiment Analysis with DeepSeek-R1: Performance,   Efficiency, and Few-Shot Learning
**Authors**: Donghao Huang, Zhaoxia Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T12:58:45Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed sentiment analysis, yet balancing accuracy, efficiency, and explainability remains a critical challenge. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of DeepSeek-R1--an open-source reasoning model--against OpenAI's GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. We test the full 671B model and its distilled variants, systematically documenting few-shot learning curves. Our experiments show DeepSeek-R1 achieves a 91.39\% F1 score on 5-class sentiment and 99.31\% accuracy on binary tasks with just 5 shots, an eightfold improvement in few-shot efficiency over GPT-4o. Architecture-specific distillation effects emerge, where a 32B Qwen2.5-based model outperforms the 70B Llama-based variant by 6.69 percentage points. While its reasoning process reduces throughput, DeepSeek-R1 offers superior explainability via transparent, step-by-step traces, establishing it as a powerful, interpretable open-source alternative.

### HyperMono: A Monotonicity-aware Approach to Hyper-Relational Knowledge   Representation
**Authors**: Zhiwei Hu, Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto, Zhiliang Xiang, Ru Li, Jeff Z. Pan

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T12:50:35Z

**Summary**: In a hyper-relational knowledge graph (HKG), each fact is composed of a main triple associated with attribute-value qualifiers, which express additional factual knowledge. The hyper-relational knowledge graph completion (HKGC) task aims at inferring plausible missing links in a HKG. Most existing approaches to HKGC focus on enhancing the communication between qualifier pairs and main triples, while overlooking two important properties that emerge from the monotonicity of the hyper-relational graphs representation regime. Stage Reasoning allows for a two-step reasoning process, facilitating the integration of coarse-grained inference results derived solely from main triples and fine-grained inference results obtained from hyper-relational facts with qualifiers. In the initial stage, coarse-grained results provide an upper bound for correct predictions, which are subsequently refined in the fine-grained step. More generally, Qualifier Monotonicity implies that by attaching more qualifier pairs to a main triple, we may only narrow down the answer set, but never enlarge it. This paper proposes the HyperMono model for hyper-relational knowledge graph completion, which realizes stage reasoning and qualifier monotonicity. To implement qualifier monotonicity HyperMono resorts to cone embeddings. Experiments on three real-world datasets with three different scenario conditions demonstrate the strong performance of HyperMono when compared to the SoTA.

### Controllable Reference-Based Real-World Remote Sensing Image   Super-Resolution with Generative Diffusion Priors
**Authors**: Ce Wang, Wanjie Sun

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T12:45:28Z

**Summary**: Super-resolution (SR) techniques can enhance the spatial resolution of remote sensing images by utilizing low-resolution (LR) images to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images, enabling more efficient large-scale earth observation applications. While single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods have shown progress, reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) offers superior performance by incorporating historical HR images alongside current LR observations. However, existing RefSR methods struggle with real-world complexities, such as cross-sensor resolution gap and significant land cover changes, often leading to under-generation or over-reliance on reference image. To address these challenges, we propose CRefDiff, a novel controllable reference-based diffusion model for real-world remote sensing image SR. To address the under-generation problem, CRefDiff is built upon the pretrained Stable Diffusion model, leveraging its powerful generative prior to produce accurate structures and textures. To mitigate over-reliance on the reference, we introduce a dual-branch fusion mechanism that adaptively integrates both local and global information from the reference image. Moreover, this novel dual-branch design enables reference strength control during inference, enhancing interactivity and flexibility of the model. Finally, a strategy named Better Start is proposed to significantly reduce the number of denoising steps, thereby accelerating the inference process. To support further research, we introduce Real-RefRSSRD, a new real-world RefSR dataset for remote sensing images, consisting of HR NAIP and LR Sentinel-2 image pairs with diverse land cover changes and significant temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on Real-RefRSSRD show that CRefDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and improves downstream tasks such as scene classification and semantic segmentation.

### Towards the Training of Deeper Predictive Coding Neural Networks
**Authors**: Chang Qi, Matteo Forasassi, Thomas Lukasiewicz, Tommaso Salvatori

**Updated**: 2025-07-01T10:16:28Z

**Summary**: Predictive coding networks trained with equilibrium propagation are neural models that perform inference through an iterative energy minimization process. Previous studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in shallow architectures, but show significant performance degradation when depth exceeds five to seven layers. In this work, we show that the reason behind this degradation is due to exponentially imbalanced errors between layers during weight updates, and predictions from the previous layer not being effective in guiding updates in deeper layers. We address the first issue by introducing two novel methods to optimize the latent variables that use precision-weighting to re-balance the distribution of energy among layers during the `relaxation phase', and the second issue by proposing a novel weight update mechanism that reduces error accumulation in deeper layers. Empirically, we test our methods on a large number of image classification tasks, resulting in large improvements in test accuracy across networks with more than seven layers, with performances comparable to those of backprop on similar models. These findings suggest that a better understanding of the relaxation phase is important to train models using equilibrium propagation at scale, and open new possibilities for their application in complex tasks.

### Addressing the Inconsistency in Bayesian Deep Learning via Generalized   Laplace Approximation
**Authors**: Yinsong Chen, Samson S. Yu, Zhong Li, Chee Peng Lim

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T12:20:59Z

**Summary**: In recent years, inconsistency in Bayesian deep learning has attracted significant attention. Tempered or generalized posterior distributions are frequently employed as direct and effective solutions. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms and the effectiveness of generalized posteriors remain active research topics. In this work, we interpret posterior tempering as a correction for model misspecification via adjustments to the joint probability, and as a recalibration of priors by reducing aleatoric uncertainty. We also identify a unique property of the Laplace approximation: the generalized normalizing constant remains invariant, in contrast to general Bayesian learning, where this constant typically depends on model parameters after generalization. Leveraging this property, we introduce the generalized Laplace approximation, which requires only a simple modification to the Hessian calculation of the regularized loss. This approach provides a flexible and scalable framework for high-quality posterior inference. We evaluate the proposed method on state-of-the-art neural networks and real-world datasets, demonstrating that the generalized Laplace approximation enhances predictive performance.

### Leveraging a Multi-Agent LLM-Based System to Educate Teachers in Hate   Incidents Management
**Authors**: Ewelina Gajewska, Michal Wawer, Katarzyna Budzynska, Jarosław A. Chudziak

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T12:18:13Z

**Summary**: Computer-aided teacher training is a state-of-the-art method designed to enhance teachers' professional skills effectively while minimising concerns related to costs, time constraints, and geographical limitations. We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) in teacher education, using a case of teaching hate incidents management in schools. To this end, we create a multi-agent LLM-based system that mimics realistic situations of hate, using a combination of retrieval-augmented prompting and persona modelling. It is designed to identify and analyse hate speech patterns, predict potential escalation, and propose effective intervention strategies. By integrating persona modelling with agentic LLMs, we create contextually diverse simulations of hate incidents, mimicking real-life situations. The system allows teachers to analyse and understand the dynamics of hate incidents in a safe and controlled environment, providing valuable insights and practical knowledge to manage such situations confidently in real life. Our pilot evaluation demonstrates teachers' enhanced understanding of the nature of annotator disagreements and the role of context in hate speech interpretation, leading to the development of more informed and effective strategies for addressing hate in classroom settings.

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T12:15:07Z

**Summary**: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has stimulated researchers to seek effective and efficient approaches to deal with LLM hallucinations and low-quality outputs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a key element of machine learning applications in dealing with such challenges. However, research to date on UQ for LLMs has been fragmented in terms of techniques and evaluation methodologies. In this work, we address this issue by introducing a novel benchmark that implements a collection of state-of-the-art UQ baselines and offers an environment for controllable and consistent evaluation of novel UQ techniques over various text generation tasks. Our benchmark also supports the assessment of confidence normalization methods in terms of their ability to provide interpretable scores. Using our benchmark, we conduct a large-scale empirical investigation of UQ and normalization techniques across eleven tasks, identifying the most effective approaches.

### Software Engineering for Large Language Models: Research Status,   Challenges and the Road Ahead
**Authors**: Hongzhou Rao, Yanjie Zhao, Xinyi Hou, Shenao Wang, Haoyu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T12:09:29Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has redefined artificial intelligence (AI), pushing the boundaries of AI research and enabling unbounded possibilities for both academia and the industry. However, LLM development faces increasingly complex challenges throughout its lifecycle, yet no existing research systematically explores these challenges and solutions from the perspective of software engineering (SE) approaches. To fill the gap, we systematically analyze research status throughout the LLM development lifecycle, divided into six phases: requirements engineering, dataset construction, model development and enhancement, testing and evaluation, deployment and operations, and maintenance and evolution. We then conclude by identifying the key challenges for each phase and presenting potential research directions to address these challenges. In general, we provide valuable insights from an SE perspective to facilitate future advances in LLM development.

### A Survey of LLM-based Automated Program Repair: Taxonomies, Design   Paradigms, and Applications
**Authors**: Boyang Yang, Zijian Cai, Fengling Liu, Bach Le, Lingming Zhang, Tegawendé F. Bissyandé, Yang Liu, Haoye Tian

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T11:46:01Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping automated program repair (APR). We categorize the recent 63 LLM-based APR systems published from January 2022 to June 2025 into four paradigms, and show how retrieval- or analysis-augmented contexts strengthen any of them. This taxonomy clarifies key trade-offs: fine-tuning delivers strong task alignment at high training cost; prompting enables rapid deployment but is limited by prompt design and context windows; procedural pipelines offer reproducible control with moderate overhead; agentic frameworks tackle multi-hunk or cross-file bugs at the price of increased latency and complexity. Persistent challenges include verifying semantic correctness beyond test suites, repairing repository-scale defects, and lowering the costs of LLMs. We outline research directions that combine lightweight human feedback, repository-aware retrieval, code analysis, and cost-aware planning to advance reliable and efficient LLM-based APR.

### Consistency Trajectory Matching for One-Step Generative Super-Resolution
**Authors**: Weiyi You, Mingyang Zhang, Leheng Zhang, Xingyu Zhou, Kexuan Shi, Shuhang Gu

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T11:43:16Z

**Summary**: Current diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) approaches achieve commendable performance at the cost of high inference overhead. Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.

### EuPdSn2; magnetic structures in view of resonant x-ray Bragg diffraction
**Authors**: Stephen W. Lovesey

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T11:36:15Z

**Summary**: The magnetic properties of materials hosting Eu2+(J = 7/2, 4f7) ions have attracted much attention in the science of strongly correlated electrons. In part because crystal electric field effects are impoverished for an s-state ion, as with Gd3+ intermetallics, and Eu2+ substitution in biological and optically active materials is resourceful. The magnetic structure of EuPdSn2 is not wholly resolved. Ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic structures coexist in powder neutron diffraction patterns, and compete in the ground state. Moreover, the specific heat as a function of temperature is enigmatic and indicative of J = 5/2. We present symmetry-informed analytic magnetic structure factors for single crystal resonant x-ray Bragg diffraction using Eu atomic resonances that reveal significant potential for the technique. Europium ions use acentric Wyckoff positions in magnetic space groups inferred from neutron diffraction. In consequence, axial and polar Eu multipoles are compulsory components of both magnetic neutron and resonant x-ray Bragg diffraction patterns. The proposed antiferromagnetic phase of EuPdSn2 supports anapoles (magnetic polar dipoles) already observed in magnetic neutron diffraction patterns presented by Gd doped SmAl2, and several resonant x-ray diffraction patterns.

### Refine-POI: Reinforcement Fine-Tuned Large Language Models for Next   Point-of-Interest Recommendation
**Authors**: Peibo Li, Shuang Ao, Hao Xue, Yang Song, Maarten de Rijke, Johan Barthélemy, Tomasz Bednarz, Flora D. Salim

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T11:36:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation tasks. Typical LLM-based recommenders fall into two categories: prompt-based and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based models. Prompt-based models generally offer greater output flexibility but deliver lower accuracy, whereas SFT-based models achieve higher performance yet face a fundamental mismatch: next POI recommendation data does not naturally suit supervised fine-tuning. In SFT, the model is trained to reproduce the exact ground truth, but each training example provides only a single target POI, so there is no ground truth for producing a top-k list.   To address this, we propose Refine-POI, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework for next POI recommendation. We introduce recommendation-driven rewards that enable LLMs to learn to generate top-k recommendation lists using only one ground-truth POI per example. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Refine-POI achieves state-of-the-art top-k recommendation performance.

### On sample-based functional observability of linear systems
**Authors**: Isabelle Krauss, Victor G. Lopez, Matthias A. Müller

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T11:35:24Z

**Summary**: Sample-based observability characterizes the ability to reconstruct the internal state of a dynamical system by using limited output information, i.e., when measurements are only infrequently and/or irregularly available. In this work, we investigate the concept of functional observability, which refers to the ability to infer a function of the system state from the outputs, within a samplebased framework. Here, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a system to be sample-based functionally observable, and formulate conditions on the sampling schemes such that these are satisfied. Furthermore, we provide a numerical example, where we demonstrate the applicability of the obtained results.

### AutoEvoEval: An Automated Framework for Evolving Close-Ended LLM   Evaluation Data
**Authors**: JiaRu Wu, Mingwei Liu

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T11:18:56Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on various tasks, but existing evaluation benchmarks are often static and insufficient to fully assess their robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios. Prior work using evolutionary or adversarial data augmentation has improved evaluation diversity but lacks systematic control over perturbation types and multi-step complexity, limiting comprehensive robustness analysis. To address these gaps, we propose AutoEvoEval, an evolution-based evaluation framework for close-ended tasks such as multi-choice question answering. AutoEvoEval introduces 22 interpretable atomic evolution operations and supports multi-round compositions, enabling controlled generation of diverse, challenging, and realistic test samples. We conduct extensive experiments addressing four research questions on a broad set of open- and closed-source LLMs. Our results show that atomic operations cause an average accuracy drop of 7.283\%, with structure-disrupting or misleading semantic edits causing the largest declines. Model sensitivities vary significantly for the same perturbation, and combining multiple evolution steps amplifies adversarial effects by up to 52.932\%. These findings suggest current benchmarks may overestimate true model generalization and emphasize the need for evolution-aware robustness evaluation. Code and resources are available at: https://github.com/SYSUSELab/AutoEvoEval.

### CSC-SQL: Corrective Self-Consistency in Text-to-SQL via Reinforcement   Learning
**Authors**: Lei Sheng, Shuai-Shuai Xu

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T11:12:31Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in translating natural language questions about relational databases into SQL queries. In particular, test-time scaling techniques such as Self-Consistency and Self-Correction can enhance SQL generation accuracy by increasing computational effort during inference. However, these methods have notable limitations: Self-Consistency may select suboptimal outputs despite majority votes, while Self-Correction typically addresses only syntactic errors. To leverage the strengths of both approaches, we propose CSC-SQL, a novel method that integrates Self-Consistency and Self-Correction. CSC-SQL selects the two most frequently occurring outputs from parallel sampling and feeds them into a merge revision model for correction. Additionally, we employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to fine-tune both the SQL generation and revision models via reinforcement learning, significantly enhancing output quality. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of CSC-SQL. On the BIRD private test set, our 7B model achieves 71.72\% execution accuracy, while the 32B model achieves 73.67\%. The code has been open sourced at https://github.com/CycloneBoy/csc_sql.

### Radioactive Watermarks in Diffusion and Autoregressive Image Generative   Models
**Authors**: Michel Meintz, Jan Dubiński, Franziska Boenisch, Adam Dziedzic

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T11:08:10Z

**Summary**: Image generative models have become increasingly popular, but training them requires large datasets that are costly to collect and curate. To circumvent these costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated images as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a valuable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when these images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable detection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable in the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity. We analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion models (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing watermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are either erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the noising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile, despite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and efficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To overcome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for IARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in large language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our extensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in preserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and preventing unauthorized use of their generated images.

### StepProof: Step-by-step verification of natural language mathematical   proofs
**Authors**: Xiaolin Hu, Qinghua Zhou, Bogdan Grechuk, Ivan Y. Tyukin

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:59:44Z

**Summary**: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified. Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification. StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs, enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification, further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.

### DABstep: Data Agent Benchmark for Multi-step Reasoning
**Authors**: Alex Egg, Martin Iglesias Goyanes, Friso Kingma, Andreu Mora, Leandro von Werra, Thomas Wolf

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:49:21Z

**Summary**: We introduce DABstep, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on realistic multi-step data analysis tasks. DABstep comprises over 450 real-world challenges derived from a financial analytics platform, requiring models to combine code-based data processing with contextual reasoning over heterogeneous documentation. Each task demands an iterative, multi-step problem-solving approach, testing capabilities in data manipulation, cross-referencing multiple sources, and precise result reporting. The benchmark provides a factoid-style answer format with automatic correctness checks for objective scoring at scale. We evaluate leading LLM-based agents, revealing a substantial performance gap: even the best agent achieves only 14.55% accuracy on the hardest tasks. We detail our benchmark's design, dataset composition, task formulation, evaluation protocol, report baseline results and analyze failure modes. DABstep is released with a public leaderboard and toolkit to accelerate research in autonomous data analysis.

### Towards an Automated Multimodal Approach for Video Summarization:   Building a Bridge Between Text, Audio and Facial Cue-Based Summarization
**Authors**: Md Moinul Islam, Sofoklis Kakouros, Janne Heikkilä, Mourad Oussalah

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:41:33Z

**Summary**: The increasing volume of video content in educational, professional, and social domains necessitates effective summarization techniques that go beyond traditional unimodal approaches. This paper proposes a behaviour-aware multimodal video summarization framework that integrates textual, audio, and visual cues to generate timestamp-aligned summaries. By extracting prosodic features, textual cues and visual indicators, the framework identifies semantically and emotionally important moments. A key contribution is the identification of bonus words, which are terms emphasized across multiple modalities and used to improve the semantic relevance and expressive clarity of the summaries. The approach is evaluated against pseudo-ground truth (pGT) summaries generated using LLM-based extractive method. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional extractive method, such as the Edmundson method, in both text and video-based evaluation metrics. Text-based metrics show ROUGE-1 increasing from 0.4769 to 0.7929 and BERTScore from 0.9152 to 0.9536, while in video-based evaluation, our proposed framework improves F1-Score by almost 23%. The findings underscore the potential of multimodal integration in producing comprehensive and behaviourally informed video summaries.

### Predicting any small-scale statistics of high-Reynolds-number turbulence   using ensemble simulations
**Authors**: Lukas Bentkamp, Michael Wilczek

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:38:12Z

**Summary**: The complex small-scale statistics of turbulence are a result of the combined cascading dynamics through all scales of the flow. Predicting these statistics using fully resolved simulations at the high Reynolds numbers that typically occur in engineering, geophysical, and astrophysical flows will exceed the capabilities of even the largest supercomputers for the foreseeable future. A common observation is that high-Reynolds-number flows are organized in clusters of intense turbulent activity separated by large regions of quiescent flow. We here show that small-scale statistics in high-Reynolds-number turbulence can be predicted based on an ensemble hypothesis, stating that they can be emulated by the statistical mixture of a heterogeneous ensemble of lower-Reynolds-number simulations. These simulations are forced at smaller scales with energy injection rates varying across the ensemble. We show that our method predicts complex gradient statistics from the recent literature, including the joint QR-PDF and extreme dissipation and enstrophy statistics, to unprecedented accuracy. Remarkably, we find that the weight distribution needed for the ensemble method to make predictions can be inferred from the anomalous scaling exponents of turbulence. Thus combining theory with fully resolved simulations, our method can be readily applied to predict a wide range of statistics at high Reynolds number but low cost, while opening up various avenues for further theoretical and numerical exploration.

### SmileyLlama: Modifying Large Language Models for Directed Chemical Space   Exploration
**Authors**: Joseph M. Cavanagh, Kunyang Sun, Andrew Gritsevskiy, Dorian Bagni, Yingze Wang, Thomas D. Bannister, Teresa Head-Gordon

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:36:58Z

**Summary**: Here we show that a general-purpose large language model (LLM) chatbot, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, can be transformed via supervised fine-tuning of engineered prompts into a chemical language model (CLM), SmileyLlama, for molecule generation. We benchmark SmileyLlama by comparing it to CLMs trained from scratch on large amounts of ChEMBL data for their ability to generate valid and novel drug-like molecules. We also use direct preference optimization to both improve SmileyLlama's adherence to a prompt and to generate molecules within the iMiner reinforcement learning framework to predict new drug molecules with optimized 3D conformations and high binding affinity to drug targets, illustrated with the SARS-Cov-2 Main Protease. This overall framework allows a LLM to speak directly as a CLM which can generate molecules with user-specified properties, rather than acting only as a chatbot with knowledge of chemistry or as a helpful virtual assistant. While our dataset and analyses are geared toward drug discovery, this general procedure can be extended to other chemical applications such as chemical synthesis.

### Single Image Test-Time Adaptation via Multi-View Co-Training
**Authors**: Smriti Joshi, Richard Osuala, Lidia Garrucho, Kaisar Kushibar, Dimitri Kessler, Oliver Diaz, Karim Lekadir

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:29:33Z

**Summary**: Test-time adaptation enables a trained model to adjust to a new domain during inference, making it particularly valuable in clinical settings where such on-the-fly adaptation is required. However, existing techniques depend on large target domain datasets, which are often impractical and unavailable in medical scenarios that demand per-patient, real-time inference. Moreover, current methods commonly focus on two-dimensional images, failing to leverage the volumetric richness of medical imaging data. Bridging this gap, we propose a Patch-Based Multi-View Co-Training method for Single Image Test-Time adaptation. Our method enforces feature and prediction consistency through uncertainty-guided self-training, enabling effective volumetric segmentation in the target domain with only a single test-time image. Validated on three publicly available breast magnetic resonance imaging datasets for tumor segmentation, our method achieves performance close to the upper bound supervised benchmark while also outperforming all existing state-of-the-art methods, on average by a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 3.75%. We publicly share our accessible codebase, readily integrable with the popular nnUNet framework, at https://github.com/smriti-joshi/muvi.git.

### DepthART: Monocular Depth Estimation as Autoregressive Refinement Task
**Authors**: Bulat Gabdullin, Nina Konovalova, Nikolay Patakin, Dmitry Senushkin, Anton Konushin

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:25:40Z

**Summary**: Monocular depth estimation has seen significant advances through discriminative approaches, yet their performance remains constrained by the limitations of training datasets. While generative approaches have addressed this challenge by leveraging priors from internet-scale datasets, with recent studies showing state-of-the-art results using fine-tuned text-to-image diffusion models, there is still room for improvement. Notably, autoregressive generative approaches, particularly Visual AutoRegressive modeling, have demonstrated superior results compared to diffusion models in conditioned image synthesis, while offering faster inference times. In this work, we apply Visual Autoregressive Transformer (VAR) to the monocular depth estimation problem. However, the conventional GPT-2-style training procedure (teacher forcing) inherited by VAR yields suboptimal results for depth estimation. To address this limitation, we introduce DepthART - a novel training method formulated as a Depth Autoregressive Refinement Task. Unlike traditional VAR training with static inputs and targets, our method implements a dynamic target formulation based on model outputs, enabling self-refinement. By utilizing the model's own predictions as inputs instead of ground truth token maps during training, we frame the objective as residual minimization, effectively reducing the discrepancy between training and inference procedures. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed training approach significantly enhances the performance of VAR in depth estimation tasks. When trained on Hypersim dataset using our approach, the model achieves superior results across multiple unseen benchmarks compared to existing generative and discriminative baselines.

### Efficient Online Inference of Vision Transformers by Training-Free   Tokenization
**Authors**: Leonidas Gee, Wing Yan Li, Viktoriia Sharmanska, Novi Quadrianto

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:22:45Z

**Summary**: The cost of deploying vision transformers increasingly represents a barrier to wider industrial adoption. Existing compression techniques require additional end-to-end fine-tuning or incur a significant drawback to runtime, making them ill-suited for online (real-time) inference, where a prediction is made on any new input as it comes in. We introduce the $\textbf{Visual Word Tokenizer}$ (VWT), a training-free method for reducing power costs while retaining performance and runtime. The VWT groups visual subwords (image patches) that are frequently used into visual words while infrequent ones remain intact. To do so, $\textit{intra}$-image or $\textit{inter}$-image statistics are leveraged to identify similar visual concepts for sequence compression. Experimentally, we demonstrate a reduction in wattage of up to 25% with only a 20% increase in runtime at most. Comparative approaches of 8-bit quantization and token merging achieve a lower or similar power efficiency but exact a higher toll on runtime (up to 100% or more). Our results indicate that VWTs are well-suited for efficient online inference with a marginal compromise on performance.

### If You Had to Pitch Your Ideal Software -- Evaluating Large Language   Models to Support User Scenario Writing for User Experience Experts and   Laypersons
**Authors**: Patrick Stadler, Christopher Lazik, Christopher Katins, Thomas Kosch

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:15:44Z

**Summary**: The process of requirements analysis requires an understanding of the end users of a system. Thus, expert stakeholders, such as User Experience (UX) designers, usually create various descriptions containing information about the users and their possible needs. In our paper, we investigate to what extent UX novices are able to write such descriptions into user scenarios. We conducted a user study with 60 participants consisting of 30 UX experts and 30 novices who were asked to write a user scenario with or without the help of an LLM-supported writing assistant. Our findings show that LLMs empower laypersons to write reasonable user scenarios and provide first-hand insights for requirements analysis that are comparable to UX experts in terms of structure and clarity, while especially excelling at audience-orientation. We present our qualitative and quantitative findings, including user scenario anatomies, potential influences, and differences in the way participants approached the task.

**Authors**: Boyuan Zheng, Zerui Fang, Zhe Xu, Rui Wang, Yiwen Chen, Cunshi Wang, Mengwei Qu, Lei Lei, Zhen Feng, Yan Liu, Yuyang Li, Mingzhou Tan, Jiaji Wu, Jianwei Shuai, Jia Li, Fangfu Ye

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:11:39Z

**Summary**: While AI for Science (AI4S) serves as an analytical tool in the current research paradigm, it doesn't solve its core inefficiency. We propose "Agent for Science" (Agent4S)-the use of LLM-driven agents to automate the entire research workflow-as the true Fifth Scientific Paradigm. This paper introduces a five-level classification for Agent4S, outlining a clear roadmap from simple task automation to fully autonomous, collaborative "AI Scientists." This framework defines the next revolutionary step in scientific discovery.

### PokéAI: A Goal-Generating, Battle-Optimizing Multi-agent System for   Pokemon Red
**Authors**: Zihao Liu, Xinhang Sui, Yueran Song, Siwen Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:09:13Z

**Summary**: We introduce Pok\'eAI, the first text-based, multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework designed to autonomously play and progress through Pok\'emon Red. Our system consists of three specialized agents-Planning, Execution, and Critique-each with its own memory bank, role, and skill set. The Planning Agent functions as the central brain, generating tasks to progress through the game. These tasks are then delegated to the Execution Agent, which carries them out within the game environment. Upon task completion, the Critique Agent evaluates the outcome to determine whether the objective was successfully achieved. Once verification is complete, control returns to the Planning Agent, forming a closed-loop decision-making system.   As a preliminary step, we developed a battle module within the Execution Agent. Our results show that the battle AI achieves an average win rate of 80.8% across 50 wild encounters, only 6% lower than the performance of an experienced human player. Furthermore, we find that a model's battle performance correlates strongly with its LLM Arena score on language-related tasks, indicating a meaningful link between linguistic ability and strategic reasoning. Finally, our analysis of gameplay logs reveals that each LLM exhibits a unique playstyle, suggesting that individual models develop distinct strategic behaviors.

### Can Large Language Models Help Students Prove Software Correctness? An   Experimental Study with Dafny
**Authors**: Carolina Carreira, Álvaro Silva, Alexandre Abreu, Alexandra Mendes

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:08:05Z

**Summary**: Students in computing education increasingly use large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. Yet, the role of LLMs in supporting cognitively demanding tasks, like deductive program verification, remains poorly understood. This paper investigates how students interact with an LLM when solving formal verification exercises in Dafny, a language that supports functional correctness, by allowing programmers to write formal specifications and automatically verifying that the implementation satisfies the specification. We conducted a mixed-methods study with master's students enrolled in a formal methods course. Each participant completed two verification problems, one with access to a custom ChatGPT interface that logged all interactions, and the other without. We identified strategies used by successful students and assessed the level of trust students place in LLMs. Our findings show that students perform significantly better when using ChatGPT; however, performance gains are tied to prompt quality. We conclude with practical recommendations for integrating LLMs into formal methods courses more effectively, including designing LLM-aware challenges that promote learning rather than substitution.

### Grid: Omni Visual Generation
**Authors**: Cong Wan, Xiangyang Luo, Hao Luo, Zijian Cai, Yiren Song, Yunlong Zhao, Yifan Bai, Fan Wang, Yuhang He, Yihong Gong

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:03:43Z

**Summary**: Visual generation has witnessed remarkable progress in single-image tasks, yet extending these capabilities to temporal sequences remains challenging. Current approaches either build specialized video models from scratch with enormous computational costs or add separate motion modules to image generators, both requiring learning temporal dynamics anew. We observe that modern image generation models possess underutilized potential in handling structured layouts with implicit temporal understanding. Building on this insight, we introduce GRID, which reformulates temporal sequences as grid layouts, enabling holistic processing of visual sequences while leveraging existing model capabilities. Through a parallel flow-matching training strategy with coarse-to-fine scheduling, our approach achieves up to 67 faster inference speeds while using <1/1000 of the computational resources compared to specialized models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRID not only excels in temporal tasks from Text-to-Video to 3D Editing but also preserves strong performance in image generation, establishing itself as an efficient and versatile omni-solution for visual generation.

## Keyword: LLM Deployment 
 ### Teaching Time Series to See and Speak: Forecasting with Aligned Visual   and Textual Perspectives
**Authors**: Sixun Dong, Wei Fan, Teresa Wu, Yanjie Fu

**Updated**: 2025-07-01T03:40:22Z

**Summary**: Time series forecasting traditionally relies on unimodal numerical inputs, which often struggle to capture high-level semantic patterns due to their dense and unstructured nature. While recent approaches have explored representing time series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain limited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual intuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms raw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than using natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities directly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared semantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer and more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate selection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the most informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments on fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing time series forecasting.

### Data Uniformity Improves Training Efficiency and More, with a   Convergence Framework Beyond the NTK Regime
**Authors**: Yuqing Wang, Shangding Gu

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T17:58:30Z

**Summary**: Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including in large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties such as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known to enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist other quantitative and general principles of data selection that can consistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited prior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly distributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance. Specifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads to a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by $h_{\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\min}$ can slow down the training dynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the approximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\min}$ increases. Our analysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including transformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further provides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and function compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct comprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings, including different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by maximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves comparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets.

### SPIRAL: Self-Play on Zero-Sum Games Incentivizes Reasoning via   Multi-Agent Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Bo Liu, Leon Guertler, Simon Yu, Zichen Liu, Penghui Qi, Daniel Balcells, Mickel Liu, Cheston Tan, Weiyan Shi, Min Lin, Wee Sun Lee, Natasha Jaques

**Updated**: 2025-07-01T02:29:52Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision. Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online, multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training. Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6% improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000 expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation, and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous reasoning development.

### Scaling Human Judgment in Community Notes with LLMs
**Authors**: Haiwen Li, Soham De, Manon Revel, Andreas Haupt, Brad Miller, Keith Coleman, Jay Baxter, Martin Saveski, Michiel A. Bakker

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T17:57:32Z

**Summary**: This paper argues for a new paradigm for Community Notes in the LLM era: an open ecosystem where both humans and LLMs can write notes, and the decision of which notes are helpful enough to show remains in the hands of humans. This approach can accelerate the delivery of notes, while maintaining trust and legitimacy through Community Notes' foundational principle: A community of diverse human raters collectively serve as the ultimate evaluator and arbiter of what is helpful. Further, the feedback from this diverse community can be used to improve LLMs' ability to produce accurate, unbiased, broadly helpful notes--what we term Reinforcement Learning from Community Feedback (RLCF). This becomes a two-way street: LLMs serve as an asset to humans--helping deliver context quickly and with minimal effort--while human feedback, in turn, enhances the performance of LLMs. This paper describes how such a system can work, its benefits, key new risks and challenges it introduces, and a research agenda to solve those challenges and realize the potential of this approach.

### Knowing You Don't Know: Learning When to Continue Search in Multi-round   RAG through Self-Practicing
**Authors**: Diji Yang, Linda Zeng, Jinmeng Rao, Yi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T17:46:40Z

**Summary**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown strong capability in enhancing language models' knowledge and reducing AI generative hallucinations, driving its widespread use. However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, SIM-RAG, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.

### SEUF: Is Unlearning One Expert Enough for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs?
**Authors**: Haomin Zhuang, Yihua Zhang, Kehan Guo, Jinghan Jia, Gaowen Liu, Sijia Liu, Xiangliang Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T17:45:54Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in LLMs unlearning have shown remarkable success in removing unwanted data-model influences while preserving the model's utility for legitimate knowledge. Despite these strides, sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs--a key subset of the LLM family--have remained unexplored in the context of unlearning. As MoE LLMs are celebrated for their exceptional performance, we ask:How can unlearning be performed effectively and efficiently on MoE LLMs? Our pilot study shows that the dynamic routing nature of MoE LLMs introduces unique challenges, leading to excessive forgetting, uncontrolled knowledge erasure and substantial utility drops when existing unlearning methods are applied. To address this, we propose a novel Selected-Expert Unlearning Framework (SEUF). Through expert attribution, unlearning is concentrated on the most actively engaged experts for the specified knowledge. Concurrently, an anchor loss is applied to the router to stabilize the active state of this targeted expert, ensuring focused and controlled unlearning. SEUF is compatible with various standard unlearning algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEUF enhances both forget quality up to 5% and model utility by 35% on MoE LLMs across various benchmarks and LLM architectures (compared to standard unlearning algorithms), while only unlearning 0.06% of the model parameters.

### INSIGHT: Bridging the Student-Teacher Gap in Times of Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Jarne Thys, Sebe Vanbrabant, Davy Vanacken, Gustavo Rovelo Ruiz

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T17:30:39Z

**Summary**: The rise of AI, especially Large Language Models, presents challenges and opportunities to integrate such technology into the classroom. AI has the potential to revolutionize education by helping teaching staff with various tasks, such as personalizing their teaching methods, but it also raises concerns, for example, about the degradation of student-teacher interactions and user privacy. Based on interviews with teaching staff, this paper introduces INSIGHT, a proof of concept to combine various AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of solving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated into various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM by extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students' questions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more personalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by using the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based on student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and inclusive learning experience.

**Authors**: Ian R. McKenzie, Oskar J. Hollinsworth, Tom Tseng, Xander Davies, Stephen Casper, Aaron D. Tucker, Robert Kirk, Adam Gleave

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T17:21:08Z

**Summary**: Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus model using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including Google DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second, we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33% ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:54:48Z

**Summary**: The increasing demand for mental health services has led to the rise of AI-driven mental health chatbots, though challenges related to privacy, data collection, and expertise persist. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is gaining attention as a theoretical basis for boosting expertise in the development of these chatbots. However, existing datasets are showing limitations for training chatbots, leading to a substantial demand for publicly available resources in the field of MI and psychotherapy. These challenges are even more pronounced in non-English languages, where they receive less attention. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that simulates MI sessions enriched with the expertise of professional therapists. We train an MI forecaster model that mimics the behavioral choices of professional therapists and employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate utterances through prompt engineering. Then, we present KMI, the first synthetic dataset theoretically grounded in MI, containing 1,000 high-quality Korean Motivational Interviewing dialogues. Through an extensive expert evaluation of the generated dataset and the dialogue model trained on it, we demonstrate the quality, expertise, and practicality of KMI. We also introduce novel metrics derived from MI theory in order to evaluate dialogues from the perspective of MI.

### Agent.xpu: Efficient Scheduling of Agentic LLM Workloads on   Heterogeneous SoC
**Authors**: Xinming Wei, Jiahao Zhang, Haoran Li, Jiayu Chen, Rui Qu, Maoliang Li, Xiang Chen, Guojie Luo

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:50:48Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on personal devices introduces a new class of workloads characterized by a dichotomy of objectives. Reactive tasks, initiated by users, demand immediate, low-latency responses, while proactive tasks operate invisibly and prioritize throughput. Existing on-device LLM engines, designed for isolated inferences, fail to efficiently manage these concurrent and conflicting requests on consumer-grade heterogeneous SoCs with CPU, integrated GPU, and NPU. This paper introduces Agent.xpu, an efficient serving system for agentic LLM workloads on memory-unified heterogeneous SoCs. With dedicated offline profiling, Agent.xpu first constructs a heterogeneous execution graph, which fuses and chunks model kernels for affinity-guided, elastic accelerator mapping with predictive kernel annotation. At runtime, its online scheduler enables fine-grained, kernel-level preemption to guarantee the responsiveness of reactive tasks. To maximize SoC utilization, it adopts slack-aware kernel backfill to opportunistically append proactive tasks, and mitigates NPU-iGPU contention via bandwidth-aware dispatch. Evaluation on an Intel Core Ultra SoC shows that Agent.xpu achieves 4.6$\times$ lower latency for reactive tasks and sustains 1.6$\times$-6.8$\times$ higher throughput for proactive tasks compared to state-of-the-art inference engines.

### Riddle Me This! Stealthy Membership Inference for Retrieval-Augmented   Generation
**Authors**: Ali Naseh, Yuefeng Peng, Anshuman Suri, Harsh Chaudhari, Alina Oprea, Amir Houmansadr

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:37:59Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate grounded responses by leveraging external knowledge databases without altering model parameters. Although the absence of weight tuning prevents leakage via model parameters, it introduces the risk of inference adversaries exploiting retrieved documents in the model's context. Existing methods for membership inference and data extraction often rely on jailbreaking or carefully crafted unnatural queries, which can be easily detected or thwarted with query rewriting techniques common in RAG systems. In this work, we present Interrogation Attack (IA), a membership inference technique targeting documents in the RAG datastore. By crafting natural-text queries that are answerable only with the target document's presence, our approach demonstrates successful inference with just 30 queries while remaining stealthy; straightforward detectors identify adversarial prompts from existing methods up to ~76x more frequently than those generated by our attack. We observe a 2x improvement in TPR@1%FPR over prior inference attacks across diverse RAG configurations, all while costing less than $0.02 per document inference.

**Authors**: Zekun Wu, Seonglae Cho, Umar Mohammed, Cristian Munoz, Kleyton Costa, Xin Guan, Theo King, Ze Wang, Emre Kazim, Adriano Koshiyama

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:31:53Z

**Summary**: Open-source AI libraries are foundational to modern AI systems, yet they present significant, underexamined risks spanning security, licensing, maintenance, supply chain integrity, and regulatory compliance. We introduce LibVulnWatch, a system that leverages recent advances in large language models and agentic workflows to perform deep, evidence-based evaluations of these libraries. Built on a graph-based orchestration of specialized agents, the framework extracts, verifies, and quantifies risk using information from repositories, documentation, and vulnerability databases. LibVulnWatch produces reproducible, governance-aligned scores across five critical domains, publishing results to a public leaderboard for ongoing ecosystem monitoring. Applied to 20 widely used libraries, including ML frameworks, LLM inference engines, and agent orchestration tools, our approach covers up to 88% of OpenSSF Scorecard checks while surfacing up to 19 additional risks per library, such as critical RCE vulnerabilities, missing SBOMs, and regulatory gaps. By integrating advanced language technologies with the practical demands of software risk assessment, this work demonstrates a scalable, transparent mechanism for continuous supply chain evaluation and informed library selection.

### MFA-KWS: Effective Keyword Spotting with Multi-head Frame-asynchronous   Decoding
**Authors**: Yu Xi, Haoyu Li, Xiaoyu Gu, Yidi Jiang, Kai Yu

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:21:25Z

**Summary**: Keyword spotting (KWS) is essential for voice-driven applications, demanding both accuracy and efficiency. Traditional ASR-based KWS methods, such as greedy and beam search, explore the entire search space without explicitly prioritizing keyword detection, often leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose an effective keyword-specific KWS framework by introducing a streaming-oriented CTC-Transducer-combined frame-asynchronous system with multi-head frame-asynchronous decoding (MFA-KWS). Specifically, MFA-KWS employs keyword-specific phone-synchronous decoding for CTC and replaces conventional RNN-T with Token-and-Duration Transducer to enhance both performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we explore various score fusion strategies, including single-frame-based and consistency-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of MFA-KWS, which achieves state-of-the-art results on both fixed keyword and arbitrary keywords datasets, such as Snips, MobvoiHotwords, and LibriKWS-20, while exhibiting strong robustness in noisy environments. Among fusion strategies, the consistency-based CDC-Last method delivers the best performance. Additionally, MFA-KWS achieves a 47% to 63% speed-up over the frame-synchronous baselines across various datasets. Extensive experimental results confirm that MFA-KWS is an effective and efficient KWS framework, making it well-suited for on-device deployment.

### Bug Fixing with Broader Context: Enhancing LLM-Based Program Repair via   Layered Knowledge Injection
**Authors**: Ramtin Ehsani, Esteban Parra, Sonia Haiduc, Preetha Chatterjee

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:19:38Z

**Summary**: Prompting LLMs with bug-related context (e.g., error messages, stack traces) improves automated program repair, but many bugs still remain unresolved. In real-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and project-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this paper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge can improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection framework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts with the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy function and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which adds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally injects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from documentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a dataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini), and analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting knowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314) using Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug types show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while only a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that different bug types require different levels of contextual information for effective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that more complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI bugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our results show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest the need for interactive and adaptive APR systems.

### Large Language Models Don't Make Sense of Word Problems. A Scoping   Review from a Mathematics Education Perspective
**Authors**: Anselm R. Strohmaier, Wim Van Dooren, Kathrin Seßler, Brian Greer, Lieven Verschaffel

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:10:42Z

**Summary**: The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question of how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support mathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle textual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word problems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the real-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We conducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including three parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in research, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical word problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the conceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs and students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled mathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics education. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most popular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require a consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our evaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems shows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy, including a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed weaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or non-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have mastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems, which potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics classrooms.

### Auto-TA: Towards Scalable Automated Thematic Analysis (TA) via   Multi-Agent Large Language Models with Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Seungjun Yi, Joakim Nguyen, Huimin Xu, Terence Lim, Andrew Well, Mia Markey, Ying Ding

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T16:02:28Z

**Summary**: Congenital heart disease (CHD) presents complex, lifelong challenges often underrepresented in traditional clinical metrics. While unstructured narratives offer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic analysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully automated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on clinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full transcript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where specialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with human analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable, patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts.

### TTRL: Test-Time Reinforcement Learning

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T15:59:26Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates Reinforcement Learning (RL) on data without explicit labels for reasoning tasks in Large Language Models (LLMs). The core challenge of the problem is reward estimation during inference while not having access to ground-truth information. While this setting appears elusive, we find that common practices in Test-Time Scaling (TTS), such as majority voting, yield surprisingly effective rewards suitable for driving RL training. In this work, we introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), a novel method for training LLMs using RL on unlabeled data. TTRL enables self-evolution of LLMs by utilizing the priors in the pre-trained models. Our experiments demonstrate that TTRL consistently improves performance across a variety of tasks and models. Notably, TTRL boosts the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-Math-7B by approximately 211% on the AIME 2024 with only unlabeled test data. Furthermore, although TTRL is only supervised by the maj@n metric, TTRL has demonstrated performance to consistently surpass the upper limit of the initial model maj@n, and approach the performance of models trained directly on test data with ground-truth labels. Our experimental findings validate the general effectiveness of TTRL across various tasks and highlight TTRL's potential for broader tasks and domains. GitHub: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/TTRL

### STCLocker: Deadlock Avoidance Testing for Autonomous Driving Systems
**Authors**: Mingfei Cheng, Renzhi Wang, Xiaofei Xie, Yuan Zhou, Lei Ma

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T15:58:10Z

**Summary**: Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is essential to ensure the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) before deployment. However, existing techniques primarily focus on evaluating ADS functionalities in single-AV settings. As ADSs are increasingly deployed in multi-AV traffic, it becomes crucial to assess their cooperative performance, particularly regarding deadlocks, a fundamental coordination failure in which multiple AVs enter a circular waiting state indefinitely, resulting in motion planning failures. Despite its importance, the cooperative capability of ADSs to prevent deadlocks remains insufficiently underexplored. To address this gap, we propose the first dedicated Spatio-Temporal Conflict-Guided Deadlock Avoidance Testing technique, STCLocker, for generating DeadLock Scenarios (DLSs), where a group of AVs controlled by the ADS under test are in a circular wait state. STCLocker consists of three key components: Deadlock Oracle, Conflict Feedback, and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation. Deadlock Oracle provides a reliable black-box mechanism for detecting deadlock cycles among multiple AVs within a given scenario. Conflict Feedback and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation collaborate to actively guide AVs into simultaneous competition over spatial conflict resources (i.e., shared passing regions) and temporal competitive behaviors (i.e., reaching the conflict region at the same time), thereby increasing the effectiveness of generating conflict-prone deadlocks. We evaluate STCLocker on two types of ADSs: Roach, an end-to-end ADS, and OpenCDA, a module-based ADS supporting cooperative communication. Experimental results show that, on average, STCLocker generates more DLS than the best-performing baseline.

### TaP: A Taxonomy-Guided Framework for Automated and Scalable Preference   Data Generation
**Authors**: Renren Jin, Tianhao Shen, Xinwei Wu, Dan Shi, Haoran Sun, Wuwei Huang, Quandong Wang, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Deyi Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T15:45:28Z

**Summary**: Conducting supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning on large language models (LLMs) requires high-quality datasets to improve their ability to follow instructions and align with human preferences and values. However, constructing such datasets is resource-intensive, and most available datasets for supervised and preference fine-tuning are in English. To address these challenges, we propose the \underline{\textbf{Ta}}xonomy-Guided \underline{\textbf{P}}reference Data Generation (TaP) framework, which facilitates automated and scalable construction of preference datasets across various languages. TaP is grounded in a structured taxonomy that allows fine-grained control over dataset composition, thereby ensuring both diversity and comprehensive coverage. We employ TaP-generated datasets to perform supervised and preference fine-tuning on various LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets outperform those trained on existing open-source datasets. Remarkably, LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets surpass the performance of those trained on an open-source dataset that is 180 times larger.

### LLM Agents Are the Antidote to Walled Gardens
**Authors**: Samuele Marro, Philip Torr

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T15:45:17Z

**Summary**: While the Internet's core infrastructure was designed to be open and universal, today's application layer is dominated by closed, proprietary platforms. Open and interoperable APIs require significant investment, and market leaders have little incentive to enable data exchange that could erode their user lock-in. We argue that LLM-based agents fundamentally disrupt this status quo. Agents can automatically translate between data formats and interact with interfaces designed for humans: this makes interoperability dramatically cheaper and effectively unavoidable. We name this shift universal interoperability: the ability for any two digital services to exchange data seamlessly using AI-mediated adapters. Universal interoperability undermines monopolistic behaviours and promotes data portability. However, it can also lead to new security risks and technical debt. Our position is that the ML community should embrace this development while building the appropriate frameworks to mitigate the downsides. By acting now, we can harness AI to restore user freedom and competitive markets without sacrificing security.

### Green Metrics Tool: Measuring for fun and profit
**Authors**: Geerd-Dietger Hoffmann, Verena Majuntke

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T15:36:53Z

**Summary**: The environmental impact of software is gaining increasing attention as the demand for computational resources continues to rise. In order to optimize software resource consumption and reduce carbon emissions, measuring and evaluating software is a first essential step. In this paper we discuss what metrics are important for fact base decision making. We introduce the Green Metrics Tool (GMT), a novel framework for accurately measuring the resource consumption of software. The tool provides a containerized, controlled, and reproducible life cycle-based approach, assessing the resource use of software during key phases. Finally, we discuss GMT features like visualization, comparability and rule- and LLM-based optimisations highlighting its potential to guide developers and researchers in reducing the environmental impact of their software.

### Learning Constraints Directly from Network Data
**Authors**: Hongyu Hè, Minhao Jin, Maria Apostolaki

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T15:36:22Z

**Summary**: Network data conforms to a wide range of rules that arise from protocols, design principles, and deployment decisions (e.g., a packet's queuing delay must be less than its end-to-end delay). Formalizing such rules as logic constraints can (i) improve the quality of synthetic data, (ii) reduce the brittleness of machine learning (ML) models, and (iii) improve semantic understanding of network measurements. However, these benefits remain out of reach if rule extraction is manual or solely reliant on ML, as both approaches yield incomplete, unreliable, and/or inaccurate rules.   This paper formulates rule extraction as a constraint modeling problem and introduces NetNomos that learns propositional logic constraints directly from raw network measurements. Constraint modeling in this domain is uniquely challenging due to the scale of the data, the inherent learning complexity and passive environment, and the lack of ground truth supervision. NetNomos addresses these challenges via a lattice-based search structured by constraint specificity and succinctness. Our approach reduces learning complexity from superquadratic to logarithmic and enables efficient traversal in combinatorial search space.   Our evaluations on diverse network datasets show that NetNomos learns all benchmark rules, including those associated with as little as 0.01% of data points, in under three hours. In contrast, baseline methods discover less than 25% of the rules and require several days to run. Through three case studies, we show that: NetNomos (i) finds rule violations in the outputs of all seven synthetic traffic generators, hence can be used to assess and guide their generation process; (ii) detects semantic differences in traffic, hence can be used for anomaly detection; and (iii) automatically finds rules used for telemetry imputation, hence can support monitoring through inference.

### Unveiling Decision-Making in LLMs for Text Classification : Extraction   of influential and interpretable concepts with Sparse Autoencoders
**Authors**: Mathis Le Bail, Jérémie Dentan, Davide Buscaldi, Sonia Vanier

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T15:18:50Z

**Summary**: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been successfully used to probe Large Language Models (LLMs) and extract interpretable concepts from their internal representations. These concepts are linear combinations of neuron activations that correspond to human-interpretable features. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of SAE-based explainability approaches for sentence classification, a domain where such methods have not been extensively explored. We present a novel SAE-based architecture tailored for text classification, leveraging a specialized classifier head and incorporating an activation rate sparsity loss. We benchmark this architecture against established methods such as ConceptShap, Independent Component Analysis, and other SAE-based concept extraction techniques. Our evaluation covers two classification benchmarks and four fine-tuned LLMs from the Pythia family. We further enrich our analysis with two novel metrics for measuring the precision of concept-based explanations, using an external sentence encoder. Our empirical results show that our architecture improves both the causality and interpretability of the extracted features.

### Adapt Your Body: Mitigating Proprioception Shifts in Imitation Learning
**Authors**: Fuhang Kuang, Jiacheng You, Yingdong Hu, Tong Zhang, Chuan Wen, Yang Gao

**Updated**: 2025-07-01T01:36:05Z

**Summary**: Imitation learning models for robotic tasks typically rely on multi-modal inputs, such as RGB images, language, and proprioceptive states. While proprioception is intuitively important for decision-making and obstacle avoidance, simply incorporating all proprioceptive states leads to a surprising degradation in imitation learning performance. In this work, we identify the underlying issue as the proprioception shift problem, where the distributions of proprioceptive states diverge significantly between training and deployment. To address this challenge, we propose a domain adaptation framework that bridges the gap by utilizing rollout data collected during deployment. Using Wasserstein distance, we quantify the discrepancy between expert and rollout proprioceptive states and minimize this gap by adding noise to both sets of states, proportional to the Wasserstein distance. This strategy enhances robustness against proprioception shifts by aligning the training and deployment distributions. Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our method, enabling the imitation policy to leverage proprioception while mitigating its adverse effects. Our approach outperforms the naive solution which discards proprioception, and other baselines designed to address distributional shifts.

### Leveraging the Potential of Prompt Engineering for Hate Speech Detection   in Low-Resource Languages
**Authors**: Ruhina Tabasshum Prome, Tarikul Islam Tamiti, Anomadarshi Barua

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:59:25Z

**Summary**: The rapid expansion of social media leads to a marked increase in hate speech, which threatens personal lives and results in numerous hate crimes. Detecting hate speech presents several challenges: diverse dialects, frequent code-mixing, and the prevalence of misspelled words in user-generated content on social media platforms. Recent progress in hate speech detection is typically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource languages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this limitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on low-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies - zero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot prompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to detect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the metaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that marks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. We investigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and compare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe, Word2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU). To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in the low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource language - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German. The performance of all prompting techniques is evaluated using the F1 score, and environmental impact factor (IF), which measures CO$_2$ emissions, electricity usage, and computational time.

### IMPACT: Inflectional Morphology Probes Across Complex Typologies
**Authors**: Mohammed J. Saeed, Tommi Vehvilainen, Evgeny Fedoseev, Sevil Caliskan, Tatiana Vodolazova

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:58:23Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress on various multilingual benchmarks and are increasingly used to generate and evaluate text in non-English languages. However, while they may produce fluent outputs, it remains unclear to what extent these models truly grasp the underlying linguistic complexity of those languages, particularly in morphology. To investigate this, we introduce IMPACT, a synthetically generated evaluation framework focused on inflectional morphology, which we publicly release, designed to evaluate LLM performance across five morphologically rich languages: Arabic, Russian, Finnish, Turkish, and Hebrew. IMPACT includes unit-test-style cases covering both shared and language-specific phenomena, from basic verb inflections (e.g., tense, number, gender) to unique features like Arabic's reverse gender agreement and vowel harmony in Finnish and Turkish. We assess eight multilingual LLMs that, despite strong English performance, struggle with other languages and uncommon morphological patterns, especially when judging ungrammatical examples. We also show that Chain of Thought and Thinking Models can degrade performance. Our work exposes gaps in LLMs' handling of linguistic complexity, pointing to clear room for improvement. To support further research, we publicly release the IMPACT framework.

### Performance of LLMs on Stochastic Modeling Operations Research Problems:   From Theory to Practice
**Authors**: Akshit Kumar, Tianyi Peng, Yuhang Wu, Assaf Zeevi

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:54:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited expert-level capabilities across various domains. However, their abilities to solve problems in Operations Research (OR) -- the analysis and optimization of mathematical models derived from real-world problems or their verbal descriptions -- remain underexplored. In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating LLMs' abilities to solve stochastic modeling problems, a core class of OR problems characterized by uncertainty and typically involving tools from probability, statistics, and stochastic processes. We manually procure a representative set of graduate-level homework and doctoral qualification-exam problems and test LLMs' abilities to solve them. We further leverage SimOpt, an open-source library of simulation-optimization problems and solvers, to investigate LLMs' abilities to make real-world decisions under uncertainty. Our results show that, though a nontrivial amount of work is still needed to reliably automate the stochastic modeling pipeline in reality, state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate proficiency on par with human experts in both classroom and practical settings. These findings highlight the potential of building AI agents that assist OR researchers and amplify the real-world impact of OR through automation.

### The Trilemma of Truth in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Germans Savcisens, Tina Eliassi-Rad

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:49:28Z

**Summary**: We often attribute human characteristics to large language models (LLMs) and claim that they "know" certain things. LLMs have an internal probabilistic knowledge that represents information retained during training. How can we assess the veracity of this knowledge? We examine two common methods for probing the veracity of LLMs and discover several assumptions that are flawed. To address these flawed assumptions, we introduce sAwMIL (short for Sparse Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a probing method that utilizes the internal activations of LLMs to separate statements into true, false, and neither. sAwMIL is based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. We evaluate sAwMIL on 5 validity criteria across 16 open-source LLMs, including both default and chat-based variants, as well as on 3 new datasets. Among the insights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the third quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always symmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default models; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for some LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge distillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from true and false and is neither true nor false. These findings provide a reliable method for verifying what LLMs "know" and how certain they are of their probabilistic internal knowledge.

### Adaptive Domain Modeling with Language Models: A Multi-Agent Approach to   Task Planning
**Authors**: Harisankar Babu, Philipp Schillinger, Tamim Asfour

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:40:24Z

**Summary**: We introduce TAPAS (Task-based Adaptation and Planning using AgentS), a multi-agent framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic planning to solve complex tasks without the need for manually defined environment models. TAPAS employs specialized LLM-based agents that collaboratively generate and adapt domain models, initial states, and goal specifications as needed using structured tool-calling mechanisms. Through this tool-based interaction, downstream agents can request modifications from upstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints without manual domain redefinition. A ReAct (Reason+Act)-style execution agent, coupled with natural language plan translation, bridges the gap between dynamically generated plans and real-world robot capabilities. TAPAS demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and in the VirtualHome simulated real-world environment.

### Advancing Multi-Step Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models   through Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting
**Authors**: André de Souza Loureiro, Jorge Valverde-Rebaza, Julieta Noguez, David Escarcega, Ricardo Marcacini

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T14:18:35Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved their problem-solving capabilities. However, these models still struggle when faced with complex multi-step reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting (MAPS) framework, a novel approach designed to enhance multi-step mathematical reasoning in LLMs by integrating techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and Auto-Prompting. Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an iterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using CoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism identifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections. These dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its reasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs show that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive results with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables general-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized reasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also increase token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically limits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning performance.

### Garbage In, Reasoning Out? Why Benchmark Scores are Unreliable and What   to Do About It
**Authors**: Seyed Mahed Mousavi, Edoardo Cecchinato, Lucia Hornikova, Giuseppe Riccardi

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:57:28Z

**Summary**: We conduct a systematic audit of three widely used reasoning benchmarks, SocialIQa, FauxPas-EAI, and ToMi, and uncover pervasive flaws in both benchmark items and evaluation methodology. Using five LLMs (GPT-{3, 3.5, 4, o1}, and LLaMA 3.1) as diagnostic tools, we identify structural, semantic, and pragmatic issues in benchmark design (e.g., duplicated items, ambiguous wording, and implausible answers), as well as scoring procedures that prioritize output form over reasoning process. Through systematic human annotation and re-evaluation on cleaned benchmark subsets, we find that model scores often improve not due to due to erratic surface wording variations and not to improved reasoning. Infact, further analyses show that model performance is highly sensitive to minor input variations such as context availability and phrasing, revealing that high scores may reflect alignment with format-specific cues rather than consistent inference based on the input. These findings challenge the validity of current benchmark-based claims about reasoning in LLMs, and highlight the need for evaluation protocols that assess reasoning as a process of drawing inference from available information, rather than as static output selection. We release audited data and evaluation tools to support more interpretable and diagnostic assessments of model reasoning.

### Large Language Models for Statistical Inference: Context Augmentation   with Applications to the Two-Sample Problem and Regression
**Authors**: Marc Ratkovic

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:57:11Z

**Summary**: We introduce context augmentation, a data-augmentation approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate contexts around observed strings as a means of facilitating valid frequentist inference. These generated contexts serve to reintroduce uncertainty, incorporate auxiliary information, and facilitate interpretability. For example, in the two-sample test, we compare the log-probability of strings under contexts from its own versus the other group. We show on synthetic data that the method's t-statistics exhibit the expected null behaviour while maintaining power and, through a replication, that the method is powerful and interpretable. We next introduce text-on-text regression. Contexts generated around the predictor string are treated as mediating variables between the predictor and outcome strings. Using negative controls, we then distinguish between semantic and syntactic dimensions of prediction. Analysis of real-world dialogic data illustrates behaviour predicted from a psycholinguistic framework. Theoretically, we provide identification conditions, derive an influence-function decomposition, and show that repeated cross-fitting of a pivotal statistic yields higher-order efficiency. We derive bounds linking estimation error, context count, and number of cross-fits. Taken together, context augmentation offers the ability to connect LLMs with longstanding statistical practice.

### Email as the Interface to Generative AI Models: Seamless Administrative   Automation
**Authors**: Andres Navarro, Carlos de Quinto, José Alberto Hernández

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:39:54Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a novel architectural framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with email interfaces to automate administrative tasks, specifically targeting accessibility barriers in enterprise environments. The system connects email communication channels with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and intelligent automation, enabling non-technical administrative staff to delegate complex form-filling and document processing tasks using familiar email interfaces. By treating the email body as a natural language prompt and attachments as contextual information, the workflow bridges the gap between advanced AI capabilities and practical usability. Empirical evaluation shows that the system can complete complex administrative forms in under 8 seconds of automated processing, with human supervision reducing total staff time by a factor of three to four compared to manual workflows. The top-performing LLM accurately filled 16 out of 29 form fields and reduced the total cost per processed form by 64% relative to manual completion. These findings demonstrate that email-based LLM integration is a viable and cost-effective approach for democratizing advanced automation in organizational settings, supporting widespread adoption without requiring specialized technical knowledge or major workflow changes. This aligns with broader trends in leveraging LLMs to enhance accessibility and automate complex tasks for non-technical users, making technology more inclusive and efficient.

### GeometryZero: Improving Geometry Solving for LLM with Group Contrastive   Policy Optimization
**Authors**: Yikun Wang, Yibin Wang, Dianyi Wang, Zimian Peng, Qipeng Guo, Dacheng Tao, Jiaqi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:36:32Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, particularly in mathematical reasoning, amid which geometry problem solving remains a challenging area where auxiliary construction plays a enssential role. Existing approaches either achieve suboptimal performance or rely on massive LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), incurring massive computational costs. We posit that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training smaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust geometric reasoning. However, directly applying GRPO to geometric reasoning presents fundamental limitations due to its dependence on unconditional rewards, which leads to indiscriminate and counterproductive auxiliary constructions. To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key innovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive or negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual utility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains. Building on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size geometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary construction. Our extensive empirical evaluation across popular geometric benchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVista) demonstrates that GeometryZero models consistently outperform baselines (e.g. GRPO), achieving an average improvement of 4.29% across all benchmarks.

### A Survey on Autonomy-Induced Security Risks in Large Model-Based Agents
**Authors**: Hang Su, Jun Luo, Chang Liu, Xiao Yang, Yichi Zhang, Yinpeng Dong, Jun Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:34:34Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the rise of autonomous AI agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in dynamic, open-ended environments. These large-model agents mark a paradigm shift from static inference systems to interactive, memory-augmented entities. While these capabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also introduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool misuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the threat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we first examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin increasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention, modular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze the corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying failure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and deceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment. These risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across perception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges, we systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different autonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control, constrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective reflection. We introduce the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), a unified cognitive framework grounded in Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs), which incorporates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation, and joint reward-risk optimization to enable principled, proactive safety across the agent's decision-making loop.

### Mathematical Reasoning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: A RAG-Based   Approach for Complex Arithmetic Reasoning
**Authors**: Mehdi Azarafza, Mojtaba Nayyeri, Faezeh Pasandideh, Steffen Staab, Achim Rettberg

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:18:47Z

**Summary**: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a 20-question problem set of UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5\% with RAG), and decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, questions, and answers are publicly available.

### Public Service Algorithm: towards a transparent, explainable, and   scalable content curation for news content based on editorial values
**Authors**: Ahmad Mel, Sebastien Noir

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T13:16:54Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of disinformation challenges traditional, unscalable editorial processes and existing automated systems that prioritize engagement over public service values. To address this, we introduce the Public Service Algorithm (PSA), a novel framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) for scalable, transparent content curation based on Public Service Media (PSM) inspired values. Utilizing a large multilingual news dataset from the 'A European Perspective' project, our experiment directly compared article ratings from a panel of experienced editors from various European PSMs, with those from several LLMs, focusing on four criteria: diversity, in-depth analysis, forward-looking, and cross-border relevance. Utilizing criterion-specific prompts, our results indicate a promising alignment between human editorial judgment and LLM assessments, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to automate value-driven curation at scale without sacrificing transparency. This research constitutes a first step towards a scalable framework for the automatic curation of trustworthy news content.

### The Impact of AI on Educational Assessment: A Framework for Constructive   Alignment
**Authors**: Patrick Stokkink

**Updated**: 2025-07-01T07:51:20Z

**Summary**: The influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Large Language Models (LLM), on education is continuously increasing. These models are frequently used by students, giving rise to the question whether current forms of assessment are still a valid way to evaluate student performance and comprehension. The theoretical framework developed in this paper is grounded in Constructive Alignment (CA) theory and Bloom's taxonomy for defining learning objectives. We argue that AI influences learning objectives of different Bloom levels in a different way, and assessment has to be adopted accordingly. Furthermore, in line with Bloom's vision, formative and summative assessment should be aligned on whether the use of AI is permitted or not.   Although lecturers tend to agree that education and assessment need to be adapted to the presence of AI, a strong bias exists on the extent to which lecturers want to allow for AI in assessment. This bias is caused by a lecturer's familiarity with AI and specifically whether they use it themselves. To avoid this bias, we propose structured guidelines on a university or faculty level, to foster alignment among the staff. Besides that, we argue that teaching staff should be trained on the capabilities and limitations of AI tools. In this way, they are better able to adapt their assessment methods.

### Explainable Sentiment Analysis with DeepSeek-R1: Performance,   Efficiency, and Few-Shot Learning
**Authors**: Donghao Huang, Zhaoxia Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T12:58:45Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed sentiment analysis, yet balancing accuracy, efficiency, and explainability remains a critical challenge. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of DeepSeek-R1--an open-source reasoning model--against OpenAI's GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. We test the full 671B model and its distilled variants, systematically documenting few-shot learning curves. Our experiments show DeepSeek-R1 achieves a 91.39\% F1 score on 5-class sentiment and 99.31\% accuracy on binary tasks with just 5 shots, an eightfold improvement in few-shot efficiency over GPT-4o. Architecture-specific distillation effects emerge, where a 32B Qwen2.5-based model outperforms the 70B Llama-based variant by 6.69 percentage points. While its reasoning process reduces throughput, DeepSeek-R1 offers superior explainability via transparent, step-by-step traces, establishing it as a powerful, interpretable open-source alternative.

### Calibrating Graph Neural Networks with Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling
**Authors**: Xiaoyang Li, Linwei Tao, Haohui Lu, Minjing Dong, Junbin Gao, Chang Xu

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T12:23:57Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong predictive performance on relational data; however, their confidence estimates often misalign with actual predictive correctness, posing significant limitations for deployment in safety-critical settings. While existing graph-aware calibration methods seek to mitigate this limitation, they primarily depend on coarse one-hop statistics, such as neighbor-predicted confidence, or latent node embeddings, thereby neglecting the fine-grained structural heterogeneity inherent in graph topology. In this work, we propose Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling (WATS), a post-hoc calibration framework that assigns node-specific temperatures based on tunable heat-kernel graph wavelet features. Specifically, WATS harnesses the scalability and topology sensitivity of graph wavelets to refine confidence estimates, all without necessitating model retraining or access to neighboring logits or predictions. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets with varying graph structures and two GNN backbones demonstrate that WATS achieves the lowest Expected Calibration Error (ECE) among all compared methods, outperforming both classical and graph-specific baselines by up to 42.3\% in ECE and reducing calibration variance by 17.24\% on average compared with graph-specific methods. Moreover, WATS remains computationally efficient, scaling well across graphs of diverse sizes and densities. Code will be released based on publication.

### Leveraging a Multi-Agent LLM-Based System to Educate Teachers in Hate   Incidents Management
**Authors**: Ewelina Gajewska, Michal Wawer, Katarzyna Budzynska, Jarosław A. Chudziak

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T12:18:13Z

**Summary**: Computer-aided teacher training is a state-of-the-art method designed to enhance teachers' professional skills effectively while minimising concerns related to costs, time constraints, and geographical limitations. We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) in teacher education, using a case of teaching hate incidents management in schools. To this end, we create a multi-agent LLM-based system that mimics realistic situations of hate, using a combination of retrieval-augmented prompting and persona modelling. It is designed to identify and analyse hate speech patterns, predict potential escalation, and propose effective intervention strategies. By integrating persona modelling with agentic LLMs, we create contextually diverse simulations of hate incidents, mimicking real-life situations. The system allows teachers to analyse and understand the dynamics of hate incidents in a safe and controlled environment, providing valuable insights and practical knowledge to manage such situations confidently in real life. Our pilot evaluation demonstrates teachers' enhanced understanding of the nature of annotator disagreements and the role of context in hate speech interpretation, leading to the development of more informed and effective strategies for addressing hate in classroom settings.

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T12:15:07Z

**Summary**: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has stimulated researchers to seek effective and efficient approaches to deal with LLM hallucinations and low-quality outputs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a key element of machine learning applications in dealing with such challenges. However, research to date on UQ for LLMs has been fragmented in terms of techniques and evaluation methodologies. In this work, we address this issue by introducing a novel benchmark that implements a collection of state-of-the-art UQ baselines and offers an environment for controllable and consistent evaluation of novel UQ techniques over various text generation tasks. Our benchmark also supports the assessment of confidence normalization methods in terms of their ability to provide interpretable scores. Using our benchmark, we conduct a large-scale empirical investigation of UQ and normalization techniques across eleven tasks, identifying the most effective approaches.

### Explainable AI for Comprehensive Risk Assessment for Financial Reports:   A Lightweight Hierarchical Transformer Network Approach
**Authors**: Xue Wen Tan, Stanley Kok

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T12:13:35Z

**Summary**: Every publicly traded U.S. company files an annual 10-K report containing critical insights into financial health and risk. We propose Tiny eXplainable Risk Assessor (TinyXRA), a lightweight and explainable transformer-based model that automatically assesses company risk from these reports. Unlike prior work that relies solely on the standard deviation of excess returns (adjusted for the Fama-French model), which indiscriminately penalizes both upside and downside risk, TinyXRA incorporates skewness, kurtosis, and the Sortino ratio for more comprehensive risk assessment. We leverage TinyBERT as our encoder to efficiently process lengthy financial documents, coupled with a novel dynamic, attention-based word cloud mechanism that provides intuitive risk visualization while filtering irrelevant terms. This lightweight design ensures scalable deployment across diverse computing environments with real-time processing capabilities for thousands of financial documents which is essential for production systems with constrained computational resources. We employ triplet loss for risk quartile classification, improving over pairwise loss approaches in existing literature by capturing both the direction and magnitude of risk differences. Our TinyXRA achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across seven test years on a dataset spanning 2013-2024, while providing transparent and interpretable risk assessments. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate our contributions and assess model explanations both quantitatively by systematically removing highly attended words and sentences, and qualitatively by examining explanation coherence. The paper concludes with findings, practical implications, limitations, and future research directions.

### Software Engineering for Large Language Models: Research Status,   Challenges and the Road Ahead
**Authors**: Hongzhou Rao, Yanjie Zhao, Xinyi Hou, Shenao Wang, Haoyu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T12:09:29Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has redefined artificial intelligence (AI), pushing the boundaries of AI research and enabling unbounded possibilities for both academia and the industry. However, LLM development faces increasingly complex challenges throughout its lifecycle, yet no existing research systematically explores these challenges and solutions from the perspective of software engineering (SE) approaches. To fill the gap, we systematically analyze research status throughout the LLM development lifecycle, divided into six phases: requirements engineering, dataset construction, model development and enhancement, testing and evaluation, deployment and operations, and maintenance and evolution. We then conclude by identifying the key challenges for each phase and presenting potential research directions to address these challenges. In general, we provide valuable insights from an SE perspective to facilitate future advances in LLM development.

### Aligning Evaluation with Clinical Priorities: Calibration, Label Shift,   and Error Costs
**Authors**: Gerardo A. Flores, Alyssa H. Smith, Julia A. Fukuyama, Ashia C. Wilson

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T11:59:31Z

**Summary**: Machine learning-based decision support systems are increasingly deployed in clinical settings, where probabilistic scoring functions are used to inform and prioritize patient management decisions. However, widely used scoring rules, such as accuracy and AUC-ROC, fail to adequately reflect key clinical priorities, including calibration, robustness to distributional shifts, and sensitivity to asymmetric error costs. In this work, we propose a principled yet practical evaluation framework for selecting calibrated thresholded classifiers that explicitly accounts for the uncertainty in class prevalences and domain-specific cost asymmetries often found in clinical settings. Building on the theory of proper scoring rules, particularly the Schervish representation, we derive an adjusted variant of cross-entropy (log score) that averages cost-weighted performance over clinically relevant ranges of class balance. The resulting evaluation is simple to apply, sensitive to clinical deployment conditions, and designed to prioritize models that are both calibrated and robust to real-world variations.

### A Survey of LLM-based Automated Program Repair: Taxonomies, Design   Paradigms, and Applications
**Authors**: Boyang Yang, Zijian Cai, Fengling Liu, Bach Le, Lingming Zhang, Tegawendé F. Bissyandé, Yang Liu, Haoye Tian

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T11:46:01Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping automated program repair (APR). We categorize the recent 63 LLM-based APR systems published from January 2022 to June 2025 into four paradigms, and show how retrieval- or analysis-augmented contexts strengthen any of them. This taxonomy clarifies key trade-offs: fine-tuning delivers strong task alignment at high training cost; prompting enables rapid deployment but is limited by prompt design and context windows; procedural pipelines offer reproducible control with moderate overhead; agentic frameworks tackle multi-hunk or cross-file bugs at the price of increased latency and complexity. Persistent challenges include verifying semantic correctness beyond test suites, repairing repository-scale defects, and lowering the costs of LLMs. We outline research directions that combine lightweight human feedback, repository-aware retrieval, code analysis, and cost-aware planning to advance reliable and efficient LLM-based APR.

### Refine-POI: Reinforcement Fine-Tuned Large Language Models for Next   Point-of-Interest Recommendation
**Authors**: Peibo Li, Shuang Ao, Hao Xue, Yang Song, Maarten de Rijke, Johan Barthélemy, Tomasz Bednarz, Flora D. Salim

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T11:36:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation tasks. Typical LLM-based recommenders fall into two categories: prompt-based and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based models. Prompt-based models generally offer greater output flexibility but deliver lower accuracy, whereas SFT-based models achieve higher performance yet face a fundamental mismatch: next POI recommendation data does not naturally suit supervised fine-tuning. In SFT, the model is trained to reproduce the exact ground truth, but each training example provides only a single target POI, so there is no ground truth for producing a top-k list.   To address this, we propose Refine-POI, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework for next POI recommendation. We introduce recommendation-driven rewards that enable LLMs to learn to generate top-k recommendation lists using only one ground-truth POI per example. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Refine-POI achieves state-of-the-art top-k recommendation performance.

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T11:27:57Z

**Summary**: Mobile networks are embracing disaggregation, reflected by the industry trend towards Open RAN. Private 5G networks are viewed as particularly suitable contenders as early adopters of Open RAN, owing to their setting, high degree of control, and opportunity for innovation they present. Motivated by this, we have recently deployed Campus5G, the first of its kind campus-wide, O-RAN-compliant private 5G testbed across the central campus of the University of Edinburgh. We present in detail our process developing the testbed, from planning, to architecting, to deployment, and measuring the testbed performance. We then discuss the lessons learned from building the testbed, and highlight some research opportunities that emerged from our deployment experience.

### AutoEvoEval: An Automated Framework for Evolving Close-Ended LLM   Evaluation Data
**Authors**: JiaRu Wu, Mingwei Liu

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T11:18:56Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on various tasks, but existing evaluation benchmarks are often static and insufficient to fully assess their robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios. Prior work using evolutionary or adversarial data augmentation has improved evaluation diversity but lacks systematic control over perturbation types and multi-step complexity, limiting comprehensive robustness analysis. To address these gaps, we propose AutoEvoEval, an evolution-based evaluation framework for close-ended tasks such as multi-choice question answering. AutoEvoEval introduces 22 interpretable atomic evolution operations and supports multi-round compositions, enabling controlled generation of diverse, challenging, and realistic test samples. We conduct extensive experiments addressing four research questions on a broad set of open- and closed-source LLMs. Our results show that atomic operations cause an average accuracy drop of 7.283\%, with structure-disrupting or misleading semantic edits causing the largest declines. Model sensitivities vary significantly for the same perturbation, and combining multiple evolution steps amplifies adversarial effects by up to 52.932\%. These findings suggest current benchmarks may overestimate true model generalization and emphasize the need for evolution-aware robustness evaluation. Code and resources are available at: https://github.com/SYSUSELab/AutoEvoEval.

### CSC-SQL: Corrective Self-Consistency in Text-to-SQL via Reinforcement   Learning
**Authors**: Lei Sheng, Shuai-Shuai Xu

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T11:12:31Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in translating natural language questions about relational databases into SQL queries. In particular, test-time scaling techniques such as Self-Consistency and Self-Correction can enhance SQL generation accuracy by increasing computational effort during inference. However, these methods have notable limitations: Self-Consistency may select suboptimal outputs despite majority votes, while Self-Correction typically addresses only syntactic errors. To leverage the strengths of both approaches, we propose CSC-SQL, a novel method that integrates Self-Consistency and Self-Correction. CSC-SQL selects the two most frequently occurring outputs from parallel sampling and feeds them into a merge revision model for correction. Additionally, we employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to fine-tune both the SQL generation and revision models via reinforcement learning, significantly enhancing output quality. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of CSC-SQL. On the BIRD private test set, our 7B model achieves 71.72\% execution accuracy, while the 32B model achieves 73.67\%. The code has been open sourced at https://github.com/CycloneBoy/csc_sql.

### Radioactive Watermarks in Diffusion and Autoregressive Image Generative   Models
**Authors**: Michel Meintz, Jan Dubiński, Franziska Boenisch, Adam Dziedzic

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T11:08:10Z

**Summary**: Image generative models have become increasingly popular, but training them requires large datasets that are costly to collect and curate. To circumvent these costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated images as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a valuable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when these images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable detection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable in the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity. We analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion models (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing watermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are either erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the noising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile, despite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and efficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To overcome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for IARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in large language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our extensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in preserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and preventing unauthorized use of their generated images.

### StepProof: Step-by-step verification of natural language mathematical   proofs
**Authors**: Xiaolin Hu, Qinghua Zhou, Bogdan Grechuk, Ivan Y. Tyukin

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:59:44Z

**Summary**: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified. Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification. StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs, enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification, further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.

### System-Embedded Diffusion Bridge Models
**Authors**: Bartlomiej Sobieski, Matthew Tivnan, Yuang Wang, Siyeop Yoon, Pengfei Jin, Dufan Wu, Quanzheng Li, Przemyslaw Biecek

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:58:49Z

**Summary**: Solving inverse problems -- recovering signals from incomplete or noisy measurements -- is fundamental in science and engineering. Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for this task. Two main paradigms have formed: unsupervised approaches that adapt pretrained generative models to inverse problems, and supervised bridge methods that train stochastic processes conditioned on paired clean and corrupted data. While the former typically assume knowledge of the measurement model, the latter have largely overlooked this structural information. We introduce System embedded Diffusion Bridge Models (SDBs), a new class of supervised bridge methods that explicitly embed the known linear measurement system into the coefficients of a matrix-valued SDE. This principled integration yields consistent improvements across diverse linear inverse problems and demonstrates robust generalization under system misspecification between training and deployment, offering a promising solution to real-world applications.

**Authors**: Alex Egg, Martin Iglesias Goyanes, Friso Kingma, Andreu Mora, Leandro von Werra, Thomas Wolf

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:49:21Z

**Summary**: We introduce DABstep, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on realistic multi-step data analysis tasks. DABstep comprises over 450 real-world challenges derived from a financial analytics platform, requiring models to combine code-based data processing with contextual reasoning over heterogeneous documentation. Each task demands an iterative, multi-step problem-solving approach, testing capabilities in data manipulation, cross-referencing multiple sources, and precise result reporting. The benchmark provides a factoid-style answer format with automatic correctness checks for objective scoring at scale. We evaluate leading LLM-based agents, revealing a substantial performance gap: even the best agent achieves only 14.55% accuracy on the hardest tasks. We detail our benchmark's design, dataset composition, task formulation, evaluation protocol, report baseline results and analyze failure modes. DABstep is released with a public leaderboard and toolkit to accelerate research in autonomous data analysis.

### Towards an Automated Multimodal Approach for Video Summarization:   Building a Bridge Between Text, Audio and Facial Cue-Based Summarization
**Authors**: Md Moinul Islam, Sofoklis Kakouros, Janne Heikkilä, Mourad Oussalah

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:41:33Z

**Summary**: The increasing volume of video content in educational, professional, and social domains necessitates effective summarization techniques that go beyond traditional unimodal approaches. This paper proposes a behaviour-aware multimodal video summarization framework that integrates textual, audio, and visual cues to generate timestamp-aligned summaries. By extracting prosodic features, textual cues and visual indicators, the framework identifies semantically and emotionally important moments. A key contribution is the identification of bonus words, which are terms emphasized across multiple modalities and used to improve the semantic relevance and expressive clarity of the summaries. The approach is evaluated against pseudo-ground truth (pGT) summaries generated using LLM-based extractive method. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional extractive method, such as the Edmundson method, in both text and video-based evaluation metrics. Text-based metrics show ROUGE-1 increasing from 0.4769 to 0.7929 and BERTScore from 0.9152 to 0.9536, while in video-based evaluation, our proposed framework improves F1-Score by almost 23%. The findings underscore the potential of multimodal integration in producing comprehensive and behaviourally informed video summaries.

### SmileyLlama: Modifying Large Language Models for Directed Chemical Space   Exploration
**Authors**: Joseph M. Cavanagh, Kunyang Sun, Andrew Gritsevskiy, Dorian Bagni, Yingze Wang, Thomas D. Bannister, Teresa Head-Gordon

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:36:58Z

**Summary**: Here we show that a general-purpose large language model (LLM) chatbot, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, can be transformed via supervised fine-tuning of engineered prompts into a chemical language model (CLM), SmileyLlama, for molecule generation. We benchmark SmileyLlama by comparing it to CLMs trained from scratch on large amounts of ChEMBL data for their ability to generate valid and novel drug-like molecules. We also use direct preference optimization to both improve SmileyLlama's adherence to a prompt and to generate molecules within the iMiner reinforcement learning framework to predict new drug molecules with optimized 3D conformations and high binding affinity to drug targets, illustrated with the SARS-Cov-2 Main Protease. This overall framework allows a LLM to speak directly as a CLM which can generate molecules with user-specified properties, rather than acting only as a chatbot with knowledge of chemistry or as a helpful virtual assistant. While our dataset and analyses are geared toward drug discovery, this general procedure can be extended to other chemical applications such as chemical synthesis.

### If You Had to Pitch Your Ideal Software -- Evaluating Large Language   Models to Support User Scenario Writing for User Experience Experts and   Laypersons
**Authors**: Patrick Stadler, Christopher Lazik, Christopher Katins, Thomas Kosch

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:15:44Z

**Summary**: The process of requirements analysis requires an understanding of the end users of a system. Thus, expert stakeholders, such as User Experience (UX) designers, usually create various descriptions containing information about the users and their possible needs. In our paper, we investigate to what extent UX novices are able to write such descriptions into user scenarios. We conducted a user study with 60 participants consisting of 30 UX experts and 30 novices who were asked to write a user scenario with or without the help of an LLM-supported writing assistant. Our findings show that LLMs empower laypersons to write reasonable user scenarios and provide first-hand insights for requirements analysis that are comparable to UX experts in terms of structure and clarity, while especially excelling at audience-orientation. We present our qualitative and quantitative findings, including user scenario anatomies, potential influences, and differences in the way participants approached the task.

**Summary**: While AI for Science (AI4S) serves as an analytical tool in the current research paradigm, it doesn't solve its core inefficiency. We propose "Agent for Science" (Agent4S)-the use of LLM-driven agents to automate the entire research workflow-as the true Fifth Scientific Paradigm. This paper introduces a five-level classification for Agent4S, outlining a clear roadmap from simple task automation to fully autonomous, collaborative "AI Scientists." This framework defines the next revolutionary step in scientific discovery.

### PokéAI: A Goal-Generating, Battle-Optimizing Multi-agent System for   Pokemon Red
**Authors**: Zihao Liu, Xinhang Sui, Yueran Song, Siwen Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:09:13Z

**Summary**: We introduce Pok\'eAI, the first text-based, multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework designed to autonomously play and progress through Pok\'emon Red. Our system consists of three specialized agents-Planning, Execution, and Critique-each with its own memory bank, role, and skill set. The Planning Agent functions as the central brain, generating tasks to progress through the game. These tasks are then delegated to the Execution Agent, which carries them out within the game environment. Upon task completion, the Critique Agent evaluates the outcome to determine whether the objective was successfully achieved. Once verification is complete, control returns to the Planning Agent, forming a closed-loop decision-making system.   As a preliminary step, we developed a battle module within the Execution Agent. Our results show that the battle AI achieves an average win rate of 80.8% across 50 wild encounters, only 6% lower than the performance of an experienced human player. Furthermore, we find that a model's battle performance correlates strongly with its LLM Arena score on language-related tasks, indicating a meaningful link between linguistic ability and strategic reasoning. Finally, our analysis of gameplay logs reveals that each LLM exhibits a unique playstyle, suggesting that individual models develop distinct strategic behaviors.

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:08:25Z

**Summary**: Prostate and zonal segmentation is a crucial step for clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa). Computer-aided diagnosis tools for prostate segmentation are based on the deep learning (DL) paradigm. However, deep neural networks are perceived as "black-box" solutions by physicians, thus making them less practical for deployment in the clinical setting. In this paper, we introduce a feed-forward machine learning model, named Green U-shaped Learning (GUSL), suitable for medical image segmentation without backpropagation. GUSL introduces a multi-layer regression scheme for coarse-to-fine segmentation. Its feature extraction is based on a linear model, which enables seamless interpretability during feature extraction. Also, GUSL introduces a mechanism for attention on the prostate boundaries, which is an error-prone region, by employing regression to refine the predictions through residue correction. In addition, a two-step pipeline approach is used to mitigate the class imbalance, an issue inherent in medical imaging problems. After conducting experiments on two publicly available datasets and one private dataset, in both prostate gland and zonal segmentation tasks, GUSL achieves state-of-the-art performance among other DL-based models. Notably, GUSL features a very energy-efficient pipeline, since it has a model size several times smaller and less complexity than the rest of the solutions. In all datasets, GUSL achieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) performance greater than $0.9$ for gland segmentation. Considering also its lightweight model size and transparency in feature extraction, it offers a competitive and practical package for medical imaging applications.

### Can Large Language Models Help Students Prove Software Correctness? An   Experimental Study with Dafny
**Authors**: Carolina Carreira, Álvaro Silva, Alexandre Abreu, Alexandra Mendes

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:08:05Z

**Summary**: Students in computing education increasingly use large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. Yet, the role of LLMs in supporting cognitively demanding tasks, like deductive program verification, remains poorly understood. This paper investigates how students interact with an LLM when solving formal verification exercises in Dafny, a language that supports functional correctness, by allowing programmers to write formal specifications and automatically verifying that the implementation satisfies the specification. We conducted a mixed-methods study with master's students enrolled in a formal methods course. Each participant completed two verification problems, one with access to a custom ChatGPT interface that logged all interactions, and the other without. We identified strategies used by successful students and assessed the level of trust students place in LLMs. Our findings show that students perform significantly better when using ChatGPT; however, performance gains are tied to prompt quality. We conclude with practical recommendations for integrating LLMs into formal methods courses more effectively, including designing LLM-aware challenges that promote learning rather than substitution.

### Interactive Reasoning: Visualizing and Controlling Chain-of-Thought   Reasoning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Rock Yuren Pang, K. J. Kevin Feng, Shangbin Feng, Chu Li, Weijia Shi, Yulia Tsvetkov, Jeffrey Heer, Katharina Reinecke

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T10:00:43Z

**Summary**: The output quality of large language models (LLMs) can be improved via "reasoning": generating segments of chain-of-thought (CoT) content to further condition the model prior to producing user-facing output. While these chains contain valuable information, they are verbose and lack explicit organization, making them tedious to review. Moreover, they lack opportunities for user feedback, such as to remove unwanted considerations, add desired ones, or clarify unclear assumptions. We introduce Interactive Reasoning, an interaction design that visualizes chain-of-thought outputs as a hierarchy of topics and enables user review and modification. We implement interactive reasoning in Hippo, a prototype for AI-assisted decision making in the face of uncertain trade-offs. In a user study with 16 participants, we find that interactive reasoning in Hippo allows users to quickly identify and interrupt erroneous generations, efficiently steer the model towards customized responses, and better understand both model reasoning and model outputs. Our work contributes to a new paradigm that incorporates user oversight into LLM reasoning processes.

### Sparsing Law: Towards Large Language Models with Greater Activation   Sparsity
**Authors**: Yuqi Luo, Chenyang Song, Xu Han, Yingfa Chen, Chaojun Xiao, Xiaojun Meng, Liqun Deng, Jiansheng Wei, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T09:50:52Z

**Summary**: Activation sparsity denotes the existence of substantial weakly-contributed elements within activation outputs that can be eliminated, benefiting many important applications concerned with large language models (LLMs). Although promoting greater activation sparsity within LLMs deserves deep studies, existing works lack comprehensive and quantitative research on the correlation between activation sparsity and potentially influential factors. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the quantitative scaling properties and influential factors of the activation sparsity within decoder-only Transformer-based LLMs. Specifically, we propose PPL-$p\%$ sparsity, a precise and performance-aware activation sparsity metric that is applicable to any activation function. Through extensive experiments, we find several important phenomena. Firstly, different activation functions exhibit comparable performance but opposite training-time sparsity trends. The activation ratio (i.e., $1-\mathrm{sparsity\ ratio}$) evolves as a convergent increasing power-law and decreasing logspace power-law with the amount of training data for SiLU-activated and ReLU-activated LLMs, respectively. These demonstrate that ReLU is more efficient as the activation function than SiLU and can leverage more training data to improve activation sparsity. Secondly, the activation ratio linearly increases with the width-depth ratio below a certain bottleneck point, indicating the potential advantage of a deeper architecture at a fixed parameter scale. Finally, at similar width-depth ratios, we surprisingly find that the limit value of activation sparsity varies weakly with the parameter scale, i.e., the activation patterns within LLMs are insensitive to the parameter scale. These empirical laws towards LLMs with greater activation sparsity have important implications for making LLMs more efficient and interpretable.

### Efficient Interleaved Speech Modeling through Knowledge Distillation
**Authors**: Mohammadmahdi Nouriborji, Morteza Rohanian

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T09:47:37Z

**Summary**: Current speech language models exceed the size and latency constraints of many deployment environments. We build compact, expressive speech generation models through layer-aligned distillation, matching hidden states, attention maps, and softened logits to compress large multimodal transformers by 3x with minimal loss in performance. We introduce TinyWave, a family of 2B-parameter models for speech-to-speech and interleaved speech-text generation, trained on 50,000 hours of public audio. TinyWave supports (i) speech-only generation using phonetic or expressive tokens and (ii) mixed speech-text continuations. Evaluation on Libri-Light shows TinyWave within 1.4 normalized perplexity points of its teacher. Accuracy on spoken StoryCloze and SALMon reaches 93-97% of the teacher's performance, outperforming size-matched baselines. These models are optimized for deployment on commodity hardware, enabling applications in real-time conversational agents, assistive technologies, and low-resource environments. We release models, training code, and evaluation scripts to support reproducible research on compact, expressive speech generation.

### L0: Reinforcement Learning to Become General Agents
**Authors**: Junjie Zhang, Jingyi Xi, Zhuoyang Song, Junyu Lu, Yuhua Ke, Ting Sun, Yukun Yang, Jiaxing Zhang, Songxin Zhang, Zejian Xie

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T09:44:32Z

**Summary**: Training large language models (LLMs) to act as autonomous agents for multi-turn, long-horizon tasks remains significant challenges in scalability and training efficiency. To address this, we introduce L-Zero (L0), a scalable, end-to-end training pipeline for general-purpose agents. Featuring a low-cost, extensible, and sandboxed concurrent agent worker pool, L0 lowers the barrier for applying reinforcement learning in complex environments. We also introduce NB-Agent, the agent scaffold within L0, which operates in a "code-as-action" fashion via a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL). We evaluate L0 on factuality question-answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that a base model can develop robust problem-solving skills using solely Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). On the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, our method boosts accuracy on SimpleQA from 30 % to 80 % and on HotpotQA from 22 % to 41 %. We have open-sourced the entire L0 system, including our L0 series models, the NB-Agent, a complete training pipeline, and the corresponding training recipes on (https://github.com/cmriat/l0).

### On the Domain Robustness of Contrastive Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Mario Koddenbrock, Rudolf Hoffmann, David Brodmann, Erik Rodner

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T09:39:33Z

**Summary**: In real-world vision-language applications, practitioners increasingly rely on large, pretrained foundation models rather than custom-built solutions, despite limited transparency regarding their training data and processes. While these models achieve impressive performance on general benchmarks, their effectiveness can decline notably under specialized domain shifts, such as unique imaging conditions or environmental variations. In this work, we introduce Deepbench, a framework designed to assess domain-specific robustness of vision-language models (VLMs). Deepbench leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate realistic, context-aware image corruptions tailored to specific deployment domains without requiring labeled data. We evaluate a range of contrastive vision-language architectures and architectural variants across six real-world domains and observe substantial variability in robustness, highlighting the need for targeted, domain-aware evaluation. Deepbench is released as open-source software to support further research into domain-aware robustness assessment.

### Robust LLM Unlearning with MUDMAN: Meta-Unlearning with Disruption   Masking And Normalization
**Authors**: Filip Sondej, Yushi Yang, Mikołaj Kniejski, Marcel Windys

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T09:37:43Z

**Summary**: Language models can retain dangerous knowledge and skills even after extensive safety fine-tuning, posing both misuse and misalignment risks. Recent studies show that even specialized unlearning methods can be easily reversed. To address this, we systematically evaluate many existing and novel components of unlearning methods and identify ones crucial for irreversible unlearning.   We introduce Disruption Masking, a technique in which we only allow updating weights, where the signs of the unlearning gradient and the retaining gradient are the same. This ensures all updates are non-disruptive.   Additionally, we identify the need for normalizing the unlearning gradients, and also confirm the usefulness of meta-learning. We combine these insights into MUDMAN (Meta-Unlearning with Disruption Masking and Normalization) and validate its effectiveness at preventing the recovery of dangerous capabilities. MUDMAN outperforms the prior TAR method by 40%, setting a new state-of-the-art for robust unlearning.

### From quantum-enhanced to quantum-inspired Monte Carlo
**Authors**: Johannes Christmann, Petr Ivashkov, Mattia Chiurco, Guglielmo Mazzola

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T09:23:34Z

**Summary**: We perform a comprehensive analysis of the quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo method [Nature, 619, 282-287 (2023)], aimed at identifying the optimal working point of the algorithm. We observe an optimal mixing Hamiltonian strength and analyze the scaling of the total evolution time with the size of the system. We also explore extensions of the circuit, including the use of time-dependent Hamiltonians and reverse digitized annealing. Additionally, we propose that classical, approximate quantum simulators can be used for the proposal step instead of the original real-hardware implementation. We observe that tensor-network simulators, even with unconverged settings, can maintain a scaling advantage over standard classical samplers. This may extend the utility of quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo as a quantum-inspired algorithm, even before the deployment of large-scale quantum hardware.

### Uncertainty-Aware Remaining Lifespan Prediction from Images
**Authors**: Tristan Kenneweg, Philip Kenneweg, Barbara Hammer

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T09:19:47Z

**Summary**: Predicting mortality-related outcomes from images offers the prospect of accessible, noninvasive, and scalable health screening. We present a method that leverages pretrained vision transformer foundation models to estimate remaining lifespan from facial and whole-body images, alongside robust uncertainty quantification. We show that predictive uncertainty varies systematically with the true remaining lifespan, and that this uncertainty can be effectively modeled by learning a Gaussian distribution for each sample. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.48 years on an established dataset, and further improves to 4.79 and 5.07 years MAE on two new, higher-quality datasets curated and published in this work. Importantly, our models provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, as demonstrated by a bucketed expected calibration error of 0.62 years. While not intended for clinical deployment, these results highlight the potential of extracting medically relevant signals from images. We make all code and datasets available to facilitate further research.

### Act-With-Think: Chunk Auto-Regressive Modeling for Generative   Recommendation
**Authors**: Yifan Wang, Weinan Gan, Longtao Xiao, Jieming Zhu, Heng Chang, Haozhao Wang, Rui Zhang, Zhenhua Dong, Ruiming Tang, Ruixuan Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T09:13:54Z

**Summary**: Generative recommendation (GR) typically encodes behavioral or semantic aspects of item information into discrete tokens, leveraging the standard autoregressive (AR) generation paradigm to make predictions. However, existing methods tend to overlook their intrinsic relationship, that is, the semantic usually provides some reasonable explainability "$\textbf{why}$" for the behavior "$\textbf{what}$", which may constrain the full potential of GR. To this end, we present Chunk AutoRegressive Modeling (CAR), a new generation paradigm following the decision pattern that users usually think semantic aspects of items (e.g. brand) and then take actions on target items (e.g. purchase). Our CAR, for the $\textit{first time}$, incorporates semantics (SIDs) and behavior (UID) into a single autoregressive transformer from an ``act-with-think'' dual perspective via chunk-level autoregression. Specifically, CAR packs SIDs and UID into a conceptual chunk for item unified representation, allowing each decoding step to make a holistic prediction. Experiments show that our CAR significantly outperforms existing methods based on traditional AR, improving Recall@5 by 7.93% to 22.30%. Furthermore, we verify the scaling effect between model performance and SIDs bit number, demonstrating that CAR preliminary emulates a kind of slow-thinking style mechanism akin to the reasoning processes observed in large language models (LLMs).

### Geminet: Learning the Duality-based Iterative Process for Lightweight   Traffic Engineering in Changing Topologies
**Authors**: Ximeng Liu, Shizhen Zhao, Xinbing Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T09:09:50Z

**Summary**: Recently, researchers have explored ML-based Traffic Engineering (TE), leveraging neural networks to solve TE problems traditionally addressed by optimization. However, existing ML-based TE schemes remain impractical: they either fail to handle topology changes or suffer from poor scalability due to excessive computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose Geminet, a lightweight and scalable ML-based TE framework that can handle changing topologies. Geminet is built upon two key insights: (i) a methodology that decouples neural networks from topology by learning an iterative gradient-descent-based adjustment process, as the update rule of gradient descent is topology-agnostic, relying only on a few gradient-related quantities; (ii) shifting optimization from path-level routing weights to edge-level dual variables, reducing memory consumption by leveraging the fact that edges are far fewer than paths. Evaluations on WAN and data center datasets show that Geminet significantly improves scalability. Its neural network size is only 0.04% to 7% of existing schemes, while handling topology variations as effectively as HARP, a state-of-the-art ML-based TE approach, without performance degradation. When trained on large-scale topologies, Geminet consumes under 10 GiB of memory, more than eight times less than the 80-plus GiB required by HARP, while achieving 5.45 times faster convergence speed, demonstrating its potential for large-scale deployment.

### Towards Building Private LLMs: Exploring Multi-Node Expert Parallelism   on Apple Silicon for Mixture-of-Experts Large Language Model
**Authors**: Mu-Chi Chen, Po-Hsuan Huang, Xiangrui Ke, Chia-Heng Tu, Chun Jason Xue, Shih-Hao Hung

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T09:04:25Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Artificial Intelligence (AI) with significant advancements such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Meta's Llama, and Databricks' DBRX. This paper addresses the cost and scalability challenges encountered when constructing private LLM systems for personal or small group services, as aimed by Apple Intelligence. A Mac Studio cluster with Apple's M2 Ultra chips is established as a cost-efficient solution to host and accelerate the pretrained DBRX model with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our performance analysis reveal that parallel execution of the model's experts across two to four machine nodes significantly reduces inference time. We find that computation time for the experts is comparable to the communication time for exchanging their outputs, emphasizing the importance of network latency over bandwidth. We also observe significant management overhead due to Apple software stack's memory management logic. Based on these findings, we develop optimization schemes to eliminate the memory management overhead. As a result, the Mac Studio cluster is 1.15 times more cost-efficient than the state-of-the-art AI supercomputer with NVIDIA H100 GPUs. In addition, we construct a performance model to estimate system performance under varying configurations, and the model provides valuable insights for designing private LLM systems.

### Skill-Nav: Enhanced Navigation with Versatile Quadrupedal Locomotion via   Waypoint Interface
**Authors**: Dewei Wang, Chenjia Bai, Chenhui Li, Jiyuan Shi, Yan Ding, Chi Zhang, Bin Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T08:59:34Z

**Summary**: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated exceptional locomotion capabilities through Reinforcement Learning (RL), including extreme parkour maneuvers. However, integrating locomotion skills with navigation in quadrupedal robots has not been fully investigated, which holds promise for enhancing long-distance movement capabilities. In this paper, we propose Skill-Nav, a method that incorporates quadrupedal locomotion skills into a hierarchical navigation framework using waypoints as an interface. Specifically, we train a waypoint-guided locomotion policy using deep RL, enabling the robot to autonomously adjust its locomotion skills to reach targeted positions while avoiding obstacles. Compared with direct velocity commands, waypoints offer a simpler yet more flexible interface for high-level planning and low-level control. Utilizing waypoints as the interface allows for the application of various general planning tools, such as large language models (LLMs) and path planning algorithms, to guide our locomotion policy in traversing terrains with diverse obstacles. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrate that Skill-Nav can effectively traverse complex terrains and complete challenging navigation tasks.

**Authors**: Xin Zhang, Liangxiu Han, Yue Shi, Yanlin Zheng, Uazman Alam, Maryam Ferdousi, Rayaz Malik

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T08:40:51Z

**Summary**: Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) affects nearly half of diabetes patients, requiring early detection. Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) enables non-invasive diagnosis, but automated methods suffer from inefficient feature extraction, reliance on handcrafted priors, and data limitations. We propose HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer (HMSViT) designed for corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis. Unlike existing methods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention mechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale feature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and integrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost. A block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT that reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a multi-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing hierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like the Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation accuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal that integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature extraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional supervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that HMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating its potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.

### BIMgent: Towards Autonomous Building Modeling via Computer-use Agents
**Authors**: Zihan Deng, Changyu Du, Stavros Nousias, André Borrmann

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T08:31:07Z

**Summary**: Existing computer-use agents primarily focus on general-purpose desktop automation tasks, with limited exploration of their application in highly specialized domains. In particular, the 3D building modeling process in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector involves open-ended design tasks and complex interaction patterns within Building Information Modeling (BIM) authoring software, which has yet to be thoroughly addressed by current studies. In this paper, we propose BIMgent, an agentic framework powered by multimodal large language models (LLMs), designed to enable autonomous building model authoring via graphical user interface (GUI) operations. BIMgent automates the architectural building modeling process, including multimodal input for conceptual design, planning of software-specific workflows, and efficient execution of the authoring GUI actions. We evaluate BIMgent on real-world building modeling tasks, including both text-based conceptual design generation and reconstruction from existing building design. The design quality achieved by BIMgent was found to be reasonable. Its operations achieved a 32% success rate, whereas all baseline models failed to complete the tasks (0% success rate). Results demonstrate that BIMgent effectively reduces manual workload while preserving design intent, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in real-world architectural modeling scenarios.

**Authors**: Kexin Chen, Yuyang Du, Junyou Li, Hanqun Cao, Menghao Guo, Xilin Dang, Lanqing Li, Jiezhong Qiu, Pheng Ann Heng, Guangyong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T08:19:19Z

**Summary**: The development of AI-assisted chemical synthesis tools requires comprehensive datasets covering diverse reaction types, yet current high-throughput experimental (HTE) approaches are expensive and limited in scope. Chemical literature represents a vast, underexplored data source containing thousands of reactions published annually. However, extracting reaction information from literature faces significant challenges including varied writing styles, complex coreference relationships, and multimodal information presentation. This paper proposes ChemMiner, a novel end-to-end framework leveraging multiple agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to extract high-fidelity chemical data from literature. ChemMiner incorporates three specialized agents: a text analysis agent for coreference mapping, a multimodal agent for non-textual information extraction, and a synthesis analysis agent for data generation. Furthermore, we developed a comprehensive benchmark with expert-annotated chemical literature to evaluate both extraction efficiency and precision. Experimental results demonstrate reaction identification rates comparable to human chemists while significantly reducing processing time, with high accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Our open-sourced benchmark facilitates future research in chemical literature data mining.

### Evaluating the Simulation of Human Personality-Driven Susceptibility to   Misinformation with LLMs
**Authors**: Manuel Pratelli, Marinella Petrocchi

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T08:16:07Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) make it possible to generate synthetic behavioural data at scale, offering an ethical and low-cost alternative to human experiments. Whether such data can faithfully capture psychological differences driven by personality traits, however, remains an open question. We evaluate the capacity of LLM agents, conditioned on Big-Five profiles, to reproduce personality-based variation in susceptibility to misinformation, focusing on news discernment, the ability to judge true headlines as true and false headlines as false. Leveraging published datasets in which human participants with known personality profiles rated headline accuracy, we create matching LLM agents and compare their responses to the original human patterns. Certain trait-misinformation associations, notably those involving Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, are reliably replicated, whereas others diverge, revealing systematic biases in how LLMs internalize and express personality. The results underscore both the promise and the limits of personality-aligned LLMs for behavioral simulation, and offer new insight into modeling cognitive diversity in artificial agents.

### AI-Generated Lecture Slides for Improving Slide Element Detection and   Retrieval
**Authors**: Suyash Maniyar, Vishvesh Trivedi, Ajoy Mondal, Anand Mishra, C. V. Jawahar

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T08:11:31Z

**Summary**: Lecture slide element detection and retrieval are key problems in slide understanding. Training effective models for these tasks often depends on extensive manual annotation. However, annotating large volumes of lecture slides for supervised training is labor intensive and requires domain expertise. To address this, we propose a large language model (LLM)-guided synthetic lecture slide generation pipeline, SynLecSlideGen, which produces high-quality, coherent and realistic slides. We also create an evaluation benchmark, namely RealSlide by manually annotating 1,050 real lecture slides. To assess the utility of our synthetic slides, we perform few-shot transfer learning on real data using models pre-trained on them. Experimental results show that few-shot transfer learning with pretraining on synthetic slides significantly improves performance compared to training only on real data. This demonstrates that synthetic data can effectively compensate for limited labeled lecture slides. The code and resources of our work are publicly available on our project website: https://synslidegen.github.io/.

### KAG-Thinker: Interactive Thinking and Deep Reasoning in LLMs via   Knowledge-Augmented Generation

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T08:08:21Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce KAG-Thinker, which upgrade KAG to a multi-turn interactive thinking and deep reasoning framework powered by a dedicated parameter-light large language model (LLM). Our approach constructs a structured thinking process for solving complex problems, enhancing the the logical coherence and contextual consistency of the reasoning process in question-answering (Q&A) tasks on domain-specific knowledge bases (KBs) within LLMs. Following the \textbf{Logical Form} guided retrieval and reasoning technology route of KAG, this framework first decomposes complex questions into independently solvable sub-problems (which are also referred to as logical forms) through \textbf{breadth decomposition}. Each such logical form is represented in two equivalent forms-natural language and logical function-and subsequently classified as either a Knowledge Retrieval or Reasoning Analysis task. Dependencies and parameter passing between these tasks are explicitly modeled via logical function interfaces. In the solving process, the Retrieval function performs retrieval tasks. It retrieves one-hop structured and unstructured information of specified knowledge unit. While the Math and Deduce functions are used to perform reasoning analysis tasks. Secondly, it is worth noting that, in the Knowledge Retrieval sub-problem tasks, LLMs and external knowledge sources are regarded as equivalent KBs. We use the \textbf{knowledge boundary} module to determine the optimal source using self-regulatory mechanisms such as confidence calibration and reflective reasoning, and use the \textbf{depth solving} module to enhance the comprehensiveness of knowledge acquisition...

### SoK: Semantic Privacy in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Baihe Ma, Yanna Jiang, Xu Wang, Guangshen Yu, Qin Wang, Caijun Sun, Chen Li, Xuelei Qi, Ying He, Wei Ni, Ren Ping Liu

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T08:08:15Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains, traditional data privacy measures prove inadequate for protecting information that is implicit, contextual, or inferable - what we define as semantic privacy. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) introduces a lifecycle-centric framework to analyze how semantic privacy risks emerge across input processing, pretraining, fine-tuning, and alignment stages of LLMs. We categorize key attack vectors and assess how current defenses, such as differential privacy, embedding encryption, edge computing, and unlearning, address these threats. Our analysis reveals critical gaps in semantic-level protection, especially against contextual inference and latent representation leakage. We conclude by outlining open challenges, including quantifying semantic leakage, protecting multimodal inputs, balancing de-identification with generation quality, and ensuring transparency in privacy enforcement. This work aims to inform future research on designing robust, semantically aware privacy-preserving techniques for LLMs.

### InstructionBench: An Instructional Video Understanding Benchmark
**Authors**: Haiwan Wei, Yitian Yuan, Xiaohan Lan, Wei Ke, Lin Ma

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T07:41:07Z

**Summary**: Despite progress in video large language models (Video-LLMs), research on instructional video understanding, crucial for enhancing access to instructional content, remains insufficient. To address this, we introduce InstructionBench, an Instructional video understanding Benchmark, which challenges models' advanced temporal reasoning within instructional videos characterized by their strict step-by-step flow. Employing GPT-4, we formulate Q&A pairs in open-ended and multiple-choice formats to assess both Coarse-Grained event-level and Fine-Grained object-level reasoning. Our filtering strategies exclude questions answerable purely by common-sense knowledge, focusing on visual perception and analysis when evaluating Video-LLM models. The benchmark finally contains 5k questions across over 700 videos. We evaluate the latest Video-LLMs on our InstructionBench, finding that closed-source models outperform open-source ones. However, even the best model, GPT-4o, achieves only 53.42% accuracy, indicating significant gaps in temporal reasoning. To advance the field, we also develop a comprehensive instructional video dataset with over 19k Q&A pairs from nearly 2.5k videos, using an automated data generation framework, thereby enriching the community's research resources. All data are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/sunwhw/InstructionBench.

### EFRame: Deeper Reasoning via Exploration-Filter-Replay Reinforcement   Learning Framework
**Authors**: Chen Wang, Lai Wei, Yanzhi Zhang, Chenyang Shao, Zedong Dan, Weiran Huang, Yue Wang, Yuzhi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T07:33:48Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient variant of PPO that lowers RL's computational cost, still faces limited exploration, low sample efficiency and instability, constraining its performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filtering-Replay framework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions. EFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories, applies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise and variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but informative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle, guiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to convergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of training, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain unattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame enables a more fine-grained categorization of training samples, allowing for a deeper analysis of how different types of samples contribute to the learning process in RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/597358816/EFRame.

### Evaluating Multi-Agent Defences Against Jailbreaking Attacks on Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Maria Carolina Cornelia Wit, Jun Pang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T07:29:07Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about jailbreaking attacks, i.e., prompts that bypass safety mechanisms. This paper investigates the use of multi-agent LLM systems as a defence against such attacks. We evaluate three jailbreaking strategies, including the original AutoDefense attack and two from Deepleaps: BetterDan and JB. Reproducing the AutoDefense framework, we compare single-agent setups with two- and three-agent configurations. Our results show that multi-agent systems enhance resistance to jailbreaks, especially by reducing false negatives. However, its effectiveness varies by attack type, and it introduces trade-offs such as increased false positives and computational overhead. These findings point to the limitations of current automated defences and suggest directions for improving alignment robustness in future LLM systems.

### Online Human Action Detection during Escorting
**Authors**: Siddhartha Mondal, Avik Mitra, Chayan Sarkar

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T07:25:31Z

**Summary**: The deployment of robot assistants in large indoor spaces has seen significant growth, with escorting tasks becoming a key application. However, most current escorting robots primarily rely on navigation-focused strategies, assuming that the person being escorted will follow without issue. In crowded environments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to keep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As a result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective escorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement dynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must continuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process and adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing dataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of escorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where other individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to identify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting their actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification and action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network architecture that can accomplish both tasks. This enables the robot to adjust its speed dynamically based on the escortee's movements and seamlessly resume escorting after any disruption. In comparative evaluations against strong baselines, our system demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness, showcasing its potential to significantly improve robotic escorting services in complex, real-world scenarios.

### Data-Driven Modulation Optimization with LMMSE Equalization for   Reliability Enhancement in Underwater Acoustic Communications
**Authors**: Xuehan Wang, Hengyu Zhang, Jintao Wang, Zhi Sun, Bo Ai

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T07:04:46Z

**Summary**: Ultra-reliable underwater acoustic (UWA) communications serve as one of the key enabling technologies for future space-air-ground-underwater integrated networks. However, the reliability of current UWA transmission is still insufficient since severe performance degradation occurs for conventional multicarrier systems in UWA channels with severe delay-scale spread. To solve this problem, we exploit learning-inspired approaches to optimize the modulation scheme under the assumption of linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) equalization, where the discrete representation of waveforms is adopted by utilizing Nyquist filters. The optimization problem is first transferred into maximizing the fairness of estimation mean square error (MSE) for each data symbol since the total MSE is invariant considering the property of orthogonal modulation. The Siamese architecture is then adopted to obtain consistent optimization results across various channel conditions, which avoids the overhead of online feedback, cooperation, and deployment of neural networks and guarantees generalization. The overall scheme including the loss function, neural network structure, and training process is also investigated in depth in this paper. The excellent performance and robustness of the proposed modulation scheme are verified by carrying out the bit error rate test over various UWA channels with severe delay-scale spread.

### From Alignment to Advancement: Bootstrapping Audio-Language Alignment   with Synthetic Data
**Authors**: Chun-Yi Kuan, Hung-yi Lee

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T06:48:46Z

**Summary**: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on audio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where crucial textual capabilities like instruction-following are lost after training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about reliability. Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for instruction tuning, making it resource-intensive. To address these issues, previous works have leveraged the backbone LLMs to synthesize general-purpose, caption-style alignment data. In this paper, we propose a data generation framework that produces contrastive-like training data, designed to enhance ALLMs' ability to differentiate between present and absent sounds. We further extend our approach to multi-audio scenarios, enabling the model to either explain differences between audio inputs or produce unified captions that describe all inputs, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. We refer to the entire ALLM training framework as bootstrapping audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs (BALSa). Experimental results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations while reliably maintaining strong performance on audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, as well as instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning capabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to developing ALLMs.

### PipeOffload: Improving Scalability of Pipeline Parallelism with Memory   Optimization
**Authors**: Xinyi Wan, Penghui Qi, Guangxing Huang, Min Lin, Jialin Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T06:37:05Z

**Summary**: Pipeline parallelism (PP) is widely used for training large language models (LLMs), yet its scalability is often constrained by high activation memory consumption as the number of in-flight microbatches grows with the degree of PP. In this paper, we focus on addressing this challenge by leveraging the under-explored memory offload strategy in PP. With empirical study, we discover that in the majority of standard configurations, at least half, and potentially all, of the activations can be offloaded with negligible overhead. In the cases where full overload is not possible, we introduce a novel selective offload strategy that decreases peak activation memory in a better-than-linear manner. Furthermore, we integrate memory offload with other techniques to jointly consider overall throughput and memory limitation. Our experiments proves that the per-device activation memory effectively reduces with the total number of stages, making PP a stronger alternative than TP, offering up to a 19\% acceleration with even lower memory consumption. The implementation is open-sourced at \href{https://github.com/sail-sg/zero-bubble-pipeline-parallelism}{this url}.

### VQ-LLM: High-performance Code Generation for Vector Quantization   Augmented LLM Inference
**Authors**: Zihan Liu, Xinhao Luo, Junxian Guo, Wentao Ni, Yangjie Zhou, Yue Guan, Cong Guo, Weihao Cui, Yu Feng, Minyi Guo, Yuhao Zhu, Minjia Zhang, Jingwen Leng, Chen Jin

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T05:54:40Z

**Summary**: In this work, we design and implement VQ-LLM, an efficient fused Vector Quantization (VQ) kernel generation framework. We first introduce a software abstraction called codebook cache to optimize codebook access efficiency and support the integration of VQ with various computations. The codebook cache adaptively stores different entries across the GPU's memory hierarchy, including off-chip global memory, on-chip shared memory, and registers. Centered around the codebook cache, we design an efficient computation engine that optimizes memory traffic during computations involving codebooks. This compute engine adopts the codebook-centric dataflow and fusion optimizations. Additionally, we provide adaptive heuristics to tailor parameter selection in our optimizations to diverse VQ configurations. Our optimizations achieve an average latency reduction of 46.13% compared to unoptimized versions. Compared to existing open-source implementations, our methods decrease latency by 64.36% to 99.1%. A final comparison with state-of-the-art element-wise quantization methods like AWQ and KVQuant shows that our VQ-LLM is practically viable, achieving latencies close or even better latencies to those at equivalent bit-widths, potentially offering greater accuracy.

### Comparative Analysis of the Code Generated by Popular Large Language   Models (LLMs) for MISRA C++ Compliance
**Authors**: Malik Muhammad Umer

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T05:53:45Z

**Summary**: Safety-critical systems are engineered systems whose failure or malfunction could result in catastrophic consequences. The software development for safety-critical systems necessitates rigorous engineering practices and adherence to certification standards like DO-178C for avionics. DO-178C is a guidance document which requires compliance to well-defined software coding standards like MISRA C++ to enforce coding guidelines that prevent the use of ambiguous, unsafe, or undefined constructs. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in automatic code generation across a wide range of programming languages, including C++. Despite their impressive performance, code generated by LLMs in safety-critical domains must be carefully analyzed for conformance to MISRA C++ coding standards. In this paper, I have conducted a comparative analysis of the C++ code generated by popular LLMs including: OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Meta AI, and Microsoft Copilot for compliance with MISRA C++.

### Object Retrieval for Visual Question Answering with Outside Knowledge
**Authors**: Shichao Kan, Yuhai Deng, Jiale Fu, Lihui Cen, Zhe Qu, Linna Zhang, Yixiong Liang, Yigang Cen

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T05:35:42Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) plays a crucial role in question answering, as LLMs possess limited knowledge and are not updated with continuously growing information. Most recent work on RAG has focused primarily on text-based or large-image retrieval, which constrains the broader application of RAG models. We recognize that object-level retrieval is essential for addressing questions that extend beyond image content. To tackle this issue, we propose a task of object retrieval for visual question answering with outside knowledge (OR-OK-VQA), aimed to extend image-based content understanding in conjunction with LLMs. A key challenge in this task is retrieving diverse objects-related images that contribute to answering the questions. To enable accurate and robust general object retrieval, it is necessary to learn embeddings for local objects. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised deep feature embedding technique called multi-scale group collaborative embedding learning (MS-GCEL), developed to learn embeddings for long-tailed objects at different scales. Additionally, we establish an OK-VQA evaluation benchmark using images from the BelgaLogos, Visual Genome, and LVIS datasets. Prior to the OK-VQA evaluation, we construct a benchmark of challenges utilizing objects extracted from the COCO 2017 and VOC 2007 datasets to support the training and evaluation of general object retrieval models. Our evaluations on both general object retrieval and OK-VQA demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The code and dataset will be publicly released for future research.

### Calibrating DRAMPower Model for HPC: A Runtime Perspective from   Real-Time Measurements
**Authors**: Xinyu Shi, Dina Ali Abdelhamid, Thomas Ilsche, Saeideh Alinezhad Chamazcoti, Timon Evenblij, Mohit Gupta, Francky Catthoor

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T05:35:14Z

**Summary**: Main memory's rising energy consumption has emerged as a critical challenge in modern computing architectures, particularly in large-scale systems, driven by frequent access patterns, growing data volumes, and insufficient power management strategies. Accurate modeling of DRAM power consumption is essential to address this challenge and optimize energy efficiency. However, existing modeling tools often rely on vendor-provided datasheet values that are obtained under worst-case or idealized conditions. As a result, they fail to capture important system-level factors, such as temperature variations, chip aging, and workload-induced variability, which leads to significant discrepancies between estimated and actual power consumption observed in real deployments. In this work, we propose a runtime calibration methodology for the DRAMPower model using energy measurements collected from real-system experiments. By applying custom memory benchmarks on an HPC cluster and leveraging fine-grained power monitoring infrastructure, we refine key current parameters (IDD values) in the model. Our calibration reduces the average energy estimation error to less than 5%, substantially improving modeling accuracy and making DRAMPower a more reliable tool for power-aware system design and optimization on the target server platform.

### On Recipe Memorization and Creativity in Large Language Models: Is Your   Model a Creative Cook, a Bad Cook, or Merely a Plagiator?
**Authors**: Jan Kvapil, Martin Fajcik

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T05:27:11Z

**Summary**: This work-in-progress investigates the memorization, creativity, and nonsense found in cooking recipes generated from Large Language Models (LLMs). Precisely, we aim (i) to analyze memorization, creativity, and non-sense in LLMs using a small, high-quality set of human judgments and (ii) to evaluate potential approaches to automate such a human annotation in order to scale our study to hundreds of recipes. To achieve (i), we conduct a detailed human annotation on 20 preselected recipes generated by LLM (Mixtral), extracting each recipe's ingredients and step-by-step actions to assess which elements are memorized--i.e., directly traceable to online sources possibly seen during training--and which arise from genuine creative synthesis or outright nonsense. We find that Mixtral consistently reuses ingredients that can be found in online documents, potentially seen during model training, suggesting strong reliance on memorized content. To achieve aim (ii) and scale our analysis beyond small sample sizes and single LLM validation, we design an ``LLM-as-judge'' pipeline that automates recipe generation, nonsense detection, parsing ingredients and recipe steps, and their annotation. For instance, comparing its output against human annotations, the best ingredient extractor and annotator is Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B, achieving up to 78% accuracy on ingredient matching. This automated framework enables large-scale quantification of memorization, creativity, and nonsense in generated recipes, providing rigorous evidence of the models' creative capacities.

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T05:21:58Z

**Summary**: The growing context lengths of large language models (LLMs) pose significant challenges for efficient inference, primarily due to GPU memory and bandwidth constraints. We present RetroInfer, a novel system that reconceptualizes the key-value (KV) cache as a vector storage system which exploits the inherent attention sparsity to accelerate long-context LLM inference. At its core is the wave index, an Attention-aWare VEctor index that enables efficient and accurate retrieval of critical tokens through techniques such as tripartite attention approximation, accuracy-bounded attention estimation, and segmented clustering. Complementing this is the wave buffer, which coordinates KV cache placement and overlaps computation and data transfer across GPU and CPU to sustain high throughput. Unlike prior sparsity-based methods that struggle with token selection and hardware coordination, RetroInfer delivers robust performance without compromising model accuracy. Experiments on long-context benchmarks show up to 4.5X speedup over full attention within GPU memory limits and up to 10.5X over sparse attention baselines when KV cache is extended to CPU memory, all while preserving full-attention-level accuracy.

### Bridging Subjective and Objective QoE: Operator-Level Aggregation Using   LLM-Based Comment Analysis and Network MOS Comparison
**Authors**: Parsa Hassani Shariat Panahi, Amir Hossein Jalilvand, M. Hassan Najafi

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T05:21:31Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a dual-layer framework for network operator-side quality of experience (QoE) assessment that integrates both objective network modeling and subjective user perception extracted from live-streaming platforms. On the objective side, we develop a machine learning model trained on mean opinion scores (MOS) computed via the ITU-T P.1203 reference implementation, allowing accurate prediction of user-perceived video quality using only network parameters such as packet loss, delay, jitter, and throughput without reliance on video content or client-side instrumentation. On the subjective side, we present a semantic filtering and scoring pipeline that processes user comments from live streams to extract performance-related feedback. A large language model is used to assign scalar MOS scores to filtered comments in a deterministic and reproducible manner. To support scalable and interpretable analysis, we construct a labeled dataset of 47,894 live-stream comments, of which about 34,000 are identified as QoE-relevant through multi-layer semantic filtering. Each comment is enriched with simulated Internet Service Provider attribution and temporally aligned using synthetic timestamps in 5-min intervals. The resulting dataset enables operator-level aggregation and time-series analysis of user-perceived quality. A delta MOS metric is proposed to measure each Internet service provider's deviation from platform-wide sentiment, allowing detection of localized degradations even in the absence of direct network telemetry. A controlled outage simulation confirms the framework's effectiveness in identifying service disruptions through comment-based trends alone. The system provides each operator with its own subjective MOS and the global platform average per interval, enabling real-time interpretation of performance deviations and comparison with objective network-based QoE estimates.

### Progressive Binarization with Semi-Structured Pruning for LLMs
**Authors**: Xianglong Yan, Tianao Zhang, Zhiteng Li, Yulun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T05:16:02Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing, but their high computational and memory costs hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. Binarization, which reduces model weights to 1 bit, is a promising solution for efficient inference. However, binarized LLMs still exhibit redundancy that can be further compressed. Semi-structured pruning offers a favorable trade-off between model performance and hardware efficiency, but naively combining it with binarization often leads to severe performance degradation. To address this, we propose Progressive Binarization with Semi-Structured Pruning (PBS$^2$P), a novel post-training compression framework. We propose Stepwise semi-structured Pruning with Binarization Optimization (SPBO) to jointly reduce pruning and binarization error. Additionally, we develop a Coarse-to-Fine Search (CFS) strategy to more effectively select pruning elements. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families show that PBS$^2$P consistently outperforms state-of-the-art binary post-training quantization methods in both perplexity and downstream accuracy. The code and models will be available at: https://github.com/XIANGLONGYAN/PBS2P.

### ChemActor: Enhancing Automated Extraction of Chemical Synthesis Actions   with LLM-Generated Data
**Authors**: Yu Zhang, Ruijie Yu, Jidong Tian, Feng Zhu, Jiapeng Liu, Xiaokang Yang, Yaohui Jin, Yanyan Xu

**Updated**: 2025-07-01T08:11:18Z

**Summary**: With the increasing interest in robotic synthesis in the context of organic chemistry, the automated extraction of chemical procedures from literature is critical. However, this task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of chemical language and the high cost of human annotation required for developing reliable computer-aided extraction protocols. Here, we present ChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical executor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured action sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to address the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data. This framework integrates a data selection module that selects data based on distribution divergence, with a general-purpose LLM, to generate machine-executable actions from a single molecule input. Additionally, we introduce a novel multi-round LLMs circle review metric, which reflects the model's advanced understanding of chemical experimental procedures. Extensive experiments on reaction-to-description (R2D) and description-to-action (D2A) tasks demonstrate that ChemActor, augmented by LLM-generated data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by 10%. The code is available at: https://github.com/Zhanghahah/ChemActor.

### Gumiho: A Hybrid Architecture to Prioritize Early Tokens in Speculative   Decoding
**Authors**: Jinze Li, Yixing Xu, Haiduo Huang, Xuanwu Yin, Dong Li, Edith C. H. Ngai, Emad Barsoum

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T04:51:00Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding (SPD) aims to accelerate the auto-regressive token generation process of a target Large Language Model (LLM). Some approaches employ a draft model with multiple heads to predict a sequence of future tokens, where each head handles a token in the sequence. The target LLM verifies the predicted sequence and accepts aligned tokens, enabling efficient multi-token generation. However, existing methods assume that all tokens within a sequence are equally important, employing identical head structures and relying on a single-generation paradigm, either serial or parallel. To this end, we theoretically demonstrate that initial tokens in the draft sequence are more important than later ones. Building on this insight, we propose Gumiho, a hybrid model combining serial and parallel heads. Specifically, given the critical importance of early tokens, we employ a sophisticated Transformer architecture for the early draft heads in a serial configuration to improve accuracy. For later tokens, we utilize multiple lightweight MLP heads operating in parallel to enhance efficiency. By allocating more advanced model structures and longer running times to the early heads, Gumiho achieves improved overall performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, fully validating its effectiveness.

### Achieving binary weight and activation for LLMs using Post-Training   Quantization
**Authors**: Siqing Song, Chuang Wang, Ruiqi Wang, Yi Yang, Xu-Yao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-30T04:32:15Z

**Summary**: Quantizing large language models (LLMs) to 1-bit precision significantly reduces computational costs, but existing quantization techniques suffer from noticeable performance degradation when using weight and activation precisions below 4 bits (W4A4). In this paper, we propose a post-training quantization framework with W(1+1)A(1*4) configuration, where weights are quantized to 1 bit with an additional 1 bit for fine-grain grouping and activations are quantized to 1 bit with a 4-fold increase in the number of channels. For weight quantization, we propose utilizing Hessian-aware fine-grained grouping along with an EM-based quantization scheme. For activation quantization, we decompose INT4-quantized activations into a 4 * INT1 format equivalently and simultaneously smooth the scaling factors based on quantization errors, which further reduces the quantization errors in activations. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM quantization baselines on W2A4 across multiple tasks, pushing the boundaries of existing LLM quantization methods toward fully binarized models.
