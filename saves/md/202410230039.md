**Authors**: Md Tahmidul Alam, Swarnav Mukhopadhyay, Md Mobinul Haque, Shubhra S. Pasayat, Chirag Gupta

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:23:03Z

**Summary**: More than 3 kV breakdown voltage was demonstrated in monolithic bidirectional GaN HEMTs for the first time having potential applications in 1200V or 1700V-class novel power converters. The on resistance of the fabricated transistors was ~20 ohm.mm or ~11 mili ohm.cm^2. Breakdown voltage was optimized by utilizing two field plates in either side of the transistor and optimizing their geometry. Shorter first field plate lengths (less than 2 micron) resulted in higher breakdown voltage and the possible reason for this was discussed. The transistors had a steep subthreshold swing of 92 mV / dec. The on/off ratio was greater than 10^5 and it was limited by the tool capacity. The fabricated 3 kV transistor was benchmarked against the state-of-the-art monolithic bidirectional GaN HEMTs in the performance matrices of breakdown voltage and on resistance, that showed crucial progress.

### MagicPIG: LSH Sampling for Efficient LLM Generation
**Authors**: Zhuoming Chen, Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Zihao Ye, Yang Zhou, Jianyu Zhang, Niklas Nolte, Yuandong Tian, Matthijs Douze, Leon Bottou, Zhihao Jia, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:44:51Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with long context windows have gained significant attention. However, the KV cache, stored to avoid re-computation, becomes a bottleneck. Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself suffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention is not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding throughput by $1.9\sim3.9\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 110ms decoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a context of 96k tokens. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/MagicPIG}.

### Do Large Language Models Need a Content Delivery Network?
**Authors**: Yihua Cheng, Kuntai Du, Jiayi Yao, Junchen Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:59:18Z

**Summary**: As the use of large language models (LLMs) expands rapidly, so does the range of knowledge needed to supplement various LLM queries. Thus, enabling flexible and efficient injection of new knowledge in LLM inference is critical. Three high-level options exist: (i) embedding the knowledge in LLM's weights (i.e., fine-tuning), (ii) including the knowledge as a part of LLM's text input (i.e., in-context learning), or (iii) injecting the KV caches of the new knowledge to LLM during prefill. This paper argues that, although fine-tuning and in-context learning are popular, using KV caches as the medium of knowledge could simultaneously enable more modular management of knowledge injection and more efficient LLM serving with low cost and fast response. To realize these benefits, we envision a Knowledge Delivery Network (KDN), a new system component in LLM services that dynamically optimizes the storage, transfer, and composition of KV cache across LLM engines and other compute and storage resources. We believe that, just like content delivery networks (CDNs), such as Akamai, enabled the success of the Internet ecosystem through their efficient data delivery, KDNs will be critical to the success of LLM applications through their efficient knowledge delivery. We have open-sourced a KDN prototype at https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

### Formalising CXL Cache Coherence
**Authors**: Chengsong Tan, Alastair F. Donaldson, John Wickerson

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T11:29:49Z

**Summary**: We report our experience formally modelling and verifying CXL.cache, the inter-device cache coherence protocol of the Compute Express Link standard. We have used the Isabelle proof assistant to create a formal model for CXL.cache based on the prose English specification. This led to us identifying and proposing fixes to several problems we identified as unclear, ambiguous or inaccurate, some of which could lead to incoherence if left unfixed. Nearly all our issues and proposed fixes have been confirmed and tentatively accepted by the CXL consortium for adoption, save for one which is still under discussion. To validate the faithfulness of our model we performed scenario verification of essential restrictions such as "Snoop-pushes-GO", and produced a fully mechanised proof of a coherence property of the model. The considerable size of this proof, comprising tens of thousands of lemmas, prompted us to develop new proof automation tools, which we have made available for other Isabelle users working with similarly cumbersome proofs.

**Authors**: Tianqing Zhou, Bobo Wang, Dong Qin, Xuefang Nie, Nan Jiang, Chunguo Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T07:24:53Z

**Summary**: Cache-assisted ultra-dense mobile edge computing (MEC) networks are a promising solution for meeting the increasing demands of numerous Internet-of-Things mobile devices (IMDs). To address the complex interferences caused by small base stations (SBSs) deployed densely in such networks, this paper explores the combination of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and base station (BS) clustering. Additionally, security measures are introduced to protect IMDs' tasks offloaded to BSs from potential eavesdropping and malicious attacks. As for such a network framework, a computation offloading scheme is proposed to minimize IMDs' energy consumption while considering constraints such as delay, power, computing resources, and security costs, optimizing channel selections, task execution decisions, device associations, power controls, security service assignments, and computing resource allocations. To solve the formulated problem efficiently, we develop a further improved hierarchical adaptive search (FIHAS) algorithm, giving some insights into its parallel implementation, computation complexity, and convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can achieve lower total energy consumption and delay compared to other algorithms when strict latency and cost constraints are imposed.

### Residual vector quantization for KV cache compression in large language   model
**Authors**: Ankur Kumar

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T07:20:41Z

**Summary**: KV cache compression methods have mainly relied on scalar quantization techniques to reduce the memory requirements during decoding. In this work, we apply residual vector quantization, which has been widely used for high fidelity audio compression, to compress KV cache in large language models (LLM). We adapt the standard recipe with minimal changes to compress the output of any key or value projection matrix in a pretrained LLM: we scale the vector by its standard deviation, divide channels into groups and then quantize each group with the same residual vector quantizer. We learn the codebook using exponential moving average and there are no other learnable parameters including the input and output projections normally used in a vector quantization set up. We find that a residual depth of 8 recovers most of the performance of the unquantized model. We also find that grouping non-contiguous channels together works better than grouping contiguous channels for compressing key matrix and the method further benefits from a light weight finetuning of LLM together with the quantization. Overall, the proposed technique is competitive with existing quantization methods while being much simpler and results in 5.5x compression compared to half precision.

### AlignedKV: Reducing Memory Access of KV-Cache with Precision-Aligned   Quantization
**Authors**: Yifan Tan, Haoze Wang, Chao Yan, Yangdong Deng

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T05:06:01Z

**Summary**: Model quantization has become a crucial technique to address the issues of large memory consumption and long inference times associated with LLMs. Mixed-precision quantization, which distinguishes between important and unimportant parameters, stands out among numerous quantization schemes as it achieves a balance between precision and compression rate. However, existing approaches can only identify important parameters through qualitative analysis and manual experiments without quantitatively analyzing how their importance is determined. We propose a new criterion, so-called 'precision alignment', to build a quantitative framework to holistically evaluate the importance of parameters in mixed-precision quantization. Our observations on floating point addition under various real-world scenarios suggest that two addends should have identical precision, otherwise the information in the higher-precision number will be wasted. Such an observation offers an essential principle to determine the precision of each parameter in matrix multiplication operation. As the first step towards applying the above discovery to large model inference, we develop a dynamic KV-Cache quantization technique to effectively reduce memory access latency. Different from existing quantization approaches that focus on memory saving, this work directly aims to accelerate LLM inference through quantifying floating numbers. The proposed technique attains a 25% saving of memory access and delivers up to 1.3x speedup in the computation of attention in the decoding phase of LLM, with almost no loss of precision.

### WarmSwap: Sharing Dependencies for Accelerating Cold Starts in   Serverless Functions
**Authors**: Rui Li, Devesh Tiwari, Gene Cooperman

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T02:35:08Z

**Summary**: This work presents WarmSwap, a novel provider-side cold-start optimization for serverless computing. This optimization reduces cold-start time when booting and loading dependencies at runtime inside a function container. Previous approaches to the optimization of cold starts tend to fall into two categories: optimizing the infrastructure of serverless computing to benefit all serverless functions; or function-specific tuning for individual serverless functions. In contrast, WarmSwap offers a broad middle ground, which optimizes entire categories of serverless functions. WarmSwap eliminates the need to initialize middleware or software dependencies when launching a new serverless container, by migrating a pre-initialized live dependency image to the new function instance. WarmSwap respects the provider's cache constraints, as a single pre-warmed dependency image in the cache is shared among all serverless functions requiring that software dependency image. WarmSwap has been tested on seven representative functions from FunctionBench. In those tests, WarmSwap accelerates dependency loading for serverless functions with large dependency requirements by a factor ranging from 2.2 to 3.2. Simulation experiments using Azure traces indicate that WarmSwap can save 88\% of optimization space when sharing a dependency image among ten different functions.

### LLC Intra-set Write Balancing
**Authors**: Keshav Krishna, Ayush Verma

**Updated**: 2024-10-20T09:37:07Z

**Summary**: The increasing use of Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) in computer architecture has brought about new challenges, one of which is the write endurance problem. Frequent writes to a particular cache cell in NVM can lead to degradation of the memory cell and reduce its lifespan. To solve this problem, we propose a sample-based blocking technique for the Last Level Cache (LLC). Our approach involves defining a threshold value and sampling a subset of cache sets. If the number of writes to a way in a sampled set exceeds the threshold, the way is blocked, and writes are redirected to other ways. We also maintain a history structure to record the number of writes in a set and a PC-Table to use for blocking in unsampled sets. Based on blocking on sampled sets, variance of values stored in history is used to determine whether blocking had a positive impact or not, and on this basis, value corresponding to instruction pointer is incremented or decremented. This value is later used for blocking in unsampled sets. Our results show that our approach significantly balances write traffic to the cache and improves the overall lifespan of the memory cells while having better performance to the base-line system. Our approach can also be applied to other cache hierarchies and NVM technologies to mitigate the problem of write endurance.

### EPIC: Efficient Position-Independent Context Caching for Serving Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Junhao Hu, Wenrui Huang, Haoyi Wang, Weidong Wang, Tiancheng Hu, Qin Zhang, Hao Feng, Xusheng Chen, Yizhou Shan, Tao Xie

**Updated**: 2024-10-20T08:42:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are critical for a wide range of applications, but serving them efficiently becomes increasingly challenging as inputs become more complex. Context caching improves serving performance by exploiting inter-request dependency and reusing key-value (KV) cache across requests, thus improving time-to-first-token (TTFT). However, existing prefix-based context caching requires exact token prefix matches, limiting cache reuse in few-shot learning, multi-document QA, or retrieval-augmented generation, where prefixes may vary. In this paper, we present EPIC, an LLM serving system that introduces position-independent context caching (PIC), enabling modular KV cache reuse regardless of token chunk position (or prefix). EPIC features two key designs: AttnLink, which leverages static attention sparsity to minimize recomputation for accuracy recovery, and KVSplit, a customizable chunking method that preserves semantic coherence. Our experiments demonstrate that Epic delivers up to 8x improvements in TTFT and 7x throughput over existing systems, with negligible or no accuracy loss. By addressing the limitations of traditional caching approaches, Epic enables more scalable and efficient LLM inference.

### Lossless KV Cache Compression to 2%
**Authors**: Zhen Yang, J. N. Han, Kan Wu, Ruobing Xie, An Wang, Xingwu Sun, Zhanhui Kang

**Updated**: 2024-10-20T02:17:35Z

**Summary**: Large language models have revolutionized data processing in numerous domains, with their ability to handle extended context reasoning receiving notable recognition. To speed up inference, maintaining a key-value (KV) cache memory is essential. Nonetheless, the growing demands for KV cache memory create significant hurdles for efficient implementation. This work introduces a novel architecture, Cross-Layer Latent Attention (CLLA), aimed at compressing the KV cache to less than 2% of its original size while maintaining comparable performance levels. CLLA integrates multiple aspects of KV cache compression, including attention head/dimension reduction, layer sharing, and quantization techniques, into a cohesive framework. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CLLA achieves lossless performance on most tasks while utilizing minimal KV cache, marking a significant advancement in practical KV cache compression.

### Online Paging with Heterogeneous Cache Slots
**Authors**: Marek Chrobak, Samuel Haney, Mehraneh Liaee, Debmalya Panigrahi, Rajmohan Rajaraman, Ravi Sundaram, Neal E. Young

**Updated**: 2024-10-19T12:15:50Z

**Summary**: It is natural to generalize the online $k$-Server problem by allowing each request to specify not only a point $p$, but also a subset $S$ of servers that may serve it. For uniform metrics, the problem is equivalent to a generalization of Paging in which each request specifies not only a page $p$, but also a subset $S$ of cache slots, and is satisfied by having a copy of $p$ in some slot in $S$. We call this problem Slot-Heterogenous Paging.   We parameterize the problem by specifying a family $\mathcal S \subseteq 2^{[k]}$ of requestable slot sets, and we establish bounds on the competitive ratio as a function of the cache size $k$ and family $\mathcal S$:   - If all request sets are allowed ($\mathcal S=2^{[k]}\setminus\{\emptyset\}$), the optimal deterministic and randomized competitive ratios are exponentially worse than for standard \Paging ($\mathcal S=\{[k]\}$).   - As a function of $|\mathcal S|$ and $k$, the optimal deterministic ratio is polynomial: at most $O(k^2|\mathcal S|)$ and at least $\Omega(\sqrt{|\mathcal S|})$.   - For any laminar family $\mathcal S$ of height $h$, the optimal ratios are $O(hk)$ (deterministic) and $O(h^2\log k)$ (randomized).   - The special case of laminar $\mathcal S$ that we call All-or-One Paging extends standard Paging by allowing each request to specify a specific slot to put the requested page in. The optimal deterministic ratio for weighted All-or-One Paging is $\Theta(k)$. Offline All-or-One Paging is NP-hard.   Some results for the laminar case are shown via a reduction to the generalization of Paging in which each request specifies a set $\mathcal P of pages, and is satisfied by fetching any page from $\mathcal P into the cache. The optimal ratios for the latter problem (with laminar family of height $h$) are at most $hk$ (deterministic) and $h\,H_k$ (randomized).

### In-context KV-Cache Eviction for LLMs via Attention-Gate
**Authors**: Zihao Zeng, Bokai Lin, Tianqi Hou, Hao Zhang, Zhijie Deng

**Updated**: 2024-10-19T08:45:11Z

**Summary**: The KV-Cache technique has become the standard for the inference of large language models (LLMs). It caches states of self-attention to avoid recomputation. Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a bottleneck of the LLM inference system, especially when confronted with ultra-large models and long-context queries. A natural remedy is to discard the KV-Cache for less important tokens, with StreamingLLM as an example, but the used static eviction strategies cannot flexibly adapt to varying contexts. Remedies like H2O leverage accumulative attention scores to perform dynamic eviction but suffer from the attention bias issue in capturing contextual information. This paper bridges this gap by devising a parameterized KV-Cache eviction mechanism, dubbed as Attention-Gate, which accepts the whole context as input and yields eviction flags for each token to realize in-context eviction. The subsequent self-attention module proceeds according to the flags and only the KV states for the remaining tokens need to be cached. The Attention-Gates can vary among different heads and layers and be trivially plugged into pre-trained LLMs, tuned by cost-effective continual pre-training or supervised fine-tuning objectives to acquire what to discard. The computational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates is minimal. Our method is validated across multiple tasks, demonstrating both efficiency and adaptability. After a highly efficient continual pre-training, it achieves higher average accuracy and evicts more tokens compared to traditional training-free methods. In supervised fine-tuning, it not only evicts many tokens but also outperforms LoRA-finetuned LLMs on some datasets, such as RTE, where it improves accuracy by 13.9% while evicting 62.8% of tokens, showing that effective eviction of redundant tokens can even enhance performance.

### CSKV: Training-Efficient Channel Shrinking for KV Cache in Long-Context   Scenarios
**Authors**: Luning Wang, Shiyao Li, Xuefei Ning, Zhihang Yuan, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Yu Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-18T19:30:35Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to process long-context tasks. However, the large memory overhead of the key-value (KV) cache poses significant challenges in long-context scenarios. Existing training-free KV cache compression methods typically focus on quantization and token pruning, which have compression limits, and excessive sparsity can lead to severe performance degradation. Other methods design new architectures with less KV overhead but require significant training overhead. To address the above two drawbacks, we further explore the redundancy in the channel dimension and apply an architecture-level design with minor training costs. Therefore, we introduce CSKV, a training-efficient Channel Shrinking technique for KV cache compression: (1) We first analyze the singular value distribution of the KV cache, revealing significant redundancy and compression potential along the channel dimension. Based on this observation, we propose using low-rank decomposition for key and value layers and storing the low-dimension features. (2) To preserve model performance, we introduce a bi-branch KV cache, including a window-based full-precision KV cache and a low-precision compressed KV cache. (3) To reduce the training costs, we minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss for the compressed KV cache instead of retraining the entire LLMs. Extensive experiments show that CSKV can reduce the memory overhead of the KV cache by 80% while maintaining the model's long-context capability. Moreover, we show that our method can be seamlessly combined with quantization to further reduce the memory overhead, achieving a compression ratio of up to 95%.

### Improving Retrieval in Sponsored Search by Leveraging Query Context   Signals
**Authors**: Akash Kumar Mohankumar, Gururaj K, Gagan Madan, Amit Singh

**Updated**: 2024-10-18T13:59:54Z

**Summary**: Accurately retrieving relevant bid keywords for user queries is critical in Sponsored Search but remains challenging, particularly for short, ambiguous queries. Existing dense and generative retrieval models often fail to capture nuanced user intent in these cases. To address this, we propose an approach to enhance query understanding by augmenting queries with rich contextual signals derived from web search results and large language models, stored in an online cache. Specifically, we use web search titles and snippets to ground queries in real-world information and utilize GPT-4 to generate query rewrites and explanations that clarify user intent. These signals are efficiently integrated through a Fusion-in-Decoder based Unity architecture, enabling both dense and generative retrieval with serving costs on par with traditional context-free models. To address scenarios where context is unavailable in the cache, we introduce context glancing, a curriculum learning strategy that improves model robustness and performance even without contextual signals during inference. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that our context-aware approach substantially outperforms context-free models. Furthermore, online A/B testing on a prominent search engine across 160+ countries shows significant improvements in user engagement and revenue.

### A Systematic Study of Cross-Layer KV Sharing for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: You Wu, Haoyi Wu, Kewei Tu

**Updated**: 2024-10-18T13:01:14Z

**Summary**: Recently, sharing key-value (KV) cache across layers has been found effective in efficient inference of large language models (LLMs). To systematically investigate different techniques of cross-layer KV sharing, we propose a unified framework that covers several recent methods and their novel variants. We conduct comprehensive experiments on all the configurations of the framework, evaluating their generation throughput and performance in language modeling and downstream tasks. We find that when reducing the size of the KV cache by 2x, most configurations can achieve competitive performance to and higher throughput than standard transformers, but when further reducing the size of the KV cache, pairing queries of all layers with KVs of upper layers can better maintain performance, although it also introduces additional training cost and prefilling latency. We hope that this work will help users choose the appropriate approach according to their requirements and facilitate research on the acceleration of LLM inference.

### FAME: Towards Factual Multi-Task Model Editing
**Authors**: Li Zeng, Yingyu Shan, Zeming Liu, Jiashu Yao, Yuhang Guo

**Updated**: 2024-10-18T10:02:03Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) embed extensive knowledge and utilize it to perform exceptionally well across various tasks. Nevertheless, outdated knowledge or factual errors within LLMs can lead to misleading or incorrect responses, causing significant issues in practical applications. To rectify the fatal flaw without the necessity for costly model retraining, various model editing approaches have been proposed to correct inaccurate knowledge within LLMs in a cost-efficient way. To evaluate these model editing methods, previous work introduced a series of datasets. However, most of the previous datasets only contain fabricated data in a single format, which diverges from real-world model editing scenarios, raising doubts about their usability in practice. To facilitate the application of model editing in real-world scenarios, we propose the challenge of practicality. To resolve such challenges and effectively enhance the capabilities of LLMs, we present FAME, an factual, comprehensive, and multi-task dataset, which is designed to enhance the practicality of model editing. We then propose SKEME, a model editing method that uses a novel caching mechanism to ensure synchronization with the real world. The experiments demonstrate that SKEME performs excellently across various tasks and scenarios, confirming its practicality.

### Per-Bank Bandwidth Regulation of Shared Last-Level Cache for Real-Time   Systems
**Authors**: Connor Sullivan, Alex Manley, Mohammad Alian, Heechul Yun

**Updated**: 2024-10-17T20:11:34Z

**Summary**: Modern commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) multicore processors have advanced memory hierarchies that enhance memory-level parallelism (MLP), which is crucial for high performance. To support high MLP, shared last-level caches (LLCs) are divided into multiple banks, allowing parallel access. However, uneven distribution of cache requests from the cores, especially when requests from multiple cores are concentrated on a single bank, can result in significant contention affecting all cores that access the cache. Such cache bank contention can even be maliciously induced -- known as cache bank-aware denial-of-service (DoS) attacks -- in order to jeopardize the system's timing predictability.   In this paper, we propose a per-bank bandwidth regulation approach for multi-banked shared LLC based multicore real-time systems. By regulating bandwidth on a per-bank basis, the approach aims to prevent unnecessary throttling of cache accesses to non-contended banks, thus improving overall performance (throughput) without compromising isolation benefits of throttling. We implement our approach on a RISC-V system-on-chip (SoC) platform using FireSim and evaluate extensively using both synthetic and real-world workloads. Our evaluation results show that the proposed per-bank regulation approach effectively protects real-time tasks from co-running cache bank-aware DoS attacks, and offers up to a 3.66$\times$ performance improvement for the throttled benign best-effort tasks compared to prior bank-oblivious bandwidth throttling approaches.

### SimLayerKV: A Simple Framework for Layer-Level KV Cache Reduction
**Authors**: Xuan Zhang, Cunxiao Du, Chao Du, Tianyu Pang, Wei Gao, Min Lin

**Updated**: 2024-10-17T17:58:14Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their capabilities to handle long contexts. However, increasing the number of model layers and the length of input sequences significantly escalates the memory required to store key-value (KV) cache, posing challenges for efficient inference. To mitigate this issue, we present SimLayerKV, a simple yet effective method that reduces inter-layer KV cache redundancies by selectively dropping cache in identified lazy layers. Our approach is based on the observation that certain layers in long-context LLMs exhibit "lazy" behavior, contributing less to modeling long-range dependencies compared to non-lazy layers. By analyzing attention weight patterns, we find that the behavior of these lazy layers is consistent across tokens during generation for a given input. This insight motivates our SimLayerKV, which identifies lazy layers and reduces their KV cache accordingly. SimLayerKV is training-free, generalizable, and can be implemented with only seven lines of code. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative LLMs, e.g., LLaMA2-7B, LLaMA3-8B, and Mistral-7B across 16 tasks from the LongBench benchmark. The results demonstrate that SimLayerKV achieves a KV cache compression ratio of 5$\times$ with only a 1.2% performance drop when combined with 4-bit quantization. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/SimLayerKV.

### Block-Attention for Efficient RAG
**Authors**: East Sun, Yan Wang, Lan Tian

**Updated**: 2024-10-17T15:27:30Z

**Summary**: We introduce Block-Attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Traditional approaches often encode the entire context. Instead, Block-Attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each block independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-Attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during inference. The implementation of Block-Attention involves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-Attention mechanism. Experiments on four RAG benchmarks demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block-Attention model achieves performance comparable to self-attention models (68.4\% vs 67.9\% on Llama3) or even superior performance (62.8\% vs 59.6\% on Mistral). Notably, Block-Attention significantly reduces the time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared to the self-attention models, the time consumption and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7\% and 99.8\%, respectively.

**Authors**: Sijun Tan, Xiuyu Li, Shishir Patil, Ziyang Wu, Tianjun Zhang, Kurt Keutzer, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Raluca Ada Popa

**Updated**: 2024-10-17T08:54:37Z

**Summary**: Processing long contexts remains a challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the quadratic computational and memory overhead of the self-attention mechanism and the substantial KV cache sizes during generation. We propose LLoCO, a novel approach to address this problem by learning contexts offline through context compression and in-domain parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA. Our method enables an LLM to create a concise representation of the original context and efficiently retrieve relevant information to answer questions accurately. Our approach extends the effective context window of a 4k token LLaMA2-7B model to handle up to 128k tokens. We evaluate our approach on several long-context question-answering datasets, demonstrating that LLoCO significantly outperforms in-context learning while using $30\times$ fewer tokens during inference. LLoCO achieves up to $7.62\times$ speed-up during inference and $11.52\times$ higher throughput during finetuning, substantially reduces the cost of long document question answering. This makes it a promising solution for efficient long context processing. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/jeffreysijuntan/lloco.

### Harnessing Your DRAM and SSD for Sustainable and Accessible LLM   Inference with Mixed-Precision and Multi-level Caching
**Authors**: Jie Peng, Zhang Cao, Huaizhi Qu, Zhengyu Zhang, Chang Guo, Yanyong Zhang, Zhichao Zhang, Tianlong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-17T08:33:39Z

**Summary**: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, their massive parameter counts and associated extensive computing make LLMs' deployment the main part of carbon emission from nowadays AI applications. Compared to modern GPUs like H$100$, it would be significantly carbon-sustainable if we could leverage old-fashioned GPUs such as M$40$ (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tisser}, M$40$ only has one third carbon emission of H$100$'s) for LLM servings. However, the limited High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) available on such GPU often cannot support the loading of LLMs due to the gigantic model size and intermediate activation data, making their serving challenging. For instance, a LLaMA2 model with $70$B parameters typically requires $128$GB for inference, which substantially surpasses $24$GB HBM in a $3090$ GPU and remains infeasible even considering the additional $64$GB DRAM. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a mixed-precision with a model modularization algorithm to enable LLM inference on outdated hardware with resource constraints. (The precision denotes the numerical precision like FP16, INT8, INT4) and multi-level caching (M2Cache).)   Specifically, our M2Cache first modulizes neurons in LLM and creates their importance ranking. Then, it adopts a dynamic sparse mixed-precision quantization mechanism in weight space to reduce computational demands and communication overhead at each decoding step. It collectively lowers the operational carbon emissions associated with LLM inference. Moreover, M2Cache introduces a three-level cache management system with HBM, DRAM, and SSDs that complements the dynamic sparse mixed-precision inference. To enhance communication efficiency, M2Cache maintains a neuron-level mixed-precision LRU cache in HBM, a larger layer-aware cache in DRAM, and a full model in SSD.

### AsymKV: Enabling 1-Bit Quantization of KV Cache with Layer-Wise   Asymmetric Quantization Configurations
**Authors**: Qian Tao, Wenyuan Yu, Jingren Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-10-17T04:35:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models have shown exceptional capabilities in a wide range of tasks, such as text generation and video generation, among others. However, due to their massive parameter count, these models often require substantial storage space, imposing significant constraints on the machines deploying LLMs. To overcome this limitation, one research direction proposes to compress the models using integer replacements for floating-point numbers, in a process known as Quantization. Some recent studies suggest quantizing the key and value cache (KV Cache) of LLMs, and designing quantization techniques that treat the key and value matrices equivalently.   This work delves deeper into the asymmetric structural roles of KV Cache, a phenomenon where the transformer's output loss is more sensitive to the quantization of key matrices. We conduct a systematic examination of the attention output error resulting from key and value quantization. The phenomenon inspires us to propose an asymmetric quantization strategy. Our approach allows for 1-bit quantization of the KV cache by implementing distinct configurations for key and value matrices. We carry out experiments across a variety of datasets, demonstrating that our proposed model allows for the quantization of up to 75% decoder layers with 1 bit, while simultaneously maintaining performance levels comparable to those of the models with floating parameters.

### cedar: Optimized and Unified Machine Learning Input Data Pipelines
**Authors**: Mark Zhao, Emanuel Adamiak, Christos Kozyrakis

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T17:54:15Z

**Summary**: The input data pipeline is an essential component of each machine learning (ML) training job. It is responsible for reading massive amounts of training data, processing batches of samples using complex transformations, and loading them onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant input data systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing data volumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data systems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in hugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources - or worse - underutilize expensive accelerators.   To address these demands, we present cedar, an optimized and unified programming framework for ML input data pipelines. cedar allows users to define input data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML frameworks and libraries. cedar introduces an extensible optimizer that systematically applies a complex combination of optimizations (e.g., offloading, caching, prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It orchestrates processing across a customizable set of local and distributed compute resources in order to improve processing performance and efficiency, all without user input. Across eight pipelines, cedar improves performance by up to 1.87x to 10.65x compared to state-of-the-art input data systems.

### Toleo: Scaling Freshness to Tera-scale Memory using CXL and PIM
**Authors**: Juechu Dong, Jonah Rosenblum, Satish Narayanasamy

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T17:10:48Z

**Summary**: Trusted hardware's freshness guarantee ensures that an adversary cannot replay an old value in response to a memory read request. They rely on maintaining a version number for each cache block and ensuring their integrity using a Merkle tree. However, these existing solutions protect only a small amount of main memory (few MBs), as the extraneous memory accesses to the Merkle tree increase prohibitively with the protected memory size. We present Toleo, which uses trusted smart memory connected through a secure CXL IDE network to safely store version numbers. Toleo eliminates the need for an unscalable Merkle tree to protect the integrity of version numbers by instead using smart memory as the root of trust. Additionally, Toleo ensures version confidentiality which enables stealth versions that reduce the version storage overhead in half.   Furthermore, in the absence of Merkle tree imposed constraints, we effectively exploit version locality at page granularity to compress version number by a factor of 240. These space optimizations make it feasible for one 168 GB Toleo smart memory device to provide freshness to a 28 TB CXL-expanded main memory pool in a rack server for a negligible performance overhead. We analyze the benefits of Toleo using several privacy-sensitive genomics, graph, generative AI, and database workloads.

### Advancing Web Browser Forensics: Critical Evaluation of Emerging Tools   and Techniques
**Authors**: Rishal Ravikesh Chand, Neeraj Anand Sharma, Muhammad Ashad Kabir

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:24:16Z

**Summary**: As the use of web browsers continues to grow, the potential for cybercrime and web-related criminal activities also increases. Digital forensic investigators must understand how different browsers function and the critical areas to consider during web forensic analysis. Web forensics, a subfield of digital forensics, involves collecting and analyzing browser artifacts, such as browser history, search keywords, and downloads, which serve as potential evidence. While existing research has provided valuable insights, many studies focus on individual browsing modes or limited forensic scenarios, leaving gaps in understanding the full scope of data retention and recovery across different modes and browsers. This paper addresses these gaps by defining four browsing scenarios and critically analyzing browser artifacts across normal, private, and portable modes using various forensic tools. We define four browsing scenarios to perform a comprehensive evaluation of popular browsers -- Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Brave, Tor, and Microsoft Edge -- by monitoring changes in key data storage areas such as cache files, cookies, browsing history, and local storage across different browsing modes. Overall, this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of browser forensic analysis and identifies key areas for enhancing privacy protection and forensic methodologies.

### FiRST: Finetuning Router-Selective Transformers for Input-Adaptive   Latency Reduction
**Authors**: Akriti Jain, Saransh Sharma, Koyel Mukherjee, Soumyabrata Pal

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:45:35Z

**Summary**: Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across domanins such as vision and language processing. However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FIRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FIRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FIRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. We further improve performance by incorporating LoRA adapters for fine-tuning on external datasets, enhancing task-specific accuracy while maintaining latency benefits. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on task. Extensive experiments show that FIRST significantly reduces latency while retaining competitive performance (as compared to baselines), making our approach an efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.

### An O(m+n)-Space Spatiotemporal Denoising Filter with Cache-Like Memories   for Dynamic Vision Sensors
**Authors**: Qinghang Zhao, Jiaqi Wang, Yixi Ji, Jinjian Wu, Guangming Shi

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:06:22Z

**Summary**: Dynamic vision sensor (DVS) is novel neuromorphic imaging device that generates asynchronous events. Despite the high temporal resolution and high dynamic range features, DVS is faced with background noise problem. Spatiotemporal filter is an effective and hardware-friendly solution for DVS denoising but previous designs have large memory overhead or degraded performance issues. In this paper, we present a lightweight and real-time spatiotemporal denoising filter with set-associative cache-like memories, which has low space complexity of \text{O(m+n)} for DVS of $m\times n$ resolution. A two-stage pipeline for memory access with read cancellation feature is proposed to reduce power consumption. Further the bitwidth redundancy for event storage is exploited to minimize the memory footprint. We implemented our design on FPGA and experimental results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with previous spatiotemporal filters while maintaining low resource utilization and low power consumption of about 125mW to 210mW at 100MHz clock frequency.

### MatryoshkaKV: Adaptive KV Compression via Trainable Orthogonal   Projection
**Authors**: Bokai Lin, Zihao Zeng, Zipeng Xiao, Siqi Kou, Tianqi Hou, Xiaofeng Gao, Hao Zhang, Zhijie Deng

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T08:34:51Z

**Summary**: KV cache has become a de facto technique for the inference of large language models (LLMs), where tensors of shape (layer number, head number, sequence length, feature dimension) are introduced to cache historical information for self-attention. As the size of the model and data grows, the KV cache can quickly become a bottleneck within the system in both storage and memory transfer. To address this, prior studies usually focus on the first three axes of the cache tensors for compression. This paper supplements them, focusing on the feature dimension axis, by utilizing low-rank projection matrices to transform the cache features into spaces with reduced dimensions. We begin by investigating the canonical orthogonal projection method for data compression through principal component analysis (PCA). We observe the issue with PCA projection where significant performance degradation is observed at low compression rates. To bridge the gap, we propose to directly tune the orthogonal projection matrices with a distillation objective using an elaborate Matryoshka training strategy. After training, we adaptively search for the optimal compression rates for various layers and heads given varying compression budgets. Compared to previous works, our method can easily embrace pre-trained LLMs and hold a smooth tradeoff between performance and compression rate. We empirically witness the high data efficiency of our training procedure and find that our method can sustain over 90% performance with an average KV cache compression rate of 60% (and up to 75% in certain extreme scenarios) for popular LLMs like LLaMA2-7B-base and Mistral-7B-v0.3-base.

### COMET: Towards Partical W4A4KV4 LLMs Serving
**Authors**: Lian Liu, Haimeng Ren, Long Cheng, Zhaohui Xu, Yudong Pan, Mengdi Wang, Xiaowei Li, Yinhe Han, Ying Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T02:16:53Z

**Summary**: Quantization is a widely-used compression technology to reduce the overhead of serving large language models (LLMs) on terminal devices and in cloud data centers. However, prevalent quantization methods, such as 8-bit weight-activation or 4-bit weight-only quantization, achieve limited performance improvements due to poor support for low-precision (e.g., 4-bit) activation. This work, for the first time, realizes practical W4A4KV4 serving for LLMs, fully utilizing the INT4 tensor cores on modern GPUs and reducing the memory bottleneck caused by the KV cache. Specifically, we propose a novel fine-grained mixed-precision quantization algorithm (FMPQ) that compresses most activations into 4-bit with negligible accuracy loss. To support mixed-precision matrix multiplication for W4A4 and W4A8, we develop a highly optimized W4Ax kernel. Our approach introduces a novel mixed-precision data layout to facilitate access and fast dequantization for activation and weight tensors, utilizing the GPU's software pipeline to hide the overhead of data loading and conversion. Additionally, we propose fine-grained streaming multiprocessor (SM) scheduling to achieve load balance across different SMs. We integrate the optimized W4Ax kernel into our inference framework, COMET, and provide efficient management to support popular LLMs such as LLaMA-3-70B. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that, when running LLaMA family models on a single A100-80G-SMX4, COMET achieves a kernel-level speedup of \textbf{$2.88\times$} over cuBLAS and a \textbf{$2.02 \times$} throughput improvement compared to TensorRT-LLM from an end-to-end framework perspective.

### Mitigate Position Bias in Large Language Models via Scaling a Single   Dimension
**Authors**: Yijiong Yu, Huiqiang Jiang, Xufang Luo, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Dongsheng Li, Yuqing Yang, Yongfeng Huang, Lili Qiu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:58:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various real-world scenarios due to their excellent generalization capabilities and robust generative abilities. However, they exhibit position bias, also known as "lost in the middle", a phenomenon that is especially pronounced in long-context scenarios, which indicates the placement of the key information in different positions of a prompt can significantly affect accuracy. This paper first explores the micro-level manifestations of position bias, concluding that attention weights are a micro-level expression of position bias. It further identifies that, in addition to position embeddings, causal attention mask also contributes to position bias by creating position-specific hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose a method to mitigate position bias by scaling this positional hidden states. Experiments on the NaturalQuestions Multi-document QA, KV retrieval, LongBench and timeline reorder tasks, using various models including RoPE models, context windowextended models, and Alibi models, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach. Our method can improve performance by up to 15.2% by modifying just one dimension of hidden states. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/PositionalHidden.

### VidCompress: Memory-Enhanced Temporal Compression for Video   Understanding in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Xiaohan Lan, Yitian Yuan, Zequn Jie, Lin Ma

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T09:07:25Z

**Summary**: Video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) possess significant potential for video understanding tasks. However, most Video-LLMs treat videos as a sequential set of individual frames, which results in insufficient temporal-spatial interaction that hinders fine-grained comprehension and difficulty in processing longer videos due to limited visual token capacity. To address these challenges, we propose VidCompress, a novel Video-LLM featuring memory-enhanced temporal compression. VidCompress employs a dual-compressor approach: a memory-enhanced compressor captures both short-term and long-term temporal relationships in videos and compresses the visual tokens using a multiscale transformer with a memory-cache mechanism, while a text-perceived compressor generates condensed visual tokens by utilizing Q-Former and integrating temporal contexts into query embeddings with cross attention. Experiments on several VideoQA datasets and comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that VidCompress efficiently models complex temporal-spatial relations and significantly outperforms existing Video-LLMs.

**Authors**: Zayd Muhammad Kawakibi Zuhri, Muhammad Farid Adilazuarda, Ayu Purwarianti, Alham Fikri Aji

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T08:45:18Z

**Summary**: Auto-regressive inference of transformers benefit greatly from Key-Value (KV) caching, but can lead to major memory bottlenecks as model size, batch size, and sequence length grow at scale. We introduce Multi-Layer Key-Value (MLKV) sharing, a novel approach extending KV sharing across transformer layers to reduce memory usage beyond what was possible with Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA). Evaluations on various NLP benchmarks and inference metrics using uptrained Pythia-160M variants demonstrate that MLKV significantly reduces memory usage with minimal performance loss, reducing KV cache size down to a factor of 6x compared to MQA. These results highlight MLKV's potential for efficient deployment of transformer models at scale. We provide code at https://github.com/zaydzuhri/pythia-mlkv

### A Training-free Sub-quadratic Cost Transformer Model Serving Framework   With Hierarchically Pruned Attention
**Authors**: Heejun Lee, Geon Park, Youngwan Lee, Jaduk Suh, Jina Kim, Wonyoung Jeong, Bumsik Kim, Hyemin Lee, Myeongjae Jeon, Sung Ju Hwang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T06:09:35Z

**Summary**: In modern large language models (LLMs), increasing the context length is crucial for improving comprehension and coherence in long-context, multi-modal, and retrieval-augmented language generation. While many recent transformer models attempt to extend their context length over a million tokens, they remain impractical due to the quadratic time and space complexities. Although recent works on linear and sparse attention mechanisms can achieve this goal, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train from scratch and significantly worse performance. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which reduces the time complexity of the attention mechanism to $O(T \log T)$ and the space complexity to $O(T)$, where $T$ is the sequence length. We notice a pattern in the attention scores of pretrained LLMs where tokens close together tend to have similar scores, which we call ``attention locality''. Based on this observation, we utilize a novel tree-search-like algorithm that estimates the top-$k$ key tokens for a given query on the fly, which is mathematically guaranteed to have better performance than random attention pruning. In addition to improving the time complexity of the attention mechanism, we further optimize GPU memory usage by implementing KV cache offloading, which stores only $O(\log T)$ tokens on the GPU while maintaining similar decoding throughput. Experiments on benchmarks show that HiP, with its training-free nature, significantly reduces both prefill and decoding latencies, as well as memory usage, while maintaining high-quality generation with minimal degradation. HiP enables pretrained LLMs to scale up to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs, potentially unlocking long-context LLM applications previously deemed infeasible.

### QSpec: Speculative Decoding with Complementary Quantization Schemes
**Authors**: Juntao Zhao, Wenhao Lu, Sheng Wang, Lingpeng Kong, Chuan Wu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T05:57:51Z

**Summary**: Quantization has been substantially adopted to accelerate inference and reduce memory consumption of large language models (LLMs). While activation-weight joint quantization speeds up the inference process through low-precision kernels, we demonstrate that it suffers severe performance degradation on multi-step reasoning tasks, rendering it ineffective. We propose a novel quantization paradigm called QSPEC, which seamlessly integrates two complementary quantization schemes for speculative decoding. Leveraging nearly cost-free execution switching, QSPEC drafts tokens with low-precision, fast activation-weight quantization, and verifies them with high-precision weight-only quantization, effectively combining the strengths of both quantization schemes. Compared to high-precision quantization methods, QSPEC empirically boosts token generation throughput by up to 1.80x without any quality compromise, distinguishing it from other low-precision quantization approaches. This enhancement is also consistent across various serving tasks, model sizes, quantization methods, and batch sizes. Unlike existing speculative decoding techniques, our approach reuses weights and the KV cache, avoiding additional memory overhead. Furthermore, QSPEC offers a plug-and-play advantage without requiring any training. We believe that QSPEC demonstrates unique strengths for future deployment of high-fidelity quantization schemes, particularly in memory-constrained scenarios (e.g., edge devices).

### Recommenadation aided Caching using Combinatorial Multi-armed Bandits
**Authors**: Pavamana K J, Chandramani Kishore Singh

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T05:34:07Z

**Summary**: We study content caching with recommendations in a wireless network where the users are connected through a base station equipped with a finite-capacity cache. We assume a fixed set of contents with unknown user preferences and content popularities. The base station can cache a subset of the contents and can also recommend subsets of the contents to different users in order to encourage them to request the recommended contents. Recommendations, depending on their acceptability, can thus be used to increase cache hits. We first assume that the users' recommendation acceptabilities are known and formulate the cache hit optimization problem as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB). We propose a UCB-based algorithm to decide which contents to cache and recommend and provide an upper bound on the regret of this algorithm. Subsequently, we consider a more general scenario where the users' recommendation acceptabilities are also unknown and propose another UCB-based algorithm that learns these as well. We numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithms and compare these to state-of-the-art algorithms.

### A Zoned Storage Optimized Flash Cache on ZNS SSDs
**Authors**: Chongzhuo Yang, Chang Guo, Ming Zhao, Zhichao Cao

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T04:35:49Z

**Summary**: Zoned Namespace SSDs (ZNS) are introduced recently to mitigate the block interface penalties of flash-based SSDs. It is a good opportunity for flash cache to address cache throughput and write amplification (WA) issues by fully controlling data allocation and garbage collection via zone-based interfaces. However, there are several critical challenges that need to be addressed including zone-interface compatibility, data management of large zone size, and a better tradeoff between throughput, cache hit ratio, and WA.   In this paper, we present Z-CacheLib, a zoned storage optimized flash cache on ZNS SSDs. In Z-CacheLib, we propose: 1) a new zStorage Engine for ZNS SSDs with low mapping and operational overhead, and 2) a novel zCache Engine with cross-layer optimizations to resolve the throughput regression and WA issues of garbage collection, which consists of delayed data eviction with virtual over-provisioning (vOP), a top-down eviction policy (zLRU) optimized from LRU, and a bottom-up drop mechanism (zDrop) for low WA. Our evaluation shows that Z-CacheLib can achieve up to 2X throughput, 5% improvement hit ratio, and almost no WA compared to CacheLib with compatible regular SSDs, demonstrating benefits of using ZNS SSDs for cache. Moreover, Z-CacheLib can achieve up to 6X throughput and 92% WA reduction compared with F2FS-based scheme.

### Enhancing High-Level Synthesis with Automated Pragma Insertion and Code   Transformation Framework
**Authors**: Stéphane Pouget, Louis-Noël Pouchet, Jason Cong

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T19:12:48Z

**Summary**: High-level synthesis, source-to-source compilers, and various Design Space Exploration techniques for pragma insertion have significantly improved the Quality of Results of generated designs. These tools offer benefits such as reduced development time and enhanced performance. However, achieving high-quality results often requires additional manual code transformations and tiling selections, which are typically performed separately or as pre-processing steps. Although DSE techniques enable code transformation upfront, the vastness of the search space often limits the exploration of all possible code transformations, making it challenging to determine which transformations are necessary. Additionally, ensuring correctness remains challenging, especially for complex transformations and optimizations.   To tackle this obstacle, we first propose a comprehensive framework leveraging HLS compilers. Our system streamlines code transformation, pragma insertion, and tiles size selection for on-chip data caching through a unified optimization problem, aiming to enhance parallelization, particularly beneficial for computation-bound kernels. Them employing a novel Non-Linear Programming (NLP) approach, we simultaneously ascertain transformations, pragmas, and tile sizes, focusing on regular loop-based kernels. Our evaluation demonstrates that our framework adeptly identifies the appropriate transformations, including scenarios where no transformation is necessary, and inserts pragmas to achieve a favorable Quality of Results.

### DuoAttention: Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference with Retrieval and   Streaming Heads
**Authors**: Guangxuan Xiao, Jiaming Tang, Jingwei Zuo, Junxian Guo, Shang Yang, Haotian Tang, Yao Fu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T17:59:58Z

**Summary**: Deploying long-context large language models (LLMs) is essential but poses significant computational and memory challenges. Caching all Key and Value (KV) states across all attention heads consumes substantial memory. Existing KV cache pruning methods either damage the long-context capabilities of LLMs or offer only limited efficiency improvements. In this paper, we identify that only a fraction of attention heads, a.k.a, Retrieval Heads, are critical for processing long contexts and require full attention across all tokens. In contrast, all other heads, which primarily focus on recent tokens and attention sinks--referred to as Streaming Heads--do not require full attention. Based on this insight, we introduce DuoAttention, a framework that only applies a full KV cache to retrieval heads while using a light-weight, constant-length KV cache for streaming heads, which reduces both LLM's decoding and pre-filling memory and latency without compromising its long-context abilities. DuoAttention uses a lightweight, optimization-based algorithm with synthetic data to identify retrieval heads accurately. Our method significantly reduces long-context inference memory by up to 2.55x for MHA and 1.67x for GQA models while speeding up decoding by up to 2.18x and 1.50x and accelerating pre-filling by up to 1.73x and 1.63x for MHA and GQA models, respectively, with minimal accuracy loss compared to full attention. Notably, combined with quantization, DuoAttention enables Llama-3-8B decoding with 3.3 million context length on a single A100 GPU. Code is provided in https://github.com/mit-han-lab/duo-attention.

### When Attention Sink Emerges in Language Models: An Empirical View
**Authors**: Xiangming Gu, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Qian Liu, Fengzhuo Zhang, Cunxiao Du, Ye Wang, Min Lin

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T17:50:28Z

**Summary**: Language Models (LMs) assign significant attention to the first token, even if it is not semantically important, which is known as attention sink. This phenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long context generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model quantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of attention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that attention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small models. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM pre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution, loss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its emergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective optimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly correlated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we find that attention sink acts more like key biases, storing extra attention scores, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value computation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems from tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax normalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention with other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without normalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Attention-Sink.

### Customize Your Visual Autoregressive Recipe with Set Autoregressive   Modeling
**Authors**: Wenze Liu, Le Zhuo, Yi Xin, Sheng Xia, Peng Gao, Xiangyu Yue

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T13:49:06Z

**Summary**: We introduce a new paradigm for AutoRegressive (AR) image generation, termed Set AutoRegressive Modeling (SAR). SAR generalizes the conventional AR to the next-set setting, i.e., splitting the sequence into arbitrary sets containing multiple tokens, rather than outputting each token in a fixed raster order. To accommodate SAR, we develop a straightforward architecture termed Fully Masked Transformer. We reveal that existing AR variants correspond to specific design choices of sequence order and output intervals within the SAR framework, with AR and Masked AR (MAR) as two extreme instances. Notably, SAR facilitates a seamless transition from AR to MAR, where intermediate states allow for training a causal model that benefits from both few-step inference and KV cache acceleration, thus leveraging the advantages of both AR and MAR. On the ImageNet benchmark, we carefully explore the properties of SAR by analyzing the impact of sequence order and output intervals on performance, as well as the generalization ability regarding inference order and steps. We further validate the potential of SAR by training a 900M text-to-image model capable of synthesizing photo-realistic images with any resolution. We hope our work may inspire more exploration and application of AR-based modeling across diverse modalities.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Token-wise Feature Caching
**Authors**: Chang Zou, Xuyang Liu, Ting Liu, Siteng Huang, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T09:35:35Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.

### FedCache 2.0: Federated Edge Learning with Knowledge Caching and Dataset   Distillation
**Authors**: Quyang Pan, Sheng Sun, Zhiyuan Wu, Yuwei Wang, Min Liu, Bo Gao, Jingyuan Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T07:58:39Z

**Summary**: Federated Edge Learning (FEL) has emerged as a promising approach for enabling edge devices to collaboratively train machine learning models while preserving data privacy. Despite its advantages, practical FEL deployment faces significant challenges related to device constraints and device-server interactions, necessitating heterogeneous, user-adaptive model training with limited and uncertain communication. In this paper, we introduce FedCache 2.0, a novel personalized FEL architecture that simultaneously addresses these challenges. FedCache 2.0 incorporates the benefits of both dataset distillation and knowledge cache-driven federated learning by storing and organizing distilled data as knowledge in the server-side knowledge cache. Moreover, a device-centric cache sampling strategy is introduced to tailor transferred knowledge for individual devices within controlled communication bandwidth. Extensive experiments on five datasets covering image recognition, audio understanding, and mobile sensor data mining tasks demonstrate that (1) FedCache 2.0 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods regardless of model structures, data distributions, and modalities. (2) FedCache 2.0 can train splendid personalized on-device models with at least $\times$28.6 improvement in communication efficiency.

### Caching Content Placement and Beamforming Co-design for IRS-Aided MIMO   Systems with Imperfect CSI
**Authors**: Meng Gao, Yang Wang, Huafu Li, Junqi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T04:49:22Z

**Summary**: When offloading links encounter deep fading and obstruction, edge caching cannot fully enhance wireless network performance and improve the QoS of edge nodes, as it fails to effectively reduce backhaul burden. The emerging technology of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) compensates for this disadvantage by creating a smart and reconfigurable wireless environment. Subsequently, we jointly design content placement and active/passive beamforming to minimize network costs under imperfect channel state information (CSI) in the IRS-oriented edge caching system. This minimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems. The content placement subproblem is addressed by applying KKT optimality conditions. We then develop the alternating optimization method to resolve precoder and reflection beamforming. Specifically, we reduce transmission power by first fixing the phase shift, reducing the problem to a convex one relative to the precoder, which is solved through convex optimization. Next, we fix the precoder and resolve the resulting reflection beamforming problem using the penalty convex-concave procedure (CCP) method. Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms uniform caching and random phase approaches in reducing transmission power and saving network costs. Eventually, the proposed approach offers potential improvements in the caching optimization and transmission robustness of wireless communication with imperfect CSI.

### Fast and Accurate Neural Rendering Using Semi-Gradients
**Authors**: In-Young Cho, Jaewoong Cho

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T04:30:38Z

**Summary**: We propose a simple yet effective neural network-based framework for global illumination rendering. Recently, rendering techniques that learn neural radiance caches by minimizing the difference (i.e., residual) between the left and right sides of the rendering equation have been suggested. Due to their ease of implementation and the advantage of excluding path integral calculations, these techniques have been applied to various fields, such as free-viewpoint rendering, differentiable rendering, and real-time rendering. However, issues of slow training and occasionally darkened renders have been noted. We identify the cause of these issues as the bias and high variance present in the gradient estimates of the existing residual-based objective function. To address this, we introduce a new objective function that maintains the same global optimum as before but allows for unbiased and low-variance gradient estimates, enabling faster and more accurate training of neural networks. In conclusion, this method is simply implemented by ignoring the partial derivatives of the right-hand side, and theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed loss.

**Authors**: Jinjin Shen, Yan Lin, Yijin Zhang, Weibin Zhang, Feng Shu, Jun Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T01:25:56Z

**Summary**: In order to avoid repeated task offloading and realize the reuse of popular task computing results, we construct a novel content caching-assisted vehicular edge computing (VEC) framework. In the face of irregular network topology and unknown environmental dynamics, we further propose a multi-agent graph attention reinforcement learning (MGARL) based edge caching scheme, which utilizes the graph attention convolution kernel to integrate the neighboring nodes' features of each agent and further enhance the cooperation among agents. Our simulation results show that our proposed scheme is capable of improving the utilization of caching resources while reducing the long-term task computing latency compared to the baselines.

### Leveraging Semantic Cues from Foundation Vision Models for Enhanced   Local Feature Correspondence
**Authors**: Felipe Cadar, Guilherme Potje, Renato Martins, Cédric Demonceaux, Erickson R. Nascimento

**Updated**: 2024-10-12T13:45:26Z

**Summary**: Visual correspondence is a crucial step in key computer vision tasks, including camera localization, image registration, and structure from motion. The most effective techniques for matching keypoints currently involve using learned sparse or dense matchers, which need pairs of images. These neural networks have a good general understanding of features from both images, but they often struggle to match points from different semantic areas. This paper presents a new method that uses semantic cues from foundation vision model features (like DINOv2) to enhance local feature matching by incorporating semantic reasoning into existing descriptors. Therefore, the learned descriptors do not require image pairs at inference time, allowing feature caching and fast matching using similarity search, unlike learned matchers. We present adapted versions of six existing descriptors, with an average increase in performance of 29% in camera localization, with comparable accuracy to existing matchers as LightGlue and LoFTR in two existing benchmarks. Both code and trained models are available at https://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/descriptors/reasoning_accv24

### Viscoelastic Effects on the Hydrodynamics of an Active Compound Particle
**Authors**: KVS Chaithanya, Sumesh P. Thampi

**Updated**: 2024-10-12T10:38:39Z

**Summary**: Understanding the hydrodynamics of microswimmers in viscoelastic fluids and confined environments is crucial for interpreting their behaviour in natural settings and designing synthetic microswimmers for practical applications like cargo transport. In this study, we explore the hydrodynamics of a concentric active compound particle - a model microswimmer (a squirmer) positioned at the centre of a viscoelastic fluid droplet (a model cargo) suspended in another viscoelastic medium. We consider the Oldroyd-B constitutive model to characterize the fluids and employ a perturbative approach in the Deborah number to analyze viscoelastic effects analytically, assuming a small Capillary number so that the droplet remains spherical and does not deform. We examine three cases: (i) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in a Newtonian fluid, (ii) a squirmer confined within a Newtonian fluid droplet suspended in a viscoelastic fluid, and (iii) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in another viscoelastic fluid. Our findings reveal that the swimming speeds of the squirmer and the droplet are determined by the complex interplay of viscoelasticity, the size ratio of the droplet to the squirmer (confinement strength), and the viscosity ratio of the surrounding fluid to the droplet fluid. A critical aspect of this interaction is the positioning of stagnation points within the fluid flow, which governs the distribution of polymeric stress. This distribution, in turn, plays a crucial role in determining the influence of viscoelasticity on the squirmer's dynamics. Our analysis suggests that viscoelastic effects can either enhance or hinder the swimming speed of the squirmer when confined in a droplet, depending on the specific configuration of the system.

### Fine-grained Attention I/O Complexity: Comprehensive Analysis for   Backward Passes
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Yufa Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-10-12T07:01:30Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing long-context information. However, the quadratic complexity of attention computation with respect to sequence length poses significant computational challenges, and I/O aware algorithms have been proposed. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the I/O complexity for attention mechanisms, focusing on backward passes by categorizing into small and large cache scenarios. Using the red-blue pebble game framework, we establish tight bounds on I/O complexity across all cache sizes. We confirm that the de facto standard I/O aware algorithm FlashAttention is optimal for both forward and backward passes for the large cache size scenario. For small cache sizes, we provide an algorithm that improves over existing methods and achieves the tight bounds. Additionally, we extend our analysis to sparse attention, a mainstream speeding-up approach, deriving fine-grained lower bounds for both forward and backward passes and both small and large caches. Our findings complete the theoretical foundation for I/O complexity in attention mechanisms, offering insights for designing efficient algorithms of LLM training and inference.

### In-place Switch: Reprogramming based SLC Cache Design for Hybrid 3D SSDs
**Authors**: Xufeng Yang, Zhengjian Cong, Congming Gao

**Updated**: 2024-10-12T02:11:14Z

**Summary**: Recently, 3D SSDs are widely adopted in PCs, data centers, and cloud storage systems. To increase capacity, high bit-density cells, such as Triple-Level Cell (TLC), are utilized within 3D SSDs. However, due to the inferior performance of TLC, a portion of TLCs is configured to operate as Single-Level Cell (SLC) to provide high performance, with host data initially directed to the SLCs. In SLC/TLC hybrid 3D SSDs, a portion of the TLC space is designated as an SLC cache to achieve high SSD performance by writing host data at the SLC speed. Given the limited size of the SLC cache, block reclamation is necessary to free up the SLC cache during idle periods. However, our preliminary studies indicate that the SLC cache can lead to a performance cliff if filled rapidly and cause significant write amplification when data migration occurs during idle times.   In this work, we propose leveraging a reprogram operation to address these challenges. Specifically, when the SLC cache is full or during idle periods, a reprogram operation is performed to switch used SLC pages to TLC pages in place (termed In-place Switch, IPS). Subsequently, other free TLC space is allocated as the new SLC cache. IPS can continuously provide sufficient SLC cache within SSDs, significantly improving write performance and reducing write amplification. Experimental results demonstrate that IPS can reduce write latency and write amplification by up to 0.75 times and 0.53 times, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art SLC cache technologies.

### Foundation Model-Powered 3D Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning via   Training-free Adaptor
**Authors**: Sahar Ahmadi, Ali Cheraghian, Morteza Saberi, Md. Towsif Abir, Hamidreza Dastmalchi, Farookh Hussain, Shafin Rahman

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T20:23:00Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in deep learning for processing point clouds hold increased interest in Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL) for 3D computer vision. This paper introduces a new method to tackle the Few-Shot Continual Incremental Learning (FSCIL) problem in 3D point cloud environments. We leverage a foundational 3D model trained extensively on point cloud data. Drawing from recent improvements in foundation models, known for their ability to work well across different tasks, we propose a novel strategy that does not require additional training to adapt to new tasks. Our approach uses a dual cache system: first, it uses previous test samples based on how confident the model was in its predictions to prevent forgetting, and second, it includes a small number of new task samples to prevent overfitting. This dynamic adaptation ensures strong performance across different learning tasks without needing lots of fine-tuning. We tested our approach on datasets like ModelNet, ShapeNet, ScanObjectNN, and CO3D, showing that it outperforms other FSCIL methods and demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/ahmadisahar/ACCV_FCIL3D}.

### Calibrated Cache Model for Few-Shot Vision-Language Model Adaptation
**Authors**: Kun Ding, Qiang Yu, Haojian Zhang, Gaofeng Meng, Shiming Xiang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:12:30Z

**Summary**: Cache-based approaches stand out as both effective and efficient for adapting vision-language models (VLMs). Nonetheless, the existing cache model overlooks three crucial aspects. 1) Pre-trained VLMs are mainly optimized for image-text similarity, neglecting the importance of image-image similarity, leading to a gap between pre-training and adaptation. 2) The current cache model is based on the Nadaraya-Watson (N-W) estimator, which disregards the intricate relationships among training samples while constructing weight function. 3) Under the condition of limited samples, the logits generated by cache model are of high uncertainty, directly using these logits without accounting for the confidence could be problematic. This work presents three calibration modules aimed at addressing the above challenges. Similarity Calibration refines the image-image similarity by using unlabeled images. We add a learnable projection layer with residual connection on top of the pre-trained image encoder of CLIP and optimize the parameters by minimizing self-supervised contrastive loss. Weight Calibration introduces a precision matrix into the weight function to adequately model the relation between training samples, transforming the existing cache model to a Gaussian Process (GP) regressor, which could be more accurate than N-W estimator. Confidence Calibration leverages the predictive variances computed by GP Regression to dynamically re-scale the logits of cache model, ensuring that the cache model's outputs are appropriately adjusted based on their confidence levels. Besides, to reduce the high complexity of GPs, we further propose a group-based learning strategy. Integrating the above designs, we propose both training-free and training-required variants. Extensive experiments on 11 few-shot classification datasets validate that the proposed methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

### Unlocking FedNL: Self-Contained Compute-Optimized Implementation
**Authors**: Konstantin Burlachenko, Peter Richtárik

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T12:19:18Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that enables intelligent agents to collaboratively train Machine Learning (ML) models in a distributed manner, eliminating the need for sharing their local data. The recent work (arXiv:2106.02969) introduces a family of Federated Newton Learn (FedNL) algorithms, marking a significant step towards applying second-order methods to FL and large-scale optimization. However, the reference FedNL prototype exhibits three serious practical drawbacks: (i) It requires 4.8 hours to launch a single experiment in a sever-grade workstation; (ii) The prototype only simulates multi-node setting; (iii) Prototype integration into resource-constrained applications is challenging. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we present a self-contained implementation of FedNL, FedNL-LS, FedNL-PP for single-node and multi-node settings. Our work resolves the aforementioned issues and reduces the wall clock time by x1000. With this FedNL outperforms alternatives for training logistic regression in a single-node -- CVXPY (arXiv:1603.00943), and in a multi-node -- Apache Spark (arXiv:1505.06807), Ray/Scikit-Learn (arXiv:1712.05889). Finally, we propose two practical-orientated compressors for FedNL - adaptive TopLEK and cache-aware RandSeqK, which fulfill the theory of FedNL.

### AsyncFS: Metadata Updates Made Asynchronous for Distributed Filesystems   with In-Network Coordination
**Authors**: Jingwei Xu, Mingkai Dong, Qiulin Tian, Ziyi Tian, Tong Xin, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T08:33:58Z

**Summary**: Distributed filesystems typically employ synchronous metadata updates, facing inherent challenges for access efficiency, load balancing, and directory contention, especially under dynamic and skewed workloads. This paper argues that synchronous updates are overly conservative for distributed filesystems. We propose AsyncFS with asynchronous metadata updates, allowing operations to return early and defer directory updates until respective read to enable latency hiding and conflict resolution. The key challenge is efficiently maintaining the synchronous semantics of metadata updates. To address this, AsyncFS is co-designed with a programmable switch, leveraging the constrained on-switch resources to holistically track directory states in the network with negligible cost. This allows AsyncFS to timely aggregate and efficiently apply delayed updates using batching and consolidation before directory reads. Evaluation shows that AsyncFS achieves up to 13.34$\times$ and 3.85$\times$ higher throughput, and 61.6% and 57.3% lower latency than two state-of-the-art distributed filesystems, InfiniFS and CFS-KV, respectively, on skewed workloads. For real-world workloads, AsyncFS improves end-to-end throughput by 21.1$\times$, 1.1$\times$ and 30.1% over Ceph, IndexFS and CFS-KV, respectively.

### ZipVL: Efficient Large Vision-Language Models with Dynamic Token   Sparsification and KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Yefei He, Feng Chen, Jing Liu, Wenqi Shao, Hong Zhou, Kaipeng Zhang, Bohan Zhuang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T07:24:21Z

**Summary**: The efficiency of large vision-language models (LVLMs) is constrained by the computational bottleneck of the attention mechanism during the prefill phase and the memory bottleneck of fetching the key-value (KV) cache in the decoding phase, particularly in scenarios involving high-resolution images or videos. Visual content often exhibits substantial redundancy, resulting in highly sparse attention maps within LVLMs. This sparsity can be leveraged to accelerate attention computation or compress the KV cache through various approaches. However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these bottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity concerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an efficient inference framework designed for LVLMs that resolves both computation and memory bottlenecks through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform attention mechanism solely on those important tokens to accelerate the prefill phase. To mitigate the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase, we employ mixed-precision quantization to the KV cache, where high-bit quantization is used for caches of important tokens, while low-bit quantization is applied to those of less importance. Our experiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by 2.6$\times$ and reduce GPU memory usage by 50.0%, with a minimal accuracy reduction of only 0.2% on Video-MME benchmark over LongVA-7B model, effectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.

### Long Context Compression with Activation Beacon
**Authors**: Peitian Zhang, Zheng Liu, Shitao Xiao, Ninglu Shao, Qiwei Ye, Zhicheng Dou

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T02:18:24Z

**Summary**: Long context compression is a critical research problem due to its significance in reducing the high computational and memory costs associated with LLMs. In this paper, we propose Activation Beacon, a plug-in module for transformer-based LLMs that targets effective, efficient, and flexible compression of long contexts. To achieve this, our method introduces the following technical designs. 1) We directly compress the activations (i.e. keys and values at every layer), rather than leveraging soft prompts to relay information (which constitute a major bottleneck to encapsulate the complex information within long contexts). 2) We tailor the compression workflow, where each fine-grained input unit is progressively compressed, enabling high-quality compression and efficient computation during both training and inference. 3) We train the model through compression-based auto-regression, making full use of plain texts and instructional data to optimize the model's compression performance. 4) During training, we randomly sample a compression ratio at each step, teaching the model to support a wide range of compression configurations. Extensive evaluations are conducted on various long-context tasks whose lengths (e.g., 128K) may far exceed the maximum training length (20K), such as document understanding, few-shot learning, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Whilst existing methods struggle to handle these challenging tasks, Activation Beacon maintains a comparable performance to the uncompressed baseline across various scenarios, achieving a 2x acceleration in inference time and an 8x reduction of memory costs for KV cache. Our data, model, and code have been released at \url{https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding/}.

### KV Prediction for Improved Time to First Token
**Authors**: Maxwell Horton, Qingqing Cao, Chenfan Sun, Yanzi Jin, Sachin Mehta, Mohammad Rastegari, Moin Nabi

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T21:55:11Z

**Summary**: Inference with transformer-based language models begins with a prompt processing step. In this step, the model generates the first output token and stores the KV cache needed for future generation steps. This prompt processing step can be computationally expensive, taking 10s of seconds or more for billion-parameter models on edge devices when prompt lengths or batch sizes rise. This degrades user experience by introducing significant latency into the model's outputs. To reduce the time spent producing the first output (known as the ``time to first token'', or TTFT) of a pretrained model, we introduce a novel method called KV Prediction. In our method, a small auxiliary model is used to process the prompt and produce an approximation of the KV cache used by a base model. This approximated KV cache is then used with the base model for autoregressive generation without the need to query the auxiliary model again. We demonstrate that our method produces a pareto-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-off when compared to baselines. On TriviaQA, we demonstrate relative accuracy improvements in the range of $15\%-50\%$ across a range of TTFT FLOPs budgets. We also demonstrate accuracy improvements of up to $30\%$ on HumanEval python code completion at fixed TTFT FLOPs budgets. Additionally, we benchmark models on an Apple M2 Pro CPU and demonstrate that our improvement in FLOPs translates to a TTFT speedup on hardware. We release our code at https://github.com/apple/corenet/tree/main/projects/kv-prediction .

**Summary**: The adoption of processing-in-memory (PiM) architectures has been gaining momentum because they provide high performance and low energy consumption by alleviating the data movement bottleneck. Yet, the security of such architectures has not been thoroughly explored. The adoption of PiM solutions provides a new way to directly access main memory, which malicious user applications can exploit. We show that this new way to access main memory opens opportunities for high-throughput timing attacks that are hard-to-mitigate without significant performance overhead.   We introduce IMPACT, a set of high-throughput main memory-based timing attacks that leverage characteristics of PiM architectures to establish covert and side channels. IMPACT enables high-throughput communication and private information leakage by exploiting the shared DRAM row buffer. To achieve high throughput, IMPACT (i) eliminates cache bypassing steps required by processor-centric main memory and cache-based timing attacks and (ii) leverages the intrinsic parallelism of PiM operations. We showcase two applications of IMPACT. First, we build two covert-channel attacks that run on the host CPU and leverage different PiM approaches to gain direct and fast access to main memory and establish high-throughput communication covert channels. Second, we showcase a side-channel attack that leaks private information of concurrently running victim applications that are accelerated with PiM. Our results demonstrate that (i) our covert channels achieve 12.87 Mb/s and 14.16 Mb/s communication throughput, respectively, which is up to 4.91x and 5.41x faster than the state-of-the-art main memory-based covert channels, and (ii) our side-channel attack allows the attacker to leak secrets with a low error rate. To avoid such covert and side channels in emerging PiM systems, we propose and evaluate three defenses.

### RecurFormer: Not All Transformer Heads Need Self-Attention
**Authors**: Ruiqing Yan, Linghan Zheng, Xingbo Du, Han Zou, Yufeng Guo, Jianfei Yang

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T15:24:12Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) excel in modeling complex language patterns but face significant computational costs during inference, especially with long inputs due to the attention mechanism's memory overhead. We observe that certain attention heads exhibit a distribution where the attention weights concentrate on tokens near the query token, termed as recency aware, which focuses on local and short-range dependencies. Leveraging this insight, we propose RecurFormer, a novel architecture that replaces these attention heads with linear recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically the Mamba architecture. This replacement reduces the cache size without evicting tokens, thus maintaining generation quality. RecurFormer retains the ability to model long-range dependencies through the remaining attention heads and allows for reusing pre-trained Transformer-based LLMs weights with continual training. Experiments demonstrate that RecurFormer matches the original model's performance while significantly enhancing inference efficiency. Our approach provides a practical solution to the computational challenges of Transformer-based LLMs inference, making it highly attractive for tasks involving long inputs.

### C$^3$P-VoxelMap: Compact, Cumulative and Coalescible Probabilistic Voxel   Mapping
**Authors**: Xu Yang, Wenhao Li, Qijie Ge, Lulu Suo, Weijie Tang, Zhengyu Wei, Longxiang Huang, Bo Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T11:01:44Z

**Summary**: This work presents a compact, cumulative and coalescible probabilistic voxel mapping method to enhance performance, accuracy and memory efficiency in LiDAR odometry. Probabilistic voxel mapping requires storing past point clouds and re-iterating on them to update the uncertainty every iteration, which consumes large memory space and CPU cycles. To solve this problem, we propose a two-folded strategy. First, we introduce a compact point-free representation for probabilistic voxels and derive a cumulative update of the planar uncertainty without caching original point clouds. Our voxel structure only keeps track of a predetermined set of statistics for points that lie inside it. This method reduces the runtime complexity from $O(MN)$ to $O(N)$ and the space complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ where $M$ is the number of iterations and $N$ is the number of points. Second, to further minimize memory usage and enhance mapping accuracy, we provide a strategy to dynamically merge voxels associated with the same physical planes by taking advantage of the geometric features in the real world. Rather than scanning for these coalescible voxels constantly at every iteration, our merging strategy accumulates voxels in a locality-sensitive hash and triggers merging lazily. On-demand merging not only reduces memory footprint with minimal computational overhead but also improves localization accuracy thanks to cross-voxel denoising. Experiments exhibit 20% higher accuracy, 20% faster performance and 70% lower memory consumption than the state-of-the-art.

### SqueezeAttention: 2D Management of KV-Cache in LLM Inference via   Layer-wise Optimal Budget
**Authors**: Zihao Wang, Bin Cui, Shaoduo Gan

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T05:11:52Z

**Summary**: Optimizing the Key-Value (KV) cache of the Large Language Model (LLM) has been considered critical to saving the cost of inference. Most of the existing KV-cache compression algorithms attempted to sparsify the sequence of tokens by taking advantage of the different importance of tokens. However, most of these methods treat all layers equally, allocating the same KV budget to each layer. This approach is suboptimal, as some layers may be less sensitive to input tokens yet still receive the same budget as others. In this work, we found that by identifying the importance of attention layers, we could optimize the KV-cache jointly from two dimensions, i.e., sequence-wise and layer-wise. Based on our observations regarding layer-wise importance in inference, we propose SqueezeAttention to precisely optimize the allocation of KV-cache budget among layers on-the-fly and then incorporate three representative sequence-wise algorithms to compress the KV-cache for each layer with its very own budget. Specifically, we first measure each layer's importance by calculating the cosine similarity of the input prompt differences before and after the self-attention layers. Based on this similarity, we then categorize the layers into two groups and adjust their KV budgets accordingly. By optimizing the KV-cache from both sequence's and layer's dimensions, SqueezeAttention achieves around 30% to 70% of the memory reductions and up to 2.2 times of throughput improvements in a wide range of LLMs and benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/hetailang/SqueezeAttention.

### TurboRAG: Accelerating Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Precomputed   KV Caches for Chunked Text
**Authors**: Songshuo Lu, Hua Wang, Yutian Rong, Zhi Chen, Yaohua Tang

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T03:52:54Z

**Summary**: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems concatenate and process numerous retrieved document chunks for prefill which requires a large volume of computation, therefore leading to significant latency in time-to-first-token (TTFT). To reduce the computation overhead as well as TTFT, we introduce TurboRAG, a novel RAG system that redesigns the inference paradigm of the current RAG system by first pre-computing and storing the key-value (KV) caches of documents offline, and then directly retrieving the saved KV cache for prefill. Hence, online computation of KV caches is eliminated during inference. In addition, we provide a number of insights into the mask matrix and positional embedding mechanisms, plus fine-tune a pretrained language model to maintain model accuracy of TurboRAG. Our approach is applicable to most existing large language models and their applications without any requirement in modification of models and inference systems. Experimental results across a suite of RAG benchmarks demonstrate that TurboRAG reduces TTFT by up to 9.4x compared to the conventional RAG systems (on an average of 8.6x), but reserving comparable performance to the standard RAG systems.

### Teddy: Efficient Large-Scale Dataset Distillation via   Taylor-Approximated Matching
**Authors**: Ruonan Yu, Songhua Liu, Jingwen Ye, Xinchao Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T03:28:46Z

**Summary**: Dataset distillation or condensation refers to compressing a large-scale dataset into a much smaller one, enabling models trained on this synthetic dataset to generalize effectively on real data. Tackling this challenge, as defined, relies on a bi-level optimization algorithm: a novel model is trained in each iteration within a nested loop, with gradients propagated through an unrolled computation graph. However, this approach incurs high memory and time complexity, posing difficulties in scaling up to large datasets such as ImageNet. Addressing these concerns, this paper introduces Teddy, a Taylor-approximated dataset distillation framework designed to handle large-scale dataset and enhance efficiency. On the one hand, backed up by theoretical analysis, we propose a memory-efficient approximation derived from Taylor expansion, which transforms the original form dependent on multi-step gradients to a first-order one. On the other hand, rather than repeatedly training a novel model in each iteration, we unveil that employing a pre-cached pool of weak models, which can be generated from a single base model, enhances both time efficiency and performance concurrently, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Teddy attains state-of-the-art efficiency and performance on the Tiny-ImageNet and original-sized ImageNet-1K dataset, notably surpassing prior methods by up to 12.8%, while reducing 46.6% runtime. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Lexie-YU/Teddy.

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T15:57:03Z

**Summary**: Understanding the physics of electromagnetic pulse emission and nozzle damage is critical for the long-term operation of laser experiments with gas targets, particularly at facilities looking to produce stable sources of radiation at high repetition rate. We present a theoretical model of plasma formation and electrostatic charging when high-power lasers are focused inside gases. The model can be used to estimate the amplitude of gigahertz electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) produced by the laser and the extent of damage to the gas jet nozzle. Looking at a range of laser and target properties relevant to existing high-power laser systems, we find that EMP fields of tens to hundreds of kV/m can be generated several metres from the gas jet. Model predictions are compared with measurements of EMP, plasma formation and nozzle damage from two experiments on the VEGA-3 laser and one experiment on the Vulcan Petawatt laser.

### VEC-Sim: A Simulation Platform for Evaluating Service Caching and   Computation Offloading Policies in Vehicular Edge Networks
**Authors**: Fan Wu, Xiaolong Xu, Muhammad Bilal, Xiangwei Wang, Hao Cheng, Siyu Wu

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T14:28:59Z

**Summary**: Computer simulation platforms offer an alternative solution by emulating complex systems in a controlled manner. However, existing Edge Computing (EC) simulators, as well as general-purpose vehicular network simulators, are not tailored for VEC and lack dedicated support for modeling the distinct access pattern, entity mobility trajectory and other unique characteristics of VEC networks. To fill this gap, this paper proposes VEC-Sim, a versatile simulation platform for in-depth evaluation and analysis of various service caching and computation offloading policies in VEC networks. VEC-Sim incorporates realistic mechanisms to replicate real-world access patterns, including service feature vector, vehicle mobility modeling, evolving service popularity, new service upload and user preference shifts, etc. Moreover, its modular architecture and extensive Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow seamless integration of customized scheduling policies and user-defined metrics. A comprehensive evaluation of VEC-Sim's capabilities is undertaken in comparison to real-world ground truths. Results prove it to be accurate in reproducing classical scheduling algorithms and extremely effective in conducting case studies.

### LayerKV: Optimizing Large Language Model Serving with Layer-wise KV   Cache Management
**Authors**: Yi Xiong, Hao Wu, Changxu Shao, Ziqing Wang, Rui Zhang, Yuhong Guo, Junping Zhao, Ke Zhang, Zhenxuan Pan

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T11:40:31Z

**Summary**: The expanding context windows in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their capabilities in various applications, but they also introduce significant challenges in maintaining low latency, particularly in Time to First Token (TTFT). This paper identifies that the sharp rise in TTFT as context length increases is predominantly driven by queuing delays, which are caused by the growing demands for GPU Key-Value (KV) cache allocation clashing with the limited availability of KV cache blocks. To address this issue, we propose LayerKV, a simple yet effective plug-in method that effectively reduces TTFT without requiring additional hardware or compromising output performance, while seamlessly integrating with existing parallelism strategies and scheduling techniques. Specifically, LayerKV introduces layer-wise KV block allocation, management, and offloading for fine-grained control over system memory, coupled with an SLO-aware scheduler to optimize overall Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Comprehensive evaluations on representative models, ranging from 7B to 70B parameters, across various GPU configurations, demonstrate that LayerKV improves TTFT latency up to 69x and reduces SLO violation rates by 28.7%, significantly enhancing the user experience.

### Variations in Multi-Agent Actor-Critic Frameworks for Joint   Optimizations in UAV Swarm Networks: Recent Evolution, Challenges, and   Directions
**Authors**: Muhammad Morshed Alam, Muhammad Yeasir Aarafat, Tamim Hossain

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T07:22:40Z

**Summary**: Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm networks (UAVSNs) can effectively execute surveillance, connectivity, and computing services to ground users (GUs). These missions require trajectory planning, UAV-GUs association, task offloading, next-hop selection, and resources such as transmit power, bandwidth, caching, and computing allocation to improve network performances. Owing to the highly dynamic topology, limited resources, and non-availability of global knowledge, optimizing network performance in UAVSNs is very intricate. Hence, it requires an adaptive joint optimization framework that can tackle both discrete and continuous decision variables to ensure optimal network performance under dynamic constraints. Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based adaptive actor-critic framework can efficiently address these problems. This paper investigates the recent evolutions of actor-critic frameworks to deal with joint optimization problems in UAVSNs. In addition, challenges and potential solutions are addressed as research directions.

### UpDLRM: Accelerating Personalized Recommendation using Real-World PIM   Architecture
**Authors**: Sitian Chen, Haobin Tan, Amelie Chi Zhou, Yusen Li, Pavan Balaji

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T04:11:28Z

**Summary**: Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) have gained popularity in recommendation systems due to their effectiveness in handling large-scale recommendation tasks. The embedding layers of DLRMs have become the performance bottleneck due to their intensive needs on memory capacity and memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose UpDLRM, which utilizes real-world processingin-memory (PIM) hardware, UPMEM DPU, to boost the memory bandwidth and reduce recommendation latency. The parallel nature of the DPU memory can provide high aggregated bandwidth for the large number of irregular memory accesses in embedding lookups, thus offering great potential to reduce the inference latency. To fully utilize the DPU memory bandwidth, we further studied the embedding table partitioning problem to achieve good workload-balance and efficient data caching. Evaluations using real-world datasets show that, UpDLRM achieves much lower inference time for DLRM compared to both CPU-only and CPU-GPU hybrid counterparts.

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T02:51:27Z

**Summary**: The increasing complexity of deep learning models used for calculating user representations presents significant challenges, particularly with limited computational resources and strict service-level agreements (SLAs). Previous research efforts have focused on optimizing model inference but have overlooked a critical question: is it necessary to perform user model inference for every ad request in large-scale social networks? To address this question and these challenges, we first analyze user access patterns at Meta and find that most user model inferences occur within a short timeframe. T his observation reveals a triangular relationship among model complexity, embedding freshness, and service SLAs. Building on this insight, we designed, implemented, and evaluated ERCache, an efficient and robust caching framework for large-scale user representations in ads recommendation systems on social networks. ERCache categorizes cache into direct and failover types and applies customized settings and eviction policies for each model, effectively balancing model complexity, embedding freshness, and service SLAs, even considering the staleness introduced by caching. ERCache has been deployed at Meta for over six months, supporting more than 30 ranking models while efficiently conserving computational resources and complying with service SLA requirements.

### Simultaneous Masking, Not Prompting Optimization: A Paradigm Shift in   Fine-tuning LLMs for Simultaneous Translation
**Authors**: Matthew Raffel, Victor Agostinelli, Lizhong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T01:12:19Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.

### KV Cache Compression, But What Must We Give in Return? A Comprehensive   Benchmark of Long Context Capable Approaches
**Authors**: Jiayi Yuan, Hongyi Liu, Shaochen Zhong, Yu-Neng Chuang, Songchen Li, Guanchu Wang, Duy Le, Hongye Jin, Vipin Chaudhary, Zhaozhuo Xu, Zirui Liu, Xia Hu

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T19:34:03Z

**Summary**: Long context capability is a crucial competency for large language models (LLMs) as it mitigates the human struggle to digest long-form texts. This capability enables complex task-solving scenarios such as book summarization, code assistance, and many more tasks that are traditionally manpower-intensive. However, transformer-based LLMs face significant challenges with long context input due to the growing size of the KV cache and the intrinsic complexity of attending to extended inputs; where multiple schools of efficiency-driven approaches - such as KV cache quantization, token dropping, prompt compression, linear-time sequence models, and hybrid architectures - have been proposed to produce efficient yet long context-capable models. Despite these advancements, no existing work has comprehensively benchmarked these methods in a reasonably aligned environment. In this work, we fill this gap by providing a taxonomy of current methods and evaluating 10+ state-of-the-art approaches across seven categories of long context tasks. Our work reveals numerous previously unknown phenomena and offers insights - as well as a friendly workbench - for the future development of long context-capable LLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/henryzhongsc/longctx_bench.

### Numerical analysis of partial discharge ignition in H2 bubbles floating   in dielectric oils, for High-Voltage Solid State Transformer applications
**Authors**: Konstantinos Kourtzanidis, Panagiotis Dimitrakellis, Dimitrios Rakopoulos

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T11:28:30Z

**Summary**: We report on a self-consistent numerical analysis campaign of partial discharge (PD) ignition in H2 bubbles floating in biobased dielectric oils. We investigate various configurations (bubble sizes, bubble position, existence of protrusion) on a cylinder-to-cylinder setup that emulates a specific SST module (from SSTAR Horizon Europe project) under transient overvoltage as well as in its design operational conditions (VRMS = 66 kV, AC excitation of 50 Hz). Our results on electrical characteristics and plasma dynamics leading to the PD ignition, indicate that under transient overvoltage and for mm size bubbles (diameter 1 -4.5 mm), the smaller the bubble the less the inception voltage, while the peak inception voltage is higher than 70 kV. The existence of metallic protrusion can affect the inception voltage of a remote floating bubble only slightly and when this is close to the sharp tip. The extreme scenario of a protrusion in contact (inside) a gas bubble severely affects the insulation properties and drops the PD inception voltage remarkably. The larger the bubble and the sharper the tip of the protrusion the lower the inception peak voltage, that can reach values well below 40 kV. On the contrary and under design operation, larger bubbles increase the severity and probability of PD events, leading to lower instantaneous inception voltages. Current pulses produced in bubbles can quickly transit to intense streamer discharges (which can also transit to catastrophic arcing) if the operational frequency is reduced and/or under transient, HF overvoltage.

### Enhancing Playback Performance in Video Recommender Systems with an   On-Device Gating and Ranking Framework
**Authors**: Yunfei Yang, Zhenghao Qi, Honghuan Wu, Qi Song, Tieyao Zhang, Hao Li, Yimin Tu, Kaiqiao Zhan, Ben Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T09:53:10Z

**Summary**: Video recommender systems (RSs) have gained increasing attention in recent years. Existing mainstream RSs focus on optimizing the matching function between users and items. However, we noticed that users frequently encounter playback issues such as slow loading or stuttering while browsing the videos, especially in weak network conditions, which will lead to a subpar browsing experience, and may cause users to leave, even when the video content and recommendations are superior. It is quite a serious issue, yet easily overlooked. To tackle this issue, we propose an on-device Gating and Ranking Framework (GRF) that cooperates with server-side RS. Specifically, we utilize a gate model to identify videos that may have playback issues in real-time, and then we employ a ranking model to select the optimal result from a locally-cached pool to replace the stuttering videos. Our solution has been fully deployed on Kwai, a large-scale short video platform with hundreds of millions of users globally. Moreover, it significantly enhances video playback performance and improves overall user experience and retention rates.

### A Scalable State Sharing Protocol for Low-Resource Validator Nodes in   Blockchain Networks
**Authors**: Ruben Hias, Weihong Wang, Jan Vanhoof, Tom Van Cutsem

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T09:46:38Z

**Summary**: The perpetual growth of data stored on popular blockchains such as Ethereum leads to significant scalability challenges and substantial storage costs for operators of full nodes. Increasing costs may lead to fewer independently operated nodes in the network, which poses risks to decentralization (and hence network security), but also pushes decentralized app developers towards centrally hosted API services.   This paper introduces a new protocol that allows validator nodes to participate in a blockchain network without the need to store the full state of the network on each node. The key idea is to use the blockchain network as both a replicated state machine and as a distributed storage system. By distributing states across nodes and enabling efficient data retrieval through a Kademlia-inspired routing protocol, we reduce storage costs for validators. Cryptographic proofs (such as Merkle proofs) are used to allow nodes to verify data stored by other nodes without having to trust those nodes directly. While the protocol trades off data storage for increased network bandwidth, we show how gossiping and caching can minimize the increased bandwidth needs.   To validate our state sharing protocol, we conduct an extensive quantitative analysis of Ethereum's data storage and data access patterns. Our findings indicate that while our protocol significantly lowers storage needs, it comes with an increased bandwidth usage ranging from 1.5 MB to 5 MB per block, translating to an additional monthly bandwidth of 319 GB to 1,065 GB. Despite this, the size remains small enough such that it can be passed to all nodes and validated within Ethereum's 12-second block validation window. Further analysis shows that Merkle proofs are the most significant contributor to the additional bandwidth. To address this concern, we also analyze the impact of switching to the more space-efficient Verkle Proofs.

### CItruS: Chunked Instruction-aware State Eviction for Long Sequence   Modeling
**Authors**: Yu Bai, Xiyuan Zou, Heyan Huang, Sanxing Chen, Marc-Antoine Rondeau, Yang Gao, Jackie Chi Kit Cheung

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T04:25:41Z

**Summary**: Long sequence modeling has gained broad interest as large language models (LLMs) continue to advance. Recent research has identified that a large portion of hidden states within the key-value caches of Transformer models can be discarded (also termed evicted) without affecting the perplexity performance in generating long sequences. However, we show that these methods, despite preserving perplexity performance, often drop information that is important for solving downstream tasks, a problem which we call information neglect. To address this issue, we introduce Chunked Instruction-aware State Eviction (CItruS), a novel modeling technique that integrates the attention preferences useful for a downstream task into the eviction process of hidden states. In addition, we design a method for chunked sequence processing to further improve efficiency. Our training-free method exhibits superior performance on long sequence comprehension and retrieval tasks over several strong baselines under the same memory budget, while preserving language modeling perplexity. The code and data have been released at https://github.com/ybai-nlp/CItruS.

### PrefixQuant: Static Quantization Beats Dynamic through Prefixed Outliers   in LLMs
**Authors**: Mengzhao Chen, Yi Liu, Jiahao Wang, Yi Bin, Wenqi Shao, Ping Luo

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T17:59:35Z

**Summary**: Quantization is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) by enhancing memory efficiency and inference speed. Existing methods for activation quantization mainly address channel-wise outliers, often neglecting token-wise outliers, leading to reliance on costly per-token dynamic quantization. To address this, we introduce PrefixQuant, a novel technique that isolates outlier tokens offline without re-training. Specifically, PrefixQuant identifies high-frequency outlier tokens and prefixes them in the KV cache, preventing the generation of outlier tokens during inference and simplifying quantization. To our knowledge, PrefixQuant is the first to enable efficient per-tensor static quantization to outperform expensive per-token dynamic quantization. For instance, in W4A4KV4 (4- bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) Llama-3-8B, PrefixQuant with per-tensor static quantization achieves a 7.43 WikiText2 perplexity and 71.08% average accuracy on 5 common-sense reasoning tasks, outperforming previous per-token dynamic quantization methods like QuaRot with 0.98 perplexity improvement and +5.98 points accuracy. Additionally, the inference speed of W4A4 quantized models using PrefixQuant is 1.60x to 2.81x faster than FP16 models and exceeds QuaRot models by 1.2x to 1.3x. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/ChenMnZ/PrefixQuant}.

### Stateful Large Language Model Serving with Pensieve
**Authors**: Lingfan Yu, Jinkun Lin, Jinyang Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T17:21:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are wildly popular today and it is important to serve them efficiently. Existing LLM serving systems are stateless across requests. Consequently, when LLMs are used in the common setting of multi-turn conversations, a growing log of the conversation history must be processed alongside any request by the serving system at each turn, resulting in repeated processing.   In this paper, we design $Pensieve$, a system optimized for multi-turn conversation LLM serving. $Pensieve$ maintains the conversation state across requests by caching previously processed history to avoid duplicate processing. $Pensieve$'s multi-tier caching strategy can utilize both GPU and CPU memory to efficiently store and retrieve cached data. $Pensieve$ also generalizes the recent PagedAttention kernel to support attention between multiple input tokens with a GPU cache spread over non-contiguous memory. Our evaluation shows that $Pensieve$ can achieve $1.14$-$3.0\times$ the throughput of vLLM and TensorRT-LLM and significantly reduce latency.

### KV-Compress: Paged KV-Cache Compression with Variable Compression Rates   per Attention Head
**Authors**: Isaac Rehg

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T15:07:09Z

**Summary**: Context lengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) have exploded in recent years, with 128k-token context becoming a standard and million-token context becoming a reality. Efficiently supporting long-context inference remains challenging as the memory that must be allocated in key-value (KV) cache for a generation scales with its context length, limiting the number of long-context requests that can be served concurrently under a given memory budget. KV cache compression can mitigate this issue by removing under-utilized KVs from each attention head's cache and reducing its memory footprint. Higher theoretical compression rates can be achieved when the number of removed KVs varies across attention heads, but application of such a strategy within existing inference frameworks adds fragmentation and cannot realize the theoretical compression rates in physical memory. We introduce KV-Compress, a novel compression method that evicts contiguous KV blocks within a PagedAttention framework, reducing the memory footprint of the KV cache proportionally to this theoretical compression rate. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on LongBench for both Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct while lowering the total number of compressed KVs by 4x compared with prior methods. Evaluations on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-FP8 achieve compression rates up to 8x with negligible impact on performance, and up to 64x while retaining over 90% of full-cache performance for all but three of the suite's subsets. We benchmark an integration of our method with vLLM that increases total throughput by up to 5.18x by enabling larger decoding batches.

### TidalDecode: Fast and Accurate LLM Decoding with Position Persistent   Sparse Attention
**Authors**: Lijie Yang, Zhihao Zhang, Zhuofu Chen, Zikun Li, Zhihao Jia

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T14:30:27Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have driven significant advancements across diverse NLP tasks, with long-context models gaining prominence for handling extended inputs. However, the expanding key-value (KV) cache size required by Transformer architectures intensifies the memory constraints, particularly during the decoding phase, creating a significant bottleneck. Existing sparse attention mechanisms designed to address this bottleneck have two limitations: (1) they often fail to reliably identify the most relevant tokens for attention, and (2) they overlook the spatial coherence of token selection across consecutive Transformer layers, which can lead to performance degradation and substantial overhead in token selection. This paper introduces TidalDecode, a simple yet effective algorithm and system for fast and accurate LLM decoding through position persistent sparse attention. TidalDecode leverages the spatial coherence of tokens selected by existing sparse attention methods and introduces a few token selection layers that perform full attention to identify the tokens with the highest attention scores, while all other layers perform sparse attention with the pre-selected tokens. This design enables TidalDecode to substantially reduce the overhead of token selection for sparse attention without sacrificing the quality of the generated results. Evaluation on a diverse set of LLMs and tasks shows that TidalDecode closely matches the generative performance of full attention methods while reducing the LLM decoding latency by up to 2.1x.

### Extended Functional Representation Lemma: A Tool For Privacy, Semantic   Representation, Caching, and Compression Design
**Authors**: Amirreza Zamani, Mikael Skoglund

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T13:33:23Z

**Summary**: This paper provides an overview of a problem in information-theoretic privacy mechanism design, addressing two scenarios in which private data is either observable or hidden. In each scenario, different privacy measures are used, including bounded mutual information and two types of per-letter privacy constraints. Considering the first scenario, an agent observes useful data that is correlated with private data, and wants to disclose the useful information to a user. Due to the privacy concerns, direct disclosure is prohibited. Hence, a privacy mechanism is designed to generate disclosed data which maximizes the revealed information about the useful data while satisfying a privacy constraint. In the second scenario, the agent has additionally access to the private data. We discuss how the Functional Representation Lemma, the Strong Functional Representation Lemma, and their extended versions are useful for designing low-complexity privacy mechanisms that achieve optimal privacy-utility trade-offs under certain constraints. Furthermore, another privacy design problem is presented where part of the private attribute is more private than the remaining part. Finally, we provide applications including semantic communications, caching and delivery, and compression designs, where the approach can be applied.

### Fast State Restoration in LLM Serving with HCache
**Authors**: Shiwei Gao, Youmin Chen, Jiwu Shu

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T13:03:45Z

**Summary**: The growing complexity of LLM usage today, e.g., multi-round conversation and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), makes contextual states (i.e., KV cache) reusable across user requests. Given the capacity constraints of GPU memory, only a limited number of contexts can be cached on GPU for reusing. Existing inference systems typically evict part of the KV cache and restore it by recomputing it from the original tokens or offloading it to host storage for later retrieval, both of which introduce substantial computational or I/O overheads. We propose HCache, a novel LLM state restoration method. Its key idea is to restore LLM states from intermediate activations and thus utilize computational and I/O resources with low overhead. We enhance HCache with two techniques, including i) a bubble-free restoration scheduler that integrates resource-complementary methods to optimize the balance between computation and IO tasks; and ii) a chunk-based storage manager to address the layout mismatch issue (i.e., layer-before-token saving versus token-before-layer restoration). Our evaluations, conducted using real-world tasks, show that HCache reduces the TTFT by up to 1.93X compared to KV offload while consuming 1.92-2.40X less storage space; compared to token recomputation, HCache achieves up to 5.73X reduction in TTFT.

### SpinQuant: LLM quantization with learned rotations
**Authors**: Zechun Liu, Changsheng Zhao, Igor Fedorov, Bilge Soran, Dhruv Choudhary, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yuandong Tian, Tijmen Blankevoort

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T01:27:59Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques applied to weights, activations, and the KV cache greatly reduce memory usage, latency, and power consumption of Large Language Models (LLMs), but may lead to large quantization errors when outliers are present. Rotating activation or weight matrices helps remove outliers and benefits quantization. In this work, we identify a collection of applicable rotation parameterizations that lead to identical outputs in full-precision Transformer architectures while enhancing quantization accuracy. In addition, we find that some random rotations lead to much better quantization than others, with an up to 13 points difference in downstream zero-shot reasoning performance. As a result, we propose SpinQuant, a novel approach that incorporates learned rotation matrices for optimal quantized network accuracy. With 4-bit quantization of weight, activation, and KV-cache, SpinQuant narrows the accuracy gap on zero-shot reasoning tasks with full precision to merely 2.9 points on the LLaMA-2 7B model, surpassing LLM-QAT by 19.1 points and SmoothQuant by 25.0 points. Furthermore, SpinQuant also outperforms concurrent work QuaRot, which applies random rotations to remove outliers. In particular, for LLaMA-3 8B models that are hard to quantize, SpinQuant reduces the gap to full precision by up to 45.1% relative to QuaRot.

### Superposed Decoding: Multiple Generations from a Single Autoregressive   Inference Pass
**Authors**: Ethan Shen, Alan Fan, Sarah M. Pratt, Jae Sung Park, Matthew Wallingford, Sham M. Kakade, Ari Holtzman, Ranjay Krishna, Ali Farhadi, Aditya Kusupati

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T22:56:06Z

**Summary**: Many applications today provide users with multiple auto-complete drafts as they type, including GitHub's code completion, Gmail's smart compose, and Apple's messaging auto-suggestions. Under the hood, language models support this by running an autoregressive inference pass to provide a draft. Consequently, providing $k$ drafts to the user requires running an expensive language model $k$ times. To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$ inference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that generates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference pass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token embeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the language model. At every inference step we combine the $k$ drafts with the top-$k$ tokens to get $k^2$ new drafts and cache the $k$ most likely options, using an n-gram interpolation with minimal compute overhead to filter out incoherent generations. Our experiments show that $k$ drafts from Superposed Decoding are at least as coherent and factual as Nucleus Sampling and Greedy Decoding respectively, while being at least $2.44\times$ faster for $k\ge3$. In a compute-normalized setting, user evaluations demonstrably favor text generated by Superposed Decoding over Nucleus Sampling. Superposed Decoding can also be combined with other decoding strategies, resulting in universal coverage gains when scaling inference time compute.

### Self-compensating Light Calorimetry with Liquid Argon Time Projection   Chamber for GeV Neutrino Physics
**Authors**: Xuyang Ning, Wei Shi, Chao Zhang, Ciro Riccio, Jay Hyun Jo

**Updated**: 2024-10-06T19:36:34Z

**Summary**: Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) is an exceptional dual calorimeter capable of estimating the energy of incident particles through both the ionization charge and the scintillation light. Our studies show that due to the mechanisms of charge recombination and light generation involved in the energy dissipation in liquid argon, light calorimetry in LArTPCs is inherently self-compensating: the missing energy in the hadronic component is compensated for by the extra recombination luminescence compared to the electromagnetic component. Good compensation of the electron-to-hadron response ratio (e/h) around unity can be achieved across a broad range of drift electric fields from 0.2 to 1.8 kV/cm.This inherent self-compensation enhances the appeal of light calorimetry in LArTPCs, complementing the well-established charge calorimetry. Using GeV neutrinos as a case study, we show that light calorimetry can achieve an energy resolution comparable to the more sophisticated charge imaging calorimetry. The synergy between light and charge calorimetry offers a novel approach to evaluating and mitigating systematic uncertainties in energy measurements with LArTPCs.

### Lazy Qubit Reordering for Accelerating Parallel State-Vector-based   Quantum Circuit Simulation
**Authors**: Yusuke Teranishi, Shoma Hiraoka, Wataru Mizukami, Masao Okita, Fumihiko Ino

**Updated**: 2024-10-05T18:20:37Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes two quantum operation scheduling methods for accelerating parallel state-vector-based quantum circuit simulation using multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). The proposed methods reduce all-to-all communication caused by qubit reordering (QR), which can dominate the overhead of parallel simulation. Our approach eliminates redundant QRs by introducing intentional delays in QR communications such that multiple QRs can be aggregated into a single QR. The delays are carefully introduced based on the principles of time-space tiling, or a cache optimization technique for classical computers, which we use to arrange the execution order of quantum operations. Moreover, we present an extended scheduling method for the hierarchical interconnection of GPU cluster systems to avoid slow inter-node communication. We develop these methods tailored for two primary procedures in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulation: quantum state update (QSU) and expectation value computation (EVC). Experimental validation on 32-GPU executions demonstrates acceleration in QSU and EVC -- up to 54$\times$ and 606$\times$, respectively -- compared to existing methods. Moreover, our extended scheduling method further reduced communication time by up to 15\% in a two-layered interconnected cluster system. Our approach is useful for any quantum circuit simulations, including QSU and/or EVC.

### SwiftKV: Fast Prefill-Optimized Inference with Knowledge-Preserving   Model Transformation
**Authors**: Aurick Qiao, Zhewei Yao, Samyam Rajbhandari, Yuxiong He

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T22:45:26Z

**Summary**: LLM inference for popular enterprise use cases, such as summarization, RAG, and code-generation, typically observes orders of magnitude longer prompt lengths than generation lengths. This characteristic leads to high cost of prefill and increased response latency. In this paper, we present SwiftKV, a novel model transformation and distillation procedure specifically designed to reduce the time and cost of processing prompt tokens while preserving high quality of generated tokens. SwiftKV combines three key mechanisms: i) SingleInputKV, which prefills later layers' KV cache using a much earlier layer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip much of the model computation, ii) AcrossKV, which merges the KV caches of neighboring layers to reduce the memory footprint and support larger batch size for higher throughput, and iii) a knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs for SwiftKV with minimal accuracy impact and low compute and data requirement. For Llama-3.1-8B and 70B, SwiftKV reduces the compute requirement of prefill by 50% and the memory requirement of the KV cache by 62.5% while incurring minimum quality degradation across a wide range of tasks. In the end-to-end inference serving using an optimized vLLM implementation, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x higher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve a staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which translates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B in 16-bit precision on 4x H100 GPUs.

**Authors**: Noah Martin, Abdullah Bin Faisal, Hiba Eltigani, Rukhshan Haroon, Swaminathan Lamelas, Fahad Dogar

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T15:23:28Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we make a case for a proxy for large language models which has explicit support for cost-saving optimizations. We design LLMProxy, which supports three key optimizations: model selection, context management, and caching. These optimizations present tradeoffs in terms of cost, inference time, and response quality, which applications can navigate through our high level, bidirectional interface. As a case study, we implement a WhatsApp-based Q&A service that uses LLMProxy to provide a rich set of features to the users. This service is deployed on a small scale (100+ users) leveraging the cloud; it has been operational for 15+ weeks and users have asked 1400+ questions so far. We report on the experiences of running this service as well as microbenchmark the specific benefits of the various cost-optimizations we present in this paper.

### HarmoniCa: Harmonizing Training and Inference for Better Feature Cache   in Diffusion Transformer Acceleration
**Authors**: Yushi Huang, Zining Wang, Ruihao Gong, Jing Liu, Xinjie Zhang, Jun Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T10:14:17Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have gained prominence for outstanding scalability and extraordinary performance in generative tasks. However, their considerable inference costs impede practical deployment. The feature cache mechanism, which involves storing and retrieving redundant computations across timesteps, holds promise for reducing per-step inference time in diffusion models. Most existing caching methods for DiT are manually designed. Although the learning-based approach attempts to optimize strategies adaptively, it suffers from discrepancies between training and inference, which hampers both the performance and acceleration ratio. Upon detailed analysis, we pinpoint that these discrepancies primarily stem from two aspects: (1) Prior Timestep Disregard, where training ignores the effect of cache usage at earlier timesteps, and (2) Objective Mismatch, where the training target (align predicted noise in each timestep) deviates from the goal of inference (generate the high-quality image). To alleviate these discrepancies, we propose HarmoniCa, a novel method that Harmonizes training and inference with a novel learning-based Caching framework built upon Step-Wise Denoising Training (SDT) and Image Error Proxy-Guided Objective (IEPO). Compared to the traditional training paradigm, the newly proposed SDT maintains the continuity of the denoising process, enabling the model to leverage information from prior timesteps during training, similar to the way it operates during inference. Furthermore, we design IEPO, which integrates an efficient proxy mechanism to approximate the final image error caused by reusing the cached feature. Therefore, IEPO helps balance final image quality and cache utilization, resolving the issue of training that only considers the impact of cache usage on the predicted output at each timestep.

### Unleashing the Potential of the Diffusion Model in Few-shot Semantic   Segmentation
**Authors**: Muzhi Zhu, Yang Liu, Zekai Luo, Chenchen Jing, Hao Chen, Guangkai Xu, Xinlong Wang, Chunhua Shen

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T07:54:58Z

**Summary**: The Diffusion Model has not only garnered noteworthy achievements in the realm of image generation but has also demonstrated its potential as an effective pretraining method utilizing unlabeled data. Drawing from the extensive potential unveiled by the Diffusion Model in both semantic correspondence and open vocabulary segmentation, our work initiates an investigation into employing the Latent Diffusion Model for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation. Recently, inspired by the in-context learning ability of large language models, Few-shot Semantic Segmentation has evolved into In-context Segmentation tasks, morphing into a crucial element in assessing generalist segmentation models. In this context, we concentrate on Few-shot Semantic Segmentation, establishing a solid foundation for the future development of a Diffusion-based generalist model for segmentation. Our initial focus lies in understanding how to facilitate interaction between the query image and the support image, resulting in the proposal of a KV fusion method within the self-attention framework. Subsequently, we delve deeper into optimizing the infusion of information from the support mask and simultaneously re-evaluating how to provide reasonable supervision from the query mask. Based on our analysis, we establish a simple and effective framework named DiffewS, maximally retaining the original Latent Diffusion Model's generative framework and effectively utilizing the pre-training prior. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the previous SOTA models in multiple settings.

### Prefixing Attention Sinks can Mitigate Activation Outliers for Large   Language Model Quantization
**Authors**: Seungwoo Son, Wonpyo Park, Woohyun Han, Kyuyeun Kim, Jaeho Lee

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T06:26:20Z

**Summary**: Despite recent advances in LLM quantization, activation quantization remains to be challenging due to the activation outliers. Conventional remedies, e.g., mixing precisions for different channels, introduce extra overhead and reduce the speedup. In this work, we develop a simple yet effective strategy to facilitate per-tensor activation quantization by preventing the generation of problematic tokens. Precisely, we propose a method to find a set of key-value cache, coined CushionCache, which mitigates outliers in subsequent tokens when inserted as a prefix. CushionCache works in two steps: First, we greedily search for a prompt token sequence that minimizes the maximum activation values in subsequent tokens. Then, we further tune the token cache to regularize the activations of subsequent tokens to be more quantization-friendly. The proposed method successfully addresses activation outliers of LLMs, providing a substantial performance boost for per-tensor activation quantization methods. We thoroughly evaluate our method over a wide range of models and benchmarks and find that it significantly surpasses the established baseline of per-tensor W8A8 quantization and can be seamlessly integrated with the recent activation quantization method.

### LoRC: Low-Rank Compression for LLMs KV Cache with a Progressive   Compression Strategy
**Authors**: Rongzhi Zhang, Kuang Wang, Liyuan Liu, Shuohang Wang, Hao Cheng, Chao Zhang, Yelong Shen

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T03:10:53Z

**Summary**: The Key-Value (KV) cache is a crucial component in serving transformer-based autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling faster inference by storing previously computed KV vectors. However, its memory consumption scales linearly with sequence length and batch size, posing a significant bottleneck in LLM deployment. Existing approaches to mitigate this issue include: (1) efficient attention variants integrated in upcycling stages, which requires extensive parameter tuning thus unsuitable for pre-trained LLMs; (2) KV cache compression at test time, primarily through token eviction policies, which often overlook inter-layer dependencies and can be task-specific.   This paper introduces an orthogonal approach to KV cache compression. We propose a low-rank approximation of KV weight matrices, allowing for plug-in integration with existing transformer-based LLMs without model retraining. To effectively compress KV cache at the weight level, we adjust for layerwise sensitivity and introduce a progressive compression strategy, which is supported by our theoretical analysis on how compression errors accumulate in deep networks. Our method is designed to function without model tuning in upcycling stages or task-specific profiling in test stages. Extensive experiments with LLaMA models ranging from 8B to 70B parameters across various tasks show that our approach significantly reduces the GPU memory footprint while maintaining performance.

### UNComp: Uncertainty-Aware Long-Context Compressor for Efficient Large   Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Jing Xiong, Jianghan Shen, Fanghua Ye, Chaofan Tao, Zhongwei Wan, Jianqiao Lu, Xun Wu, Chuanyang Zheng, Zhijiang Guo, Lingpeng Kong, Ngai Wong

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T02:32:36Z

**Summary**: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their high memory and computational demands, especially during long-context inference. While key-value (KV) caching accelerates inference by reusing previously computed keys and values, it also introduces significant memory overhead. Existing KV cache compression methods such as eviction and merging typically compress the KV cache after it is generated and overlook the eviction of hidden states, failing to improve the speed of the prefilling stage. Additionally, applying a uniform compression rate across different attention heads can harm crucial retrieval heads in needle-in-a-haystack tasks due to excessive compression. In this paper, we propose UNComp, an uncertainty-aware compression scheme that leverages matrix entropy to estimate model uncertainty across layers and heads at the token sequence level. By grouping layers and heads based on their uncertainty, UNComp adaptively compresses both the hidden states and the KV cache. Our method achieves a 1.6x speedup in the prefilling stage and reduces the KV cache to 4.74% of its original size, resulting in a 6.4x increase in throughput and a 1.4x speedup in inference with only a 1.41% performance loss. Remarkably, in needle-in-a-haystack tasks, UNComp outperforms the full-size KV cache even when compressed to 9.38% of its original size. Our approach offers an efficient, training-free Grouped-Query Attention paradigm that can be seamlessly integrated into existing KV cache schemes.

### Compute Or Load KV Cache? Why Not Both?
**Authors**: Shuowei Jin, Xueshen Liu, Qingzhao Zhang, Z. Morley Mao

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T01:11:09Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly increased context window sizes, enabling sophisticated applications but also introducing substantial computational overheads, particularly computing key-value (KV) cache in the prefill stage. Prefix caching has emerged to save GPU power in this scenario, which saves KV cache at disks and reuse them across multiple queries. However, traditional prefix caching mechanisms often suffer from substantial latency because the speed of loading KV cache from disks to GPU memory is bottlenecked by the throughput of I/O devices. To optimize the latency of long-context prefill, we propose Cake, a novel KV cache loader, which employs a bidirectional parallelized KV cache generation strategy. Upon receiving a prefill task, Cake simultaneously and dynamically loads saved KV cache from prefix cache locations and computes KV cache on local GPUs, maximizing the utilization of available computation and I/O bandwidth resources. Additionally, Cake automatically adapts to diverse system statuses without manual parameter. tuning. In experiments on various prompt datasets, GPUs, and I/O devices, Cake offers up to 68.1% Time To First Token (TTFT) reduction compare with compute-only method and 94.6% TTFT reduction compare with I/O-only method.

### DeFT: Decoding with Flash Tree-attention for Efficient Tree-structured   LLM Inference
**Authors**: Jinwei Yao, Kaiqi Chen, Kexun Zhang, Jiaxuan You, Binhang Yuan, Zeke Wang, Tao Lin

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T22:17:01Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex tasks that process multiple generation calls in a tree structure with shared prefixes of tokens, including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, speculative decoding, etc. However, existing inference systems for tree-based applications are inefficient due to improper partitioning of queries and KV cache during attention calculation. This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory access (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load balancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory and shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges, we propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient attention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions. DeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention calculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading KV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose Flattened Tree KV Splitting, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the KV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU utilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99 KV cache IO and nearly 100 IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves up to 2.52/3.82x speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three practical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention algorithms.

### GaNI: Global and Near Field Illumination Aware Neural Inverse Rendering
**Authors**: Jiaye Wu, Saeed Hadadan, Geng Lin, Matthias Zwicker, David Jacobs, Roni Sengupta

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T22:11:19Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present GaNI, a Global and Near-field Illumination-aware neural inverse rendering technique that can reconstruct geometry, albedo, and roughness parameters from images of a scene captured with co-located light and camera. Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera focus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and near-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We introduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct the geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse neural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo and roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple technical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that NeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections from the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of near-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle specular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant illumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during capture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and additional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method outperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering techniques. Our approach produces significantly better reflectance and slightly better geometry than capture strategies that do not require a dark room.

### ReLIC: A Recipe for 64k Steps of In-Context Reinforcement Learning for   Embodied AI
**Authors**: Ahmad Elawady, Gunjan Chhablani, Ram Ramrakhya, Karmesh Yadav, Dhruv Batra, Zsolt Kira, Andrew Szot

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T17:58:11Z

**Summary**: Intelligent embodied agents need to quickly adapt to new scenarios by integrating long histories of experience into decision-making. For instance, a robot in an unfamiliar house initially wouldn't know the locations of objects needed for tasks and might perform inefficiently. However, as it gathers more experience, it should learn the layout of its environment and remember where objects are, allowing it to complete new tasks more efficiently. To enable such rapid adaptation to new tasks, we present ReLIC, a new approach for in-context reinforcement learning (RL) for embodied agents. With ReLIC, agents are capable of adapting to new environments using 64,000 steps of in-context experience with full attention while being trained through self-generated experience via RL. We achieve this by proposing a novel policy update scheme for on-policy RL called "partial updates'' as well as a Sink-KV mechanism that enables effective utilization of a long observation history for embodied agents. Our method outperforms a variety of meta-RL baselines in adapting to unseen houses in an embodied multi-object navigation task. In addition, we find that ReLIC is capable of few-shot imitation learning despite never being trained with expert demonstrations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of ReLIC, highlighting that the combination of large-scale RL training, the proposed partial updates scheme, and the Sink-KV are essential for effective in-context learning. The code for ReLIC and all our experiments is at https://github.com/aielawady/relic

### Preble: Efficient Distributed Prompt Scheduling for LLM Serving
**Authors**: Vikranth Srivatsa, Zijian He, Reyna Abhyankar, Dongming Li, Yiying Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T17:50:33Z

**Summary**: Prompts to large language models (LLMs) have evolved beyond simple user questions. For LLMs to solve complex problems, today's practices are to include domain-specific instructions, illustration of tool usages, and/or long context such as textbook chapters in prompts. As such, many parts of prompts are repetitive across requests. Recent works propose to cache and reuse KV state of prompts. However, they are all confined to a single-GPU optimization, while production LLM serving systems are distributed by nature.   This paper proposes Preble, the first distributed LLM serving platform that targets and optimizes for prompt sharing. We designed a distributed scheduling system that co-optimizes KV state reuse and computation load-balancing with a new scheduling algorithm and a hierarchical scheduling mechanism. Our evaluation of Preble with real workloads and request arrival patterns on two open-source LLMs shows that Preble outperforms the SOTA serving systems by 1.5X to 14.5X on average latency and 2X to 10X on p99 latency.

### Disaggregated Memory with SmartNIC Offloading: a Case Study on Graph   Processing
**Authors**: Jacob Wahlgren, Gabin Schieffer, Maya Gokhale, Roger Pearce, Ivy Peng

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T15:41:31Z

**Summary**: Disaggregated memory breaks the boundary of monolithic servers to enable memory provisioning on demand. Using network-attached memory to provide memory expansion for memory-intensive applications on compute nodes can improve the overall memory utilization on a cluster and reduce the total cost of ownership. However, current software solutions for leveraging network-attached memory must consume resources on the compute node for memory management tasks. Emerging off-path smartNICs provide general-purpose programmability at low-cost low-power cores. This work provides a general architecture design that enables network-attached memory and offloading tasks onto off-path programmable SmartNIC. We provide a prototype implementation called SODA on Nvidia BlueField DPU. SODA adapts communication paths and data transfer alternatives, pipelines data movement stages, and enables customizable data caching and prefetching optimizations. We evaluate SODA in five representative graph applications on real-world graphs. Our results show that SODA can achieve up to 7.9x speedup compared to node-local SSD and reduce network traffic by 42% compared to disaggregated memory without SmartNIC offloading at similar or better performance.

### Learning from Offline Foundation Features with Tensor Augmentations
**Authors**: Emir Konuk, Christos Matsoukas, Moein Sorkhei, Phitchapha Lertsiravaramet, Kevin Smith

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T14:35:35Z

**Summary**: We introduce Learning from Offline Foundation Features with Tensor Augmentations (LOFF-TA), an efficient training scheme designed to harness the capabilities of foundation models in limited resource settings where their direct development is not feasible. LOFF-TA involves training a compact classifier on cached feature embeddings from a frozen foundation model, resulting in up to $37\times$ faster training and up to $26\times$ reduced GPU memory usage. Because the embeddings of augmented images would be too numerous to store, yet the augmentation process is essential for training, we propose to apply tensor augmentations to the cached embeddings of the original non-augmented images. LOFF-TA makes it possible to leverage the power of foundation models, regardless of their size, in settings with limited computational capacity. Moreover, LOFF-TA can be used to apply foundation models to high-resolution images without increasing compute. In certain scenarios, we find that training with LOFF-TA yields better results than directly fine-tuning the foundation model.

 ### Reflection-Bench: probing AI intelligence with reflection
**Authors**: Lingyu Li, Yixu Wang, Haiquan Zhao, Shuqi Kong, Yan Teng, Chunbo Li, Yingchun Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:59:50Z

**Summary**: The ability to adapt beliefs or behaviors in response to unexpected outcomes, reflection, is fundamental to intelligent systems' interaction with the world. From a cognitive science perspective, this serves as a core principle of intelligence applicable to both human and AI systems. To address the debate on the intelligence of large language models (LLMs), we propose Reflection-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 7 tasks spanning core cognitive functions crucial for reflection, including perception, memory, belief updating, decision-making, prediction, counterfactual thinking, and meta-reflection. We evaluate the performances of 13 prominent LLMs such as OpenAI o1, GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, etc. The results indicate that current LLMs still lack satisfactory reflection ability. We discuss the underlying causes of these results and suggest potential avenues for future research. In conclusion, Reflection-Bench offers both evaluation tools and inspiration for developing AI capable of reliably interacting with the environment. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/YabYum/ReflectionBench.

### Elucidating the design space of language models for image generation
**Authors**: Xuantong Liu, Shaozhe Hao, Xianbiao Qi, Tianyang Hu, Jun Wang, Rong Xiao, Yuan Yao

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:57:04Z

**Summary**: The success of autoregressive (AR) language models in text generation has inspired the computer vision community to adopt Large Language Models (LLMs) for image generation. However, considering the essential differences between text and image modalities, the design space of language models for image generation remains underexplored. We observe that image tokens exhibit greater randomness compared to text tokens, which presents challenges when training with token prediction. Nevertheless, AR models demonstrate their potential by effectively learning patterns even from a seemingly suboptimal optimization problem. Our analysis also reveals that while all models successfully grasp the importance of local information in image generation, smaller models struggle to capture the global context. In contrast, larger models showcase improved capabilities in this area, helping to explain the performance gains achieved when scaling up model size. We further elucidate the design space of language models for vision generation, including tokenizer choice, model choice, model scalability, vocabulary design, and sampling strategy through extensive comparative experiments. Our work is the first to analyze the optimization behavior of language models in vision generation, and we believe it can inspire more effective designs when applying LMs to other domains. Finally, our elucidated language model for image generation, termed as ELM, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet 256*256 benchmark. The code is available at https://github.com/Pepperlll/LMforImageGeneration.git.

### CompassJudger-1: All-in-one Judge Model Helps Model Evaluation and   Evolution
**Authors**: Maosong Cao, Alexander Lam, Haodong Duan, Hongwei Liu, Songyang Zhang, Kai Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:56:51Z

**Summary**: Efficient and accurate evaluation is crucial for the continuous improvement of large language models (LLMs). Among various assessment methods, subjective evaluation has garnered significant attention due to its superior alignment with real-world usage scenarios and human preferences. However, human-based evaluations are costly and lack reproducibility, making precise automated evaluators (judgers) vital in this process. In this report, we introduce \textbf{CompassJudger-1}, the first open-source \textbf{all-in-one} judge LLM. CompassJudger-1 is a general-purpose LLM that demonstrates remarkable versatility. It is capable of: 1. Performing unitary scoring and two-model comparisons as a reward model; 2. Conducting evaluations according to specified formats; 3. Generating critiques; 4. Executing diverse tasks like a general LLM. To assess the evaluation capabilities of different judge models under a unified setting, we have also established \textbf{JudgerBench}, a new benchmark that encompasses various subjective evaluation tasks and covers a wide range of topics. CompassJudger-1 offers a comprehensive solution for various evaluation tasks while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to diverse requirements. Both CompassJudger and JudgerBench are released and available to the research community athttps://github.com/open-compass/CompassJudger. We believe that by open-sourcing these tools, we can foster collaboration and accelerate progress in LLM evaluation methodologies.

### Can Knowledge Editing Really Correct Hallucinations?
**Authors**: Baixiang Huang, Canyu Chen, Xiongxiao Xu, Ali Payani, Kai Shu

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:55:54Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations, referring to the non-factual information in generated content, despite their superior capacities across tasks. Meanwhile, knowledge editing has been developed as a new popular paradigm to correct the erroneous factual knowledge encoded in LLMs with the advantage of avoiding retraining from scratch. However, one common issue of existing evaluation datasets for knowledge editing is that they do not ensure LLMs actually generate hallucinated answers to the evaluation questions before editing. When LLMs are evaluated on such datasets after being edited by different techniques, it is hard to directly adopt the performance to assess the effectiveness of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations. Thus, the fundamental question remains insufficiently validated: Can knowledge editing really correct hallucinations in LLMs? We proposed HalluEditBench to holistically benchmark knowledge editing methods in correcting real-world hallucinations. First, we rigorously construct a massive hallucination dataset with 9 domains, 26 topics and more than 6,000 hallucinations. Then, we assess the performance of knowledge editing methods in a holistic way on five dimensions including Efficacy, Generalization, Portability, Locality, and Robustness. Through HalluEditBench, we have provided new insights into the potentials and limitations of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations, which could inspire future improvements and facilitate the progress in the field of knowledge editing.

### Analyzing Context Contributions in LLM-based Machine Translation
**Authors**: Emmanouil Zaranis, Nuno M. Guerreiro, André F. T. Martins

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:51:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in machine translation (MT) and demonstrated the ability to leverage in-context learning through few-shot examples. However, the mechanisms by which LLMs use different parts of the input context remain largely unexplored. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of context utilization in MT, studying how LLMs use various context parts, such as few-shot examples and the source text, when generating translations. We highlight several key findings: (1) the source part of few-shot examples appears to contribute more than its corresponding targets, irrespective of translation direction; (2) finetuning LLMs with parallel data alters the contribution patterns of different context parts; and (3) there is a positional bias where earlier few-shot examples have higher contributions to the translated sequence. Finally, we demonstrate that inspecting anomalous context contributions can potentially uncover pathological translations, such as hallucinations. Our findings shed light on the internal workings of LLM-based MT which go beyond those known for standard encoder-decoder MT models.

### MoRE: Multi-Modal Contrastive Pre-training with Transformers on X-Rays,   ECGs, and Diagnostic Report
**Authors**: Samrajya Thapa, Koushik Howlader, Subhankar Bhattacharjee, Wei le

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:42:41Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a novel Multi-Modal Contrastive Pre-training Framework that synergistically combines X-rays, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and radiology/cardiology reports. Our approach leverages transformers to encode these diverse modalities into a unified representation space, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and facilitate comprehensive patient assessments. We utilize LoRA-Peft to significantly reduce trainable parameters in the LLM and incorporate recent linear attention dropping strategy in the Vision Transformer(ViT) for smoother attention. Furthermore, we provide novel multimodal attention explanations and retrieval for our model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an integrated model that combines X-ray, ECG, and Radiology/Cardiology Report with this approach. By utilizing contrastive loss, MoRE effectively aligns modality-specific features into a coherent embedding, which supports various downstream tasks such as zero-shot classification and multimodal retrieval. Employing our proposed methodology, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the Mimic-IV, CheXpert, Edema Severity, and PtbXl downstream datasets, surpassing existing multimodal approaches. Our proposed framework shows significant improvements in capturing intricate inter-modal relationships and its robustness in medical diagnosis that establishes a framework for future research in multimodal learning in the healthcare sector.

### IBGP: Imperfect Byzantine Generals Problem for Zero-Shot Robustness in   Communicative Multi-Agent Systems
**Authors**: Yihuan Mao, Yipeng Kang, Peilun Li, Ning Zhang, Wei Xu, Chongjie Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:41:42Z

**Summary**: As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly integrate into our infrastructure, their robust coordination and message synchronization become vital. The Byzantine Generals Problem (BGP) is a critical model for constructing resilient multi-agent systems (MAS) under adversarial attacks. It describes a scenario where malicious agents with unknown identities exist in the system-situations that, in our context, could result from LLM agents' hallucinations or external attacks. In BGP, the objective of the entire system is to reach a consensus on the action to be taken. Traditional BGP requires global consensus among all agents; however, in practical scenarios, global consensus is not always necessary and can even be inefficient. Therefore, there is a pressing need to explore a refined version of BGP that aligns with the local coordination patterns observed in MAS. We refer to this refined version as Imperfect BGP (IBGP) in our research, aiming to address this discrepancy. To tackle this issue, we propose a framework that leverages consensus protocols within general MAS settings, providing provable resilience against communication attacks and adaptability to changing environments, as validated by empirical results. Additionally, we present a case study in a sensor network environment to illustrate the practical application of our protocol.

### LLaVA-KD: A Framework of Distilling Multimodal Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yuxuan Cai, Jiangning Zhang, Haoyang He, Xinwei He, Ao Tong, Zhenye Gan, Chengjie Wang, Xiang Bai

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:41:28Z

**Summary**: The success of Large Language Models (LLM) has led researchers to explore Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for unified visual and linguistic understanding. However, the increasing model size and computational complexity of MLLM limit their use in resource-constrained environments. Small-scale MLLM (s-MLLM) aims to retain the capabilities of the large-scale model (l-MLLM) while reducing computational demands, but resulting in a significant decline in performance. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel LLaVA-KD framework to transfer knowledge from l-MLLM to s-MLLM. Specifically, we introduce Multimodal Distillation (MDist) to minimize the divergence between the visual-textual output distributions of l-MLLM and s-MLLM, and Relation Distillation (RDist) to transfer l-MLLM's ability to model correlations between visual features. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training scheme to fully exploit the potential of s-MLLM: 1) Distilled Pre-Training to align visual-textual representations, 2) Supervised Fine-Tuning to equip the model with multimodal understanding, and 3) Distilled Fine-Tuning to further transfer l-MLLM capabilities. Our approach significantly improves performance without altering the small model's architecture. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component. Code will be available at https://github.com/caiyuxuan1120/LLaVA-KD.

**Updated**: 2024-10-22T06:48:54Z

**Summary**: We evaluate the moral alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences in multilingual trolley problems. Building on the Moral Machine experiment, which captures over 40 million human judgments across 200+ countries, we develop a cross-lingual corpus of moral dilemma vignettes in over 100 languages called MultiTP. This dataset enables the assessment of LLMs' decision-making processes in diverse linguistic contexts. Our analysis explores the alignment of 19 different LLMs with human judgments, capturing preferences across six moral dimensions: species, gender, fitness, status, age, and the number of lives involved. By correlating these preferences with the demographic distribution of language speakers and examining the consistency of LLM responses to various prompt paraphrasings, our findings provide insights into cross-lingual and ethical biases of LLMs and their intersection. We discover significant variance in alignment across languages, challenging the assumption of uniform moral reasoning in AI systems and highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse perspectives in AI ethics. The results underscore the need for further research on the integration of multilingual dimensions in responsible AI research to ensure fair and equitable AI interactions worldwide.

### Building A Coding Assistant via the Retrieval-Augmented Language Model
**Authors**: Xinze Li, Hanbin Wang, Zhenghao Liu, Shi Yu, Shuo Wang, Shuo Wang, Yukun Yan, Yukai Fu, Yu Gu, Ge Yu

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:34:39Z

**Summary**: Pretrained language models have shown strong effectiveness in code-related tasks, such as code retrieval, code generation, code summarization, and code completion tasks. In this paper, we propose COde assistaNt viA retrieval-augmeNted language model (CONAN), which aims to build a code assistant by mimicking the knowledge-seeking behaviors of humans during coding. Specifically, it consists of a code structure aware retriever (CONAN-R) and a dual-view code representation-based retrieval-augmented generation model (CONAN-G). CONAN-R pretrains CodeT5 using Code-Documentation Alignment and Masked Entity Prediction tasks to make language models code structure-aware and learn effective representations for code snippets and documentation. Then CONAN-G designs a dual-view code representation mechanism for implementing a retrieval-augmented code generation model. CONAN-G regards the code documentation descriptions as prompts, which help language models better understand the code semantics. Our experiments show that CONAN achieves convincing performance on different code generation tasks and significantly outperforms previous retrieval augmented code generation models. Our further analyses show that CONAN learns tailored representations for both code snippets and documentation by aligning code-documentation data pairs and capturing structural semantics by masking and predicting entities in the code data. Additionally, the retrieved code snippets and documentation provide necessary information from both program language and natural language to assist the code generation process. CONAN can also be used as an assistant for Large Language Models (LLMs), providing LLMs with external knowledge in shorter code document lengths to improve their effectiveness on various code tasks. It shows the ability of CONAN to extract necessary information and help filter out the noise from retrieved code documents.

### A Realistic Threat Model for Large Language Model Jailbreaks
**Authors**: Valentyn Boreiko, Alexander Panfilov, Vaclav Voracek, Matthias Hein, Jonas Geiping

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:27:01Z

**Summary**: A plethora of jailbreaking attacks have been proposed to obtain harmful responses from safety-tuned LLMs. In their original settings, these methods all largely succeed in coercing the target output, but their attacks vary substantially in fluency and computational effort. In this work, we propose a unified threat model for the principled comparison of these methods. Our threat model combines constraints in perplexity, measuring how far a jailbreak deviates from natural text, and computational budget, in total FLOPs. For the former, we build an N-gram model on 1T tokens, which, in contrast to model-based perplexity, allows for an LLM-agnostic and inherently interpretable evaluation. We adapt popular attacks to this new, realistic threat model, with which we, for the first time, benchmark these attacks on equal footing. After a rigorous comparison, we not only find attack success rates against safety-tuned modern models to be lower than previously presented but also find that attacks based on discrete optimization significantly outperform recent LLM-based attacks. Being inherently interpretable, our threat model allows for a comprehensive analysis and comparison of jailbreak attacks. We find that effective attacks exploit and abuse infrequent N-grams, either selecting N-grams absent from real-world text or rare ones, e.g. specific to code datasets.

### Bidirectional Decoding: Improving Action Chunking via Closed-Loop   Resampling
**Authors**: Yuejiang Liu, Jubayer Ibn Hamid, Annie Xie, Yoonho Lee, Maximilian Du, Chelsea Finn

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:27:00Z

**Summary**: Predicting and executing a sequence of actions without intermediate replanning, known as action chunking, is increasingly used in robot learning from human demonstrations. Yet, its reported effects on the learned policy are inconsistent: some studies find it crucial for achieving strong results, while others observe decreased performance. In this paper, we first dissect how action chunking impacts the divergence between a learner and a demonstrator. We find that action chunking allows the learner to better capture the temporal dependencies in demonstrations but at the cost of reduced reactivity in stochastic environments. To address this tradeoff, we propose Bidirectional Decoding (BID), a test-time inference algorithm that bridges action chunking with closed-loop operations. BID samples multiple predictions at each time step and searches for the optimal one based on two criteria: (i) backward coherence, which favors samples that align with previous decisions; (ii) forward contrast, which seeks samples of high likelihood for future plans. By coupling decisions within and across action chunks, BID promotes consistency over time while maintaining reactivity to unexpected changes. Experimental results show that BID boosts the performance of two state-of-the-art generative policies across seven simulation benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Code and videos are available at https://bid-robot.github.io.

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:22:45Z

**Summary**: Remarkable progress has been made on automated problem solving through societies of agents based on large language models (LLMs). Existing LLM-based multi-agent systems can already solve simple dialogue tasks. Solutions to more complex tasks, however, are complicated through logic inconsistencies due to cascading hallucinations caused by naively chaining LLMs. Here we introduce MetaGPT, an innovative meta-programming framework incorporating efficient human workflows into LLM-based multi-agent collaborations. MetaGPT encodes Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompt sequences for more streamlined workflows, thus allowing agents with human-like domain expertise to verify intermediate results and reduce errors. MetaGPT utilizes an assembly line paradigm to assign diverse roles to various agents, efficiently breaking down complex tasks into subtasks involving many agents working together. On collaborative software engineering benchmarks, MetaGPT generates more coherent solutions than previous chat-based multi-agent systems. Our project can be found at https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT

### Impact of Dataset Properties on Membership Inference Vulnerability of   Deep Transfer Learning
**Authors**: Marlon Tobaben, Hibiki Ito, Joonas Jälkö, Gauri Pradhan, Yuan He, Antti Honkela

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:19:12Z

**Summary**: We analyse the relationship between privacy vulnerability and dataset properties, such as examples per class and number of classes, when applying two state-of-the-art membership inference attacks (MIAs) to fine-tuned neural networks. We derive per-example MIA vulnerability in terms of score distributions and statistics computed from shadow models. We introduce a simplified model of membership inference and prove that in this model, the logarithm of the difference of true and false positive rates depends linearly on the logarithm of the number of examples per class. We complement the theoretical analysis with empirical analysis by systematically testing the practical privacy vulnerability of fine-tuning large image classification models and obtain the previously derived power law dependence between the number of examples per class in the data and the MIA vulnerability, as measured by true positive rate of the attack at a low false positive rate. Finally, we fit a parametric model of the previously derived form to predict true positive rate based on dataset properties and observe good fit for MIA vulnerability on unseen fine-tuning scenarios.

### Pre-training Distillation for Large Language Models: A Design Space   Exploration
**Authors**: Hao Peng, Xin Lv, Yushi Bai, Zijun Yao, Jiajie Zhang, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:16:13Z

**Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. Previous work applying KD in the field of large language models (LLMs) typically focused on the post-training phase, where the student LLM learns directly from instructions and corresponding responses generated by the teacher model. In this paper, we extend KD to the pre-training phase of LLMs, named pre-training distillation (PD). We first conduct a preliminary experiment using GLM-4-9B as the teacher LLM to distill a 1.9B parameter student LLM, validating the effectiveness of PD. Considering the key impact factors of distillation, we systematically explore the design space of pre-training distillation across four aspects: logits processing, loss selection, scaling law, and offline or online logits. We conduct extensive experiments to explore the design space of pre-training distillation and find better configurations and interesting conclusions, such as larger student LLMs generally benefiting more from pre-training distillation, while a larger teacher LLM does not necessarily guarantee better results. We hope our exploration of the design space will inform future practices in pre-training distillation.

### Comprehensive benchmarking of large language models for RNA secondary   structure prediction
**Authors**: L. I. Zablocki, L. A. Bugnon, M. Gerard, L. Di Persia, G. Stegmayer, D. H. Milone

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:12:06Z

**Summary**: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLM) for DNA and proteins, several LLM for RNA have been developed recently. RNA-LLM uses large datasets of RNA sequences to learn, in a self-supervised way, how to represent each RNA base with a semantically rich numerical vector. This is done under the hypothesis that obtaining high-quality RNA representations can enhance data-costly downstream tasks. Among them, predicting the secondary structure is a fundamental task for uncovering RNA functional mechanisms. In this work we present a comprehensive experimental analysis of several pre-trained RNA-LLM, comparing them for the RNA secondary structure prediction task in an unified deep learning framework. The RNA-LLM were assessed with increasing generalization difficulty on benchmark datasets. Results showed that two LLM clearly outperform the other models, and revealed significant challenges for generalization in low-homology scenarios.

### Compute-Constrained Data Selection
**Authors**: Junjie Oscar Yin, Alexander M. Rush

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:11:21Z

**Summary**: Data selection can reduce the amount of training data needed to finetune LLMs; however, the efficacy of data selection scales directly with its compute. Motivated by the practical challenge of compute-constrained finetuning, we consider the setting in which both the cost of selecting data and training are budgeted for. We first formalize the problem of data selection with a cost-aware utility function, and model the data selection problem as trading off initial-selection cost for training gain. We run a comprehensive sweep of experiments across multiple tasks, varying compute budget by scaling finetuning tokens, model sizes, and data selection compute. These experiments show the validity of this model in real-world experiments. Interestingly we find that many powerful data selection methods are almost never compute-optimal, and that cheaper data selection alternatives dominate both from a theoretical and empirical perspective.

### Are Large Language Models Chameleons? An Attempt to Simulate Social   Surveys
**Authors**: Mingmeng Geng, Sihong He, Roberto Trotta

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:05:15Z

**Summary**: Can large language models (LLMs) simulate social surveys? To answer this question, we conducted millions of simulations in which LLMs were asked to answer subjective questions. A comparison of different LLM responses with the European Social Survey (ESS) data suggests that the effect of prompts on bias and variability is fundamental, highlighting major cultural, age, and gender biases. We further discussed statistical methods for measuring the difference between LLM answers and survey data and proposed a novel measure inspired by Jaccard similarity, as LLM-generated responses are likely to have a smaller variance. Our experiments also reveal that it is important to analyze the robustness and variability of prompts before using LLMs to simulate social surveys, as their imitation abilities are approximate at best.

### LASER: Script Execution by Autonomous Agents for On-demand Traffic   Simulation
**Authors**: Hao Gao, Jingyue Wang, Wenyang Fang, Jingwei Xu, Yunpeng Huang, Taolue Chen, Xiaoxing Ma

**Updated**: 2024-10-22T07:14:11Z

**Summary**: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) require diverse and safety-critical traffic scenarios for effective training and testing, but the existing data generation methods struggle to provide flexibility and scalability. We propose LASER, a novel frame-work that leverage large language models (LLMs) to conduct traffic simulations based on natural language inputs. The framework operates in two stages: it first generates scripts from user-provided descriptions and then executes them using autonomous agents in real time. Validated in the CARLA simulator, LASER successfully generates complex, on-demand driving scenarios, significantly improving ADS training and testing data generation.

### Information for Conversation Generation: Proposals Utilising Knowledge   Graphs
**Authors**: Alex Clay, Ernesto Jiménez-Ruiz

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:59:25Z

**Summary**: LLMs are frequently used tools for conversational generation. Without additional information LLMs can generate lower quality responses due to lacking relevant content and hallucinations, as well as the perception of poor emotional capability, and an inability to maintain a consistent character. Knowledge graphs are commonly used forms of external knowledge and may provide solutions to these challenges. This paper introduces three proposals, utilizing knowledge graphs to enhance LLM generation. Firstly, dynamic knowledge graph embeddings and recommendation could allow for the integration of new information and the selection of relevant knowledge for response generation. Secondly, storing entities with emotional values as additional features may provide knowledge that is better emotionally aligned with the user input. Thirdly, integrating character information through narrative bubbles would maintain character consistency, as well as introducing a structure that would readily incorporate new information.

### A Trust-Region Method for Graphical Stein Variational Inference
**Authors**: Liam Pavlovic, David M. Rosen

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:59:01Z

**Summary**: Stein variational inference (SVI) is a sample-based approximate Bayesian inference technique that generates a sample set by jointly optimizing the samples' locations to minimize an information-theoretic measure of discrepancy with the target probability distribution. SVI thus provides a fast and significantly more sample-efficient approach to Bayesian inference than traditional (random-sampling-based) alternatives. However, the optimization techniques employed in existing SVI methods struggle to address problems in which the target distribution is high-dimensional, poorly-conditioned, or non-convex, which severely limits the range of their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose a novel trust-region optimization approach for SVI that successfully addresses each of these challenges. Our method builds upon prior work in SVI by leveraging conditional independences in the target distribution (to achieve high-dimensional scaling) and second-order information (to address poor conditioning), while additionally providing an effective adaptive step control procedure, which is essential for ensuring convergence on challenging non-convex optimization problems. Experimental results show our method achieves superior numerical performance, both in convergence rate and sample accuracy, and scales better in high-dimensional distributions, than previous SVI techniques.

### Contamination Report for Multilingual Benchmarks
**Authors**: Sanchit Ahuja, Varun Gumma, Sunayana Sitaram

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:49:35Z

**Summary**: Benchmark contamination refers to the presence of test datasets in Large Language Model (LLM) pre-training or post-training data. Contamination can lead to inflated scores on benchmarks, compromising evaluation results and making it difficult to determine the capabilities of models. In this work, we study the contamination of popular multilingual benchmarks in LLMs that support multiple languages. We use the Black Box test to determine whether $7$ frequently used multilingual benchmarks are contaminated in $7$ popular open and closed LLMs and find that almost all models show signs of being contaminated with almost all the benchmarks we test. Our findings can help the community determine the best set of benchmarks to use for multilingual evaluation.

### RM-Bench: Benchmarking Reward Models of Language Models with Subtlety   and Style
**Authors**: Yantao Liu, Zijun Yao, Rui Min, Yixin Cao, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:48:26Z

**Summary**: Reward models are critical in techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Inference Scaling Laws, where they guide language model alignment and select optimal responses. Despite their importance, existing reward model benchmarks often evaluate models by asking them to distinguish between responses generated by models of varying power. However, this approach fails to assess reward models on subtle but critical content changes and variations in style, resulting in a low correlation with policy model performance. To this end, we introduce RM-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate reward models based on their sensitivity to subtle content differences and resistance to style biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RM-Bench strongly correlates with policy model performance, making it a reliable reference for selecting reward models to align language models effectively. We evaluate nearly 40 reward models on RM-Bench. Our results reveal that even state-of-the-art models achieve an average performance of only 46.6%, which falls short of random-level accuracy (50%) when faced with style bias interference. These findings highlight the significant room for improvement in current reward models. Related code and data are available at https://github.com/THU-KEG/RM-Bench.

### Toxicity Detection is NOT all you Need: Measuring the Gaps to Supporting   Volunteer Content Moderators
**Authors**: Yang Trista Cao, Lovely-Frances Domingo, Sarah Ann Gilbert, Michelle Mazurek, Katie Shilton, Hal Daumé III

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:48:18Z

**Summary**: Extensive efforts in automated approaches for content moderation have been focused on developing models to identify toxic, offensive, and hateful content with the aim of lightening the load for moderators. Yet, it remains uncertain whether improvements on those tasks have truly addressed moderators' needs in accomplishing their work. In this paper, we surface gaps between past research efforts that have aimed to provide automation for aspects of content moderation and the needs of volunteer content moderators, regarding identifying violations of various moderation rules. To do so, we conduct a model review on Hugging Face to reveal the availability of models to cover various moderation rules and guidelines from three exemplar forums. We further put state-of-the-art LLMs to the test, evaluating how well these models perform in flagging violations of platform rules from one particular forum. Finally, we conduct a user survey study with volunteer moderators to gain insight into their perspectives on useful moderation models. Overall, we observe a non-trivial gap, as missing developed models and LLMs exhibit moderate to low performance on a significant portion of the rules. Moderators' reports provide guides for future work on developing moderation assistant models.

### SleeperNets: Universal Backdoor Poisoning Attacks Against Reinforcement   Learning Agents
**Authors**: Ethan Rathbun, Christopher Amato, Alina Oprea

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:44:58Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) is an actively growing field that is seeing increased usage in real-world, safety-critical applications -- making it paramount to ensure the robustness of RL algorithms against adversarial attacks. In this work we explore a particularly stealthy form of training-time attacks against RL -- backdoor poisoning. Here the adversary intercepts the training of an RL agent with the goal of reliably inducing a particular action when the agent observes a pre-determined trigger at inference time. We uncover theoretical limitations of prior work by proving their inability to generalize across domains and MDPs. Motivated by this, we formulate a novel poisoning attack framework which interlinks the adversary's objectives with those of finding an optimal policy -- guaranteeing attack success in the limit. Using insights from our theoretical analysis we develop ``SleeperNets'' as a universal backdoor attack which exploits a newly proposed threat model and leverages dynamic reward poisoning techniques. We evaluate our attack in 6 environments spanning multiple domains and demonstrate significant improvements in attack success over existing methods, while preserving benign episodic return.

### MagicPIG: LSH Sampling for Efficient LLM Generation
**Authors**: Zhuoming Chen, Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Zihao Ye, Yang Zhou, Jianyu Zhang, Niklas Nolte, Yuandong Tian, Matthijs Douze, Leon Bottou, Zhihao Jia, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:44:51Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with long context windows have gained significant attention. However, the KV cache, stored to avoid re-computation, becomes a bottleneck. Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself suffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention is not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding throughput by $1.9\sim3.9\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 110ms decoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a context of 96k tokens. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/MagicPIG}.

### Nonparametric tests of treatment effect homogeneity for policy-makers
**Authors**: Oliver Dukes, Mats J. Stensrud, Riccardo Brioschi, Aaron Hudson

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:41:23Z

**Summary**: Recent work has focused on nonparametric estimation of conditional treatment effects, but inference has remained relatively unexplored. We propose a class of nonparametric tests for both quantitative and qualitative treatment effect heterogeneity. The tests can incorporate a variety of structured assumptions on the conditional average treatment effect, allow for both continuous and discrete covariates, and do not require sample splitting. Furthermore, we show how the tests are tailored to detect alternatives where the population impact of adopting a personalized decision rule differs from using a rule that discards covariates. The proposal is thus relevant for guiding treatment policies. The utility of the proposal is borne out in simulation studies and a re-analysis of an AIDS clinical trial.

### Correcting for Selection Biases in the Determination of the Hubble   Constant from Time-Delay Cosmography
**Authors**: ian Li, Thomas E. Collett, Philip J. Marshall, Sydney Erickson, Wolfgang Enzi, Lindsay Oldham, Daniel Ballard

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:37:26Z

**Summary**: Time delays in lensed quasars now provide a $H_0$ estimate comparable in precision to the local distance ladder. The primary source of systematic uncertainty in $H_0$ from time delay cosmography is the mass-sheet transform (MST). The TDCOSMO collaboration inferred that a mass sheet is present such that the inferred Hubble constant decreases by 8$\%$. However, that result is limited by the assumption that the density profiles of galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-quasar lenses are the same. In this work, we use a composite star plus dark matter mass profile for the deflector population and model the selection function for galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-quasar lenses. We find that a power-law density profile with an MST is a good approximation to a two-component mass profile around the Einstein radius, but require a mass sheet parameter, $\lambda_\mathrm{int}$, of 0.95$^{+0.06}_{-0.08}$ for SLACS like galaxy-galaxy lenses and 0.87$^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ for quadruply-imaged quasars. For individual systems, $\lambda_\mathrm{int}$ is strongly correlated with the ratio of the half-light radius and Einstein radius of the lens. By propagating these results through the TDCOSMO we find that $H_0$ is lowered by $\sim$3\%. Using the velocity dispersions from SLACS IX and our fiducial model for selection biases we infer H$_0 = 66\pm4 \mathrm{(stat)} \pm 1 \mathrm{(model \: sys)} \pm 2 \mathrm{(measurement \: sys)} \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for the TDCOSMO plus SLACS dataset. The first residual systematic error is due to plausible alternative choices in modelling the selection function, the second is an estimate of the remaining systematic error in the measurement of velocity dispersions for SLACS lenses. Accurate time delay cosmography requires accurate velocity dispersion measurements and accurate calibration of selection biases.

### Exploring Pretraining via Active Forgetting for Improving Cross Lingual   Transfer for Decoder Language Models
**Authors**: Divyanshu Aggarwal, Ashutosh Sathe, Sunayana Sitaram

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:33:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities in a multitude of NLP tasks. However, the efficacy of such models to languages other than English is often limited. Prior works have shown that encoder-only models such as BERT or XLM-RoBERTa show impressive cross lingual transfer of their capabilities from English to other languages. In this work, we propose a pretraining strategy that uses active forgetting to achieve similar cross lingual transfer in decoder-only LLMs. We show that LLMs pretrained with active forgetting are highly effective when adapting to new and unseen languages. Through extensive experimentation, we find that LLMs pretrained with active forgetting are able to learn better multilingual representations which translates to better performance in many downstream tasks.

### Sparse Bayesian multidimensional scaling(s)
**Authors**: Ami Sheth, Aaron Smith, Andrew J. Holbrook

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:30:51Z

**Summary**: Bayesian multidimensional scaling (BMDS) is a probabilistic dimension reduction tool that allows one to model and visualize data consisting of dissimilarities between pairs of objects. Although BMDS has proven useful within, e.g., Bayesian phylogenetic inference, its likelihood and gradient calculations require a burdensome order of $N^2$ floating-point operations, where $N$ is the number of data points. Thus, BMDS becomes impractical as $N$ grows large. We propose and compare two sparse versions of BMDS (sBMDS) that apply log-likelihood and gradient computations to subsets of the observed dissimilarity matrix data. Landmark sBMDS (L-sBMDS) extracts columns, while banded sBMDS (B-sBMDS) extracts diagonals of the data. These sparse variants let one specify a time complexity between $N^2$ and $N$. Under simplified settings, we prove posterior consistency for subsampled distance matrices. Through simulations, we examine the accuracy and computational efficiency across all models using both the Metropolis-Hastings and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms. We observe approximately 3-fold, 10-fold and 40-fold speedups with negligible loss of accuracy, when applying the sBMDS likelihoods and gradients to 500, 1,000 and 5,000 data points with 50 bands (landmarks); these speedups only increase with the size of data considered. Finally, we apply the sBMDS variants to the phylogeographic modeling of multiple influenza subtypes to better understand how these strains spread through global air transportation networks.

### A Survey on Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Xiaohan Xu, Ming Li, Chongyang Tao, Tao Shen, Reynold Cheng, Jinyang Li, Can Xu, Dacheng Tao, Tianyi Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:22:33Z

**Summary**: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), Knowledge Distillation (KD) emerges as a pivotal methodology for transferring advanced capabilities from leading proprietary LLMs, such as GPT-4, to their open-source counterparts like LLaMA and Mistral. Additionally, as open-source LLMs flourish, KD plays a crucial role in both compressing these models, and facilitating their self-improvement by employing themselves as teachers. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of KD's role within the realm of LLM, highlighting its critical function in imparting advanced knowledge to smaller models and its utility in model compression and self-improvement. Our survey is meticulously structured around three foundational pillars: \textit{algorithm}, \textit{skill}, and \textit{verticalization} -- providing a comprehensive examination of KD mechanisms, the enhancement of specific cognitive abilities, and their practical implications across diverse fields. Crucially, the survey navigates the intricate interplay between data augmentation (DA) and KD, illustrating how DA emerges as a powerful paradigm within the KD framework to bolster LLMs' performance. By leveraging DA to generate context-rich, skill-specific training data, KD transcends traditional boundaries, enabling open-source models to approximate the contextual adeptness, ethical alignment, and deep semantic insights characteristic of their proprietary counterparts. This work aims to provide an insightful guide for researchers and practitioners, offering a detailed overview of current methodologies in KD and proposing future research directions. Importantly, we firmly advocate for compliance with the legal terms that regulate the use of LLMs, ensuring ethical and lawful application of KD of LLMs. An associated Github repository is available at https://github.com/Tebmer/Awesome-Knowledge-Distillation-of-LLMs.

**Authors**: Xiang Yue, Yueqi Song, Akari Asai, Seungone Kim, Jean de Dieu Nyandwi, Simran Khanuja, Anjali Kantharuban, Lintang Sutawika, Sathyanarayanan Ramamoorthy, Graham Neubig

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:19:41Z

**Summary**: Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their development has predominantly focused on English- and western-centric datasets and tasks, leaving most of the world's languages and diverse cultural contexts underrepresented. This paper introduces Pangea, a multilingual multimodal LLM trained on PangeaIns, a diverse 6M instruction dataset spanning 39 languages. PangeaIns features: 1) high-quality English instructions, 2) carefully machine-translated instructions, and 3) culturally relevant multimodal tasks to ensure cross-cultural coverage. To rigorously assess models' capabilities, we introduce PangeaBench, a holistic evaluation suite encompassing 14 datasets covering 47 languages. Results show that Pangea significantly outperforms existing open-source models in multilingual settings and diverse cultural contexts. Ablation studies further reveal the importance of English data proportions, language popularity, and the number of multimodal training samples on overall performance. We fully open-source our data, code, and trained checkpoints, to facilitate the development of inclusive and robust multilingual MLLMs, promoting equity and accessibility across a broader linguistic and cultural spectrum.

### Modelling Structured Data Learning with Restricted Boltzmann Machines in   the Teacher-Student Setting
**Authors**: Robin Thériault, Francesco Tosello, Daniele Tantari

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:18:19Z

**Summary**: Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) are generative models capable to learn data with a rich underlying structure. We study the teacher-student setting where a student RBM learns structured data generated by a teacher RBM. The amount of structure in the data is controlled by adjusting the number of hidden units of the teacher and the correlations in the rows of the weights, a.k.a. patterns. In the absence of correlations, we validate the conjecture that the performance is independent of the number of teacher patters and hidden units of the student RBMs, and we argue that the teacher-student setting can be used as a toy model for studying the lottery ticket hypothesis. Beyond this regime, we find that the critical amount of data required to learn the teacher patterns decreases with both their number and correlations. In both regimes, we find that, even with an relatively large dataset, it becomes impossible to learn the teacher patterns if the inference temperature used for regularization is kept too low. In our framework, the student can learn teacher patterns one-to-one or many-to-one, generalizing previous findings about the teacher-student setting with two hidden units to any arbitrary finite number of hidden units.

**Authors**: Jinheng Wang, Hansong Zhou, Ting Song, Shaoguang Mao, Shuming Ma, Hongyu Wang, Yan Xia, Furu Wei

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:14:57Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BitNet and BitNet b1.58, present a promising approach to enhancing the efficiency of LLMs in terms of speed and energy consumption. These developments also enable local LLM deployment across a broad range of devices. In this work, we introduce bitnet.cpp, a tailored software stack designed to unlock the full potential of 1-bit LLMs. Specifically, we develop a set of kernels to support fast and lossless inference of ternary BitNet b1.58 LLMs on CPUs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that bitnet.cpp achieves significant speedups, ranging from 2.37x to 6.17x on x86 CPUs and from 1.37x to 5.07x on ARM CPUs, across various model sizes.

### Beyond 2:4: exploring V:N:M sparsity for efficient transformer inference   on GPUs
**Authors**: Kang Zhao, Tao Yuan, Han Bao, Zhenfeng Su, Chang Gao, Zhaofeng Sun, Zichen Liang, Liping Jing, Jianfei Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:00:04Z

**Summary**: To date, 2:4 sparsity has stood as the only sparse pattern that can be accelerated using sparse tensor cores on GPUs. In practice, 2:4 sparsity often possesses low actual speedups ($\leq 1.3$) and requires fixed sparse ratios, meaning that other ratios, such as 4:8, 8:16, or those exceeding 50% sparsity, do not incur any speedups on GPUs. Recent studies suggest that V:N:M sparsity is promising in addressing these limitations of 2:4 sparsity. However, regarding accuracy, the effects of V:N:M sparsity on broader Transformer models, such as vision Transformers and large language models (LLMs), are largely unexamined. Moreover, Some specific issues related to V:N:M sparsity, such as how to select appropriate V and M values, remain unresolved. In this study, we thoroughly investigate the application of V:N:M sparsity in vision models and LLMs across multiple tasks, from pertaining to downstream tasks. We propose three key approaches to enhance the applicability and accuracy of V:N:M-sparse Transformers, including heuristic V and M selection, V:N:M-specific channel permutation, and three-staged LoRA training techniques. Experimental results show that, with our methods, the DeiT-small achieves lossless accuracy at 64:2:5 sparsity, while the DeiT-base maintains accuracy even at 64:2:8 sparsity. In addition, the fine-tuned LLama2-7B at 64:2:5 sparsity performs comparably or better than training-free 2:4 sparse alternatives on downstream tasks. More importantly, V:N:M-sparse Transformers offer a wider range of speedup-accuracy trade-offs compared to 2:4 sparsity. Overall, our exploration largely facilitates the V:N:M sparsity to act as a truly effective acceleration solution for Transformers in cost-sensitive inference scenarios.

### Mechanism Design for LLM Fine-tuning with Multiple Reward Models
**Authors**: Haoran Sun, Yurong Chen, Siwei Wang, Wei Chen, Xiaotie Deng

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:59:42Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to aggregate multiple preferences has attracted considerable research attention. With aggregation algorithms advancing, a potential economic scenario arises where fine-tuning services are provided to agents with different preferences. In this context, agents may benefit from strategically misreporting their preferences, which could affect the fine-tuned outcomes. This paper addresses such incentive issues by framing it as a mechanism design problem: an LLM provider determines the fine-tuning objective (training rule) and the pricing scheme (payment rule) for agents. We primarily focus on a representative class of training rules that maximize social welfare subject to certain regularizations, referred to as \tr\ rules. Firstly, we show that under most circumstances, truthful reporting is sub-optimal with simply a training rule, thereby highlighting the necessity of payments. Secondly, we design affine maximizer payment rules that implement \tr\ rules in dominant-strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC). We characterize sufficient conditions for payment equivalence properties. For a training rule that satisfies these conditions, we have found all the payment rules that implement it in DSIC, as they only differ by a constant term irrelevant to agents' reports from each other. Thirdly, we demonstrate that our mechanism is approximately DSIC even with perturbed input, showcasing its robustness against the inevitable errors in real-world applications. Experiments on real LLM setups further confirm the practical implications of our results.

### Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models for Heterophilic Graphs
**Authors**: Yuxia Wu, Shujie Li, Yuan Fang, Chuan Shi

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:59:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have presented significant opportunities to enhance various machine learning applications, including graph neural networks (GNNs). By leveraging the vast open-world knowledge within LLMs, we can more effectively interpret and utilize textual data to better characterize heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often have different labels. However, existing approaches for heterophilic graphs overlook the rich textual data associated with nodes, which could unlock deeper insights into their heterophilic contexts. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs for modeling heterophilic graphs and propose a novel two-stage framework: LLM-enhanced edge discriminator and LLM-guided edge reweighting. In the first stage, we fine-tune the LLM to better identify homophilic and heterophilic edges based on the textual content of their nodes. In the second stage, we adaptively manage message propagation in GNNs for different edge types based on node features, structures, and heterophilic or homophilic characteristics. To cope with the computational demands when deploying LLMs in practical scenarios, we further explore model distillation techniques to fine-tune smaller, more efficient models that maintain competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating the feasibility of using LLMs to enhance node classification on heterophilic graphs.

### Do Large Language Models Need a Content Delivery Network?
**Authors**: Yihua Cheng, Kuntai Du, Jiayi Yao, Junchen Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:59:18Z

**Summary**: As the use of large language models (LLMs) expands rapidly, so does the range of knowledge needed to supplement various LLM queries. Thus, enabling flexible and efficient injection of new knowledge in LLM inference is critical. Three high-level options exist: (i) embedding the knowledge in LLM's weights (i.e., fine-tuning), (ii) including the knowledge as a part of LLM's text input (i.e., in-context learning), or (iii) injecting the KV caches of the new knowledge to LLM during prefill. This paper argues that, although fine-tuning and in-context learning are popular, using KV caches as the medium of knowledge could simultaneously enable more modular management of knowledge injection and more efficient LLM serving with low cost and fast response. To realize these benefits, we envision a Knowledge Delivery Network (KDN), a new system component in LLM services that dynamically optimizes the storage, transfer, and composition of KV cache across LLM engines and other compute and storage resources. We believe that, just like content delivery networks (CDNs), such as Akamai, enabled the success of the Internet ecosystem through their efficient data delivery, KDNs will be critical to the success of LLM applications through their efficient knowledge delivery. We have open-sourced a KDN prototype at https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

### MathGAP: Out-of-Distribution Evaluation on Problems with Arbitrarily   Complex Proofs
**Authors**: Andreas Opedal, Haruki Shirakami, Bernhard Schölkopf, Abulhair Saparov, Mrinmaya Sachan

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:58:30Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can solve arithmetic word problems with high accuracy, but little is known about how well they generalize to problems that are more complex than the ones on which they have been trained. Empirical investigations of such questions are impeded by two major flaws of current evaluations: (i) much of the evaluation data is contaminated, in the sense that it has already been seen during training, and (ii) benchmark datasets do not capture how problem proofs may be arbitrarily complex in various ways. As a step towards addressing these issues, we present a framework for evaluating LLMs on problems with arbitrarily complex arithmetic proofs, called MathGAP. MathGAP generates problems that follow fixed proof specifications -- along with chain-of-thought reasoning annotations -- enabling systematic studies on generalization with respect to arithmetic proof complexity. We apply MathGAP to analyze how in-context learning interacts with generalization to problems that have more complex proofs. We find that among the models tested, most show a significant decrease in performance as proofs get deeper and wider. This effect is more pronounced in complex, nonlinear proof structures, which are challenging even for GPT-4o. Surprisingly, providing in-context examples from the same distribution as the test set is not always beneficial for performance. In particular, zero-shot prompting as well as demonstrating a diverse range of examples that are less complex than the test data sometimes yield similar or higher accuracies.

### SMART: Self-learning Meta-strategy Agent for Reasoning Tasks
**Authors**: Rongxing Liu, Kumar Shridhar, Manish Prajapat, Patrick Xia, Mrinmaya Sachan

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:55:04Z

**Summary**: Tasks requiring deductive reasoning, especially those involving multiple steps, often demand adaptive strategies such as intermediate generation of rationales or programs, as no single approach is universally optimal. While Language Models (LMs) can enhance their outputs through iterative self-refinement and strategy adjustments, they frequently fail to apply the most effective strategy in their first attempt. This inefficiency raises the question: Can LMs learn to select the optimal strategy in the first attempt, without a need for refinement? To address this challenge, we introduce SMART (Self-learning Meta-strategy Agent for Reasoning Tasks), a novel framework that enables LMs to autonomously learn and select the most effective strategies for various reasoning tasks. We model the strategy selection process as a Markov Decision Process and leverage reinforcement learning-driven continuous self-improvement to allow the model to find the suitable strategy to solve a given task. Unlike traditional self-refinement methods that rely on multiple inference passes or external feedback, SMART allows an LM to internalize the outcomes of its own reasoning processes and adjust its strategy accordingly, aiming for correct solutions on the first attempt. Our experiments across various reasoning datasets and with different model architectures demonstrate that SMART significantly enhances the ability of models to choose optimal strategies without external guidance (+15 points on the GSM8K dataset). By achieving higher accuracy with a single inference pass, SMART not only improves performance but also reduces computational costs for refinement-based strategies, paving the way for more efficient and intelligent reasoning in LMs.

### PromptExp: Multi-granularity Prompt Explanation of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ximing Dong, Shaowei Wang, Dayi Lin, Gopi Krishnan Rajbahadur, Boquan Zhou, Shichao Liu, Ahmed E. Hassan

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:54:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models excel in tasks like natural language understanding and text generation. Prompt engineering plays a critical role in leveraging LLM effectively. However, LLMs black-box nature hinders its interpretability and effective prompting engineering. A wide range of model explanation approaches have been developed for deep learning models, However, these local explanations are designed for single-output tasks like classification and regression,and cannot be directly applied to LLMs, which generate sequences of tokens. Recent efforts in LLM explanation focus on natural language explanations, but they are prone to hallucinations and inaccuracies. To address this, we introduce OurTool, a framework for multi-granularity prompt explanations by aggregating token-level insights. OurTool introduces two token-level explanation approaches: 1.an aggregation-based approach combining local explanation techniques, and 2. a perturbation-based approach with novel techniques to evaluate token masking impact. OurTool supports both white-box and black-box explanations and extends explanations to higher granularity levels, enabling flexible analysis. We evaluate OurTool in case studies such as sentiment analysis, showing the perturbation-based approach performs best using semantic similarity to assess perturbation impact. Furthermore, we conducted a user study to confirm OurTool's accuracy and practical value, and demonstrate its potential to enhance LLM interpretability.

### Do LLMs write like humans? Variation in grammatical and rhetorical   styles
**Authors**: Alex Reinhart, David West Brown, Ben Markey, Michael Laudenbach, Kachatad Pantusen, Ronald Yurko, Gordon Weinberg

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:35:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are capable of writing grammatical text that follows instructions, answers questions, and solves problems. As they have advanced, it has become difficult to distinguish their output from human-written text. While past research has found some differences in surface features such as word choice and punctuation, and developed classifiers to detect LLM output, none has studied the rhetorical styles of LLMs.   Using several variants of Llama 3 and GPT-4o, we construct two parallel corpora of human- and LLM-written texts from common prompts. Using Douglas Biber's set of lexical, grammatical, and rhetorical features, we identify systematic differences between LLMs and humans and between different LLMs. These differences persist when moving from smaller models to larger ones, and are larger for instruction-tuned models than base models. This demonstrates that despite their advanced abilities, LLMs struggle to match human styles, and hence more advanced linguistic features can detect patterns in their behavior not previously recognized.

### Statistical Inference for Temporal Difference Learning with Linear   Function Approximation
**Authors**: Weichen Wu, Gen Li, Yuting Wei, Alessandro Rinaldo

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:34:44Z

**Summary**: Statistical inference with finite-sample validity for the value function of a given policy in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is crucial for ensuring the reliability of reinforcement learning. Temporal Difference (TD) learning, arguably the most widely used algorithm for policy evaluation, serves as a natural framework for this purpose.In this paper, we study the consistency properties of TD learning with Polyak-Ruppert averaging and linear function approximation, and obtain three significant improvements over existing results. First, we derive a novel sharp high-dimensional probability convergence guarantee that depends explicitly on the asymptotic variance and holds under weak conditions. We further establish refined high-dimensional Berry-Esseen bounds over the class of convex sets that guarantee faster rates than those in the literature. Finally, we propose a plug-in estimator for the asymptotic covariance matrix, designed for efficient online computation. These results enable the construction of confidence regions and simultaneous confidence intervals for the linear parameters of the value function, with guaranteed finite-sample coverage. We demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.

### Aligning Translation-Specific Understanding to General Understanding in   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yichong Huang, Baohang Li, Xiaocheng Feng, Chengpeng Fu, Wenshuai Huo, Ting Liu, Bing Qin

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:19:41Z

**Summary**: Large Language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable abilities in understanding complex texts, offering a promising path towards human-like translation performance. However, this study reveals the misalignment between the translation-specific understanding and the general understanding inside LLMs. This understanding misalignment leads to LLMs mistakenly or literally translating some complicated concepts that they accurately comprehend in the general scenarios (e.g., QA). To align the translation-specific understanding to the general one, we propose a novel translation process, DUAT (Difficult words Understanding Aligned Translation), explicitly incorporating the general understanding on the complicated content incurring inconsistent understanding to guide the translation. Specifically, DUAT performs cross-lingual interpretation for the difficult-to-translate words and enhances the translation with the generated interpretations. Furthermore, we reframe the external tools to improve DUAT in detecting difficult words and generating helpful interpretations. We conduct experiments on the self-constructed benchmark Challenge-WMT, consisting of samples that are prone to mistranslation. Human evaluation results on high-resource and low-resource language pairs indicate that DUAT significantly facilitates the understanding alignment, which improves the translation quality (up to +3.85 COMET) and reduces the literality of the translation by -25% to -51%.

### Analysing the Residual Stream of Language Models Under Knowledge   Conflicts
**Authors**: Yu Zhao, Xiaotang Du, Giwon Hong, Aryo Pradipta Gema, Alessio Devoto, Hongru Wang, Xuanli He, Kam-Fai Wong, Pasquale Minervini

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:12:51Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can store a significant amount of factual knowledge in their parameters. However, their parametric knowledge may conflict with the information provided in the context. Such conflicts can lead to undesirable model behaviour, such as reliance on outdated or incorrect information. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can identify knowledge conflicts and whether it is possible to know which source of knowledge the model will rely on by analysing the residual stream of the LLM. Through probing tasks, we find that LLMs can internally register the signal of knowledge conflict in the residual stream, which can be accurately detected by probing the intermediate model activations. This allows us to detect conflicts within the residual stream before generating the answers without modifying the input or model parameters. Moreover, we find that the residual stream shows significantly different patterns when the model relies on contextual knowledge versus parametric knowledge to resolve conflicts. This pattern can be employed to estimate the behaviour of LLMs when conflict happens and prevent unexpected answers before producing the answers. Our analysis offers insights into how LLMs internally manage knowledge conflicts and provides a foundation for developing methods to control the knowledge selection processes.

**Authors**: Ali Anaissi, Ali Braytee, Junaid Akram

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:12:20Z

**Summary**: We present an advanced approach to medical question-answering (QA) services, using fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the accuracy and reliability of healthcare information. Our study focuses on optimizing models like LLaMA-2 and Mistral, which have shown great promise in delivering precise, reliable medical answers. By leveraging comprehensive datasets, we applied fine-tuning techniques such as rsDoRA+ and ReRAG. rsDoRA+ enhances model performance through a combination of decomposed model weights, varied learning rates for low-rank matrices, and rank stabilization, leading to improved efficiency. ReRAG, which integrates retrieval on demand and question rewriting, further refines the accuracy of the responses. This approach enables healthcare providers to access fast, dependable information, aiding in more efficient decision-making and fostering greater patient trust. Our work highlights the potential of fine-tuned LLMs to significantly improve the quality and accessibility of medical information services, ultimately contributing to better healthcare outcomes for all.

### CartesianMoE: Boosting Knowledge Sharing among Experts via Cartesian   Product Routing in Mixture-of-Experts
**Authors**: Zhenpeng Su, Xing Wu, Zijia Lin, Yizhe Xiong, Minxuan Lv, Guangyuan Ma, Hui Chen, Songlin Hu, Guiguang Ding

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:55:59Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLM) have been attracting much attention from the community recently, due to their remarkable performance in all kinds of downstream tasks. According to the well-known scaling law, scaling up a dense LLM enhances its capabilities, but also significantly increases the computational complexity. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models address that by allowing the model size to grow without substantially raising training or inference costs. Yet MoE models face challenges regarding knowledge sharing among experts, making their performance somehow sensitive to routing accuracy. To tackle that, previous works introduced shared experts and combined their outputs with those of the top $K$ routed experts in an ``addition'' manner. In this paper, inspired by collective matrix factorization to learn shared knowledge among data, we propose CartesianMoE, which implements more effective knowledge sharing among experts in more like a ``multiplication'' manner. Extensive experimental results indicate that CartesianMoE outperforms previous MoE models for building LLMs, in terms of both perplexity and downstream task performance. And we also find that CartesianMoE achieves better expert routing robustness.

### A PID-Controlled Non-Negative Tensor Factorization Model for Analyzing   Missing Data in NILM
**Authors**: DengYu Shi

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:53:11Z

**Summary**: With the growing demand for energy and increased environmental awareness, Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) has become an essential tool in smart grid and energy management. By analyzing total power load data, NILM infers the energy usage of individual appliances without the need for separate sensors, enabling real-time monitoring from a few locations. This approach helps users understand consumption patterns, enhance energy efficiency, and detect anomalies for effective energy management. However, NILM datasets often suffer from issues such as sensor failures and data loss, compromising data integrity, thereby impacting subsequent analysis and applications. Traditional imputation methods, such as linear interpolation and matrix factorization, struggle with nonlinear relationships and are sensitive to sparse data, resulting in information loss. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controlled Non-Negative Latent Factorization of Tensor (PNLF) model, which dynamically adjusts parameter gradients to improve convergence, stability, and accuracy. Experimental results show that the PNLF model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tensor completion models in both accuracy and efficiency. By addressing data loss issues, this study enhances load disaggregation precision and optimizes energy management, providing reliable data support for smart grid applications and policy formulation.

**Authors**: Jeremy Stephen Gabriel Yee Zhi Wen, Pai Chet Ng, Zhengkui Wang, Ian McLoughlin, Aik Beng Ng, Simon See

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:48:35Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a systematic review of the infrastructure requirements for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on-device within the context of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), focusing on both hardware and software perspectives. From the hardware viewpoint, we discuss the utilization of processing units like GPUs and TPUs, efficient memory and storage solutions, and strategies for effective deployment, addressing the challenges of limited computational resources typical in SME settings. From the software perspective, we explore framework compatibility, operating system optimization, and the use of specialized libraries tailored for resource-constrained environments. The review is structured to first identify the unique challenges faced by SMEs in deploying LLMs on-device, followed by an exploration of the opportunities that both hardware innovations and software adaptations offer to overcome these obstacles. Such a structured review provides practical insights, contributing significantly to the community by enhancing the technological resilience of SMEs in integrating LLMs.

### Rolling the DICE on Idiomaticity: How LLMs Fail to Grasp Context
**Authors**: Maggie Mi, Aline Villavicencio, Nafise Sadat Moosavi

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:47:37Z

**Summary**: Human processing of idioms relies on understanding the contextual sentences in which idioms occur, as well as language-intrinsic features such as frequency and speaker-intrinsic factors like familiarity. While LLMs have shown high performance on idiomaticity detection tasks, this success may be attributed to reasoning shortcuts in existing datasets. To this end, we construct a novel, controlled contrastive dataset designed to test whether LLMs can effectively use context to disambiguate idiomatic meaning. Additionally, we explore how collocational frequency and sentence probability influence model performance. Our findings reveal that LLMs often fail to resolve idiomaticity when it is required to attend to the surrounding context, and that models perform better on sentences that have higher likelihood. The collocational frequency of expressions also impacts performance. We make our code and dataset publicly available.

### Wasserstein Gradient Flow over Variational Parameter Space for   Variational Inference
**Authors**: Dai Hai Nguyen, Tetsuya Sakurai, Hiroshi Mamitsuka

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:33:15Z

**Summary**: Variational inference (VI) can be cast as an optimization problem in which the variational parameters are tuned to closely align a variational distribution with the true posterior. The optimization task can be approached through vanilla gradient descent in black-box VI or natural-gradient descent in natural-gradient VI. In this work, we reframe VI as the optimization of an objective that concerns probability distributions defined over a \textit{variational parameter space}. Subsequently, we propose Wasserstein gradient descent for tackling this optimization problem. Notably, the optimization techniques, namely black-box VI and natural-gradient VI, can be reinterpreted as specific instances of the proposed Wasserstein gradient descent. To enhance the efficiency of optimization, we develop practical methods for numerically solving the discrete gradient flows. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through empirical experiments on a synthetic dataset, supplemented by theoretical analyses.

### Latent Skill Discovery for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
**Authors**: Zifan Xu, Haozhu Wang, Dmitriy Bespalov, Xuan Wang, Peter Stone, Yanjun Qi

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:21:59Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a popular in-context learning (ICL) approach for large language models (LLMs), especially when tackling complex reasoning tasks. Traditional ICL approaches construct prompts using examples that contain questions similar to the input question. However, CoT prompting, which includes crucial intermediate reasoning steps (rationales) within its examples, necessitates selecting examples based on these rationales rather than the questions themselves. Existing methods require human experts or pre-trained LLMs to describe the skill, a high-level abstraction of rationales, to guide the selection. These methods, however, are often costly and difficult to scale. Instead, this paper introduces a new approach named Latent Reasoning Skills (LaRS) that employs unsupervised learning to create a latent space representation of rationales, with a latent variable called a reasoning skill. Concurrently, LaRS learns a reasoning policy to determine the required reasoning skill for a given question. Then the ICL examples are selected by aligning the reasoning skills between past examples and the question. This approach is theoretically grounded and compute-efficient, eliminating the need for auxiliary LLM inference or manual prompt design. Empirical results demonstrate that LaRS consistently outperforms SOTA skill-based selection methods, processing example banks four times faster, reducing LLM inferences during the selection stage by half, and showing greater robustness to sub-optimal example banks.

### Large Language Models Know What To Say But Not When To Speak
**Authors**: Muhammad Umair, Vasanth Sarathy, JP de Ruiter

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:20:25Z

**Summary**: Turn-taking is a fundamental mechanism in human communication that ensures smooth and coherent verbal interactions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have motivated their use in improving the turn-taking capabilities of Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS), such as their ability to respond at appropriate times. However, existing models often struggle to predict opportunities for speaking -- called Transition Relevance Places (TRPs) -- in natural, unscripted conversations, focusing only on turn-final TRPs and not within-turn TRPs. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel dataset of participant-labeled within-turn TRPs and use it to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in predicting opportunities for speaking. Our experiments reveal the current limitations of LLMs in modeling unscripted spoken interactions, highlighting areas for improvement and paving the way for more naturalistic dialogue systems.

### Optimal Communication and Key Rate Region for Hierarchical Secure   Aggregation with User Collusion
**Authors**: Xiang Zhang, Kai Wan, Hua Sun, Shiqiang Wang, Mingyue Ji, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:13:03Z

**Summary**: Secure aggregation is concerned with the task of securely uploading the inputs of multiple users to an aggregation server without letting the server know the inputs beyond their summation. It finds broad applications in distributed machine learning paradigms such as federated learning (FL) where multiple clients, each having access to a proprietary dataset, periodically upload their locally trained models (abstracted as inputs) to a parameter server which then generates an aggregate (e.g., averaged) model that is sent back to the clients as an initializing point for a new round of local training. To enhance the data privacy of the clients, secure aggregation protocols are developed using techniques from cryptography to ensure that the server infers no more information of the users' inputs beyond the desired aggregated input, even if the server can collude with some users. Although laying the ground for understanding the fundamental utility-security trade-off in secure aggregation, the simple star client-server architecture cannot capture more complex network architectures used in practical systems. Motivated by hierarchical federated learning, we investigate the secure aggregation problem in a $3$-layer hierarchical network consisting of clustered users connecting to an aggregation server through an intermediate layer of relays. Besides the conventional server security which requires that the server learns nothing beyond the desired sum of inputs, relay security is also imposed so that the relays infer nothing about the users' inputs and remain oblivious. For such a hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) problem, we characterize the optimal multifaceted trade-off between communication (in terms of user-to-relay and relay-to-server communication rates) and secret key generation efficiency (in terms of individual key and source key rates).

### Natural GaLore: Accelerating GaLore for memory-efficient LLM Training   and Fine-tuning
**Authors**: Arijit Das

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:05:06Z

**Summary**: Training LLMs presents significant memory challenges due to growing size of data, weights, and optimizer states. Techniques such as data and model parallelism, gradient checkpointing, and offloading strategies address this issue but are often infeasible due to hardware constraints. To mitigate memory usage, alternative methods like Parameter-Efficient-Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and GaLore approximate weights or optimizer states. PEFT methods, such as LoRA, have gained popularity for fine-tuning LLMs, though they require a full-rank warm start. In contrast, GaLore allows full-parameter learning while being more memory-efficient. This work introduces Natural GaLore, a simple drop in replacement for AdamW, which efficiently applies the inverse Empirical Fisher Information Matrix to low-rank gradients using Woodbury's Identity. We demonstrate that incorporating second-order information speeds up optimization significantly, especially when the iteration budget is limited. Empirical pretraining on 60M, 130M, 350M, and 1.1B parameter Llama models on C4 data demonstrate significantly lower perplexity over GaLore without additional memory overhead. By fine-tuning RoBERTa on the GLUE benchmark using Natural GaLore, we demonstrate significant reduction in gap 86.05% vs 86.28% for full-finetuning. Furthermore, fine-tuning the TinyLlama 1.1B model for function calling using the TinyAgent framework shows that Natural GaLore achieving 83.09% accuracy on the TinyAgent dataset, significantly outperforms 16-bit LoRA at 80.06% and even surpasses GPT4-Turbo by 4%, all while using 30% less memory.   All code to reproduce the results are available at: https://github.com/selfsupervised-ai/Natural-GaLore.git

### Beware of Words: Evaluating the Lexical Diversity of Conversational LLMs   using ChatGPT as Case Study
**Authors**: Gonzalo Martínez, José Alberto Hernández, Javier Conde, Pedro Reviriego, Elena Merino

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:02:00Z

**Summary**: The performance of conversational Large Language Models (LLMs) in general, and of ChatGPT in particular, is currently being evaluated on many different tasks, from logical reasoning or maths to answering questions on a myriad of topics. Instead, much less attention is being devoted to the study of the linguistic features of the texts generated by these LLMs. This is surprising since LLMs are models for language, and understanding how they use the language is important. Indeed, conversational LLMs are poised to have a significant impact on the evolution of languages as they may eventually dominate the creation of new text. This means that for example, if conversational LLMs do not use a word it may become less and less frequent and eventually stop being used altogether. Therefore, evaluating the linguistic features of the text they produce and how those depend on the model parameters is the first step toward understanding the potential impact of conversational LLMs on the evolution of languages. In this paper, we consider the evaluation of the lexical richness of the text generated by LLMs and how it depends on the model parameters. A methodology is presented and used to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of lexical richness using ChatGPT as a case study. The results show how lexical richness depends on the version of ChatGPT and some of its parameters, such as the presence penalty, or on the role assigned to the model. The dataset and tools used in our analysis are released under open licenses with the goal of drawing the much-needed attention to the evaluation of the linguistic features of LLM-generated text.

### A New Approach to Solving SMAC Task: Generating Decision Tree Code from   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yue Deng, Weiyu Ma, Yuxin Fan, Yin Zhang, Haifeng Zhang, Jian Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:58:38Z

**Summary**: StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) is one of the most commonly used experimental environments in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the specific task is to control a set number of allied units to defeat enemy forces. Traditional MARL algorithms often require interacting with the environment for up to 1 million steps to train a model, and the resulting policies are typically non-interpretable with weak transferability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solving SMAC tasks called LLM-SMAC. In our framework, agents leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate decision tree code by providing task descriptions. The model is further self-reflection using feedback from the rewards provided by the environment. We conduct experiments in the SMAC and demonstrate that our method can produce high-quality, interpretable decision trees with minimal environmental exploration. Moreover, these models exhibit strong transferability, successfully applying to similar SMAC environments without modification. We believe this approach offers a new direction for solving decision-making tasks in the future.

**Summary**: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enable models to generalize to unseen target domains by learning from multiple source domains. Existing DG methods primarily rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which inherently learn texture biases due to their limited receptive fields, making them prone to overfitting source domains. While some works have introduced transformer-based methods (ViTs) for DG to leverage the global receptive field, these methods incur high computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Recently, advanced state space models (SSMs), represented by Mamba, have shown promising results in supervised learning tasks by achieving linear complexity in sequence length during training and fast RNN-like computation during inference. Inspired by this, we investigate the generalization ability of the Mamba model under domain shifts and find that input-dependent matrices within SSMs could accumulate and amplify domain-specific features, thus hindering model generalization. To address this issue, we propose a novel SSM-based architecture with saliency-based token-aware transformation (namely START), which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances and offers a competitive alternative to CNNs and ViTs. Our START can selectively perturb and suppress domain-specific features in salient tokens within the input-dependent matrices of SSMs, thus effectively reducing the discrepancy between different domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that START outperforms existing SOTA DG methods with efficient linear complexity. Our code is available at https://github.com/lingeringlight/START.

### Semiparametric Bayesian Inference for a Conditional Moment Equality   Model
**Authors**: Christopher D. Walker

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:49:38Z

**Summary**: Conditional moment equality models are regularly encountered in empirical economics, yet they are difficult to estimate. These models map a conditional distribution of data to a structural parameter via the restriction that a conditional mean equals zero. Using this observation, I introduce a Bayesian inference framework in which an unknown conditional distribution is replaced with a nonparametric posterior, and structural parameter inference is then performed using an implied posterior. The method has the same flexibility as frequentist semiparametric estimators and does not require converting conditional moments to unconditional moments. Importantly, I prove a semiparametric Bernstein-von Mises theorem, providing conditions under which, in large samples, the posterior for the structural parameter is approximately normal, centered at an efficient estimator, and has variance equal to the Chamberlain (1987) semiparametric efficiency bound. As byproducts, I show that Bayesian uncertainty quantification methods are asymptotically optimal frequentist confidence sets and derive low-level sufficient conditions for Gaussian process priors. The latter sheds light on a key prior stability condition and relates to the numerical aspects of the paper in which these priors are used to predict the welfare effects of price changes.

### Identifying new high-confidence polluted white dwarf candidates using   Gaia XP spectra and Self-Organizing Maps
**Authors**: Xabier Pérez-Couto, Lara Pallas-Quintela, Minia Manteiga, Eva Villaver, Carlos Dafonte

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:48:52Z

**Summary**: The identification of new white dwarfs (WDs) polluted with heavy elements is important since they provide a valuable tool for inferring chemical properties of putative planetary systems accreting material on their surfaces. The Gaia space mission has provided us with an unprecedented amount of astrometric, photometric, and low resolution (XP) spectroscopic data for millions of newly discovered stellar sources, among them thousands of WDs. In order to find WDs among this data and to identify which ones have metals in their atmospheres, we propose a methodology based on an unsupervised artificial intelligence technique called Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). In our approach a nonlinear high-dimensional dataset is projected on a 2D grid map where similar elements fall into the same neuron.   By applying this method, we obtained a clean sample of 66,337 WDs. We performed an automatic spectral classification analysis to them, obtaining 143 bona fide polluted WD candidates not previously classified in the literature. The majority of them are cool WDs and we identify in their XP spectra several metallic lines such as Ca, Mg, Na, Li, and K. The fact that we obtain similar precision metrics than those achieved with recent supervised techniques highlights the power of our unsupervised approach to mine the Gaia archives for hidden treasures to follow-up spectroscopically with higher resolution.

### Are Language Model Logits Calibrated?
**Authors**: Charles Lovering, Michael Krumdick, Viet Dac Lai, Nilesh Kumar, Varshini Reddy, Rik Koncel-Kedziorski, Chris Tanner

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:41:15Z

**Summary**: Some information is factual (e.g., "Paris is in France"), whereas other information is probabilistic (e.g., "the coin flip will be a [Heads/Tails]."). We believe that good Language Models (LMs) should understand and reflect this nuance. Our work investigates this by testing if LMs' output probabilities are calibrated to their textual contexts. We define model "calibration" as the degree to which the output probabilities of candidate tokens are aligned with the relative likelihood that should be inferred from the given context. For example, if the context concerns two equally likely options (e.g., heads or tails for a fair coin), the output probabilities should reflect this. Likewise, context that concerns non-uniformly likely events (e.g., rolling a six with a die) should also be appropriately captured with proportionate output probabilities. We find that even in simple settings the best LMs (1) are poorly calibrated, and (2) have systematic biases (e.g., preferred colors and sensitivities to word orderings). For example, gpt-4o-mini often picks the first of two options presented in the prompt regardless of the options' implied likelihood, whereas Llama-3.1-8B picks the second. Our other consistent finding is mode-collapse: Instruction-tuned models often over-allocate probability mass on a single option. These systematic biases introduce non-intuitive model behavior, making models harder for users to understand.

### Bypass Back-propagation: Optimization-based Structural Pruning for Large   Language Models via Policy Gradient
**Authors**: Yuan Gao, Zujing Liu, Weizhong Zhang, Bo Du, Gui-Song Xia

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:39:32Z

**Summary**: In contrast to moderate-size neural network pruning, structural weight pruning on the Large-Language Models (LLMs) imposes a novel challenge on the efficiency of the pruning algorithms, due to the heavy computation/memory demands of the LLMs. Recent efficient LLM pruning methods typically operate at the post-training phase without the expensive weight finetuning, however, their pruning criteria often rely on heuristically hand-crafted metrics, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. We instead propose a novel optimization-based structural pruning that learns the pruning masks in a probabilistic space directly by optimizing the loss of the pruned model. To preserve the efficiency, our method eliminates the back-propagation through the LLM per se during the optimization, requiring only the forward pass of the LLM. We achieve this by learning an underlying Bernoulli distribution to sample binary pruning masks, where we decouple the Bernoulli parameters from the LLM loss, thus facilitating an efficient optimization via a policy gradient estimator without back-propagation. As a result, our method is able to 1) operate at structural granularities of channels, heads, and layers, 2) support global and heterogeneous pruning (i.e., our method automatically determines different redundancy for different layers), and 3) optionally initialize with a metric-based method (for our Bernoulli distributions). Extensive experiments on LLaMA, LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, Vicuna, and Mistral using the C4 and WikiText2 datasets demonstrate that our method operates for 2.7 hours with around 35GB memory for the 13B models on a single A100 GPU, and our pruned models outperform the state-of-the-arts w.r.t. both perplexity and the majority of various zero-shot tasks. Codes will be released.

### Exploring Continual Fine-Tuning for Enhancing Language Ability in Large   Language Model
**Authors**: Divyanshu Aggarwal, Sankarshan Damle, Navin Goyal, Satya Lokam, Sunayana Sitaram

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:39:03Z

**Summary**: A common challenge towards the adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to learn new languages over time without hampering the model's performance on languages in which the model is already proficient (usually English). Continual fine-tuning (CFT) is the process of sequentially fine-tuning an LLM to enable the model to adapt to downstream tasks with varying data distributions and time shifts. This paper focuses on the language adaptability of LLMs through CFT. We study a two-phase CFT process in which an English-only end-to-end fine-tuned LLM from Phase 1 (predominantly Task Ability) is sequentially fine-tuned on a multilingual dataset -- comprising task data in new languages -- in Phase 2 (predominantly Language Ability). We observe that the ``similarity'' of Phase 2 tasks with Phase 1 determines the LLM's adaptability. For similar phase-wise datasets, the LLM after Phase 2 does not show deterioration in task ability. In contrast, when the phase-wise datasets are not similar, the LLM's task ability deteriorates. We test our hypothesis on the open-source \mis\ and \llm\ models with multiple phase-wise dataset pairs. To address the deterioration, we analyze tailored variants of two CFT methods: layer freezing and generative replay. Our findings demonstrate their effectiveness in enhancing the language ability of LLMs while preserving task performance, in comparison to relevant baselines.

### DISCO: Efficient Diffusion Solver for Large-Scale Combinatorial   Optimization Problems
**Authors**: Kexiong Yu, Hang Zhao, Yuhang Huang, Renjiao Yi, Kai Xu, Chenyang Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:38:48Z

**Summary**: Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems are fundamentally important in numerous real-world applications across diverse industries, characterized by entailing enormous solution space and demanding time-sensitive response. Despite recent advancements in neural solvers, their limited expressiveness struggles to capture the multi-modal nature of CO landscapes. While some research has shifted towards diffusion models, these models still sample solutions indiscriminately from the entire NP-complete solution space with time-consuming denoising processes, which limit their practicality for large problem scales. We propose DISCO, an efficient DIffusion Solver for large-scale Combinatorial Optimization problems that excels in both solution quality and inference speed. DISCO's efficacy is twofold: First, it enhances solution quality by constraining the sampling space to a more meaningful domain guided by solution residues, while preserving the multi-modal properties of the output distributions. Second, it accelerates the denoising process through an analytically solvable approach, enabling solution sampling with minimal reverse-time steps and significantly reducing inference time. DISCO delivers strong performance on large-scale Traveling Salesman Problems and challenging Maximal Independent Set benchmarks, with inference time up to 5.28 times faster than other diffusion alternatives. By incorporating a divide-and-conquer strategy, DISCO can well generalize to solve unseen-scale problem instances, even surpassing models specifically trained for those scales.

### Steering Knowledge Selection Behaviours in LLMs via SAE-Based   Representation Engineering
**Authors**: Yu Zhao, Alessio Devoto, Giwon Hong, Xiaotang Du, Aryo Pradipta Gema, Hongru Wang, Kam-Fai Wong, Pasquale Minervini

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:30:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can store a significant amount of factual knowledge in their parameters. However, their parametric knowledge may conflict with the information provided in the context -- this phenomenon, known as \emph{context-memory knowledge conflicts}, can lead to undesirable model behaviour, such as reliance on outdated or incorrect information. Analysing the internal activations of LLMs, we find that they can internally register the signals of knowledge conflict at mid-layers. Such signals allow us to detect whether a knowledge conflict occurs and use \emph{inference-time} intervention strategies to resolve it. In this work, we propose \textsc{SpARE}, a \emph{training-free} representation engineering method that uses pre-trained sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) to control the knowledge selection behaviour of LLMs. \textsc{SpARE} identifies the functional features that control the knowledge selection behaviours and applies them to edit the internal activations of LLMs at inference time. Our experimental results show that \textsc{SpARE} can effectively control the usage of either knowledge source to resolve knowledge conflict in open-domain question-answering tasks, surpassing existing representation engineering methods ($+10\%$) as well as contrastive decoding methods ($+15\%$).

### Selection-p: Self-Supervised Task-Agnostic Prompt Compression for   Faithfulness and Transferability
**Authors**: Tsz Ting Chung, Leyang Cui, Lemao Liu, Xinting Huang, Shuming Shi, Dit-Yan Yeung

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:11:44Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of natural language processing tasks when leveraging in-context learning. To mitigate the additional computational and financial costs associated with in-context learning, several prompt compression methods have been proposed to compress the in-context learning prompts. Despite their success, these methods face challenges with transferability due to model-specific compression, or rely on external training data, such as GPT-4. In this paper, we investigate the ability of LLMs to develop a unified compression method that discretizes uninformative tokens, utilizing a self-supervised pre-training technique. By introducing a small number of parameters during the continual pre-training, the proposed Selection-p produces a probability for each input token, indicating whether to preserve or discard it. Experiments show Selection-p achieves state-of-the-art performance across numerous classification tasks, achieving compression rates of up to 10 times while experiencing only a marginal 0.8% decrease in performance. Moreover, it exhibits superior transferability to different models compared to prior work. Additionally, we further analyze how Selection-p helps maintain performance on in-context learning with long contexts.

### Granularity Matters in Long-Tail Learning
**Authors**: Shizhen Zhao, Xin Wen, Jiahui Liu, Chuofan Ma, Chunfeng Yuan, Xiaojuan Qi

**Updated**: 2024-10-22T06:35:13Z

**Summary**: Balancing training on long-tail data distributions remains a long-standing challenge in deep learning. While methods such as re-weighting and re-sampling help alleviate the imbalance issue, limited sample diversity continues to hinder models from learning robust and generalizable feature representations, particularly for tail classes. In contrast to existing methods, we offer a novel perspective on long-tail learning, inspired by an observation: datasets with finer granularity tend to be less affected by data imbalance. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon through both quantitative and qualitative studies, showing that increased granularity enhances the generalization of learned features in tail categories. Motivated by these findings, we propose a method to increase dataset granularity through category extrapolation. Specifically, we introduce open-set auxiliary classes that are visually similar to existing ones, aiming to enhance representation learning for both head and tail classes. This forms the core contribution and insight of our approach. To automate the curation of auxiliary data, we leverage large language models (LLMs) as knowledge bases to search for auxiliary categories and retrieve relevant images through web crawling. To prevent the overwhelming presence of auxiliary classes from disrupting training, we introduce a neighbor-silencing loss that encourages the model to focus on class discrimination within the target dataset. During inference, the classifier weights for auxiliary categories are masked out, leaving only the target class weights for use. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three standard long-tail benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, notably outperforming strong baseline methods that use the same amount of data. The code will be made publicly available.

### PROMPTHEUS: A Human-Centered Pipeline to Streamline SLRs with LLMs
**Authors**: João Pedro Fernandes Torres, Catherine Muligan, Joaquim Jorge, Catarina Moreira

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:05:33Z

**Summary**: The growing volume of academic publications poses significant challenges for researchers conducting timely and accurate Systematic Literature Reviews, particularly in fast-evolving fields like artificial intelligence. This growth of academic literature also makes it increasingly difficult for lay people to access scientific knowledge effectively, meaning academic literature is often misrepresented in the popular press and, more broadly, in society. Traditional SLR methods are labor-intensive and error-prone, and they struggle to keep up with the rapid pace of new research. To address these issues, we developed \textit{PROMPTHEUS}: an AI-driven pipeline solution that automates the SLR process using Large Language Models. We aimed to enhance efficiency by reducing the manual workload while maintaining the precision and coherence required for comprehensive literature synthesis. PROMPTHEUS automates key stages of the SLR process, including systematic search, data extraction, topic modeling using BERTopic, and summarization with transformer models. Evaluations conducted across five research domains demonstrate that PROMPTHEUS reduces review time, achieves high precision, and provides coherent topic organization, offering a scalable and effective solution for conducting literature reviews in an increasingly crowded research landscape. In addition, such tools may reduce the increasing mistrust in science by making summarization more accessible to laypeople.   The code for this project can be found on the GitHub repository at https://github.com/joaopftorres/PROMPTHEUS.git

### Enabling Energy-Efficient Deployment of Large Language Models on   Memristor Crossbar: A Synergy of Large and Small
**Authors**: Zhehui Wang, Tao Luo, Cheng Liu, Weichen Liu, Rick Siow Mong Goh, Weng-Fai Wong

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:04:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered substantial attention due to their promising applications in diverse domains. Nevertheless, the increasing size of LLMs comes with a significant surge in the computational requirements for training and deployment. Memristor crossbars have emerged as a promising solution, which demonstrated a small footprint and remarkably high energy efficiency in computer vision (CV) models. Memristors possess higher density compared to conventional memory technologies, making them highly suitable for effectively managing the extreme model size associated with LLMs. However, deploying LLMs on memristor crossbars faces three major challenges. Firstly, the size of LLMs increases rapidly, already surpassing the capabilities of state-of-the-art memristor chips. Secondly, LLMs often incorporate multi-head attention blocks, which involve non-weight stationary multiplications that traditional memristor crossbars cannot support. Third, while memristor crossbars excel at performing linear operations, they are not capable of executing complex nonlinear operations in LLM such as softmax and layer normalization. To address these challenges, we present a novel architecture for the memristor crossbar that enables the deployment of state-of-the-art LLM on a single chip or package, eliminating the energy and time inefficiencies associated with off-chip communication. Our testing on BERT_Large showed negligible accuracy loss. Compared to traditional memristor crossbars, our architecture achieves enhancements of up to 39X in area overhead and 18X in energy consumption. Compared to modern TPU/GPU systems, our architecture demonstrates at least a 68X reduction in the area-delay product and a significant 69% energy consumption reduction.

### OAEI-LLM: A Benchmark Dataset for Understanding Large Language Model   Hallucinations in Ontology Matching
**Authors**: Zhangcheng Qiang, Kerry Taylor, Weiqing Wang, Jing Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T12:54:33Z

**Summary**: Hallucinations of large language models (LLMs) commonly occur in domain-specific downstream tasks, with no exception in ontology matching (OM). The prevalence of using LLMs for OM raises the need for benchmarks to better understand LLM hallucinations. The OAEI-LLM dataset is an extended version of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) datasets that evaluate LLM-specific hallucinations in OM tasks. We outline the methodology used in dataset construction and schema extension, and provide examples of potential use cases.

### VeLoRA: Memory Efficient Training using Rank-1 Sub-Token Projections
**Authors**: Roy Miles, Pradyumna Reddy, Ismail Elezi, Jiankang Deng

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T12:53:21Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for tackling many language-processing tasks. Despite their success, training and fine-tuning these models is still far too computationally and memory intensive. In this paper, we identify and characterise the important components needed for effective model convergence using gradient descent. In doing so we find that the intermediate activations used to implement backpropagation can be excessively compressed without incurring any degradation in performance. This result leads us to a cheap and memory-efficient algorithm for both fine-tuning and pre-training LLMs. The proposed algorithm simply divides the tokens up into smaller sub-tokens before projecting them onto a fixed 1-dimensional subspace during the forward pass. These features are then coarsely reconstructed during the backward pass to implement the update rules. We confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm as being complimentary to many state-of-the-art PEFT methods on the VTAB-1k fine-tuning benchmark. Furthermore, we outperform QLoRA for fine-tuning LLaMA and show competitive performance against other memory-efficient pre-training methods on the large-scale C4 dataset.

### Self-Explained Keywords Empower Large Language Models for Code   Generation
**Authors**: Lishui Fan, Mouxiang Chen, Zhongxin Liu

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T12:52:03Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in code generation. However, due to the long-tail distribution of LLMs' training data, low-frequency terms are typically underrepresented in the training process. Consequently, LLMs often misunderstand or overlook problem-specific, low-frequency keywords during code generation, compromising the accuracy of the generated code. To address this, we propose a novel technique named SEK(\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{E}xplained \textbf{K}eywords), which empowers an LLM for better code generation by extracting and explaining the key terms in the problem description with the LLM itself and ranking them based on frequency. Comprehensive experiments across three benchmarks, i.e., HumanEval(+), MBPP(+), and APPS, with five representative LLMs, show that SEK can significantly improve LLMs in code generation, yielding substantial and consistent gains. For instance, SEK improves the Pass@1 of DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct from 85.4\% to 93.3\% on the Humaneval benchmark. Further analysis confirms that SEK enables the LLMs to shift their attention from low-frequency keywords to their corresponding high-frequency counterparts.

### Partial Orientation Retrieval of Proteins From Coulomb Explosions
**Authors**: Tomas André, Emiliano De Santis, Nicusor Timneanu, Carl Caleman

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T12:50:38Z

**Summary**: Single Particle Imaging techniques at X-ray lasers have made significant strides, yet the challenge of determining the orientation of freely rotating molecules during delivery remains. In this study, we propose a novel method to partially retrieve the relative orientation of proteins exposed to ultrafast X-ray pulses by analyzing the fragmentation patterns resulting from Coulomb explosions. We simulate these explosions for 45 proteins in the size range 100 -- 4000 atoms using a hybrid Monte Carlo/Molecular Dynamics approach and capture the resulting ion ejection patterns with virtual detectors. Our goal is to exploit information from the explosion to infer orientations of proteins at the time of X-ray exposure. Our results demonstrate that partial orientation information can be extracted, particularly for larger proteins. Our findings can be integrated into existing reconstruction algorithms such as Expand-Maximize-Compress, to improve their efficiency and reduce the need for high-quality diffraction patterns. This method offers a promising avenue for enhancing Single Particle Imaging by leveraging measurable data from the Coulomb explosion to provide valuable insights about orientation.

### INC-Math: Integrating Natural Language and Code for Enhanced   Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Xuyuan Xiong, Simeng Han, Ziyue Zhou, Arman Cohan

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T12:48:58Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly used to generate solutions for mathematical reasoning problems in the following formats: natural language, code, or a combination of both. In this paper, we explore fundamental questions related to solving mathematical reasoning problems using natural language and code with state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.1-8b-Turbo. Our findings show that LLMs are better at reasoning in natural language compared to code. Additionally, although natural language and code serve as complementary forms of reasoning, they can affect each other in a negative way in certain scenarios. These insights motivate our development of a new prompting method, INC-Math, which leverages an LLM to dynamically select the most appropriate reasoning form, resulting in improved performance over comparable baselines with GPT-4o-mini.

### A Differentially Private Energy Trading Mechanism Approaching Social   Optimum
**Authors**: Yuji Cao, Yue Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T12:36:33Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a differentially private energy trading mechanism for prosumers in peer-to-peer (P2P) markets, offering provable privacy guarantees while approaching the Nash equilibrium with nearly socially optimal efficiency. We first model the P2P energy trading as a (generalized) Nash game and prove the vulnerability of traditional distributed algorithms to privacy attacks through an adversarial inference model. To address this challenge, we develop a privacy-preserving Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm incorporating carefully calibrated Laplacian noise. We prove that the proposed algorithm achieves $\epsilon$-differential privacy while converging in expectation to the Nash equilibrium with a suitable stepsize. Numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the algorithm's robustness against privacy attacks, convergence behavior, and optimality compared to the non-private solution. Results demonstrate that our mechanism effectively protects prosumers' sensitive information while maintaining near-optimal market outcomes, offering a practical approach for privacy-preserving coordination in P2P markets.

### CamI2V: Camera-Controlled Image-to-Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Guangcong Zheng, Teng Li, Rui Jiang, Yehao Lu, Tao Wu, Xi Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-22T06:26:45Z

**Summary**: Recently, camera pose, as a user-friendly and physics-related condition, has been introduced into text-to-video diffusion model for camera control. However, existing methods simply inject camera conditions through a side input. These approaches neglect the inherent physical knowledge of camera pose, resulting in imprecise camera control, inconsistencies, and also poor interpretability. In this paper, we emphasize the necessity of integrating explicit physical constraints into model design. Epipolar attention is proposed for modeling all cross-frame relationships from a novel perspective of noised condition. This ensures that features are aggregated from corresponding epipolar lines in all noised frames, overcoming the limitations of current attention mechanisms in tracking displaced features across frames, especially when features move significantly with the camera and become obscured by noise. Additionally, we introduce register tokens to handle cases without intersections between frames, commonly caused by rapid camera movements, dynamic objects, or occlusions. To support image-to-video, we propose the multiple guidance scale to allow for precise control for image, text, and camera, respectively. Furthermore, we establish a more robust and reproducible evaluation pipeline to solve the inaccuracy and instability of existing camera control measurement. We achieve a 25.5% improvement in camera controllability on RealEstate10K while maintaining strong generalization to out-of-domain images. Only 24GB and 12GB are required for training and inference, respectively. We plan to release checkpoints, along with training and evaluation codes.

### Do Large Language Models Have an English Accent? Evaluating and   Improving the Naturalness of Multilingual LLMs
**Authors**: Yanzhu Guo, Simone Conia, Zelin Zhou, Min Li, Saloni Potdar, Henry Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T12:34:17Z

**Summary**: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly designed with English as the primary language, and even the few that are multilingual tend to exhibit strong English-centric biases. Much like speakers who might produce awkward expressions when learning a second language, LLMs often generate unnatural outputs in non-English languages, reflecting English-centric patterns in both vocabulary and grammar. Despite the importance of this issue, the naturalness of multilingual LLM outputs has received limited attention. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing novel automatic corpus-level metrics to assess the lexical and syntactic naturalness of LLM outputs in a multilingual context. Using our new metrics, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on a curated benchmark in French and Chinese, revealing a tendency towards English-influenced patterns. To mitigate this issue, we also propose a simple and effective alignment method to improve the naturalness of an LLM in a target language and domain, achieving consistent improvements in naturalness without compromising the performance on general-purpose benchmarks. Our work highlights the importance of developing multilingual metrics, resources and methods for the new wave of multilingual LLMs.

### The mutual arrangement of Wright-Fisher diffusion path measures and its   impact on parameter estimation
**Authors**: Paul A. Jenkins

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T12:34:14Z

**Summary**: The Wright-Fisher diffusion is a fundamentally important model of evolution encompassing genetic drift, mutation, and natural selection. Suppose you want to infer the parameters associated with these processes from an observed sample path. Then to write down the likelihood one first needs to know the mutual arrangement of two path measures under different parametrizations; that is, whether they are absolutely continuous, equivalent, singular, and so on. In this paper we give a complete answer to this question by finding the separating times for the diffusion - the stopping time before which one measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the other and after which the pair is mutually singular. In one dimension this extends a classical result of Dawson on the local equivalence between neutral and non-neutral Wright-Fisher diffusion measures. Along the way we also develop new zero-one type laws for the diffusion on its approach to, and emergence from, the boundary. As an application we derive an explicit expression for the joint maximum likelihood estimator of the mutation and selection parameters and show that its convergence properties are closely related to the separating time.

**Authors**: Ayman Asad Khan, Md Toufique Hasan, Kai Kristian Kemell, Jussi Rasku, Pekka Abrahamsson

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T12:21:49Z

**Summary**: This paper presents an experience report on the development of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using PDF documents as the primary data source. The RAG architecture combines generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the precision of information retrieval. This approach has the potential to redefine how we interact with and augment both structured and unstructured knowledge in generative models to enhance transparency, accuracy, and contextuality of responses. The paper details the end-to-end pipeline, from data collection, preprocessing, to retrieval indexing and response generation, highlighting technical challenges and practical solutions. We aim to offer insights to researchers and practitioners developing similar systems using two distinct approaches: OpenAI's Assistant API with GPT Series and Llama's open-source models. The practical implications of this research lie in enhancing the reliability of generative AI systems in various sectors where domain-specific knowledge and real-time information retrieval is important. The Python code used in this work is also available at: https://github.com/GPT-Laboratory/RAG-LLM-Development-Guidebook-from-PDFs.

### CausalGraph2LLM: Evaluating LLMs for Causal Queries
**Authors**: Ivaxi Sheth, Bahare Fatemi, Mario Fritz

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T12:12:21Z

**Summary**: Causality is essential in scientific research, enabling researchers to interpret true relationships between variables. These causal relationships are often represented by causal graphs, which are directed acyclic graphs. With the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an increasing interest in exploring their capabilities in causal reasoning and their potential use to hypothesize causal graphs. These tasks necessitate the LLMs to encode the causal graph effectively for subsequent downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive benchmark, \emph{CausalGraph2LLM}, encompassing a variety of causal graph settings to assess the causal graph understanding capability of LLMs. We categorize the causal queries into two types: graph-level and node-level queries. We benchmark both open-sourced and closed models for our study. Our findings reveal that while LLMs show promise in this domain, they are highly sensitive to the encoding used. Even capable models like GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 exhibit sensitivity to encoding, with deviations of about $60\%$. We further demonstrate this sensitivity for downstream causal intervention tasks. Moreover, we observe that LLMs can often display biases when presented with contextual information about a causal graph, potentially stemming from their parametric memory.

### Claim Check-Worthiness Detection: How Well do LLMs Grasp Annotation   Guidelines?
**Authors**: Laura Majer, Jan Šnajder

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T11:33:33Z

**Summary**: The increasing threat of disinformation calls for automating parts of the fact-checking pipeline. Identifying text segments requiring fact-checking is known as claim detection (CD) and claim check-worthiness detection (CW), the latter incorporating complex domain-specific criteria of worthiness and often framed as a ranking task. Zero- and few-shot LLM prompting is an attractive option for both tasks, as it bypasses the need for labeled datasets and allows verbalized claim and worthiness criteria to be directly used for prompting. We evaluate the LLMs' predictive and calibration accuracy on five CD/CW datasets from diverse domains, each utilizing a different worthiness criterion. We investigate two key aspects: (1) how best to distill factuality and worthiness criteria into a prompt and (2) what amount of context to provide for each claim. To this end, we experiment with varying the level of prompt verbosity and the amount of contextual information provided to the model. Our results show that optimal prompt verbosity is domain-dependent, adding context does not improve performance, and confidence scores can be directly used to produce reliable check-worthiness rankings.

### Diverse Policies Recovering via Pointwise Mutual Information Weighted   Imitation Learning
**Authors**: Hanlin Yang, Jian Yao, Weiming Liu, Qing Wang, Hanmin Qin, Hansheng Kong, Kirk Tang, Jiechao Xiong, Chao Yu, Kai Li, Junliang Xing, Hongwu Chen, Juchao Zhuo, Qiang Fu, Yang Wei, Haobo Fu

**Updated**: 2024-10-22T05:06:36Z

**Summary**: Recovering a spectrum of diverse policies from a set of expert trajectories is an important research topic in imitation learning. After determining a latent style for a trajectory, previous diverse policies recovering methods usually employ a vanilla behavioral cloning learning objective conditioned on the latent style, treating each state-action pair in the trajectory with equal importance. Based on an observation that in many scenarios, behavioral styles are often highly relevant with only a subset of state-action pairs, this paper presents a new principled method in diverse polices recovery. In particular, after inferring or assigning a latent style for a trajectory, we enhance the vanilla behavioral cloning by incorporating a weighting mechanism based on pointwise mutual information. This additional weighting reflects the significance of each state-action pair's contribution to learning the style, thus allowing our method to focus on state-action pairs most representative of that style. We provide theoretical justifications for our new objective, and extensive empirical evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our method in recovering diverse policies from expert data.

### Few-sample Variational Inference of Bayesian Neural Networks with   Arbitrary Nonlinearities
**Authors**: David J. Schodt

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T11:26:32Z

**Summary**: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) extend traditional neural networks to provide uncertainties associated with their outputs. On the forward pass through a BNN, predictions (and their uncertainties) are made either by Monte Carlo sampling network weights from the learned posterior or by analytically propagating statistical moments through the network. Though flexible, Monte Carlo sampling is computationally expensive and can be infeasible or impractical under resource constraints or for large networks. While moment propagation can ameliorate the computational costs of BNN inference, it can be difficult or impossible for networks with arbitrary nonlinearities, thereby restricting the possible set of network layers permitted with such a scheme. In this work, we demonstrate a simple yet effective approach for propagating statistical moments through arbitrary nonlinearities with only 3 deterministic samples, enabling few-sample variational inference of BNNs without restricting the set of network layers used. Furthermore, we leverage this approach to demonstrate a novel nonlinear activation function that we use to inject physics-informed prior information into output nodes of a BNN.

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T11:26:20Z

**Summary**: The ease of access to large language models (LLMs) has enabled a widespread of machine-generated texts, and now it is often hard to tell whether a piece of text was human-written or machine-generated. This raises concerns about potential misuse, particularly within educational and academic domains. Thus, it is important to develop practical systems that can automate the process. Here, we present one such system, LLM-DetectAIve, designed for fine-grained detection. Unlike most previous work on machine-generated text detection, which focused on binary classification, LLM-DetectAIve supports four categories: (i) human-written, (ii) machine-generated, (iii) machine-written, then machine-humanized, and (iv) human-written, then machine-polished. Category (iii) aims to detect attempts to obfuscate the fact that a text was machine-generated, while category (iv) looks for cases where the LLM was used to polish a human-written text, which is typically acceptable in academic writing, but not in education. Our experiments show that LLM-DetectAIve can effectively identify the above four categories, which makes it a potentially useful tool in education, academia, and other domains.   LLM-DetectAIve is publicly accessible at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/LLM-DetectAIve. The video describing our system is available at https://youtu.be/E8eT_bE7k8c.

**Authors**: Lars Dingeldein, Pilar Cossio, Roberto Covino

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T11:17:18Z

**Summary**: Single-molecule experiments are a unique tool to characterize the structural dynamics of biomolecules. However, reconstructing molecular details from noisy single-molecule data is challenging. Simulation-based inference (SBI) integrates statistical inference, physics-based simulators, and machine learning and is emerging as a powerful framework for analysing complex experimental data. Recent advances in deep learning have accelerated the development of new SBI methods, enabling the application of Bayesian inference to an ever-increasing number of scientific problems. Here, we review the nascent application of SBI to the analysis of single-molecule experiments. We introduce parametric Bayesian inference and discuss its limitations. We then overview emerging deep-learning-based SBI methods to perform Bayesian inference for complex models encoded in computer simulators. We illustrate the first applications of SBI to single-molecule force-spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy experiments. SBI allows us to leverage powerful computer algorithms modeling complex biomolecular phenomena to connect scientific models and experiments in a principled way.

### StrucText-Eval: Evaluating Large Language Model's Reasoning Ability in   Structure-Rich Text
**Authors**: Zhouhong Gu, Haoning Ye, Xingzhou Chen, Zeyang Zhou, Hongwei Feng, Yanghua Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T11:06:06Z

**Summary**: The effective utilization of structured data, integral to corporate data strategies, has been challenged by the rise of large language models (LLMs) capable of processing unstructured information. This shift prompts the question: can LLMs interpret structured data directly in its unstructured form? We propose an automatic evaluation data generation method for assessing LLMs' reasoning capabilities on structure-rich text to explore this. Our approach supports 8 structured languages and 29 tasks, generating data with adjustable complexity through controllable nesting and structural width. We introduce StrucText-Eval, a benchmark containing 5,800 pre-generated and annotated samples designed to evaluate how well LLMs understand and reason through structured text. StrucText-Eval is divided into two suites: a regular Test suite (3,712 samples) and a Test-Hard suite (2,088 samples), the latter emphasizing the gap between human and model performance on more complex tasks. Experimental results show that while open-source LLMs achieve a maximum accuracy of 74.9\% on the standard dataset, their performance drops significantly to 45.8\% on the harder dataset. In contrast, human participants reach an accuracy of 92.6\% on StrucText-Eval-Hard, highlighting LLMs' current limitations in handling intricate structural information. The benchmark and generation codes are open sourced in \url{https://github.com/MikeGu721/StrucText-Eval}

### How to Build a Pre-trained Multimodal model for Simultaneously Chatting   and Decision-making?
**Authors**: Zuojin Tang, Bin Hu, Chenyang Zhao, De Ma, Gang Pan, Bin Liu

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T11:02:42Z

**Summary**: Existing large pre-trained models typically map text input to text output in an end-to-end manner, such as ChatGPT, or map a segment of text input to a hierarchy of action decisions, such as OpenVLA. However, humans can simultaneously generate text and actions when receiving specific input signals. For example, a driver can make precise driving decisions while conversing with a friend in the passenger seat. Motivated by this observation, we consider the following question in this work: is it possible to construct a pre-trained model that can provide both language interaction and precise decision-making capabilities in dynamic open scenarios. We provide a definitive answer to this question by developing a new model architecture termed Visual Language Action model for Chatting and Decision Making (VLA4CD), and further demonstrating its performance in challenging autonomous driving tasks. Specifically, we leverage LoRA to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM with data of multiple modalities covering language, visual, and action. Unlike the existing LoRA operations used for LLM fine-tuning, we have designed new computational modules and training cost functions for VLA4CD. These designs enable VLA4CD to provide continuous-valued action decisions while outputting text responses. In contrast, existing LLMs can only output text responses, and current VLA models can only output action decisions. Moreover, these VLA models handle action data by discretizing and then tokenizing the discretized actions, a method unsuitable for complex decision-making tasks involving high-dimensional continuous-valued action vectors, such as autonomous driving. The experimental results on CARLA validate that: (1) our proposed model construction method is effective; (2) compared to the SOTA VLA model, VLA4CD can provide more accurate real-time decision-making while retaining the text interaction capability inherent to LLMs.

### FlickerFusion: Intra-trajectory Domain Generalizing Multi-Agent RL
**Authors**: Woosung Koh, Wonbeen Oh, Siyeol Kim, Suhin Shin, Hyeongjin Kim, Jaein Jang, Junghyun Lee, Se-Young Yun

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T10:57:45Z

**Summary**: Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. Our results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. For standardized evaluation, we introduce MPEv2, an enhanced version of Multi Particle Environments (MPE), consisting of 12 benchmarks. Benchmarks, implementations, and trained models are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.

### Variable Rate Learned Wavelet Video Coding with Temporal Layer   Adaptivity
**Authors**: Anna Meyer, André Kaup

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T10:57:08Z

**Summary**: Learned wavelet video coders provide an explainable framework by performing discrete wavelet transforms in temporal, horizontal, and vertical dimensions. With a temporal transform based on motion-compensated temporal filtering (MCTF), spatial and temporal scalability is obtained. In this paper, we introduce variable rate support and a mechanism for quality adaption to different temporal layers for a higher coding efficiency. Moreover, we propose a multi-stage training strategy that allows training with multiple temporal layers. Our experiments demonstrate Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta bitrate savings of at least -17% compared to a learned MCTF model without these extensions. Our method also outperforms other learned video coders like DCVC-DC. Training and inference code is available at: https://github.com/FAU-LMS/Learned-pMCTF.

### Mesa-Extrapolation: A Weave Position Encoding Method for Enhanced   Extrapolation in LLMs
**Authors**: Xin Ma, Yang Liu, Jingjing Liu, Xiaoxu Ma

**Updated**: 2024-10-22T08:00:00Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs), although having revolutionized many fields, still suffer from the challenging extrapolation problem, where the inference ability of LLMs sharply declines beyond their max training lengths. In this work, we conduct a theoretical analysis to better understand why No Position Encoding (NoPE) fails outside its effective range, as well as examining the power of Position Encoding (PE) in this context. Our findings reveal that with meticulous weave position, PE can indeed be extended beyond effective range. Our theorems establish that LLMs equipped with weave PE can achieve improved extrapolation performance without additional cost. Furthermore, we introduce a novel weave PE method, Mesa-Extrapolation, which utilizes a chunk-based triangular attention matrix and applies Stair PE to manage the final chunk. This method not only retains competitive performance but also offers substantial benefits such as significantly reduced memory demand and faster inference speed. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Mesa-Extrapolation, demonstrating its potential as a scalable solution to enhancing LLMs applicative reach.

### Random Token Fusion for Multi-View Medical Diagnosis
**Authors**: Jingyu Guo, Christos Matsoukas, Fredrik Strand, Kevin Smith

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T10:19:45Z

**Summary**: In multi-view medical diagnosis, deep learning-based models often fuse information from different imaging perspectives to improve diagnostic performance. However, existing approaches are prone to overfitting and rely heavily on view-specific features, which can lead to trivial solutions. In this work, we introduce Random Token Fusion (RTF), a novel technique designed to enhance multi-view medical image analysis using vision transformers. By integrating randomness into the feature fusion process during training, RTF addresses the issue of overfitting and enhances the robustness and accuracy of diagnostic models without incurring any additional cost at inference. We validate our approach on standard mammography and chest X-ray benchmark datasets. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RTF consistently improves the performance of existing fusion methods, paving the way for a new generation of multi-view medical foundation models.

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T10:11:11Z

**Summary**: The growing capabilities of AI models are leading to their wider use, including in safety-critical domains. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to make these models safer to use by making their inference process more transparent. However, current explainability methods are seldom evaluated in the way they are intended to be used: by real-world end users. To address this, we conducted a large-scale user study with 85 healthcare practitioners in the context of human-AI collaborative chest X-ray analysis. We evaluated three types of explanations: visual explanations (saliency maps), natural language explanations, and a combination of both modalities. We specifically examined how different explanation types influence users depending on whether the AI advice and explanations are factually correct. We find that text-based explanations lead to significant over-reliance, which is alleviated by combining them with saliency maps. We also observe that the quality of explanations, that is, how much factually correct information they entail, and how much this aligns with AI correctness, significantly impacts the usefulness of the different explanation types.

### LLM4GRN: Discovering Causal Gene Regulatory Networks with LLMs --   Evaluation through Synthetic Data Generation
**Authors**: Tejumade Afonja, Ivaxi Sheth, Ruta Binkyte, Waqar Hanif, Thomas Ulas, Matthias Becker, Mario Fritz

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T09:46:37Z

**Summary**: Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) represent the causal relationships between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Understanding these networks is crucial for uncovering disease mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. In this work, we investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) for GRN discovery, leveraging their learned biological knowledge alone or in combination with traditional statistical methods. We develop a task-based evaluation strategy to address the challenge of unavailable ground truth causal graphs. Specifically, we use the GRNs suggested by LLMs to guide causal synthetic data generation and compare the resulting data against the original dataset. Our statistical and biological assessments show that LLMs can support statistical modeling and data synthesis for biological research.

### Mitigating Biases of Large Language Models in Stance Detection with   Counterfactual Augmented Calibration
**Authors**: Ang Li, Jingqian Zhao, Bin Liang, Lin Gui, Hui Wang, Xi Zeng, Xingwei Liang, Kam-Fai Wong, Ruifeng Xu

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T09:42:55Z

**Summary**: Stance detection is critical for understanding the underlying position or attitude expressed toward a topic. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements across various natural language processing tasks including stance detection, however, their performance in stance detection is limited by biases and spurious correlations inherent due to their data-driven nature. Our statistical experiment reveals that LLMs are prone to generate biased stances due to sentiment-stance spurious correlations and preference towards certain individuals and topics. Furthermore, the results demonstrate a strong negative correlation between stance bias and stance detection performance, underscoring the importance of mitigating bias to enhance the utility of LLMs in stance detection. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Counterfactual Augmented Calibration Network (FACTUAL), which a novel calibration network is devised to calibrate potential bias in the stance prediction of LLMs. Further, to address the challenge of effectively learning bias representations and the difficulty in the generalizability of debiasing, we construct counterfactual augmented data. This approach enhances the calibration network, facilitating the debiasing and out-of-domain generalization. Experimental results on in-target and zero-shot stance detection tasks show that the proposed FACTUAL can effectively mitigate biases of LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### Large Language Models Empower Personalized Valuation in Auction
**Authors**: Jie Sun, Tianyu Zhang, Houcheng Jiang, Kexin Huang, Chi Luo, Junkang Wu, Jiancan Wu, An Zhang, Xiang Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T09:31:51Z

**Summary**: Auctions, a fundamental economic mechanism, encompass the valuation of goods or services and the competitive bidding algorithms within a specific framework, serving to uncover the true market value. However, current research predominantly focuses on the bidding algorithms within a given auction mechanism, often overlooking the advantages of incorporating individual bidders' unique preferences and the semantic information related to the items into the valuation process. Our analysis, both theoretical and empirical, shows that imprecise or noisy valuations can significantly affect the overall utility for participants. To bridge this gap, we propose a personalized valuation framework, namely \textbf{S}emantic-enhanced \textbf{P}ersonalized \textbf{V}aluation in \textbf{A}uction (\ours), which integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate semantic information into each bidder's unique valuation process. Specifically, SPVA employs a two-stage approach: it first fine-tunes LLMs to encode bidder preferences in personalized valuations, and then constructs a Vickrey auction environment integrated with a bidding algorithm to demonstrate that SPVA's more accurate valuations result in higher profits. Additionally, we have developed a semantic-enhanced dataset comprising over 23,000 samples and introduced new personalized evaluation metrics that reflect both bidder preferences and profit. Through simulations of various auction scenarios, our method demonstrates its ability to provide accurate valuations and capture bidder preferences, affirming the method's effectiveness in real-world auction settings.

**Authors**: Oleg Savchenko, Florian List, Guillermo Franco Abellán, Noemi Anau Montel, Christoph Weniger

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T09:23:50Z

**Summary**: Reconstructing cosmological initial conditions (ICs) from late-time observations is a difficult task, which relies on the use of computationally expensive simulators alongside sophisticated statistical methods to navigate multi-million dimensional parameter spaces. We present a simple method for Bayesian field reconstruction based on modeling the posterior distribution of the initial matter density field to be diagonal Gaussian in Fourier space, with its covariance and the mean estimator being the trainable parts of the algorithm. Training and sampling are extremely fast (training: $\sim 1 \, \mathrm{h}$ on a GPU, sampling: $\lesssim 3 \, \mathrm{s}$ for 1000 samples at resolution $128^3$), and our method supports industry-standard (non-differentiable) $N$-body simulators. We verify the fidelity of the obtained IC samples in terms of summary statistics.

**Authors**: Tianyang Zhang, Zhuoxuan Jiang, Shengguang Bai, Tianrui Zhang, Lin Lin, Yang Liu, Jiawei Ren

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T09:22:29Z

**Summary**: With the ever-increasing demands on Question Answering (QA) systems for IT operations and maintenance, an efficient and supervised fine-tunable framework is necessary to ensure the data security, private deployment and continuous upgrading. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have notably improved the open-domain QA's performance, how to efficiently handle enterprise-exclusive corpora and build domain-specific QA systems are still less-studied for industrial applications. In this paper, we propose a general and comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and facilitate the whole business process of establishing QA systems for IT operations and maintenance. In accordance with the prevailing RAG method, our proposed framework, named with RAG4ITOps, composes of two major stages: (1) Models Fine-tuning \& Data Vectorization, and (2) Online QA System Process. At the Stage 1, we leverage a contrastive learning method with two negative sampling strategies to fine-tune the embedding model, and design the instruction templates to fine-tune the LLM with a Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning method. At the Stage 2, an efficient process of QA system is built for serving. We collect enterprise-exclusive corpora from the domain of cloud computing, and the extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior results than counterparts on two kinds of QA tasks. Our experiment also provide a case for applying the RAG4ITOps to real-world enterprise-level applications.

 ### Reflection-Bench: probing AI intelligence with reflection
**Authors**: Lingyu Li, Yixu Wang, Haiquan Zhao, Shuqi Kong, Yan Teng, Chunbo Li, Yingchun Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:59:50Z

**Summary**: The ability to adapt beliefs or behaviors in response to unexpected outcomes, reflection, is fundamental to intelligent systems' interaction with the world. From a cognitive science perspective, this serves as a core principle of intelligence applicable to both human and AI systems. To address the debate on the intelligence of large language models (LLMs), we propose Reflection-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 7 tasks spanning core cognitive functions crucial for reflection, including perception, memory, belief updating, decision-making, prediction, counterfactual thinking, and meta-reflection. We evaluate the performances of 13 prominent LLMs such as OpenAI o1, GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, etc. The results indicate that current LLMs still lack satisfactory reflection ability. We discuss the underlying causes of these results and suggest potential avenues for future research. In conclusion, Reflection-Bench offers both evaluation tools and inspiration for developing AI capable of reliably interacting with the environment. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/YabYum/ReflectionBench.

### Elucidating the design space of language models for image generation
**Authors**: Xuantong Liu, Shaozhe Hao, Xianbiao Qi, Tianyang Hu, Jun Wang, Rong Xiao, Yuan Yao

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:57:04Z

**Summary**: The success of autoregressive (AR) language models in text generation has inspired the computer vision community to adopt Large Language Models (LLMs) for image generation. However, considering the essential differences between text and image modalities, the design space of language models for image generation remains underexplored. We observe that image tokens exhibit greater randomness compared to text tokens, which presents challenges when training with token prediction. Nevertheless, AR models demonstrate their potential by effectively learning patterns even from a seemingly suboptimal optimization problem. Our analysis also reveals that while all models successfully grasp the importance of local information in image generation, smaller models struggle to capture the global context. In contrast, larger models showcase improved capabilities in this area, helping to explain the performance gains achieved when scaling up model size. We further elucidate the design space of language models for vision generation, including tokenizer choice, model choice, model scalability, vocabulary design, and sampling strategy through extensive comparative experiments. Our work is the first to analyze the optimization behavior of language models in vision generation, and we believe it can inspire more effective designs when applying LMs to other domains. Finally, our elucidated language model for image generation, termed as ELM, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet 256*256 benchmark. The code is available at https://github.com/Pepperlll/LMforImageGeneration.git.

### CompassJudger-1: All-in-one Judge Model Helps Model Evaluation and   Evolution
**Authors**: Maosong Cao, Alexander Lam, Haodong Duan, Hongwei Liu, Songyang Zhang, Kai Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:56:51Z

**Summary**: Efficient and accurate evaluation is crucial for the continuous improvement of large language models (LLMs). Among various assessment methods, subjective evaluation has garnered significant attention due to its superior alignment with real-world usage scenarios and human preferences. However, human-based evaluations are costly and lack reproducibility, making precise automated evaluators (judgers) vital in this process. In this report, we introduce \textbf{CompassJudger-1}, the first open-source \textbf{all-in-one} judge LLM. CompassJudger-1 is a general-purpose LLM that demonstrates remarkable versatility. It is capable of: 1. Performing unitary scoring and two-model comparisons as a reward model; 2. Conducting evaluations according to specified formats; 3. Generating critiques; 4. Executing diverse tasks like a general LLM. To assess the evaluation capabilities of different judge models under a unified setting, we have also established \textbf{JudgerBench}, a new benchmark that encompasses various subjective evaluation tasks and covers a wide range of topics. CompassJudger-1 offers a comprehensive solution for various evaluation tasks while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to diverse requirements. Both CompassJudger and JudgerBench are released and available to the research community athttps://github.com/open-compass/CompassJudger. We believe that by open-sourcing these tools, we can foster collaboration and accelerate progress in LLM evaluation methodologies.

### Can Knowledge Editing Really Correct Hallucinations?
**Authors**: Baixiang Huang, Canyu Chen, Xiongxiao Xu, Ali Payani, Kai Shu

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:55:54Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations, referring to the non-factual information in generated content, despite their superior capacities across tasks. Meanwhile, knowledge editing has been developed as a new popular paradigm to correct the erroneous factual knowledge encoded in LLMs with the advantage of avoiding retraining from scratch. However, one common issue of existing evaluation datasets for knowledge editing is that they do not ensure LLMs actually generate hallucinated answers to the evaluation questions before editing. When LLMs are evaluated on such datasets after being edited by different techniques, it is hard to directly adopt the performance to assess the effectiveness of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations. Thus, the fundamental question remains insufficiently validated: Can knowledge editing really correct hallucinations in LLMs? We proposed HalluEditBench to holistically benchmark knowledge editing methods in correcting real-world hallucinations. First, we rigorously construct a massive hallucination dataset with 9 domains, 26 topics and more than 6,000 hallucinations. Then, we assess the performance of knowledge editing methods in a holistic way on five dimensions including Efficacy, Generalization, Portability, Locality, and Robustness. Through HalluEditBench, we have provided new insights into the potentials and limitations of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations, which could inspire future improvements and facilitate the progress in the field of knowledge editing.

### Analyzing Context Contributions in LLM-based Machine Translation
**Authors**: Emmanouil Zaranis, Nuno M. Guerreiro, André F. T. Martins

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:51:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in machine translation (MT) and demonstrated the ability to leverage in-context learning through few-shot examples. However, the mechanisms by which LLMs use different parts of the input context remain largely unexplored. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of context utilization in MT, studying how LLMs use various context parts, such as few-shot examples and the source text, when generating translations. We highlight several key findings: (1) the source part of few-shot examples appears to contribute more than its corresponding targets, irrespective of translation direction; (2) finetuning LLMs with parallel data alters the contribution patterns of different context parts; and (3) there is a positional bias where earlier few-shot examples have higher contributions to the translated sequence. Finally, we demonstrate that inspecting anomalous context contributions can potentially uncover pathological translations, such as hallucinations. Our findings shed light on the internal workings of LLM-based MT which go beyond those known for standard encoder-decoder MT models.

### MoRE: Multi-Modal Contrastive Pre-training with Transformers on X-Rays,   ECGs, and Diagnostic Report
**Authors**: Samrajya Thapa, Koushik Howlader, Subhankar Bhattacharjee, Wei le

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:42:41Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a novel Multi-Modal Contrastive Pre-training Framework that synergistically combines X-rays, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and radiology/cardiology reports. Our approach leverages transformers to encode these diverse modalities into a unified representation space, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and facilitate comprehensive patient assessments. We utilize LoRA-Peft to significantly reduce trainable parameters in the LLM and incorporate recent linear attention dropping strategy in the Vision Transformer(ViT) for smoother attention. Furthermore, we provide novel multimodal attention explanations and retrieval for our model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an integrated model that combines X-ray, ECG, and Radiology/Cardiology Report with this approach. By utilizing contrastive loss, MoRE effectively aligns modality-specific features into a coherent embedding, which supports various downstream tasks such as zero-shot classification and multimodal retrieval. Employing our proposed methodology, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the Mimic-IV, CheXpert, Edema Severity, and PtbXl downstream datasets, surpassing existing multimodal approaches. Our proposed framework shows significant improvements in capturing intricate inter-modal relationships and its robustness in medical diagnosis that establishes a framework for future research in multimodal learning in the healthcare sector.

### IBGP: Imperfect Byzantine Generals Problem for Zero-Shot Robustness in   Communicative Multi-Agent Systems
**Authors**: Yihuan Mao, Yipeng Kang, Peilun Li, Ning Zhang, Wei Xu, Chongjie Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:41:42Z

**Summary**: As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly integrate into our infrastructure, their robust coordination and message synchronization become vital. The Byzantine Generals Problem (BGP) is a critical model for constructing resilient multi-agent systems (MAS) under adversarial attacks. It describes a scenario where malicious agents with unknown identities exist in the system-situations that, in our context, could result from LLM agents' hallucinations or external attacks. In BGP, the objective of the entire system is to reach a consensus on the action to be taken. Traditional BGP requires global consensus among all agents; however, in practical scenarios, global consensus is not always necessary and can even be inefficient. Therefore, there is a pressing need to explore a refined version of BGP that aligns with the local coordination patterns observed in MAS. We refer to this refined version as Imperfect BGP (IBGP) in our research, aiming to address this discrepancy. To tackle this issue, we propose a framework that leverages consensus protocols within general MAS settings, providing provable resilience against communication attacks and adaptability to changing environments, as validated by empirical results. Additionally, we present a case study in a sensor network environment to illustrate the practical application of our protocol.

### LLaVA-KD: A Framework of Distilling Multimodal Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yuxuan Cai, Jiangning Zhang, Haoyang He, Xinwei He, Ao Tong, Zhenye Gan, Chengjie Wang, Xiang Bai

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:41:28Z

**Summary**: The success of Large Language Models (LLM) has led researchers to explore Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for unified visual and linguistic understanding. However, the increasing model size and computational complexity of MLLM limit their use in resource-constrained environments. Small-scale MLLM (s-MLLM) aims to retain the capabilities of the large-scale model (l-MLLM) while reducing computational demands, but resulting in a significant decline in performance. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel LLaVA-KD framework to transfer knowledge from l-MLLM to s-MLLM. Specifically, we introduce Multimodal Distillation (MDist) to minimize the divergence between the visual-textual output distributions of l-MLLM and s-MLLM, and Relation Distillation (RDist) to transfer l-MLLM's ability to model correlations between visual features. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training scheme to fully exploit the potential of s-MLLM: 1) Distilled Pre-Training to align visual-textual representations, 2) Supervised Fine-Tuning to equip the model with multimodal understanding, and 3) Distilled Fine-Tuning to further transfer l-MLLM capabilities. Our approach significantly improves performance without altering the small model's architecture. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component. Code will be available at https://github.com/caiyuxuan1120/LLaVA-KD.

**Updated**: 2024-10-22T06:48:54Z

**Summary**: We evaluate the moral alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences in multilingual trolley problems. Building on the Moral Machine experiment, which captures over 40 million human judgments across 200+ countries, we develop a cross-lingual corpus of moral dilemma vignettes in over 100 languages called MultiTP. This dataset enables the assessment of LLMs' decision-making processes in diverse linguistic contexts. Our analysis explores the alignment of 19 different LLMs with human judgments, capturing preferences across six moral dimensions: species, gender, fitness, status, age, and the number of lives involved. By correlating these preferences with the demographic distribution of language speakers and examining the consistency of LLM responses to various prompt paraphrasings, our findings provide insights into cross-lingual and ethical biases of LLMs and their intersection. We discover significant variance in alignment across languages, challenging the assumption of uniform moral reasoning in AI systems and highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse perspectives in AI ethics. The results underscore the need for further research on the integration of multilingual dimensions in responsible AI research to ensure fair and equitable AI interactions worldwide.

### Building A Coding Assistant via the Retrieval-Augmented Language Model
**Authors**: Xinze Li, Hanbin Wang, Zhenghao Liu, Shi Yu, Shuo Wang, Shuo Wang, Yukun Yan, Yukai Fu, Yu Gu, Ge Yu

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:34:39Z

**Summary**: Pretrained language models have shown strong effectiveness in code-related tasks, such as code retrieval, code generation, code summarization, and code completion tasks. In this paper, we propose COde assistaNt viA retrieval-augmeNted language model (CONAN), which aims to build a code assistant by mimicking the knowledge-seeking behaviors of humans during coding. Specifically, it consists of a code structure aware retriever (CONAN-R) and a dual-view code representation-based retrieval-augmented generation model (CONAN-G). CONAN-R pretrains CodeT5 using Code-Documentation Alignment and Masked Entity Prediction tasks to make language models code structure-aware and learn effective representations for code snippets and documentation. Then CONAN-G designs a dual-view code representation mechanism for implementing a retrieval-augmented code generation model. CONAN-G regards the code documentation descriptions as prompts, which help language models better understand the code semantics. Our experiments show that CONAN achieves convincing performance on different code generation tasks and significantly outperforms previous retrieval augmented code generation models. Our further analyses show that CONAN learns tailored representations for both code snippets and documentation by aligning code-documentation data pairs and capturing structural semantics by masking and predicting entities in the code data. Additionally, the retrieved code snippets and documentation provide necessary information from both program language and natural language to assist the code generation process. CONAN can also be used as an assistant for Large Language Models (LLMs), providing LLMs with external knowledge in shorter code document lengths to improve their effectiveness on various code tasks. It shows the ability of CONAN to extract necessary information and help filter out the noise from retrieved code documents.

### A Realistic Threat Model for Large Language Model Jailbreaks
**Authors**: Valentyn Boreiko, Alexander Panfilov, Vaclav Voracek, Matthias Hein, Jonas Geiping

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:27:01Z

**Summary**: A plethora of jailbreaking attacks have been proposed to obtain harmful responses from safety-tuned LLMs. In their original settings, these methods all largely succeed in coercing the target output, but their attacks vary substantially in fluency and computational effort. In this work, we propose a unified threat model for the principled comparison of these methods. Our threat model combines constraints in perplexity, measuring how far a jailbreak deviates from natural text, and computational budget, in total FLOPs. For the former, we build an N-gram model on 1T tokens, which, in contrast to model-based perplexity, allows for an LLM-agnostic and inherently interpretable evaluation. We adapt popular attacks to this new, realistic threat model, with which we, for the first time, benchmark these attacks on equal footing. After a rigorous comparison, we not only find attack success rates against safety-tuned modern models to be lower than previously presented but also find that attacks based on discrete optimization significantly outperform recent LLM-based attacks. Being inherently interpretable, our threat model allows for a comprehensive analysis and comparison of jailbreak attacks. We find that effective attacks exploit and abuse infrequent N-grams, either selecting N-grams absent from real-world text or rare ones, e.g. specific to code datasets.

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:22:45Z

**Summary**: Remarkable progress has been made on automated problem solving through societies of agents based on large language models (LLMs). Existing LLM-based multi-agent systems can already solve simple dialogue tasks. Solutions to more complex tasks, however, are complicated through logic inconsistencies due to cascading hallucinations caused by naively chaining LLMs. Here we introduce MetaGPT, an innovative meta-programming framework incorporating efficient human workflows into LLM-based multi-agent collaborations. MetaGPT encodes Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompt sequences for more streamlined workflows, thus allowing agents with human-like domain expertise to verify intermediate results and reduce errors. MetaGPT utilizes an assembly line paradigm to assign diverse roles to various agents, efficiently breaking down complex tasks into subtasks involving many agents working together. On collaborative software engineering benchmarks, MetaGPT generates more coherent solutions than previous chat-based multi-agent systems.

### Pre-training Distillation for Large Language Models: A Design Space   Exploration
**Authors**: Hao Peng, Xin Lv, Yushi Bai, Zijun Yao, Jiajie Zhang, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:16:13Z

**Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. Previous work applying KD in the field of large language models (LLMs) typically focused on the post-training phase, where the student LLM learns directly from instructions and corresponding responses generated by the teacher model. In this paper, we extend KD to the pre-training phase of LLMs, named pre-training distillation (PD). We first conduct a preliminary experiment using GLM-4-9B as the teacher LLM to distill a 1.9B parameter student LLM, validating the effectiveness of PD. Considering the key impact factors of distillation, we systematically explore the design space of pre-training distillation across four aspects: logits processing, loss selection, scaling law, and offline or online logits. We conduct extensive experiments to explore the design space of pre-training distillation and find better configurations and interesting conclusions, such as larger student LLMs generally benefiting more from pre-training distillation, while a larger teacher LLM does not necessarily guarantee better results. We hope our exploration of the design space will inform future practices in pre-training distillation.

### Comprehensive benchmarking of large language models for RNA secondary   structure prediction
**Authors**: L. I. Zablocki, L. A. Bugnon, M. Gerard, L. Di Persia, G. Stegmayer, D. H. Milone

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:12:06Z

**Summary**: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLM) for DNA and proteins, several LLM for RNA have been developed recently. RNA-LLM uses large datasets of RNA sequences to learn, in a self-supervised way, how to represent each RNA base with a semantically rich numerical vector. This is done under the hypothesis that obtaining high-quality RNA representations can enhance data-costly downstream tasks. Among them, predicting the secondary structure is a fundamental task for uncovering RNA functional mechanisms. In this work we present a comprehensive experimental analysis of several pre-trained RNA-LLM, comparing them for the RNA secondary structure prediction task in an unified deep learning framework. The RNA-LLM were assessed with increasing generalization difficulty on benchmark datasets. Results showed that two LLM clearly outperform the other models, and revealed significant challenges for generalization in low-homology scenarios.

### Compute-Constrained Data Selection
**Authors**: Junjie Oscar Yin, Alexander M. Rush

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:11:21Z

**Summary**: Data selection can reduce the amount of training data needed to finetune LLMs; however, the efficacy of data selection scales directly with its compute. Motivated by the practical challenge of compute-constrained finetuning, we consider the setting in which both the cost of selecting data and training are budgeted for. We first formalize the problem of data selection with a cost-aware utility function, and model the data selection problem as trading off initial-selection cost for training gain. We run a comprehensive sweep of experiments across multiple tasks, varying compute budget by scaling finetuning tokens, model sizes, and data selection compute. These experiments show the validity of this model in real-world experiments. Interestingly we find that many powerful data selection methods are almost never compute-optimal, and that cheaper data selection alternatives dominate both from a theoretical and empirical perspective.

### Are Large Language Models Chameleons? An Attempt to Simulate Social   Surveys
**Authors**: Mingmeng Geng, Sihong He, Roberto Trotta

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:05:15Z

**Summary**: Can large language models (LLMs) simulate social surveys? To answer this question, we conducted millions of simulations in which LLMs were asked to answer subjective questions. A comparison of different LLM responses with the European Social Survey (ESS) data suggests that the effect of prompts on bias and variability is fundamental, highlighting major cultural, age, and gender biases. We further discussed statistical methods for measuring the difference between LLM answers and survey data and proposed a novel measure inspired by Jaccard similarity, as LLM-generated responses are likely to have a smaller variance. Our experiments also reveal that it is important to analyze the robustness and variability of prompts before using LLMs to simulate social surveys, as their imitation abilities are approximate at best.

**Updated**: 2024-10-22T07:14:11Z

**Summary**: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) require diverse and safety-critical traffic scenarios for effective training and testing, but the existing data generation methods struggle to provide flexibility and scalability. We propose LASER, a novel frame-work that leverage large language models (LLMs) to conduct traffic simulations based on natural language inputs. The framework operates in two stages: it first generates scripts from user-provided descriptions and then executes them using autonomous agents in real time. Validated in the CARLA simulator, LASER successfully generates complex, on-demand driving scenarios, significantly improving ADS training and testing data generation.

### Information for Conversation Generation: Proposals Utilising Knowledge   Graphs
**Authors**: Alex Clay, Ernesto Jiménez-Ruiz

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:59:25Z

**Summary**: LLMs are frequently used tools for conversational generation. Without additional information LLMs can generate lower quality responses due to lacking relevant content and hallucinations, as well as the perception of poor emotional capability, and an inability to maintain a consistent character. Knowledge graphs are commonly used forms of external knowledge and may provide solutions to these challenges. This paper introduces three proposals, utilizing knowledge graphs to enhance LLM generation. Firstly, dynamic knowledge graph embeddings and recommendation could allow for the integration of new information and the selection of relevant knowledge for response generation. Secondly, storing entities with emotional values as additional features may provide knowledge that is better emotionally aligned with the user input. Thirdly, integrating character information through narrative bubbles would maintain character consistency, as well as introducing a structure that would readily incorporate new information.

### Contamination Report for Multilingual Benchmarks
**Authors**: Sanchit Ahuja, Varun Gumma, Sunayana Sitaram

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:49:35Z

**Summary**: Benchmark contamination refers to the presence of test datasets in Large Language Model (LLM) pre-training or post-training data. Contamination can lead to inflated scores on benchmarks, compromising evaluation results and making it difficult to determine the capabilities of models. In this work, we study the contamination of popular multilingual benchmarks in LLMs that support multiple languages. We use the Black Box test to determine whether $7$ frequently used multilingual benchmarks are contaminated in $7$ popular open and closed LLMs and find that almost all models show signs of being contaminated with almost all the benchmarks we test. Our findings can help the community determine the best set of benchmarks to use for multilingual evaluation.

### Toxicity Detection is NOT all you Need: Measuring the Gaps to Supporting   Volunteer Content Moderators
**Authors**: Yang Trista Cao, Lovely-Frances Domingo, Sarah Ann Gilbert, Michelle Mazurek, Katie Shilton, Hal Daumé III

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:48:18Z

**Summary**: Extensive efforts in automated approaches for content moderation have been focused on developing models to identify toxic, offensive, and hateful content with the aim of lightening the load for moderators. Yet, it remains uncertain whether improvements on those tasks have truly addressed moderators' needs in accomplishing their work. In this paper, we surface gaps between past research efforts that have aimed to provide automation for aspects of content moderation and the needs of volunteer content moderators, regarding identifying violations of various moderation rules. To do so, we conduct a model review on Hugging Face to reveal the availability of models to cover various moderation rules and guidelines from three exemplar forums. We further put state-of-the-art LLMs to the test, evaluating how well these models perform in flagging violations of platform rules from one particular forum. Finally, we conduct a user survey study with volunteer moderators to gain insight into their perspectives on useful moderation models. Overall, we observe a non-trivial gap, as missing developed models and LLMs exhibit moderate to low performance on a significant portion of the rules. Moderators' reports provide guides for future work on developing moderation assistant models.

**Authors**: Zhuoming Chen, Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Zihao Ye, Yang Zhou, Jianyu Zhang, Niklas Nolte, Yuandong Tian, Matthijs Douze, Leon Bottou, Zhihao Jia, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:44:51Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with long context windows have gained significant attention. However, the KV cache, stored to avoid re-computation, becomes a bottleneck. Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself suffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention is not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding throughput by $1.9\sim3.9\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 110ms decoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a context of 96k tokens. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/MagicPIG}.

### Exploring Pretraining via Active Forgetting for Improving Cross Lingual   Transfer for Decoder Language Models
**Authors**: Divyanshu Aggarwal, Ashutosh Sathe, Sunayana Sitaram

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:33:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities in a multitude of NLP tasks. However, the efficacy of such models to languages other than English is often limited. Prior works have shown that encoder-only models such as BERT or XLM-RoBERTa show impressive cross lingual transfer of their capabilities from English to other languages. In this work, we propose a pretraining strategy that uses active forgetting to achieve similar cross lingual transfer in decoder-only LLMs. We show that LLMs pretrained with active forgetting are highly effective when adapting to new and unseen languages. Through extensive experimentation, we find that LLMs pretrained with active forgetting are able to learn better multilingual representations which translates to better performance in many downstream tasks.

### Adversarial Inception for Bounded Backdoor Poisoning in Deep   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Ethan Rathbun, Christopher Amato, Alina Oprea

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:27:48Z

**Summary**: Recent works have demonstrated the vulnerability of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms against training-time, backdoor poisoning attacks. These attacks induce pre-determined, adversarial behavior in the agent upon observing a fixed trigger during deployment while allowing the agent to solve its intended task during training. Prior attacks rely on arbitrarily large perturbations to the agent's rewards to achieve both of these objectives - leaving them open to detection. Thus, in this work, we propose a new class of backdoor attacks against DRL which achieve state of the art performance while minimally altering the agent's rewards. These "inception" attacks train the agent to associate the targeted adversarial behavior with high returns by inducing a disjunction between the agent's chosen action and the true action executed in the environment during training. We formally define these attacks and prove they can achieve both adversarial objectives. We then devise an online inception attack which significantly out-performs prior attacks under bounded reward constraints.

**Authors**: Xiaohan Xu, Ming Li, Chongyang Tao, Tao Shen, Reynold Cheng, Jinyang Li, Can Xu, Dacheng Tao, Tianyi Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:22:33Z

**Summary**: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), Knowledge Distillation (KD) emerges as a pivotal methodology for transferring advanced capabilities from leading proprietary LLMs, such as GPT-4, to their open-source counterparts like LLaMA and Mistral. Additionally, as open-source LLMs flourish, KD plays a crucial role in both compressing these models, and facilitating their self-improvement by employing themselves as teachers. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of KD's role within the realm of LLM, highlighting its critical function in imparting advanced knowledge to smaller models and its utility in model compression and self-improvement. Our survey is meticulously structured around three foundational pillars: \textit{algorithm}, \textit{skill}, and \textit{verticalization} -- providing a comprehensive examination of KD mechanisms, the enhancement of specific cognitive abilities, and their practical implications across diverse fields. Crucially, the survey navigates the intricate interplay between data augmentation (DA) and KD, illustrating how DA emerges as a powerful paradigm within the KD framework to bolster LLMs' performance. By leveraging DA to generate context-rich, skill-specific training data, KD transcends traditional boundaries, enabling open-source models to approximate the contextual adeptness, ethical alignment, and deep semantic insights characteristic of their proprietary counterparts. This work aims to provide an insightful guide for researchers and practitioners, offering a detailed overview of current methodologies in KD and proposing future research directions. Importantly, we firmly advocate for compliance with the legal terms that regulate the use of LLMs, ensuring ethical and lawful application of KD of LLMs. An associated Github repository is available at https://github.com/Tebmer/Awesome-Knowledge-Distillation-of-LLMs.

**Authors**: Xiang Yue, Yueqi Song, Akari Asai, Seungone Kim, Jean de Dieu Nyandwi, Simran Khanuja, Anjali Kantharuban, Lintang Sutawika, Sathyanarayanan Ramamoorthy, Graham Neubig

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:19:41Z

**Summary**: Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their development has predominantly focused on English- and western-centric datasets and tasks, leaving most of the world's languages and diverse cultural contexts underrepresented. This paper introduces Pangea, a multilingual multimodal LLM trained on PangeaIns, a diverse 6M instruction dataset spanning 39 languages. PangeaIns features: 1) high-quality English instructions, 2) carefully machine-translated instructions, and 3) culturally relevant multimodal tasks to ensure cross-cultural coverage. To rigorously assess models' capabilities, we introduce PangeaBench, a holistic evaluation suite encompassing 14 datasets covering 47 languages. Results show that Pangea significantly outperforms existing open-source models in multilingual settings and diverse cultural contexts. Ablation studies further reveal the importance of English data proportions, language popularity, and the number of multimodal training samples on overall performance. We fully open-source our data, code, and trained checkpoints, to facilitate the development of inclusive and robust multilingual MLLMs, promoting equity and accessibility across a broader linguistic and cultural spectrum.

**Authors**: Jinheng Wang, Hansong Zhou, Ting Song, Shaoguang Mao, Shuming Ma, Hongyu Wang, Yan Xia, Furu Wei

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:14:57Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BitNet and BitNet b1.58, present a promising approach to enhancing the efficiency of LLMs in terms of speed and energy consumption. These developments also enable local LLM deployment across a broad range of devices. In this work, we introduce bitnet.cpp, a tailored software stack designed to unlock the full potential of 1-bit LLMs. Specifically, we develop a set of kernels to support fast and lossless inference of ternary BitNet b1.58 LLMs on CPUs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that bitnet.cpp achieves significant speedups, ranging from 2.37x to 6.17x on x86 CPUs and from 1.37x to 5.07x on ARM CPUs, across various model sizes. The code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/BitNet.

### Cooperative Multistatic Target Detection in Cell-Free Communication   Networks
**Authors**: Tianyu Yang, Shuangyang Li, Yi Song, Kangda Zhi, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:07:08Z

**Summary**: In this work, we consider the target detection problem in a multistatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenario characterized by the cell-free MIMO communication network deployment, where multiple radio units (RUs) in the network cooperate with each other for the sensing task. By exploiting the angle resolution from multiple arrays deployed in the network and the delay resolution from the communication signals, i.e., orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, we formulate a cooperative sensing problem with coherent data fusion of multiple RUs' observations and propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based method, where the global coordinates of target locations are directly detected. Intensive numerical results indicate promising target detection performance of the proposed SBL-based method. Additionally, a theoretical analysis of the considered cooperative multistatic sensing task is provided using the pairwise error probability (PEP) analysis, which can be used to provide design insights, e.g., illumination and beam patterns, for the considered problem.

### Beyond 2:4: exploring V:N:M sparsity for efficient transformer inference   on GPUs
**Authors**: Kang Zhao, Tao Yuan, Han Bao, Zhenfeng Su, Chang Gao, Zhaofeng Sun, Zichen Liang, Liping Jing, Jianfei Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T16:00:04Z

**Summary**: To date, 2:4 sparsity has stood as the only sparse pattern that can be accelerated using sparse tensor cores on GPUs. In practice, 2:4 sparsity often possesses low actual speedups ($\leq 1.3$) and requires fixed sparse ratios, meaning that other ratios, such as 4:8, 8:16, or those exceeding 50% sparsity, do not incur any speedups on GPUs. Recent studies suggest that V:N:M sparsity is promising in addressing these limitations of 2:4 sparsity. However, regarding accuracy, the effects of V:N:M sparsity on broader Transformer models, such as vision Transformers and large language models (LLMs), are largely unexamined. Moreover, Some specific issues related to V:N:M sparsity, such as how to select appropriate V and M values, remain unresolved. In this study, we thoroughly investigate the application of V:N:M sparsity in vision models and LLMs across multiple tasks, from pertaining to downstream tasks. We propose three key approaches to enhance the applicability and accuracy of V:N:M-sparse Transformers, including heuristic V and M selection, V:N:M-specific channel permutation, and three-staged LoRA training techniques. Experimental results show that, with our methods, the DeiT-small achieves lossless accuracy at 64:2:5 sparsity, while the DeiT-base maintains accuracy even at 64:2:8 sparsity. In addition, the fine-tuned LLama2-7B at 64:2:5 sparsity performs comparably or better than training-free 2:4 sparse alternatives on downstream tasks. More importantly, V:N:M-sparse Transformers offer a wider range of speedup-accuracy trade-offs compared to 2:4 sparsity. Overall, our exploration largely facilitates the V:N:M sparsity to act as a truly effective acceleration solution for Transformers in cost-sensitive inference scenarios.

### Mechanism Design for LLM Fine-tuning with Multiple Reward Models
**Authors**: Haoran Sun, Yurong Chen, Siwei Wang, Wei Chen, Xiaotie Deng

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:59:42Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to aggregate multiple preferences has attracted considerable research attention. With aggregation algorithms advancing, a potential economic scenario arises where fine-tuning services are provided to agents with different preferences. In this context, agents may benefit from strategically misreporting their preferences, which could affect the fine-tuned outcomes. This paper addresses such incentive issues by framing it as a mechanism design problem: an LLM provider determines the fine-tuning objective (training rule) and the pricing scheme (payment rule) for agents. We primarily focus on a representative class of training rules that maximize social welfare subject to certain regularizations, referred to as \tr\ rules. Firstly, we show that under most circumstances, truthful reporting is sub-optimal with simply a training rule, thereby highlighting the necessity of payments. Secondly, we design affine maximizer payment rules that implement \tr\ rules in dominant-strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC). We characterize sufficient conditions for payment equivalence properties. For a training rule that satisfies these conditions, we have found all the payment rules that implement it in DSIC, as they only differ by a constant term irrelevant to agents' reports from each other. Thirdly, we demonstrate that our mechanism is approximately DSIC even with perturbed input, showcasing its robustness against the inevitable errors in real-world applications. Experiments on real LLM setups further confirm the practical implications of our results.

### Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models for Heterophilic Graphs
**Authors**: Yuxia Wu, Shujie Li, Yuan Fang, Chuan Shi

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:59:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have presented significant opportunities to enhance various machine learning applications, including graph neural networks (GNNs). By leveraging the vast open-world knowledge within LLMs, we can more effectively interpret and utilize textual data to better characterize heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often have different labels. However, existing approaches for heterophilic graphs overlook the rich textual data associated with nodes, which could unlock deeper insights into their heterophilic contexts. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs for modeling heterophilic graphs and propose a novel two-stage framework: LLM-enhanced edge discriminator and LLM-guided edge reweighting. In the first stage, we fine-tune the LLM to better identify homophilic and heterophilic edges based on the textual content of their nodes. In the second stage, we adaptively manage message propagation in GNNs for different edge types based on node features, structures, and heterophilic or homophilic characteristics. To cope with the computational demands when deploying LLMs in practical scenarios, we further explore model distillation techniques to fine-tune smaller, more efficient models that maintain competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating the feasibility of using LLMs to enhance node classification on heterophilic graphs.

### Do Large Language Models Need a Content Delivery Network?
**Authors**: Yihua Cheng, Kuntai Du, Jiayi Yao, Junchen Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:59:18Z

**Summary**: As the use of large language models (LLMs) expands rapidly, so does the range of knowledge needed to supplement various LLM queries. Thus, enabling flexible and efficient injection of new knowledge in LLM inference is critical. Three high-level options exist: (i) embedding the knowledge in LLM's weights (i.e., fine-tuning), (ii) including the knowledge as a part of LLM's text input (i.e., in-context learning), or (iii) injecting the KV caches of the new knowledge to LLM during prefill. This paper argues that, although fine-tuning and in-context learning are popular, using KV caches as the medium of knowledge could simultaneously enable more modular management of knowledge injection and more efficient LLM serving with low cost and fast response. To realize these benefits, we envision a Knowledge Delivery Network (KDN), a new system component in LLM services that dynamically optimizes the storage, transfer, and composition of KV cache across LLM engines and other compute and storage resources. We believe that, just like content delivery networks (CDNs), such as Akamai, enabled the success of the Internet ecosystem through their efficient data delivery, KDNs will be critical to the success of LLM applications through their efficient knowledge delivery. We have open-sourced a KDN prototype at https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

### MathGAP: Out-of-Distribution Evaluation on Problems with Arbitrarily   Complex Proofs
**Authors**: Andreas Opedal, Haruki Shirakami, Bernhard Schölkopf, Abulhair Saparov, Mrinmaya Sachan

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:58:30Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can solve arithmetic word problems with high accuracy, but little is known about how well they generalize to problems that are more complex than the ones on which they have been trained. Empirical investigations of such questions are impeded by two major flaws of current evaluations: (i) much of the evaluation data is contaminated, in the sense that it has already been seen during training, and (ii) benchmark datasets do not capture how problem proofs may be arbitrarily complex in various ways. As a step towards addressing these issues, we present a framework for evaluating LLMs on problems with arbitrarily complex arithmetic proofs, called MathGAP. MathGAP generates problems that follow fixed proof specifications -- along with chain-of-thought reasoning annotations -- enabling systematic studies on generalization with respect to arithmetic proof complexity. We apply MathGAP to analyze how in-context learning interacts with generalization to problems that have more complex proofs. We find that among the models tested, most show a significant decrease in performance as proofs get deeper and wider. This effect is more pronounced in complex, nonlinear proof structures, which are challenging even for GPT-4o. Surprisingly, providing in-context examples from the same distribution as the test set is not always beneficial for performance. In particular, zero-shot prompting as well as demonstrating a diverse range of examples that are less complex than the test data sometimes yield similar or higher accuracies.

### PromptExp: Multi-granularity Prompt Explanation of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ximing Dong, Shaowei Wang, Dayi Lin, Gopi Krishnan Rajbahadur, Boquan Zhou, Shichao Liu, Ahmed E. Hassan

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:54:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models excel in tasks like natural language understanding and text generation. Prompt engineering plays a critical role in leveraging LLM effectively. However, LLMs black-box nature hinders its interpretability and effective prompting engineering. A wide range of model explanation approaches have been developed for deep learning models, However, these local explanations are designed for single-output tasks like classification and regression,and cannot be directly applied to LLMs, which generate sequences of tokens. Recent efforts in LLM explanation focus on natural language explanations, but they are prone to hallucinations and inaccuracies. To address this, we introduce OurTool, a framework for multi-granularity prompt explanations by aggregating token-level insights. OurTool introduces two token-level explanation approaches: 1.an aggregation-based approach combining local explanation techniques, and 2. a perturbation-based approach with novel techniques to evaluate token masking impact. OurTool supports both white-box and black-box explanations and extends explanations to higher granularity levels, enabling flexible analysis. We evaluate OurTool in case studies such as sentiment analysis, showing the perturbation-based approach performs best using semantic similarity to assess perturbation impact. Furthermore, we conducted a user study to confirm OurTool's accuracy and practical value, and demonstrate its potential to enhance LLM interpretability.

### Do LLMs write like humans? Variation in grammatical and rhetorical   styles
**Authors**: Alex Reinhart, David West Brown, Ben Markey, Michael Laudenbach, Kachatad Pantusen, Ronald Yurko, Gordon Weinberg

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:35:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are capable of writing grammatical text that follows instructions, answers questions, and solves problems. As they have advanced, it has become difficult to distinguish their output from human-written text. While past research has found some differences in surface features such as word choice and punctuation, and developed classifiers to detect LLM output, none has studied the rhetorical styles of LLMs.   Using several variants of Llama 3 and GPT-4o, we construct two parallel corpora of human- and LLM-written texts from common prompts. Using Douglas Biber's set of lexical, grammatical, and rhetorical features, we identify systematic differences between LLMs and humans and between different LLMs. These differences persist when moving from smaller models to larger ones, and are larger for instruction-tuned models than base models. This demonstrates that despite their advanced abilities, LLMs struggle to match human styles, and hence more advanced linguistic features can detect patterns in their behavior not previously recognized.

### Aligning Translation-Specific Understanding to General Understanding in   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yichong Huang, Baohang Li, Xiaocheng Feng, Chengpeng Fu, Wenshuai Huo, Ting Liu, Bing Qin

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:19:41Z

**Summary**: Large Language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable abilities in understanding complex texts, offering a promising path towards human-like translation performance. However, this study reveals the misalignment between the translation-specific understanding and the general understanding inside LLMs. This understanding misalignment leads to LLMs mistakenly or literally translating some complicated concepts that they accurately comprehend in the general scenarios (e.g., QA). To align the translation-specific understanding to the general one, we propose a novel translation process, DUAT (Difficult words Understanding Aligned Translation), explicitly incorporating the general understanding on the complicated content incurring inconsistent understanding to guide the translation. Specifically, DUAT performs cross-lingual interpretation for the difficult-to-translate words and enhances the translation with the generated interpretations. Furthermore, we reframe the external tools to improve DUAT in detecting difficult words and generating helpful interpretations. We conduct experiments on the self-constructed benchmark Challenge-WMT, consisting of samples that are prone to mistranslation. Human evaluation results on high-resource and low-resource language pairs indicate that DUAT significantly facilitates the understanding alignment, which improves the translation quality (up to +3.85 COMET) and reduces the literality of the translation by -25% to -51%.

### Analysing the Residual Stream of Language Models Under Knowledge   Conflicts
**Authors**: Yu Zhao, Xiaotang Du, Giwon Hong, Aryo Pradipta Gema, Alessio Devoto, Hongru Wang, Xuanli He, Kam-Fai Wong, Pasquale Minervini

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:12:51Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can store a significant amount of factual knowledge in their parameters. However, their parametric knowledge may conflict with the information provided in the context. Such conflicts can lead to undesirable model behaviour, such as reliance on outdated or incorrect information. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can identify knowledge conflicts and whether it is possible to know which source of knowledge the model will rely on by analysing the residual stream of the LLM. Through probing tasks, we find that LLMs can internally register the signal of knowledge conflict in the residual stream, which can be accurately detected by probing the intermediate model activations. This allows us to detect conflicts within the residual stream before generating the answers without modifying the input or model parameters. Moreover, we find that the residual stream shows significantly different patterns when the model relies on contextual knowledge versus parametric knowledge to resolve conflicts. This pattern can be employed to estimate the behaviour of LLMs when conflict happens and prevent unexpected answers before producing the answers. Our analysis offers insights into how LLMs internally manage knowledge conflicts and provides a foundation for developing methods to control the knowledge selection processes.

### Fine-Tuning LLMs for Reliable Medical Question-Answering Services
**Authors**: Ali Anaissi, Ali Braytee, Junaid Akram

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:12:20Z

**Summary**: We present an advanced approach to medical question-answering (QA) services, using fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the accuracy and reliability of healthcare information. Our study focuses on optimizing models like LLaMA-2 and Mistral, which have shown great promise in delivering precise, reliable medical answers. By leveraging comprehensive datasets, we applied fine-tuning techniques such as rsDoRA+ and ReRAG. rsDoRA+ enhances model performance through a combination of decomposed model weights, varied learning rates for low-rank matrices, and rank stabilization, leading to improved efficiency. ReRAG, which integrates retrieval on demand and question rewriting, further refines the accuracy of the responses. This approach enables healthcare providers to access fast, dependable information, aiding in more efficient decision-making and fostering greater patient trust. Our work highlights the potential of fine-tuned LLMs to significantly improve the quality and accessibility of medical information services, ultimately contributing to better healthcare outcomes for all.

### Unleashing the Potential of Multi-Channel Fusion in Retrieval for   Personalized Recommendations
**Authors**: Junjie Huang, Jiarui Qin, Jianghao Lin, Ziming Feng, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:58:38Z

**Summary**: Recommender systems (RS) are pivotal in managing information overload in modern digital services. A key challenge in RS is efficiently processing vast item pools to deliver highly personalized recommendations under strict latency constraints. Multi-stage cascade ranking addresses this by employing computationally efficient retrieval methods to cover diverse user interests, followed by more precise ranking models to refine the results. In the retrieval stage, multi-channel retrieval is often used to generate distinct item subsets from different candidate generators, leveraging the complementary strengths of these methods to maximize coverage. However, forwarding all retrieved items overwhelms downstream rankers, necessitating truncation. Despite advancements in individual retrieval methods, multi-channel fusion, the process of efficiently merging multi-channel retrieval results, remains underexplored. We are the first to identify and systematically investigate multi-channel fusion in the retrieval stage. Current industry practices often rely on heuristic approaches and manual designs, which often lead to suboptimal performance. Moreover, traditional gradient-based methods like SGD are unsuitable for this task due to the non-differentiable nature of the selection process. In this paper, we explore advanced channel fusion strategies by assigning systematically optimized weights to each channel. We utilize black-box optimization techniques, including the Cross Entropy Method and Bayesian Optimization for global weight optimization, alongside policy gradient-based approaches for personalized merging. Our methods enhance both personalization and flexibility, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple datasets and yielding substantial gains in real-world deployments, offering a scalable solution for optimizing multi-channel fusion in retrieval.

### CartesianMoE: Boosting Knowledge Sharing among Experts via Cartesian   Product Routing in Mixture-of-Experts
**Authors**: Zhenpeng Su, Xing Wu, Zijia Lin, Yizhe Xiong, Minxuan Lv, Guangyuan Ma, Hui Chen, Songlin Hu, Guiguang Ding

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:55:59Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLM) have been attracting much attention from the community recently, due to their remarkable performance in all kinds of downstream tasks. According to the well-known scaling law, scaling up a dense LLM enhances its capabilities, but also significantly increases the computational complexity. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models address that by allowing the model size to grow without substantially raising training or inference costs. Yet MoE models face challenges regarding knowledge sharing among experts, making their performance somehow sensitive to routing accuracy. To tackle that, previous works introduced shared experts and combined their outputs with those of the top $K$ routed experts in an ``addition'' manner. In this paper, inspired by collective matrix factorization to learn shared knowledge among data, we propose CartesianMoE, which implements more effective knowledge sharing among experts in more like a ``multiplication'' manner. Extensive experimental results indicate that CartesianMoE outperforms previous MoE models for building LLMs, in terms of both perplexity and downstream task performance. And we also find that CartesianMoE achieves better expert routing robustness.

**Authors**: Jeremy Stephen Gabriel Yee Zhi Wen, Pai Chet Ng, Zhengkui Wang, Ian McLoughlin, Aik Beng Ng, Simon See

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:48:35Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a systematic review of the infrastructure requirements for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on-device within the context of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), focusing on both hardware and software perspectives. From the hardware viewpoint, we discuss the utilization of processing units like GPUs and TPUs, efficient memory and storage solutions, and strategies for effective deployment, addressing the challenges of limited computational resources typical in SME settings. From the software perspective, we explore framework compatibility, operating system optimization, and the use of specialized libraries tailored for resource-constrained environments. The review is structured to first identify the unique challenges faced by SMEs in deploying LLMs on-device, followed by an exploration of the opportunities that both hardware innovations and software adaptations offer to overcome these obstacles. Such a structured review provides practical insights, contributing significantly to the community by enhancing the technological resilience of SMEs in integrating LLMs.

### Rolling the DICE on Idiomaticity: How LLMs Fail to Grasp Context
**Authors**: Maggie Mi, Aline Villavicencio, Nafise Sadat Moosavi

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:47:37Z

**Summary**: Human processing of idioms relies on understanding the contextual sentences in which idioms occur, as well as language-intrinsic features such as frequency and speaker-intrinsic factors like familiarity. While LLMs have shown high performance on idiomaticity detection tasks, this success may be attributed to reasoning shortcuts in existing datasets. To this end, we construct a novel, controlled contrastive dataset designed to test whether LLMs can effectively use context to disambiguate idiomatic meaning. Additionally, we explore how collocational frequency and sentence probability influence model performance. Our findings reveal that LLMs often fail to resolve idiomaticity when it is required to attend to the surrounding context, and that models perform better on sentences that have higher likelihood. The collocational frequency of expressions also impacts performance. We make our code and dataset publicly available.

### Latent Skill Discovery for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
**Authors**: Zifan Xu, Haozhu Wang, Dmitriy Bespalov, Xuan Wang, Peter Stone, Yanjun Qi

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:21:59Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a popular in-context learning (ICL) approach for large language models (LLMs), especially when tackling complex reasoning tasks. Traditional ICL approaches construct prompts using examples that contain questions similar to the input question. However, CoT prompting, which includes crucial intermediate reasoning steps (rationales) within its examples, necessitates selecting examples based on these rationales rather than the questions themselves. Existing methods require human experts or pre-trained LLMs to describe the skill, a high-level abstraction of rationales, to guide the selection. These methods, however, are often costly and difficult to scale. Instead, this paper introduces a new approach named Latent Reasoning Skills (LaRS) that employs unsupervised learning to create a latent space representation of rationales, with a latent variable called a reasoning skill. Concurrently, LaRS learns a reasoning policy to determine the required reasoning skill for a given question. Then the ICL examples are selected by aligning the reasoning skills between past examples and the question. This approach is theoretically grounded and compute-efficient, eliminating the need for auxiliary LLM inference or manual prompt design. Empirical results demonstrate that LaRS consistently outperforms SOTA skill-based selection methods, processing example banks four times faster, reducing LLM inferences during the selection stage by half, and showing greater robustness to sub-optimal example banks.

### Large Language Models Know What To Say But Not When To Speak
**Authors**: Muhammad Umair, Vasanth Sarathy, JP de Ruiter

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:20:25Z

**Summary**: Turn-taking is a fundamental mechanism in human communication that ensures smooth and coherent verbal interactions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have motivated their use in improving the turn-taking capabilities of Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS), such as their ability to respond at appropriate times. However, existing models often struggle to predict opportunities for speaking -- called Transition Relevance Places (TRPs) -- in natural, unscripted conversations, focusing only on turn-final TRPs and not within-turn TRPs. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel dataset of participant-labeled within-turn TRPs and use it to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in predicting opportunities for speaking. Our experiments reveal the current limitations of LLMs in modeling unscripted spoken interactions, highlighting areas for improvement and paving the way for more naturalistic dialogue systems.

### Benchmarking Pathology Foundation Models: Adaptation Strategies and   Scenarios
**Authors**: Jeaung Lee, Jeewoo Lim, Keunho Byeon, Jin Tae Kwak

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:10:18Z

**Summary**: In computational pathology, several foundation models have recently emerged and demonstrated enhanced learning capability for analyzing pathology images. However, adapting these models to various downstream tasks remains challenging, particularly when faced with datasets from different sources and acquisition conditions, as well as limited data availability. In this study, we benchmark four pathology-specific foundation models across 14 datasets and two scenarios-consistency assessment and flexibility assessment-addressing diverse adaptation scenarios and downstream tasks. In the consistency assessment scenario, involving five fine-tuning methods, we found that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach was both efficient and effective for adapting pathology-specific foundation models to diverse datasets within the same downstream task. In the flexibility assessment scenario under data-limited environments, utilizing five few-shot learning methods, we observed that the foundation models benefited more from the few-shot learning methods that involve modification during the testing phase only. These findings provide insights that could guide the deployment of pathology-specific foundation models in real clinical settings, potentially improving the accuracy and reliability of pathology image analysis. The code for this study is available at: https://github.com/QuIIL/BenchmarkingPathologyFoundationModels.

### Natural GaLore: Accelerating GaLore for memory-efficient LLM Training   and Fine-tuning
**Authors**: Arijit Das

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:05:06Z

**Summary**: Training LLMs presents significant memory challenges due to growing size of data, weights, and optimizer states. Techniques such as data and model parallelism, gradient checkpointing, and offloading strategies address this issue but are often infeasible due to hardware constraints. To mitigate memory usage, alternative methods like Parameter-Efficient-Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and GaLore approximate weights or optimizer states. PEFT methods, such as LoRA, have gained popularity for fine-tuning LLMs, though they require a full-rank warm start. In contrast, GaLore allows full-parameter learning while being more memory-efficient. This work introduces Natural GaLore, a simple drop in replacement for AdamW, which efficiently applies the inverse Empirical Fisher Information Matrix to low-rank gradients using Woodbury's Identity. We demonstrate that incorporating second-order information speeds up optimization significantly, especially when the iteration budget is limited. Empirical pretraining on 60M, 130M, 350M, and 1.1B parameter Llama models on C4 data demonstrate significantly lower perplexity over GaLore without additional memory overhead. By fine-tuning RoBERTa on the GLUE benchmark using Natural GaLore, we demonstrate significant reduction in gap 86.05% vs 86.28% for full-finetuning. Furthermore, fine-tuning the TinyLlama 1.1B model for function calling using the TinyAgent framework shows that Natural GaLore achieving 83.09% accuracy on the TinyAgent dataset, significantly outperforms 16-bit LoRA at 80.06% and even surpasses GPT4-Turbo by 4%, all while using 30% less memory.   All code to reproduce the results are available at: https://github.com/selfsupervised-ai/Natural-GaLore.git

### Beware of Words: Evaluating the Lexical Diversity of Conversational LLMs   using ChatGPT as Case Study
**Authors**: Gonzalo Martínez, José Alberto Hernández, Javier Conde, Pedro Reviriego, Elena Merino

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T14:02:00Z

**Summary**: The performance of conversational Large Language Models (LLMs) in general, and of ChatGPT in particular, is currently being evaluated on many different tasks, from logical reasoning or maths to answering questions on a myriad of topics. Instead, much less attention is being devoted to the study of the linguistic features of the texts generated by these LLMs. This is surprising since LLMs are models for language, and understanding how they use the language is important. Indeed, conversational LLMs are poised to have a significant impact on the evolution of languages as they may eventually dominate the creation of new text. This means that for example, if conversational LLMs do not use a word it may become less and less frequent and eventually stop being used altogether. Therefore, evaluating the linguistic features of the text they produce and how those depend on the model parameters is the first step toward understanding the potential impact of conversational LLMs on the evolution of languages. In this paper, we consider the evaluation of the lexical richness of the text generated by LLMs and how it depends on the model parameters. A methodology is presented and used to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of lexical richness using ChatGPT as a case study. The results show how lexical richness depends on the version of ChatGPT and some of its parameters, such as the presence penalty, or on the role assigned to the model. The dataset and tools used in our analysis are released under open licenses with the goal of drawing the much-needed attention to the evaluation of the linguistic features of LLM-generated text.

### A New Approach to Solving SMAC Task: Generating Decision Tree Code from   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yue Deng, Weiyu Ma, Yuxin Fan, Yin Zhang, Haifeng Zhang, Jian Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:58:38Z

**Summary**: StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) is one of the most commonly used experimental environments in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the specific task is to control a set number of allied units to defeat enemy forces. Traditional MARL algorithms often require interacting with the environment for up to 1 million steps to train a model, and the resulting policies are typically non-interpretable with weak transferability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solving SMAC tasks called LLM-SMAC. In our framework, agents leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate decision tree code by providing task descriptions. The model is further self-reflection using feedback from the rewards provided by the environment. We conduct experiments in the SMAC and demonstrate that our method can produce high-quality, interpretable decision trees with minimal environmental exploration. Moreover, these models exhibit strong transferability, successfully applying to similar SMAC environments without modification. We believe this approach offers a new direction for solving decision-making tasks in the future.

### Fusionize++: Improving Serverless Application Performance Using Dynamic   Task Inlining and Infrastructure Optimization
**Authors**: Trever Schirmer, Joel Scheuner, Tobias Pfandzelter, David Bermbach

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:48:26Z

**Summary**: The Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) execution model increases developer productivity by removing operational concerns such as managing hardware or software runtimes. Developers, however, still need to partition their applications into FaaS functions, which is error-prone and complex: Encapsulating only the smallest logical unit of an application as a FaaS function maximizes flexibility and reusability. Yet, it also leads to invocation overheads, additional cold starts, and may increase cost due to double billing during synchronous invocations. Conversely, deploying an entire application as a single FaaS function avoids these overheads but decreases flexibility. In this paper we present Fusionize, a framework that automates optimizing for this trade-off by automatically fusing application code into an optimized multi-function composition. Developers only need to write fine-grained application code following the serverless model, while Fusionize automatically fuses different parts of the application into FaaS functions, manages their interactions, and configures the underlying infrastructure. At runtime, it monitors application performance and adapts it to minimize request-response latency and costs. Real-world use cases show that Fusionize can improve the deployment artifacts of the application, reducing both median request-response latency and cost of an example IoT application by more than 35%.

### Bypass Back-propagation: Optimization-based Structural Pruning for Large   Language Models via Policy Gradient
**Authors**: Yuan Gao, Zujing Liu, Weizhong Zhang, Bo Du, Gui-Song Xia

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:39:32Z

**Summary**: In contrast to moderate-size neural network pruning, structural weight pruning on the Large-Language Models (LLMs) imposes a novel challenge on the efficiency of the pruning algorithms, due to the heavy computation/memory demands of the LLMs. Recent efficient LLM pruning methods typically operate at the post-training phase without the expensive weight finetuning, however, their pruning criteria often rely on heuristically hand-crafted metrics, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. We instead propose a novel optimization-based structural pruning that learns the pruning masks in a probabilistic space directly by optimizing the loss of the pruned model. To preserve the efficiency, our method eliminates the back-propagation through the LLM per se during the optimization, requiring only the forward pass of the LLM. We achieve this by learning an underlying Bernoulli distribution to sample binary pruning masks, where we decouple the Bernoulli parameters from the LLM loss, thus facilitating an efficient optimization via a policy gradient estimator without back-propagation. As a result, our method is able to 1) operate at structural granularities of channels, heads, and layers, 2) support global and heterogeneous pruning (i.e., our method automatically determines different redundancy for different layers), and 3) optionally initialize with a metric-based method (for our Bernoulli distributions). Extensive experiments on LLaMA, LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, Vicuna, and Mistral using the C4 and WikiText2 datasets demonstrate that our method operates for 2.7 hours with around 35GB memory for the 13B models on a single A100 GPU, and our pruned models outperform the state-of-the-arts w.r.t. both perplexity and the majority of various zero-shot tasks. Codes will be released.

### Exploring Continual Fine-Tuning for Enhancing Language Ability in Large   Language Model
**Authors**: Divyanshu Aggarwal, Sankarshan Damle, Navin Goyal, Satya Lokam, Sunayana Sitaram

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:39:03Z

**Summary**: A common challenge towards the adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to learn new languages over time without hampering the model's performance on languages in which the model is already proficient (usually English). Continual fine-tuning (CFT) is the process of sequentially fine-tuning an LLM to enable the model to adapt to downstream tasks with varying data distributions and time shifts. This paper focuses on the language adaptability of LLMs through CFT. We study a two-phase CFT process in which an English-only end-to-end fine-tuned LLM from Phase 1 (predominantly Task Ability) is sequentially fine-tuned on a multilingual dataset -- comprising task data in new languages -- in Phase 2 (predominantly Language Ability). We observe that the ``similarity'' of Phase 2 tasks with Phase 1 determines the LLM's adaptability. For similar phase-wise datasets, the LLM after Phase 2 does not show deterioration in task ability. In contrast, when the phase-wise datasets are not similar, the LLM's task ability deteriorates. We test our hypothesis on the open-source \mis\ and \llm\ models with multiple phase-wise dataset pairs. To address the deterioration, we analyze tailored variants of two CFT methods: layer freezing and generative replay. Our findings demonstrate their effectiveness in enhancing the language ability of LLMs while preserving task performance, in comparison to relevant baselines.

### Steering Knowledge Selection Behaviours in LLMs via SAE-Based   Representation Engineering
**Authors**: Yu Zhao, Alessio Devoto, Giwon Hong, Xiaotang Du, Aryo Pradipta Gema, Hongru Wang, Kam-Fai Wong, Pasquale Minervini

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:30:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can store a significant amount of factual knowledge in their parameters. However, their parametric knowledge may conflict with the information provided in the context -- this phenomenon, known as \emph{context-memory knowledge conflicts}, can lead to undesirable model behaviour, such as reliance on outdated or incorrect information. Analysing the internal activations of LLMs, we find that they can internally register the signals of knowledge conflict at mid-layers. Such signals allow us to detect whether a knowledge conflict occurs and use \emph{inference-time} intervention strategies to resolve it. In this work, we propose \textsc{SpARE}, a \emph{training-free} representation engineering method that uses pre-trained sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) to control the knowledge selection behaviour of LLMs. \textsc{SpARE} identifies the functional features that control the knowledge selection behaviours and applies them to edit the internal activations of LLMs at inference time. Our experimental results show that \textsc{SpARE} can effectively control the usage of either knowledge source to resolve knowledge conflict in open-domain question-answering tasks, surpassing existing representation engineering methods ($+10\%$) as well as contrastive decoding methods ($+15\%$).

### Optimizing BioTac Simulation for Realistic Tactile Perception
**Authors**: Wadhah Zai El Amri, Nicolás Navarro-Guerrero

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:28:20Z

**Summary**: Tactile sensing presents a promising opportunity for enhancing the interaction capabilities of today's robots. BioTac is a commonly used tactile sensor that enables robots to perceive and respond to physical tactile stimuli. However, the sensor's non-linearity poses challenges in simulating its behavior. In this paper, we first investigate a BioTac simulation that uses temperature, force, and contact point positions to predict the sensor outputs. We show that training with BioTac temperature readings does not yield accurate sensor output predictions during deployment. Consequently, we tested three alternative models, i.e., an XGBoost regressor, a neural network, and a transformer encoder. We train these models without temperature readings and provide a detailed investigation of the window size of the input vectors. We demonstrate that we achieve statistically significant improvements over the baseline network. Furthermore, our results reveal that the XGBoost regressor and transformer outperform traditional feed-forward neural networks in this task. We make all our code and results available online on https://github.com/wzaielamri/Optimizing_BioTac_Simulation.

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:16:58Z

**Summary**: Simulation plays a crucial role in the rapid development and safe deployment of autonomous vehicles. Realistic traffic agent models are indispensable for bridging the gap between simulation and the real world. Many existing approaches for imitating human behavior are based on learning from demonstration. However, these approaches are often constrained by focusing on individual training strategies. Therefore, to foster a broader understanding of realistic traffic agent modeling, in this paper, we provide an extensive comparative analysis of different training principles, with a focus on closed-loop methods for highway driving simulation. We experimentally compare (i) open-loop vs. closed-loop multi-agent training, (ii) adversarial vs. deterministic supervised training, (iii) the impact of reinforcement losses, and (iv) the impact of training alongside log-replayed agents to identify suitable training techniques for realistic agent modeling. Furthermore, we identify promising combinations of different closed-loop training methods.

### Selection-p: Self-Supervised Task-Agnostic Prompt Compression for   Faithfulness and Transferability
**Authors**: Tsz Ting Chung, Leyang Cui, Lemao Liu, Xinting Huang, Shuming Shi, Dit-Yan Yeung

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:11:44Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of natural language processing tasks when leveraging in-context learning. To mitigate the additional computational and financial costs associated with in-context learning, several prompt compression methods have been proposed to compress the in-context learning prompts. Despite their success, these methods face challenges with transferability due to model-specific compression, or rely on external training data, such as GPT-4. In this paper, we investigate the ability of LLMs to develop a unified compression method that discretizes uninformative tokens, utilizing a self-supervised pre-training technique. By introducing a small number of parameters during the continual pre-training, the proposed Selection-p produces a probability for each input token, indicating whether to preserve or discard it. Experiments show Selection-p achieves state-of-the-art performance across numerous classification tasks, achieving compression rates of up to 10 times while experiencing only a marginal 0.8% decrease in performance. Moreover, it exhibits superior transferability to different models compared to prior work. Additionally, we further analyze how Selection-p helps maintain performance on in-context learning with long contexts.

### Granularity Matters in Long-Tail Learning
**Authors**: Shizhen Zhao, Xin Wen, Jiahui Liu, Chuofan Ma, Chunfeng Yuan, Xiaojuan Qi

**Updated**: 2024-10-22T06:35:13Z

**Summary**: Balancing training on long-tail data distributions remains a long-standing challenge in deep learning. While methods such as re-weighting and re-sampling help alleviate the imbalance issue, limited sample diversity continues to hinder models from learning robust and generalizable feature representations, particularly for tail classes. In contrast to existing methods, we offer a novel perspective on long-tail learning, inspired by an observation: datasets with finer granularity tend to be less affected by data imbalance. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon through both quantitative and qualitative studies, showing that increased granularity enhances the generalization of learned features in tail categories. Motivated by these findings, we propose a method to increase dataset granularity through category extrapolation. Specifically, we introduce open-set auxiliary classes that are visually similar to existing ones, aiming to enhance representation learning for both head and tail classes. This forms the core contribution and insight of our approach. To automate the curation of auxiliary data, we leverage large language models (LLMs) as knowledge bases to search for auxiliary categories and retrieve relevant images through web crawling. To prevent the overwhelming presence of auxiliary classes from disrupting training, we introduce a neighbor-silencing loss that encourages the model to focus on class discrimination within the target dataset. During inference, the classifier weights for auxiliary categories are masked out, leaving only the target class weights for use. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three standard long-tail benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, notably outperforming strong baseline methods that use the same amount of data. The code will be made publicly available.

### PROMPTHEUS: A Human-Centered Pipeline to Streamline SLRs with LLMs
**Authors**: João Pedro Fernandes Torres, Catherine Muligan, Joaquim Jorge, Catarina Moreira

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:05:33Z

**Summary**: The growing volume of academic publications poses significant challenges for researchers conducting timely and accurate Systematic Literature Reviews, particularly in fast-evolving fields like artificial intelligence. This growth of academic literature also makes it increasingly difficult for lay people to access scientific knowledge effectively, meaning academic literature is often misrepresented in the popular press and, more broadly, in society. Traditional SLR methods are labor-intensive and error-prone, and they struggle to keep up with the rapid pace of new research. To address these issues, we developed \textit{PROMPTHEUS}: an AI-driven pipeline solution that automates the SLR process using Large Language Models. We aimed to enhance efficiency by reducing the manual workload while maintaining the precision and coherence required for comprehensive literature synthesis. PROMPTHEUS automates key stages of the SLR process, including systematic search, data extraction, topic modeling using BERTopic, and summarization with transformer models. Evaluations conducted across five research domains demonstrate that PROMPTHEUS reduces review time, achieves high precision, and provides coherent topic organization, offering a scalable and effective solution for conducting literature reviews in an increasingly crowded research landscape. In addition, such tools may reduce the increasing mistrust in science by making summarization more accessible to laypeople.   The code for this project can be found on the GitHub repository at https://github.com/joaopftorres/PROMPTHEUS.git

### Enabling Energy-Efficient Deployment of Large Language Models on   Memristor Crossbar: A Synergy of Large and Small
**Authors**: Zhehui Wang, Tao Luo, Cheng Liu, Weichen Liu, Rick Siow Mong Goh, Weng-Fai Wong

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:04:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered substantial attention due to their promising applications in diverse domains. Nevertheless, the increasing size of LLMs comes with a significant surge in the computational requirements for training and deployment. Memristor crossbars have emerged as a promising solution, which demonstrated a small footprint and remarkably high energy efficiency in computer vision (CV) models. Memristors possess higher density compared to conventional memory technologies, making them highly suitable for effectively managing the extreme model size associated with LLMs. However, deploying LLMs on memristor crossbars faces three major challenges. Firstly, the size of LLMs increases rapidly, already surpassing the capabilities of state-of-the-art memristor chips. Secondly, LLMs often incorporate multi-head attention blocks, which involve non-weight stationary multiplications that traditional memristor crossbars cannot support. Third, while memristor crossbars excel at performing linear operations, they are not capable of executing complex nonlinear operations in LLM such as softmax and layer normalization. To address these challenges, we present a novel architecture for the memristor crossbar that enables the deployment of state-of-the-art LLM on a single chip or package, eliminating the energy and time inefficiencies associated with off-chip communication. Our testing on BERT_Large showed negligible accuracy loss. Compared to traditional memristor crossbars, our architecture achieves enhancements of up to 39X in area overhead and 18X in energy consumption. Compared to modern TPU/GPU systems, our architecture demonstrates at least a 68X reduction in the area-delay product and a significant 69% energy consumption reduction.

### Large Language Models for Cross-lingual Emotion Detection
**Authors**: Ram Mohan Rao Kadiyala

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T13:00:09Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a detailed system description of our entry for the WASSA 2024 Task 2, focused on cross-lingual emotion detection. We utilized a combination of large language models (LLMs) and their ensembles to effectively understand and categorize emotions across different languages. Our approach not only outperformed other submissions with a large margin, but also demonstrated the strength of integrating multiple models to enhance performance.

### OAEI-LLM: A Benchmark Dataset for Understanding Large Language Model   Hallucinations in Ontology Matching
**Authors**: Zhangcheng Qiang, Kerry Taylor, Weiqing Wang, Jing Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T12:54:33Z

**Summary**: Hallucinations of large language models (LLMs) commonly occur in domain-specific downstream tasks, with no exception in ontology matching (OM). The prevalence of using LLMs for OM raises the need for benchmarks to better understand LLM hallucinations. The OAEI-LLM dataset is an extended version of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) datasets that evaluate LLM-specific hallucinations in OM tasks. We outline the methodology used in dataset construction and schema extension, and provide examples of potential use cases.

### VeLoRA: Memory Efficient Training using Rank-1 Sub-Token Projections
**Authors**: Roy Miles, Pradyumna Reddy, Ismail Elezi, Jiankang Deng

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T12:53:21Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for tackling many language-processing tasks. Despite their success, training and fine-tuning these models is still far too computationally and memory intensive. In this paper, we identify and characterise the important components needed for effective model convergence using gradient descent. In doing so we find that the intermediate activations used to implement backpropagation can be excessively compressed without incurring any degradation in performance. This result leads us to a cheap and memory-efficient algorithm for both fine-tuning and pre-training LLMs. The proposed algorithm simply divides the tokens up into smaller sub-tokens before projecting them onto a fixed 1-dimensional subspace during the forward pass. These features are then coarsely reconstructed during the backward pass to implement the update rules. We confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm as being complimentary to many state-of-the-art PEFT methods on the VTAB-1k fine-tuning benchmark. Furthermore, we outperform QLoRA for fine-tuning LLaMA and show competitive performance against other memory-efficient pre-training methods on the large-scale C4 dataset.

### Self-Explained Keywords Empower Large Language Models for Code   Generation
**Authors**: Lishui Fan, Mouxiang Chen, Zhongxin Liu

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T12:52:03Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in code generation. However, due to the long-tail distribution of LLMs' training data, low-frequency terms are typically underrepresented in the training process. Consequently, LLMs often misunderstand or overlook problem-specific, low-frequency keywords during code generation, compromising the accuracy of the generated code. To address this, we propose a novel technique named SEK(\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{E}xplained \textbf{K}eywords), which empowers an LLM for better code generation by extracting and explaining the key terms in the problem description with the LLM itself and ranking them based on frequency. Comprehensive experiments across three benchmarks, i.e., HumanEval(+), MBPP(+), and APPS, with five representative LLMs, show that SEK can significantly improve LLMs in code generation, yielding substantial and consistent gains. For instance, SEK improves the Pass@1 of DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct from 85.4\% to 93.3\% on the Humaneval benchmark. Further analysis confirms that SEK enables the LLMs to shift their attention from low-frequency keywords to their corresponding high-frequency counterparts.

### INC-Math: Integrating Natural Language and Code for Enhanced   Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Xuyuan Xiong, Simeng Han, Ziyue Zhou, Arman Cohan

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T12:48:58Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly used to generate solutions for mathematical reasoning problems in the following formats: natural language, code, or a combination of both. In this paper, we explore fundamental questions related to solving mathematical reasoning problems using natural language and code with state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.1-8b-Turbo. Our findings show that LLMs are better at reasoning in natural language compared to code. Additionally, although natural language and code serve as complementary forms of reasoning, they can affect each other in a negative way in certain scenarios. These insights motivate our development of a new prompting method, INC-Math, which leverages an LLM to dynamically select the most appropriate reasoning form, resulting in improved performance over comparable baselines with GPT-4o-mini.

### Do Large Language Models Have an English Accent? Evaluating and   Improving the Naturalness of Multilingual LLMs
**Authors**: Yanzhu Guo, Simone Conia, Zelin Zhou, Min Li, Saloni Potdar, Henry Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T12:34:17Z

**Summary**: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly designed with English as the primary language, and even the few that are multilingual tend to exhibit strong English-centric biases. Much like speakers who might produce awkward expressions when learning a second language, LLMs often generate unnatural outputs in non-English languages, reflecting English-centric patterns in both vocabulary and grammar. Despite the importance of this issue, the naturalness of multilingual LLM outputs has received limited attention. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing novel automatic corpus-level metrics to assess the lexical and syntactic naturalness of LLM outputs in a multilingual context. Using our new metrics, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on a curated benchmark in French and Chinese, revealing a tendency towards English-influenced patterns. To mitigate this issue, we also propose a simple and effective alignment method to improve the naturalness of an LLM in a target language and domain, achieving consistent improvements in naturalness without compromising the performance on general-purpose benchmarks. Our work highlights the importance of developing multilingual metrics, resources and methods for the new wave of multilingual LLMs.

**Authors**: Ayman Asad Khan, Md Toufique Hasan, Kai Kristian Kemell, Jussi Rasku, Pekka Abrahamsson

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T12:21:49Z

**Summary**: This paper presents an experience report on the development of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using PDF documents as the primary data source. The RAG architecture combines generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the precision of information retrieval. This approach has the potential to redefine how we interact with and augment both structured and unstructured knowledge in generative models to enhance transparency, accuracy, and contextuality of responses. The paper details the end-to-end pipeline, from data collection, preprocessing, to retrieval indexing and response generation, highlighting technical challenges and practical solutions. We aim to offer insights to researchers and practitioners developing similar systems using two distinct approaches: OpenAI's Assistant API with GPT Series and Llama's open-source models. The practical implications of this research lie in enhancing the reliability of generative AI systems in various sectors where domain-specific knowledge and real-time information retrieval is important.

### A Low-Cost Privacy-Preserving Digital Wallet for Humanitarian Aid   Distribution
**Authors**: Eva Luvison, Sylvain Chatel, Justinas Sukaitis, Vincent Graf Narbel, Carmela Troncoso, Wouter Lueks

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T12:15:03Z

**Summary**: Humanitarian organizations distribute aid to people affected by armed conflicts or natural disasters. Digitalization has the potential to increase the efficiency and fairness of aid-distribution systems, and recent work by Wang et al. has shown that these benefits are possible without creating privacy harms for aid recipients. However, their work only provides a solution for one particular aid-distribution scenario in which aid recipients receive a pre-defined set of goods. Yet, in many situations it is desirable to enable recipients to decide which items they need at each moment to satisfy their specific needs. We formalize these needs into functional, deployment, security, and privacy requirements, and design a privacy-preserving digital wallet for aid distribution. Our smart-card-based solution enables aid recipients to spend a pre-defined budget at different vendors to obtain the items that they need. We prove our solution's security and privacy properties, and show it is practical at scale.

### CausalGraph2LLM: Evaluating LLMs for Causal Queries
**Authors**: Ivaxi Sheth, Bahare Fatemi, Mario Fritz

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T12:12:21Z

**Summary**: Causality is essential in scientific research, enabling researchers to interpret true relationships between variables. These causal relationships are often represented by causal graphs, which are directed acyclic graphs. With the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an increasing interest in exploring their capabilities in causal reasoning and their potential use to hypothesize causal graphs. These tasks necessitate the LLMs to encode the causal graph effectively for subsequent downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive benchmark, \emph{CausalGraph2LLM}, encompassing a variety of causal graph settings to assess the causal graph understanding capability of LLMs. We categorize the causal queries into two types: graph-level and node-level queries. We benchmark both open-sourced and closed models for our study. Our findings reveal that while LLMs show promise in this domain, they are highly sensitive to the encoding used. Even capable models like GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 exhibit sensitivity to encoding, with deviations of about $60\%$. We further demonstrate this sensitivity for downstream causal intervention tasks. Moreover, we observe that LLMs can often display biases when presented with contextual information about a causal graph, potentially stemming from their parametric memory.

### Claim Check-Worthiness Detection: How Well do LLMs Grasp Annotation   Guidelines?
**Authors**: Laura Majer, Jan Šnajder

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T11:33:33Z

**Summary**: The increasing threat of disinformation calls for automating parts of the fact-checking pipeline. Identifying text segments requiring fact-checking is known as claim detection (CD) and claim check-worthiness detection (CW), the latter incorporating complex domain-specific criteria of worthiness and often framed as a ranking task. Zero- and few-shot LLM prompting is an attractive option for both tasks, as it bypasses the need for labeled datasets and allows verbalized claim and worthiness criteria to be directly used for prompting. We evaluate the LLMs' predictive and calibration accuracy on five CD/CW datasets from diverse domains, each utilizing a different worthiness criterion. We investigate two key aspects: (1) how best to distill factuality and worthiness criteria into a prompt and (2) what amount of context to provide for each claim. To this end, we experiment with varying the level of prompt verbosity and the amount of contextual information provided to the model. Our results show that optimal prompt verbosity is domain-dependent, adding context does not improve performance, and confidence scores can be directly used to produce reliable check-worthiness rankings.

### DefVerify: Do Hate Speech Models Reflect Their Dataset's Definition?
**Authors**: Urja Khurana, Eric Nalisnick, Antske Fokkens

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T11:33:18Z

**Summary**: When building a predictive model, it is often difficult to ensure that domain-specific requirements are encoded by the model that will eventually be deployed. Consider researchers working on hate speech detection. They will have an idea of what is considered hate speech, but building a model that reflects their view accurately requires preserving those ideals throughout the workflow of data set construction and model training. Complications such as sampling bias, annotation bias, and model misspecification almost always arise, possibly resulting in a gap between the domain specification and the model's actual behavior upon deployment. To address this issue for hate speech detection, we propose DefVerify: a 3-step procedure that (i) encodes a user-specified definition of hate speech, (ii) quantifies to what extent the model reflects the intended definition, and (iii) tries to identify the point of failure in the workflow. We use DefVerify to find gaps between definition and model behavior when applied to six popular hate speech benchmark datasets.

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T11:26:20Z

**Summary**: The ease of access to large language models (LLMs) has enabled a widespread of machine-generated texts, and now it is often hard to tell whether a piece of text was human-written or machine-generated. This raises concerns about potential misuse, particularly within educational and academic domains. Thus, it is important to develop practical systems that can automate the process. Here, we present one such system, LLM-DetectAIve, designed for fine-grained detection. Unlike most previous work on machine-generated text detection, which focused on binary classification, LLM-DetectAIve supports four categories: (i) human-written, (ii) machine-generated, (iii) machine-written, then machine-humanized, and (iv) human-written, then machine-polished. Category (iii) aims to detect attempts to obfuscate the fact that a text was machine-generated, while category (iv) looks for cases where the LLM was used to polish a human-written text, which is typically acceptable in academic writing, but not in education. Our experiments show that LLM-DetectAIve can effectively identify the above four categories, which makes it a potentially useful tool in education, academia, and other domains.   LLM-DetectAIve is publicly accessible at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/LLM-DetectAIve. The video describing our system is available at https://youtu.be/E8eT_bE7k8c.

### StrucText-Eval: Evaluating Large Language Model's Reasoning Ability in   Structure-Rich Text
**Authors**: Zhouhong Gu, Haoning Ye, Xingzhou Chen, Zeyang Zhou, Hongwei Feng, Yanghua Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T11:06:06Z

**Summary**: The effective utilization of structured data, integral to corporate data strategies, has been challenged by the rise of large language models (LLMs) capable of processing unstructured information. This shift prompts the question: can LLMs interpret structured data directly in its unstructured form? We propose an automatic evaluation data generation method for assessing LLMs' reasoning capabilities on structure-rich text to explore this. Our approach supports 8 structured languages and 29 tasks, generating data with adjustable complexity through controllable nesting and structural width. We introduce StrucText-Eval, a benchmark containing 5,800 pre-generated and annotated samples designed to evaluate how well LLMs understand and reason through structured text. StrucText-Eval is divided into two suites: a regular Test suite (3,712 samples) and a Test-Hard suite (2,088 samples), the latter emphasizing the gap between human and model performance on more complex tasks. Experimental results show that while open-source LLMs achieve a maximum accuracy of 74.9\% on the standard dataset, their performance drops significantly to 45.8\% on the harder dataset. In contrast, human participants reach an accuracy of 92.6\% on StrucText-Eval-Hard, highlighting LLMs' current limitations in handling intricate structural information. The benchmark and generation codes are open sourced in \url{https://github.com/MikeGu721/StrucText-Eval}

### How to Build a Pre-trained Multimodal model for Simultaneously Chatting   and Decision-making?
**Authors**: Zuojin Tang, Bin Hu, Chenyang Zhao, De Ma, Gang Pan, Bin Liu

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T11:02:42Z

**Summary**: Existing large pre-trained models typically map text input to text output in an end-to-end manner, such as ChatGPT, or map a segment of text input to a hierarchy of action decisions, such as OpenVLA. However, humans can simultaneously generate text and actions when receiving specific input signals. For example, a driver can make precise driving decisions while conversing with a friend in the passenger seat. Motivated by this observation, we consider the following question in this work: is it possible to construct a pre-trained model that can provide both language interaction and precise decision-making capabilities in dynamic open scenarios. We provide a definitive answer to this question by developing a new model architecture termed Visual Language Action model for Chatting and Decision Making (VLA4CD), and further demonstrating its performance in challenging autonomous driving tasks. Specifically, we leverage LoRA to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM with data of multiple modalities covering language, visual, and action. Unlike the existing LoRA operations used for LLM fine-tuning, we have designed new computational modules and training cost functions for VLA4CD. These designs enable VLA4CD to provide continuous-valued action decisions while outputting text responses. In contrast, existing LLMs can only output text responses, and current VLA models can only output action decisions. Moreover, these VLA models handle action data by discretizing and then tokenizing the discretized actions, a method unsuitable for complex decision-making tasks involving high-dimensional continuous-valued action vectors, such as autonomous driving. The experimental results on CARLA validate that: (1) our proposed model construction method is effective; (2) compared to the SOTA VLA model, VLA4CD can provide more accurate real-time decision-making while retaining the text interaction capability inherent to LLMs.

### Mesa-Extrapolation: A Weave Position Encoding Method for Enhanced   Extrapolation in LLMs
**Authors**: Xin Ma, Yang Liu, Jingjing Liu, Xiaoxu Ma

**Updated**: 2024-10-22T08:00:00Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs), although having revolutionized many fields, still suffer from the challenging extrapolation problem, where the inference ability of LLMs sharply declines beyond their max training lengths. In this work, we conduct a theoretical analysis to better understand why No Position Encoding (NoPE) fails outside its effective range, as well as examining the power of Position Encoding (PE) in this context. Our findings reveal that with meticulous weave position, PE can indeed be extended beyond effective range. Our theorems establish that LLMs equipped with weave PE can achieve improved extrapolation performance without additional cost. Furthermore, we introduce a novel weave PE method, Mesa-Extrapolation, which utilizes a chunk-based triangular attention matrix and applies Stair PE to manage the final chunk. This method not only retains competitive performance but also offers substantial benefits such as significantly reduced memory demand and faster inference speed. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Mesa-Extrapolation, demonstrating its potential as a scalable solution to enhancing LLMs applicative reach.

**Authors**: Tejumade Afonja, Ivaxi Sheth, Ruta Binkyte, Waqar Hanif, Thomas Ulas, Matthias Becker, Mario Fritz

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T09:46:37Z

**Summary**: Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) represent the causal relationships between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Understanding these networks is crucial for uncovering disease mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. In this work, we investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) for GRN discovery, leveraging their learned biological knowledge alone or in combination with traditional statistical methods. We develop a task-based evaluation strategy to address the challenge of unavailable ground truth causal graphs. Specifically, we use the GRNs suggested by LLMs to guide causal synthetic data generation and compare the resulting data against the original dataset. Our statistical and biological assessments show that LLMs can support statistical modeling and data synthesis for biological research.

### Mitigating Biases of Large Language Models in Stance Detection with   Counterfactual Augmented Calibration
**Authors**: Ang Li, Jingqian Zhao, Bin Liang, Lin Gui, Hui Wang, Xi Zeng, Xingwei Liang, Kam-Fai Wong, Ruifeng Xu

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T09:42:55Z

**Summary**: Stance detection is critical for understanding the underlying position or attitude expressed toward a topic. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements across various natural language processing tasks including stance detection, however, their performance in stance detection is limited by biases and spurious correlations inherent due to their data-driven nature. Our statistical experiment reveals that LLMs are prone to generate biased stances due to sentiment-stance spurious correlations and preference towards certain individuals and topics. Furthermore, the results demonstrate a strong negative correlation between stance bias and stance detection performance, underscoring the importance of mitigating bias to enhance the utility of LLMs in stance detection. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Counterfactual Augmented Calibration Network (FACTUAL), which a novel calibration network is devised to calibrate potential bias in the stance prediction of LLMs. Further, to address the challenge of effectively learning bias representations and the difficulty in the generalizability of debiasing, we construct counterfactual augmented data. This approach enhances the calibration network, facilitating the debiasing and out-of-domain generalization. Experimental results on in-target and zero-shot stance detection tasks show that the proposed FACTUAL can effectively mitigate biases of LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### Large Language Models Empower Personalized Valuation in Auction
**Authors**: Jie Sun, Tianyu Zhang, Houcheng Jiang, Kexin Huang, Chi Luo, Junkang Wu, Jiancan Wu, An Zhang, Xiang Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T09:31:51Z

**Summary**: Auctions, a fundamental economic mechanism, encompass the valuation of goods or services and the competitive bidding algorithms within a specific framework, serving to uncover the true market value. However, current research predominantly focuses on the bidding algorithms within a given auction mechanism, often overlooking the advantages of incorporating individual bidders' unique preferences and the semantic information related to the items into the valuation process. Our analysis, both theoretical and empirical, shows that imprecise or noisy valuations can significantly affect the overall utility for participants. To bridge this gap, we propose a personalized valuation framework, namely \textbf{S}emantic-enhanced \textbf{P}ersonalized \textbf{V}aluation in \textbf{A}uction (\ours), which integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate semantic information into each bidder's unique valuation process. Specifically, SPVA employs a two-stage approach: it first fine-tunes LLMs to encode bidder preferences in personalized valuations, and then constructs a Vickrey auction environment integrated with a bidding algorithm to demonstrate that SPVA's more accurate valuations result in higher profits. Additionally, we have developed a semantic-enhanced dataset comprising over 23,000 samples and introduced new personalized evaluation metrics that reflect both bidder preferences and profit. Through simulations of various auction scenarios, our method demonstrates its ability to provide accurate valuations and capture bidder preferences, affirming the method's effectiveness in real-world auction settings.

### Software Frugality in an Accelerating World: the Case of Continuous   Integration
**Authors**: Quentin Perez, Romain Lefeuvre, Thomas Degueule, Olivier Barais, Benoit Combemale

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T09:29:50Z

**Summary**: The acceleration of software development and delivery requires rigorous continuous testing and deployment of software systems, which are being deployed in increasingly diverse, complex, and dynamic environments. In recent years, the popularization of DevOps and integrated software forges like GitLab and GitHub has largely democratized Continuous Integration (CI) practices for a growing number of software. However, this trend intersects significantly with global energy consumption concerns and the growing demand for frugality in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector. CI pipelines typically run in data centers which contribute significantly to the environmental footprint of ICT, yet there is little information available regarding their environmental impact. This article aims to bridge this gap by conducting the first large-scale analysis of the energy footprint of CI pipelines implemented with GitHub Actions and to provide a first overview of the energy impact of CI. We collect, instrument, and reproduce 838 workflows from 396 Java repositories hosted on GitHub to measure their energy consumption. We observe that the average unitary energy cost of a pipeline is relatively low, at 10 Wh. However, due to repeated invocations of these pipelines in real settings, the aggregated energy consumption cost per project is high, averaging 22 kWh. When evaluating CO2 emissions based on regional Wh-to-CO2 estimates, we observe that the average aggregated CO2 emissions are significant, averaging 10.5 kg. To put this into perspective, this is akin to the emissions produced by driving approximately 100 kilometers in a typical European car (110 gCO2/km). In light of our results, we advocate that developers should have the means to better anticipate and reflect on the environmental consequences of their CI choices when implementing DevOps practices.

**Summary**: With the ever-increasing demands on Question Answering (QA) systems for IT operations and maintenance, an efficient and supervised fine-tunable framework is necessary to ensure the data security, private deployment and continuous upgrading. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have notably improved the open-domain QA's performance, how to efficiently handle enterprise-exclusive corpora and build domain-specific QA systems are still less-studied for industrial applications. In this paper, we propose a general and comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and facilitate the whole business process of establishing QA systems for IT operations and maintenance. In accordance with the prevailing RAG method, our proposed framework, named with RAG4ITOps, composes of two major stages: (1) Models Fine-tuning \& Data Vectorization, and (2) Online QA System Process. At the Stage 1, we leverage a contrastive learning method with two negative sampling strategies to fine-tune the embedding model, and design the instruction templates to fine-tune the LLM with a Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning method. At the Stage 2, an efficient process of QA system is built for serving. We collect enterprise-exclusive corpora from the domain of cloud computing, and the extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior results than counterparts on two kinds of QA tasks. Our experiment also provide a case for applying the RAG4ITOps to real-world enterprise-level applications.

**Authors**: Cem Üyük, Danica Rovó, Shaghayegh Kolli, Rabia Varol, Georg Groh, Daryna Dementieva

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T08:58:39Z

**Summary**: In the era dominated by information overload and its facilitation with Large Language Models (LLMs), the prevalence of misinformation poses a significant threat to public discourse and societal well-being. A critical concern at present involves the identification of machine-generated news. In this work, we take a significant step by introducing a benchmark dataset designed for neural news detection in four languages: English, Turkish, Hungarian, and Persian. The dataset incorporates outputs from multiple multilingual generators (in both, zero-shot and fine-tuned setups) such as BloomZ, LLaMa-2, Mistral, Mixtral, and GPT-4. Next, we experiment with a variety of classifiers, ranging from those based on linguistic features to advanced Transformer-based models and LLMs prompting. We present the detection results aiming to delve into the interpretablity and robustness of machine-generated texts detectors across all target languages.

### Truth is Universal: Robust Detection of Lies in LLMs
**Authors**: Lennart Bürger, Fred A. Hamprecht, Boaz Nadler

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T08:55:49Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionised natural language processing, exhibiting impressive human-like capabilities. In particular, LLMs are capable of "lying", knowingly outputting false statements. Hence, it is of interest and importance to develop methods to detect when LLMs lie. Indeed, several authors trained classifiers to detect LLM lies based on their internal model activations. However, other researchers showed that these classifiers may fail to generalise, for example to negated statements. In this work, we aim to develop a robust method to detect when an LLM is lying. To this end, we make the following key contributions: (i) We demonstrate the existence of a two-dimensional subspace, along which the activation vectors of true and false statements can be separated. Notably, this finding is universal and holds for various LLMs, including Gemma-7B, LLaMA2-13B, Mistral-7B and LLaMA3-8B. Our analysis explains the generalisation failures observed in previous studies and sets the stage for more robust lie detection; (ii) Building upon (i), we construct an accurate LLM lie detector. Empirically, our proposed classifier achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 94% accuracy in both distinguishing true from false factual statements and detecting lies generated in real-world scenarios.

### Reducing Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models via Latent Space   Steering
**Authors**: Sheng Liu, Haotian Ye, Lei Xing, James Zou

**Updated**: 2024-10-22T05:01:28Z

**Summary**: Hallucination poses a challenge to the deployment of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in applications. Unlike in large language models (LLMs), hallucination in LVLMs often arises from misalignments between visual inputs and textual outputs. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of hallucination, focusing on the unique structure of LVLMs that distinguishes them from large language models (LLMs). We identify that hallucinations often arise from the sensitivity of text decoders to vision inputs, a natural phenomenon when image encoders and text decoders are pre-trained separately. Inspired by this, we introduce Visual and Textual Intervention (VTI), a novel technique designed to reduce hallucinations by steering latent space representations during inference to enhance the stability of vision features. As a task-agnostic test-time intervention, VTI can be easily applied to any problem without additional cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it can effectively reduce hallucinations and outperform baseline methods across multiple metrics, highlighting the critical role of vision feature stability in LVLMs.

### Learning-to-Defer for Extractive Question Answering
**Authors**: Montreuil Yannis, Carlier Axel, Ng Lai Xing, Ooi Wei Tsang

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T08:21:00Z

**Summary**: Pre-trained language models have profoundly impacted the field of extractive question-answering, leveraging large-scale textual corpora to enhance contextual language understanding. Despite their success, these models struggle in complex scenarios that demand nuanced interpretation or inferential reasoning beyond immediate textual cues. Furthermore, their size poses deployment challenges on resource-constrained devices. Addressing these limitations, we introduce an adapted two-stage Learning-to-Defer mechanism that enhances decision-making by enabling selective deference to human experts or larger models without retraining language models in the context of question-answering. This approach not only maintains computational efficiency but also significantly improves model reliability and accuracy in ambiguous contexts. We establish the theoretical soundness of our methodology by proving Bayes and $(\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{R})$--consistency of our surrogate loss function, guaranteeing the optimality of the final solution. Empirical evaluations on the SQuADv2 dataset illustrate performance gains from integrating human expertise and leveraging larger models. Our results further demonstrate that deferring a minimal number of queries allows the smaller model to achieve performance comparable to their larger counterparts while preserving computing efficiency, thus broadening the applicability of pre-trained language models in diverse operational environments.

### Automated Proof Generation for Rust Code via Self-Evolution
**Authors**: Tianyu Chen, Shuai Lu, Shan Lu, Yeyun Gong, Chenyuan Yang, Xuheng Li, Md Rakib Hossain Misu, Hao Yu, Nan Duan, Peng Cheng, Fan Yang, Shuvendu K Lahiri, Tao Xie, Lidong Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T08:15:45Z

**Summary**: Ensuring correctness is crucial for code generation. Formal verification offers a definitive assurance of correctness, but demands substantial human effort in proof construction and hence raises a pressing need for automation. The primary obstacle lies in the severe lack of data - there is much less proof than code for LLMs to train upon. In this paper, we introduce SAFE, a novel framework that overcomes the lack of human-written proof to enable automated proof generation of Rust code. SAFE establishes a self-evolving cycle where data synthesis and fine-tuning collaborate to enhance the model capability, leveraging the definitive power of a symbolic verifier in telling correct proof from incorrect ones. SAFE also re-purposes the large number of synthesized incorrect proofs to train the self-debugging capability of the fine-tuned models, empowering them to fix incorrect proofs based on the verifier's feedback. SAFE demonstrates superior efficiency and precision compared to GPT-4o. Through tens of thousands of synthesized proofs and the self-debugging mechanism, we improve the capability of open-source models, initially unacquainted with formal verification, to automatically write proof for Rust code. This advancement leads to a significant improvement in performance, achieving a 70.50% accuracy rate in a benchmark crafted by human experts, a significant leap over GPT-4o's performance of 24.46%.

### Who's Who: Large Language Models Meet Knowledge Conflicts in Practice
**Authors**: Quang Hieu Pham, Hoang Ngo, Anh Tuan Luu, Dat Quoc Nguyen

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T07:56:45Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods are viable solutions for addressing the static memory limits of pre-trained language models. Nevertheless, encountering conflicting sources of information within the retrieval context is an inevitable practical challenge. In such situations, the language models are recommended to transparently inform users about the conflicts rather than autonomously deciding what to present based on their inherent biases. To analyze how current large language models (LLMs) align with our recommendation, we introduce WhoQA, a public benchmark dataset to examine model's behavior in knowledge conflict situations. We induce conflicts by asking about a common property among entities having the same name, resulting in questions with up to 8 distinctive answers. WhoQA evaluation set includes 5K questions across 13 Wikidata property types and 150K Wikipedia entities. Our experiments show that despite the simplicity of WhoQA questions, knowledge conflicts significantly degrades LLMs' performance in RAG settings.

### AutoTrain: No-code training for state-of-the-art models
**Authors**: Abhishek Thakur

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T07:53:32Z

**Summary**: With the advancements in open-source models, training (or finetuning) models on custom datasets has become a crucial part of developing solutions which are tailored to specific industrial or open-source applications. Yet, there is no single tool which simplifies the process of training across different types of modalities or tasks. We introduce AutoTrain (aka AutoTrain Advanced) -- an open-source, no code tool/library which can be used to train (or finetune) models for different kinds of tasks such as: large language model (LLM) finetuning, text classification/regression, token classification, sequence-to-sequence task, finetuning of sentence transformers, visual language model (VLM) finetuning, image classification/regression and even classification and regression tasks on tabular data. AutoTrain Advanced is an open-source library providing best practices for training models on custom datasets. The library is available at https://github.com/huggingface/autotrain-advanced. AutoTrain can be used in fully local mode or on cloud machines and works with tens of thousands of models shared on Hugging Face Hub and their variations.

### Efficient Non-Myopic Layered Bayesian Optimization For Large-Scale   Bathymetric Informative Path Planning
**Authors**: Alexander Kiessling, Ignacio Torroba, Chelsea Rose Sidrane, Ivan Stenius, Jana Tumova, John Folkesson

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T07:39:13Z

**Summary**: Informative path planning (IPP) applied to bathymetric mapping allows AUVs to focus on feature-rich areas to quickly reduce uncertainty and increase mapping efficiency. Existing methods based on Bayesian optimization (BO) over Gaussian Process (GP) maps work well on small scenarios but they are short-sighted and computationally heavy when mapping larger areas, hindering deployment in real applications. To overcome this, we present a 2-layered BO IPP method that performs non-myopic, real-time planning in a tree search fashion over large Stochastic Variational GP maps, while respecting the AUV motion constraints and accounting for localization uncertainty. Our framework outperforms the standard industrial lawn-mowing pattern and a myopic baseline in a set of hardware in the loop (HIL) experiments in an embedded platform over real bathymetry.

### Motion Segmentation for Neuromorphic Aerial Surveillance
**Authors**: Sami Arja, Alexandre Marcireau, Saeed Afshar, Bharath Ramesh, Gregory Cohen

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T07:34:04Z

**Summary**: Aerial surveillance demands rapid and precise detection of moving objects in dynamic environments. Event cameras, which draw inspiration from biological vision systems, present a promising alternative to frame-based sensors due to their exceptional temporal resolution, superior dynamic range, and minimal power requirements. Unlike traditional frame-based sensors that capture redundant information at fixed intervals, event cameras asynchronously record pixel-level brightness changes, providing a continuous and efficient data stream ideal for fast motion segmentation. While these sensors are ideal for fast motion segmentation, existing event-based motion segmentation methods often suffer from limitations such as the need for per-scene parameter tuning or reliance on manual labelling, hindering their scalability and practical deployment. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a novel motion segmentation method that leverages self-supervised vision transformers on both event data and optical flow information. Our approach eliminates the need for human annotations and reduces dependency on scene-specific parameters. In this paper, we used the EVK4-HD Prophesee event camera onboard a highly dynamic aerial platform in urban settings. We conduct extensive evaluations of our framework across multiple datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance compared to existing benchmarks. Our method can effectively handle various types of motion and an arbitrary number of moving objects. Code and dataset are available at: \url{https://samiarja.github.io/evairborne/}

### Residual vector quantization for KV cache compression in large language   model
**Authors**: Ankur Kumar

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T07:20:41Z

**Summary**: KV cache compression methods have mainly relied on scalar quantization techniques to reduce the memory requirements during decoding. In this work, we apply residual vector quantization, which has been widely used for high fidelity audio compression, to compress KV cache in large language models (LLM). We adapt the standard recipe with minimal changes to compress the output of any key or value projection matrix in a pretrained LLM: we scale the vector by its standard deviation, divide channels into groups and then quantize each group with the same residual vector quantizer. We learn the codebook using exponential moving average and there are no other learnable parameters including the input and output projections normally used in a vector quantization set up. We find that a residual depth of 8 recovers most of the performance of the unquantized model. We also find that grouping non-contiguous channels together works better than grouping contiguous channels for compressing key matrix and the method further benefits from a light weight finetuning of LLM together with the quantization. Overall, the proposed technique is competitive with existing quantization methods while being much simpler and results in 5.5x compression compared to half precision.

**Authors**: Derong Xu, Ziheng Zhang, Zhihong Zhu, Zhenxi Lin, Qidong Liu, Xian Wu, Tong Xu, Xiangyu Zhao, Yefeng Zheng, Enhong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T07:19:19Z

**Summary**: The impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have attracted extensive interests of applying LLMs to medical field. However, the complex nature of clinical environments presents significant hallucination challenges for LLMs, hindering their widespread adoption. In this paper, we address these hallucination issues in the context of Medical Information Extraction (MIE) tasks by introducing ALternate Contrastive Decoding (ALCD). We begin by redefining MIE tasks as an identify-and-classify process. We then separate the identification and classification functions of LLMs by selectively masking the optimization of tokens during fine-tuning. During the inference stage, we alternately contrast output distributions derived from sub-task models. This approach aims to selectively enhance the identification and classification capabilities while minimizing the influence of other inherent abilities in LLMs. Additionally, we propose an alternate adaptive constraint strategy to more effectively adjust the scale and scope of contrastive tokens. Through comprehensive experiments on two different backbones and six diverse medical information extraction tasks, ALCD demonstrates significant improvements in resolving hallucination issues compared to conventional decoding methods.

### Students Rather Than Experts: A New AI For Education Pipeline To Model   More Human-Like And Personalised Early Adolescences
**Authors**: Yiping Ma, Shiyu Hu, Xuchen Li, Yipei Wang, Shiqing Liu, Kang Hao Cheong

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T07:18:24Z

**Summary**: The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been applied in expert systems across various domains, providing new opportunities for AI in Education. Educational interactions involve a cyclical exchange between teachers and students. Current research predominantly focuses on using LLMs to simulate teachers, leveraging their expertise to enhance student learning outcomes. However, the simulation of students, which could improve teachers' instructional skills, has received insufficient attention due to the challenges of modeling and evaluating virtual students. This research asks: Can LLMs be utilized to develop virtual student agents that mimic human-like behavior and individual variability? Unlike expert systems focusing on knowledge delivery, virtual students must replicate learning difficulties, emotional responses, and linguistic uncertainties. These traits present significant challenges in both modeling and evaluation. To address these issues, this study focuses on language learning as a context for modeling virtual student agents. We propose a novel AI4Education framework, called SOE (Scene-Object-Evaluation), to systematically construct LVSA (LLM-based Virtual Student Agents). By curating a dataset of personalized teacher-student interactions with various personality traits, question types, and learning stages, and fine-tuning LLMs using LoRA, we conduct multi-dimensional evaluation experiments. Specifically, we: (1) develop a theoretical framework for generating LVSA; (2) integrate human subjective evaluation metrics into GPT-4 assessments, demonstrating a strong correlation between human evaluators and GPT-4 in judging LVSA authenticity; and (3) validate that LLMs can generate human-like, personalized virtual student agents in educational contexts, laying a foundation for future applications in pre-service teacher training and multi-agent simulation environments.

### InternLM2.5-StepProver: Advancing Automated Theorem Proving via Expert   Iteration on Large-Scale LEAN Problems
**Authors**: Zijian Wu, Suozhi Huang, Zhejian Zhou, Huaiyuan Ying, Jiayu Wang, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T07:18:23Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in mathematical theorem proving, particularly when utilizing formal languages such as LEAN. The major learning paradigm is expert iteration, which necessitates a pre-defined dataset comprising numerous mathematical problems. In this process, LLMs attempt to prove problems within the dataset and iteratively refine their capabilities through self-training on the proofs they discover. We propose to use large scale LEAN problem datasets Lean-workbook for expert iteration with more than 20,000 CPU days. During expert iteration, we found log-linear trends between solved problem amount with proof length and CPU usage. We train a critic model to select relatively easy problems for policy models to make trials and guide the model to search for deeper proofs. InternLM2.5-StepProver achieves open-source state-of-the-art on MiniF2F, Lean-Workbook-Plus, ProofNet, and Putnam benchmarks. Specifically, it achieves a pass of 65.9% on the MiniF2F-test and proves (or disproves) 17.0% of problems in Lean-Workbook-Plus which shows a significant improvement compared to only 9.5% of problems proved when Lean-Workbook-Plus was released. We open-source our models and searched proofs at https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-Math and https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/Lean-Workbook.

### Unconstrained Model Merging for Enhanced LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Yiming Zhang, Baoyi He, Shengyu Zhang, Yuhao Fu, Qi Zhou, Zhijie Sang, Zijin Hong, Kejing Yang, Wenjun Wang, Jianbo Yuan, Guanghan Ning, Linyi Li, Chunlin Ji, Fei Wu, Hongxia Yang

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T07:12:26Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in building domain-specific large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, especially in tasks requiring reasoning abilities like logical inference over complex relationships and multi-step problem solving. However, creating a powerful all-in-one LLM remains challenging due to the need for proprietary data and vast computational resources. As a resource-friendly alternative, we explore the potential of merging multiple expert models into a single LLM. Existing studies on model merging mainly focus on generalist LLMs instead of domain experts, or the LLMs under the same architecture and size. In this work, we propose an unconstrained model merging framework that accommodates both homogeneous and heterogeneous model architectures with a focus on reasoning tasks. A fine-grained layer-wise weight merging strategy is designed for homogeneous models merging, while heterogeneous model merging is built upon the probabilistic distribution knowledge derived from instruction-response fine-tuning data. Across 7 benchmarks and 9 reasoning-optimized LLMs, we reveal key findings that combinatorial reasoning emerges from merging which surpasses simple additive effects. We propose that unconstrained model merging could serve as a foundation for decentralized LLMs, marking a notable progression from the existing centralized LLM framework. This evolution could enhance wider participation and stimulate additional advancement in the field of artificial intelligence, effectively addressing the constraints posed by centralized models.

We critically analyze existing research aimed at understanding, examining, and mitigating these ethical risks. Our survey underscores integrating ethical standards and societal values into the development of LLMs, thereby guiding the development of responsible and ethically aligned language models.

### Efficient Terminology Integration for LLM-based Translation in   Specialized Domains
**Authors**: Sejoon Kim, Mingi Sung, Jeonghwan Lee, Hyunkuk Lim, Jorge Froilan Gimenez Perez

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T07:01:25Z

**Summary**: Traditional machine translation methods typically involve training models directly on large parallel corpora, with limited emphasis on specialized terminology. However, In specialized fields such as patent, finance, or biomedical domains, terminology is crucial for translation, with many terms that needs to be translated following agreed-upon conventions. In this paper we introduce a methodology that efficiently trains models with a smaller amount of data while preserving the accuracy of terminology translation. We achieve this through a systematic process of term extraction and glossary creation using the Trie Tree algorithm, followed by data reconstruction to teach the LLM how to integrate these specialized terms. This methodology enhances the model's ability to handle specialized terminology and ensures high-quality translations, particularly in fields where term consistency is crucial. Our approach has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving the highest translation score among participants in the WMT patent task to date, showcasing its effectiveness and broad applicability in specialized translation domains where general methods often fall short.

### Can LLMs Recognize Toxicity? A Structured Investigation Framework and   Toxicity Metric
**Authors**: Hyukhun Koh, Dohyung Kim, Minwoo Lee, Kyomin Jung

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T06:56:26Z

**Summary**: In the pursuit of developing Large Language Models (LLMs) that adhere to societal standards, it is imperative to detect the toxicity in the generated text. The majority of existing toxicity metrics rely on encoder models trained on specific toxicity datasets, which are susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems and depend on the dataset's definition of toxicity. In this paper, we introduce a robust metric grounded on LLMs to flexibly measure toxicity according to the given definition. We first analyze the toxicity factors, followed by an examination of the intrinsic toxic attributes of LLMs to ascertain their suitability as evaluators. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our metric with detailed analysis. Our empirical results demonstrate outstanding performance in measuring toxicity within verified factors, improving on conventional metrics by 12 points in the F1 score. Our findings also indicate that upstream toxicity significantly influences downstream metrics, suggesting that LLMs are unsuitable for toxicity evaluations within unverified factors.

### Wireless Human-Machine Collaboration in Industry 5.0
**Authors**: Gaoyang Pang, Wanchun Liu, Dusit Niyato, Daniel Quevedo, Branka Vucetic, Yonghui Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T06:56:03Z

**Summary**: Wireless Human-Machine Collaboration (WHMC) represents a critical advancement for Industry 5.0, enabling seamless interaction between humans and machines across geographically distributed systems. As the WHMC systems become increasingly important for achieving complex collaborative control tasks, ensuring their stability is essential for practical deployment and long-term operation. Stability analysis certifies how the closed-loop system will behave under model randomness, which is essential for systems operating with wireless communications. However, the fundamental stability analysis of the WHMC systems remains an unexplored challenge due to the intricate interplay between the stochastic nature of wireless communications, dynamic human operations, and the inherent complexities of control system dynamics. This paper establishes a fundamental WHMC model incorporating dual wireless loops for machine and human control. Our framework accounts for practical factors such as short-packet transmissions, fading channels, and advanced HARQ schemes. We model human control lag as a Markov process, which is crucial for capturing the stochastic nature of human interactions. Building on this model, we propose a stochastic cycle-cost-based approach to derive a stability condition for the WHMC system, expressed in terms of wireless channel statistics, human dynamics, and control parameters. Our findings are validated through extensive numerical simulations and a proof-of-concept experiment, where we developed and tested a novel wireless collaborative cart-pole control system. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and provide a robust framework for future research on WHMC systems in more complex environments.

### DomainSum: A Hierarchical Benchmark for Fine-Grained Domain Shift in   Abstractive Text Summarization
**Authors**: Haohan Yuan, Haopeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T06:55:35Z

**Summary**: Most research on abstractive summarization focuses on single-domain applications, often neglecting how domain shifts between documents affect performance and the generalization ability of summarization models. To address this issue, we introduce DomainSum, a hierarchical benchmark designed to capture fine-grained domain shifts in abstractive summarization. We categorize these shifts into three levels: genre, style, and topic, and demonstrate through comprehensive benchmark analysis that they follow a hierarchical structure. Furthermore, we evaluate the domain generalization capabilities of commonly used pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs) in in-domain and cross-domain settings.
