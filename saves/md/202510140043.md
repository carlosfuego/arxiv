 ### StreamingVLM: Real-Time Understanding for Infinite Video Streams
**Authors**: Ruyi Xu, Guangxuan Xiao, Yukang Chen, Liuning He, Kelly Peng, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:59:58Z

**Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks, a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks, which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense, per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning, improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by +5.96.

### DiskJoin: Large-scale Vector Similarity Join with SSD
**Authors**: Yanqi Chen, Xiao Yan, Alexandra Meliou, Eric Lo

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:56:23Z

**Summary**: Similarity join--a widely used operation in data science--finds all pairs of items that have distance smaller than a threshold. Prior work has explored distributed computation methods to scale similarity join to large data volumes but these methods require a cluster deployment, and efficiency suffers from expensive inter-machine communication. On the other hand, disk-based solutions are more cost-effective by using a single machine and storing the large dataset on high-performance external storage, such as NVMe SSDs, but in these methods the disk I/O time is a serious bottleneck. In this paper, we propose DiskJoin, the first disk-based similarity join algorithm that can process billion-scale vector datasets efficiently on a single machine. DiskJoin improves disk I/O by tailoring the data access patterns to avoid repetitive accesses and read amplification. It also uses main memory as a dynamic cache and carefully manages cache eviction to improve cache hit rate and reduce disk retrieval time. For further acceleration, we adopt a probabilistic pruning technique that can effectively prune a large number of vector pairs from computation. Our evaluation on real-world, large-scale datasets shows that DiskJoin significantly outperforms alternatives, achieving speedups from 50x to 1000x.

### Memory- and compute-optimized geometric multigrid GMGPolar for   curvilinear coordinate representations -- Applications to fusion plasma
**Authors**: Julian Litz, Philippe Leleux, Carola Kruse, Joscha Gedicke, Martin J. Kühn

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:08:26Z

**Summary**: Tokamak fusion reactors are actively studied as a means of realizing energy production from plasma fusion. However, due to the substantial cost and time required to construct fusion reactors and run physical experiments, numerical experiments are indispensable for understanding plasma physics inside tokamaks, supporting the design and engineering phase, and optimizing future reactor designs. Geometric multigrid methods are optimal solvers for many problems that arise from the discretization of partial differential equations. It has been shown that the multigrid solver GMGPolar solves the 2D gyrokinetic Poisson equation in linear complexity and with only small memory requirements compared to other state-of-the-art solvers. In this paper, we present a completely refactored and object-oriented version of GMGPolar which offers two different matrix-free implementations. Among other things, we leverage the Sherman-Morrison formula to solve cyclic tridiagonal systems from circular line solvers without additional fill-in and we apply reordering to optimize cache access of circular and radial smoothing operations. With the Give approach, memory requirements are further reduced and speedups of four to seven are obtained for usual test cases. For the Take approach, speedups of 16 to 18 can be attained. In an additionally experimental setup of using GMGPolar as a preconditioner for conjugate gradients, this speedup could even be increased to factors between 25 and 37.

### Efficient Autoregressive Inference for Transformer Probabilistic Models
**Authors**: Conor Hassan, Nasrulloh Loka, Cen-You Li, Daolang Huang, Paul E. Chang, Yang Yang, Francesco Silvestrin, Samuel Kaski, Luigi Acerbi

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:32:58Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based models for amortized probabilistic inference, such as neural processes, prior-fitted networks, and tabular foundation models, excel at single-pass marginal prediction. However, many real-world applications, from signal interpolation to multi-column tabular predictions, require coherent joint distributions that capture dependencies between predictions. While purely autoregressive architectures efficiently generate such distributions, they sacrifice the flexible set-conditioning that makes these models powerful for meta-learning. Conversely, the standard approach to obtain joint distributions from set-based models requires expensive re-encoding of the entire augmented conditioning set at each autoregressive step. We introduce a causal autoregressive buffer that preserves the advantages of both paradigms. Our approach decouples context encoding from updating the conditioning set. The model processes the context once and caches it. A dynamic buffer then captures target dependencies: as targets are incorporated, they enter the buffer and attend to both the cached context and previously buffered targets. This enables efficient batched autoregressive generation and one-pass joint log-likelihood evaluation. A unified training strategy allows seamless integration of set-based and autoregressive modes at minimal additional cost. Across synthetic functions, EEG signals, cognitive models, and tabular data, our method matches predictive accuracy of strong baselines while delivering up to 20 times faster joint sampling. Our approach combines the efficiency of autoregressive generative models with the representational power of set-based conditioning, making joint prediction practical for transformer-based probabilistic models.

### 3C Resources Joint Allocation for Time-Deterministic Remote Sensing   Image Backhaul in the Space-Ground Integrated Network
**Authors**: Chongxiao Cai, Yan Zhu, Min Sheng, Jiandong Li, Yan Shi, Di Zhou, Ziwen Xie, Chen Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:03:42Z

**Summary**: Low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites assist observation satellites (OSs) to compress and backhaul more time-determined images (TDI) has become a new paradigm, which is used to enhance the timeout caused by the limited computing resources of OSs. However, how to capture the time-varying and dynamic characteristics of multi-dimensional resources is challenging for efficient collaborative scheduling. Motivated by this factor, we design a highly succinct multi-dimensional resource time-expanded graph (MDR-TEG) modell. Specifically, by employing a slots division mechanism and introducing an external virtual node, the time-varying communication, caching, and computing (3C) resources are depicted in low complexity by the link weights within, between, and outside the slots. Based on the MDR-TEG, the maximizing successful transmission ratio of TDI (MSTR-TDI) is modeled as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Which further relaxed decomposed into two tractable sub-problems: maximizing the successful transmission rate of images (MSTRI) and ensuring the timeliness problem (ETP). Subsequently, an efficient subgradient of relaxation computing constraint (SRCC) algorithm is proposed. The upper and lower bounds of MSTR-TDI are obtained by solving the two subproblems and the dual problem (DP), and the direction of the next iteration is obtained by feedback. Furthermore, arranging the sending sequences of images to improve the quality of the solution. The approximate optimal solution of MSTR-TDI is eventually obtained through repeated iterations. The simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed MDR-TEG model and the effectiveness of the SRCC.

### Systematic Assessment of Cache Timing Vulnerabilities on RISC-V   Processors
**Authors**: Cédrick Austa, Jan Tobias Mühlberg, Jean-Michel Dricot

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:15:40Z

**Summary**: While interest in the open RISC-V instruction set architecture is growing, tools to assess the security of concrete processor implementations are lacking. There are dedicated tools and benchmarks for common microarchitectural side-channel vulnerabilities for popular processor families such as Intel x86-64 or ARM, but not for RISC-V. In this paper we describe our efforts in porting an Intel x86-64 benchmark suite for cache-based timing vulnerabilities to RISC-V. We then use this benchmark to evaluate the security of three commercially available RISC-V processors, the T-Head C910 and the SiFive U54 and U74 cores. We observe that the C910 processor exhibits more distinct timing types than the other processors, leading to the assumption that code running on the C910 would be exposed to more microarchitectural vulnerability sources. In addition, our evaluation reveals that $65.9\%$ of the vulnerabilities covered by the benchmark exist in all processors, while only $6.8\%$ are absent from all cores. Our work, in particular the ported benchmark, aims to support RISC-V processor designers to identify leakage sources early in their designs and to support the development of countermeasures.

### Mem4Nav: Boosting Vision-and-Language Navigation in Urban Environments   with a Hierarchical Spatial-Cognition Long-Short Memory System
**Authors**: Lixuan He, Haoyu Dong, Zhenxing Chen, Yangcheng Yu, Jie Feng, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:08:39Z

**Summary**: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/Mem4Nav.

### Mask Tokens as Prophet: Fine-Grained Cache Eviction for Efficient dLLM   Inference
**Authors**: Jianuo Huang, Yaojie Zhang, Yicun Yang, Benhao Huang, Biqing Qi, Dongrui Liu, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:01:16Z

**Summary**: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to dominant autoregressive models (ARMs) by the ability of parallel decoding at the expense of substantial computation and memory costs. Specifically, the cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/jianuo-huang/MaskKV

### Online Video Depth Anything: Temporally-Consistent Depth Prediction with   Low Memory Consumption
**Authors**: Johann-Friedrich Feiden, Tim Küchler, Denis Zavadski, Bogdan Savchynskyy, Carsten Rother

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T09:24:53Z

**Summary**: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power hardware.

### Enhanced Breakdown and RF Performance in Field-Plated AlGaN/GaN HEMT for   High-Power Applications
**Authors**: Tanjim Rahman, Trupti Ranjan Lenka

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T08:57:16Z

**Summary**: High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) are most suitable for harsh environments as they operate reliably under extreme conditions such as high voltages, high temperatures, radiation exposure and corrosive atmospheres. In this article, gate field-plated engineering Al0.295GaN/GaN HEMT is proposed for achieving high breakdown voltage to reliably operate in harsh environments. The Al0.295GaN/GaN heterointerface results in a 2DEG (two-dimensional electron gas) density of the order of 1013 cm-2 obtained from the self-consistent solution of Schr\"odinger and Poisson equations. The device has undergone DC and breakdown simulations which result in threshold voltage of -5.5 V, drain saturation current of 3000 mA, and breakdown voltage of 1 kV. The HEMT also shows excellent RF characteristics which include cut-off frequency (ft) of 28 GHz and maximum frequency of oscillation (fmax) of 38 GHz. The proposed gate field-plated HEMT is stable up to 40 GHz and suitable for high-voltage and high-power RF operation during harsh environment applications.

### Autoencoding-Free Context Compression for LLMs via Contextual Semantic   Anchors
**Authors**: Xin Liu, RunSong Zhao, PengCheng Huang, XinYu Liu, JunYi Xiao, ChunYang Xiao, Tong Xiao, Shengxiang Gao, Zhengtao Yu, JingBo Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T01:42:14Z

**Summary**: Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2) bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves 1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing advantages at higher compression ratios.

### Lizard: An Efficient Linearization Framework for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chien Van Nguyen, Ruiyi Zhang, Hanieh Deilamsalehy, Puneet Mathur, Viet Dac Lai, Haoliang Wang, Jayakumar Subramanian, Ryan A. Rossi, Trung Bui, Nikos Vlassis, Franck Dernoncourt, Thien Huu Nguyen

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T20:37:43Z

**Summary**: We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into subquadratic architectures. Transformers faces severe computational and memory bottlenecks with long sequences due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing Key-Value (KV) cache that makes inference memory-bound by context length. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while preserving model quality. Unlike prior linearization methods constrained by fixed, non-adaptive structures, Lizard augments the architecture with compact, learnable modules that enable adaptive memory control and robust length generalization. Moreover, we introduce a hardwareaware algorithm that solves numerical instability in gated attention to accelerate training. Extensive experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of its teacher model's performance, significantly outperforming previous methods by up to 9.4 - 24.5 points on the 5-shot MMLU benchmark and demonstrating superior associative recall.

### Man-Made Heuristics Are Dead. Long Live Code Generators!
**Authors**: Rohit Dwivedula, Divyanshu Saxena, Aditya Akella, Swarat Chaudhuri, Daehyeok Kim

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T20:35:00Z

**Summary**: Policy design for various systems controllers has conventionally been a manual process, with domain experts carefully tailoring heuristics for the specific instance in which the policy will be deployed. In this paper, we re-imagine policy design via a novel automated search technique fueled by recent advances in generative models, specifically Large Language Model (LLM)-driven code generation. We outline the design and implementation of PolicySmith, a framework that applies LLMs to synthesize instance-optimal heuristics. We apply PolicySmith to two long-standing systems policies - web caching and congestion control, highlighting the opportunities unraveled by this LLM-driven heuristic search. For caching, PolicySmith discovers heuristics that outperform established baselines on standard open-source traces. For congestion control, we show that PolicySmith can generate safe policies that integrate directly into the Linux kernel.

### Struc-EMB: The Potential of Structure-Aware Encoding in Language   Embeddings
**Authors**: Shikun Liu, Haoyu Wang, Mufei Li, Pan Li

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T19:45:54Z

**Summary**: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text, overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations, that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy, moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually aware embedding models.

### Which Heads Matter for Reasoning? RL-Guided KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Wenjie Du, Li Jiang, Keda Tao, Xue Liu, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T17:50:00Z

**Summary**: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV) cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

### Scaling up Multi-Turn Off-Policy RL and Multi-Agent Tree Search for LLM   Step-Provers
**Authors**: Ran Xin, Zeyu Zheng, Yanchen Nie, Kun Yuan, Xia Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T17:45:50Z

**Summary**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem proving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by challenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and inference-time compute. This paper introduces \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system designed to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary innovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space, enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics benchmarks. \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\% and 41.4\% on the MiniF2F and ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal mathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of broader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon multi-turn reasoning and complex search.

### Spiffy: Multiplying Diffusion LLM Acceleration via Lossless Speculative   Decoding
**Authors**: Sudhanshu Agrawal, Risheek Garrepalli, Raghavv Goel, Mingu Lee, Christopher Lott, Fatih Porikli

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T17:38:52Z

**Summary**: Diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs (AR-LLMs) with the potential to operate at significantly higher token generation rates. However, currently available open-source dLLMs often generate at much lower rates, typically decoding only a single token at every denoising timestep in order to maximize output quality. We present Spiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by $\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output distribution. This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying ideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes draft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an auto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and eliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To structure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph which is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise nature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To further optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an efficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines high-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling increased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup achieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent innovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and multi-token unmasking. We demonstrate that when combined with such parallel decoding algorithms, Spiffy is able to effectively multiply the benefits of these methods leading to total speedups of up to $\mathbf{7.9\times}$.

### FreqCa: Accelerating Diffusion Models via Frequency-Aware Caching
**Authors**: Jiacheng Liu, Peiliang Cai, Qinming Zhou, Yuqi Lin, Deyang Kong, Benhao Huang, Yupei Pan, Haowen Xu, Chang Zou, Junshu Tang, Shikang Zheng, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T17:22:23Z

**Summary**: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps. Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images, exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)   which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.   Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF) instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint of feature caching by 99%.   Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing. Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on GitHub.

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T16:19:42Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference pipeline into four modular components-model, diffusion iteration manager, decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager-and integrates novel algorithms for each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800 tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to prior systems, dInfer delivers $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while maintaining similar model performance. Even compared with AR models (with a comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which is highly optimized with latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still deliverers $2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.

### FMCache: File-System Metadata Caching in Programmable Switches
**Authors**: Qingxiu Liu, Jiazhen Cai, Siyuan Sheng, Yuhui Chen, Lu Tang, Zhirong Shen, Patrick P. C. Lee

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T15:38:13Z

**Summary**: Fast and scalable metadata management across multiple metadata servers is crucial for distributed file systems to handle numerous files and directories. Client-side caching of frequently accessed metadata can mitigate server loads, but incurs significant overhead and complexity in maintaining cache consistency when the number of clients increases. We propose FMCache, an in-switch file-system metadata caching framework that leverages programmable switches to serve file-system metadata requests from multiple clients directly in the switch data plane. Unlike prior in-switch key-value caching approaches, FMCache addresses file-system-specific path dependencies under stringent switch resource constraints. We implement FMCache atop Hadoop HDFS and evaluate it on a Tofino-switch testbed using real-world file-system metadata workloads. FMCache achieves up to 181.6% higher throughput than vanilla HDFS and complements client-side caching with additional throughput gains of up to 139.6%. It also incurs low latencies and limited switch resource usage.

### Towards Energy-Efficient Serverless Computing with Hardware Isolation
**Authors**: Natalie Carl, Tobias Pfandzelter, David Bermbach

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T13:06:16Z

**Summary**: Serverless computing provides just-in-time infrastructure provisioning with rapid elasticity and a finely-grained pricing model. As full control of resource allocation is in the hands of the cloud provider and applications only consume resources when they actually perform work, we believe that serverless computing is uniquely positioned to maximize energy efficiency.   However, the focus of current serverless platforms is to run hundreds or thousands of serverless functions from different tenants on traditional server hardware, requiring expensive software isolation mechanisms and a high degree of overprovisioning, i.e., idle servers, to anticipate load spikes. With shared caches, high clock frequencies, and many-core architectures, servers today are optimized for large, singular workloads but not to run thousands of isolated functions.   We propose rethinking the serverless hardware architecture to align it with the requirements of serverless software. Specifically, we propose using hardware isolation with individual processors per function instead of software isolation resulting in a serverless hardware stack that consumes energy only when an application actually performs work. In preliminary evaluation with real hardware and a typical serverless workload we find that this could reduce energy consumption overheads by 90.63% or an average 70.8MW.

### TASP: Topology-aware Sequence Parallelism
**Authors**: Yida Wang, Ke Hong, Xiuhong Li, Yuanchao Xu, Wenxun Wang, Guohao Dai, Yu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T13:03:29Z

**Summary**: Long-context large language models (LLMs) face constraints due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The mainstream sequence parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency, restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.   Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and multi-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate that TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these modern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring Attention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention. The code is available at https://github.com/infinigence/HamiltonAttention.

### TokenSelect: Efficient Long-Context Inference and Length Extrapolation   for LLMs via Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection
**Authors**: Wei Wu, Zhuoshi Pan, Chao Wang, Liyi Chen, Yunchu Bai, Tianfu Wang, Kun Fu, Zheng Wang, Hui Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T12:05:04Z

**Summary**: Rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred demand for processing extended context sequences in contemporary applications. However, this progress faces two challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues limit LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using QK dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a few critical KV cache tokens in attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we design the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented the efficient Paged Dot Product Kernel, significantly reducing the selection overhead. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to $23.84\times$ speedup in attention computation and up to $2.28\times$ acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.

### Panorama: Fast-Track Nearest Neighbors
**Authors**: Vansh Ramani, Alexis Schlomer, Akash Nayar, Panagiotis Karras, Sayan Ranu, Jignesh M. Patel

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T12:01:20Z

**Summary**: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space, aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts, SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns. Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

### Spotlight Attention: Towards Efficient LLM Generation via Non-linear   Hashing-based KV Cache Retrieval
**Authors**: Wenhao Li, Yuxin Zhang, Gen Luo, Haiyuan Wan, Ziyang Gong, Fei Chao, Rongrong Ji

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T09:33:47Z

**Summary**: Reducing the key-value (KV) cache burden in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerates inference. Dynamically selecting critical KV caches during decoding helps maintain performance. Existing methods use random linear hashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to the orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in LLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear hashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys, enhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight, stable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling optimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8 hours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves retrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least 5$\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the computational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA kernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\mu$s on a single A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\times$ higher than vanilla decoding.

### Generative AI-enhanced Low-Altitude UAV-Mounted Stacked Intelligent   Metasurfaces
**Authors**: Geng Sun, Mingzhe Fan, Lei Zhang, Hongyang Pan, Jiahui Li, Chuang Zhang, Linyao Li, Changyuan Zhao, Chau Yuen

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T09:14:43Z

**Summary**: Wireless communication systems face challenges in meeting the demand for higher data rates and reliable connectivity in complex environments. Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a promising technology for advanced wave-domain signal processing, where mobile SIMs can outperform fixed counterparts. In this paper, we propose a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted SIM (UAV-SIM) assisted communication system within low-altitude economy (LAE) networks, where UAVs act as both cache-enabled base stations and mobile SIM carriers to enhance uplink transmissions. To maximize network capacity, we formulate a UAV-SIM-based joint optimization problem (USBJOP) that integrates user association, UAV-SIM three-dimensional positioning, and multi-layer SIM phase shift design. Due to the non-convexity and NP-hardness of USBJOP, we decompose it into three subproblems, which are the association between UAV-SIMs and users optimization problem (AUUOP), the UAV location optimization problem (ULOP), and the UAV-SIM phase shifts optimization problem (USPSOP). Then, we solve them through an alternating optimization strategy. Specifically, AUUOP and ULOP are transformed into convex forms solvable via the CVX tool, while USPSOP is addressed by a generative artificial intelligence (GAI)-based hybrid optimization algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves approximately 1.5 times higher network capacity compared with suboptimal schemes, effectively mitigates multi-user interference with increasing SIM layers and meta-atoms, and reduces runtime by 10\% while maintaining solution quality, thereby demonstrating its practicality for real-world deployments.

### LLM meets ML: Data-efficient Anomaly Detection on Unstable Logs
**Authors**: Fatemeh Hadadi, Qinghua Xu, Domenico Bianculli, Lionel Briand

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T02:37:26Z

**Summary**: Most log-based anomaly detectors assume logs are stable, though logs are often unstable due to software or environmental changes. Anomaly detection on unstable logs (ULAD) is therefore a more realistic, yet under-investigated challenge. Current approaches predominantly employ machine learning (ML) models, which often require extensive labeled data for training. To mitigate data insufficiency, we propose FlexLog, a novel hybrid approach for ULAD that combines ML models -- decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and a feedforward neural network -- with a Large Language Model (Mistral) through ensemble learning. FlexLog also incorporates a cache and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further enhance efficiency and effectiveness. To evaluate FlexLog, we configured four datasets for \task, namely ADFA-U, LOGEVOL-U, SynHDFS-U, and SYNEVOL-U. FlexLog outperforms all baselines by at least 1.2 percentage points (pp) in F1 score while using much less labeled data (62.87 pp reduction). When trained on the same amount of data as the baselines, FlexLog achieves up to a 13 pp increase in F1 score on ADFA-U across varying training dataset sizes. Additionally, FlexLog maintains inference time under one second per log sequence, making it suitable for most applications, except latency-sensitive systems. Further analysis reveals the positive impact of FlexLog's key components: cache, RAG and ensemble learning.

### FlashDLM: Accelerating Diffusion Language Model Inference via Efficient   KV Caching and Guided Diffusion
**Authors**: Zhanqiu Hu, Jian Meng, Yash Akhauri, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah, Jae-sun Seo, Zhiru Zhang, Udit Gupta

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T01:43:02Z

**Summary**: Diffusion language models offer parallel token generation and inherent bidirectionality, promising more efficient and powerful sequence modeling compared to autoregressive approaches. However, state-of-the-art diffusion models (e.g., Dream 7B, LLaDA 8B) suffer from slow inference. While they match the quality of similarly sized autoregressive (AR) models (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B, Llama3 8B), their iterative denoising requires multiple full-sequence forward passes, resulting in high computational costs and latency, particularly for long input prompts and long-context scenarios. Furthermore, parallel token generation introduces token incoherence problems, and current sampling heuristics suffer from significant quality drops with decreasing denoising steps. We address these limitations with two training-free techniques. First, we propose FreeCache, a Key-Value (KV) approximation caching technique that reuses stable KV projections across denoising steps, effectively reducing the computational cost of DLM inference. Second, we introduce Guided Diffusion, a training-free method that uses a lightweight pretrained autoregressive model to supervise token unmasking, dramatically reducing the total number of denoising iterations without sacrificing quality. We conduct extensive evaluations on open-source reasoning benchmarks, and our combined methods deliver an average of 12.14x end-to-end speedup across various tasks with negligible accuracy degradation. For the first time, diffusion language models achieve a comparable and even faster latency as the widely adopted autoregressive models. Our work successfully paved the way for scaling up the diffusion language model to a broader scope of applications across different domains.

**Authors**: Binzhe Yuan, Xiangyu Zhang, Zeyu Zheng, Yuefeng Zhang, Haochuan Wan, Zhechen Yuan, Junsheng Chen, Yunxiang He, Junran Ding, Xiaoming Zhang, Chaolin Rao, Wenyan Su, Pingqiang Zhou, Jingyi Yu, Xin Lou

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T01:40:39Z

**Summary**: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have transformed 3D reconstruction and rendering, facilitating photorealistic image synthesis from sparse viewpoints. This work introduces an explicit data reuse neural rendering (EDR-NR) architecture, which reduces frequent external memory accesses (EMAs) and cache misses by exploiting the spatial locality from three phases, including rays, ray packets (RPs), and samples. The EDR-NR architecture features a four-stage scheduler that clusters rays on the basis of Z-order, prioritize lagging rays when ray divergence happens, reorders RPs based on spatial proximity, and issues samples out-of-orderly (OoO) according to the availability of on-chip feature data. In addition, a four-tier hierarchical RP marching (HRM) technique is integrated with an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) to facilitate spatial skipping (SS), reducing redundant computations and improving throughput. Moreover, a balanced allocation strategy for feature storage is proposed to mitigate SRAM bank conflicts. Fabricated using a 40 nm process with a die area of 10.5 mmX, the EDR-NR chip demonstrates a 2.41X enhancement in normalized energy efficiency, a 1.21X improvement in normalized area efficiency, a 1.20X increase in normalized throughput, and a 53.42% reduction in on-chip SRAM consumption compared to state-of-the-art accelerators.

### OBCache: Optimal Brain KV Cache Pruning for Efficient Long-Context LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Yuzhe Gu, Xiyu Liang, Jiaojiao Zhao, Enmao Diao

**Updated**: 2025-10-09T00:58:28Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size. Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity, yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs. Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

### When Thoughts Meet Facts: Reusable Reasoning for Long-Context LMs
**Authors**: Soyeong Jeong, Taehee Jung, Sung Ju Hwang, Joo-Kyung Kim, Dongyeop Kang

**Updated**: 2025-10-08T19:52:35Z

**Summary**: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However, simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models, demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

### AsyncSpade: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Asynchronous Sparse   Decoding
**Authors**: Shuqing Luo, Yilin Guan, Pingzhi Li, Hanrui Wang, Tianlong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-10-08T19:36:11Z

**Summary**: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT), but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection, hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

### Speculate Deep and Accurate: Lossless and Training-Free Acceleration for   Offloaded LLMs via Substitute Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Pei-Shuo Wang, Jian-Jia Chen, Chun-Che Yang, Chi-Chih Chang, Ning-Chi Huang, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah, Kai-Chiang Wu

**Updated**: 2025-10-08T18:16:04Z

**Summary**: The immense model sizes of large language models (LLMs) challenge deployment on memory-limited consumer GPUs. Although model compression and parameter offloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can degrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow inference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate parameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft tokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single forward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward passes that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on pretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align with custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model training usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from insufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token acceptance lengths. To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups, we propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading that is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft model by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target LLM portions. Additionally, our method shares the remaining GPU-resident layers and the KV-Cache, further reducing memory overhead and enhance alignment. SubSpec achieves a high average acceptance length, delivering 9.1x speedup for Qwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and an average of 12.5x speedup for Qwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit).

### Artificial Hippocampus Networks for Efficient Long-Context Modeling
**Authors**: Yunhao Fang, Weihao Yu, Shu Zhong, Qinghao Ye, Xuehan Xiong, Lai Wei

**Updated**: 2025-10-08T17:59:55Z

**Summary**: Long-sequence modeling faces a fundamental trade-off between the efficiency of compressive fixed-size memory in RNN-like models and the fidelity of lossless growing memory in attention-based Transformers. Inspired by the Multi-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework of artificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of the Transformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module termed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses out-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To validate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like architectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and Gated DeltaNet. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate that AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and achieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while substantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance, augmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5% and memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k sequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88. Code is available at: https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/AHN.

### Agentic generative AI for media content discovery at the national   football league
**Authors**: Henry Wang, Md Sirajus Salekin, Jake Lee, Ross Claytor, Shinan Zhang, Michael Chi

**Updated**: 2025-10-08T17:51:34Z

**Summary**: Generative AI has unlocked new possibilities in content discovery and management. Through collaboration with the National Football League (NFL), we demonstrate how a generative-AI based workflow enables media researchers and analysts to query relevant historical plays using natural language rather than traditional filter-and-click interfaces. The agentic workflow takes a user query as input, breaks it into elements, and translates them into the underlying database query language. Accuracy and latency are further improved through carefully designed semantic caching. The solution achieves over 95 percent accuracy and reduces the average time to find relevant videos from 10 minutes to 30 seconds, significantly increasing the NFL's operational efficiency and allowing users to focus on producing creative content and engaging storylines.

**Updated**: 2025-10-08T17:50:16Z

**Summary**: Processing long-form audio is a major challenge for Large Audio Language models (LALMs). These models struggle with the quadratic cost of attention ($O(N^2)$) and with modeling long-range temporal dependencies. Existing audio benchmarks are built mostly from short clips and do not evaluate models in realistic long context settings. To address this gap, we introduce AudioMarathon, a benchmark designed to evaluate both understanding and inference efficiency on long-form audio. AudioMarathon provides a diverse set of tasks built upon three pillars: long-context audio inputs with durations ranging from 90.0 to 300.0 seconds, which correspond to encoded sequences of 2,250 to 7,500 audio tokens, respectively, full domain coverage across speech, sound, and music, and complex reasoning that requires multi-hop inference. We evaluate state-of-the-art LALMs and observe clear performance drops as audio length grows. We also study acceleration techniques and analyze the trade-offs of token pruning and KV cache eviction. The results show large gaps across current LALMs and highlight the need for better temporal reasoning and memory-efficient architectures. We believe AudioMarathon will drive the audio and multimodal research community to develop more advanced audio understanding models capable of solving complex audio tasks.

### FlowKV: Enhancing Multi-Turn Conversational Coherence in LLMs via   Isolated Key-Value Cache Management
**Authors**: Xiang Liu, Hong Chen, Xuming Hu, Xiaowen Chu

**Updated**: 2025-10-08T00:06:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn conversational applications, where the management of the Key-Value (KV) Cache presents a significant bottleneck. The linear growth of the KV Cache with dialogue history imposes substantial computational costs, and existing eviction strategies often degrade performance by repeatedly compressing early conversational context, leading to information loss and context forgetting. This paper introduces FlowKV, a novel \textbf{multi-turn isolation mechanism} for KV Cache management, which can be applied to any KV Cache compression method without training. FlowKV's core innovation is a multi-turn isolation mechanism that preserves the accumulated compressed KV cache from past turns. Compression is then strategically applied only to the newly generated KV pairs of the latest completed turn, effectively preventing the re-compression of older context and thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our results demonstrate that FlowKV consistently and significantly outperforms baseline strategies in maintaining instruction-following accuracy and user preference retention from 10.90\% to 75.40\%, particularly in later conversational turns.

**Updated**: 2025-10-07T22:07:44Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding is widely adopted to reduce latency in large language model (LLM) inference by leveraging smaller draft models capable of handling diverse user tasks. However, emerging AI applications, such as LLM-based agents, present unique workload characteristics: instead of diverse independent requests, agentic frameworks typically submit repetitive inference requests, such as multi-agent pipelines performing similar subtasks or self-refinement loops iteratively enhancing outputs. These workloads result in long and highly predictable sequences, which current speculative decoding methods do not effectively exploit. To address this gap, we introduce \emph{SuffixDecoding}, a novel method that utilizes efficient suffix trees to cache long token sequences from prompts and previous outputs. By adaptively speculating more tokens when acceptance likelihood is high and fewer when it is low, SuffixDecoding effectively exploits opportunities for longer speculations while conserving computation when those opportunities are limited. Evaluations on agentic benchmarks, including SWE-Bench and Text-to-SQL, demonstrate that SuffixDecoding achieves speedups of up to 5.3$\times$, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- 2.8$\times$ faster than model-based approaches like EAGLE-2/3 and 1.9$\times$ faster than model-free approaches such as Token Recycling.

**Summary**: This study investigates the impact of fast neutron irradiation and post-radiation electro-thermal annealing on the electrical performance of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Schottky barrier diodes. Devices irradiated with 1 MeV neutrons at a high fluence of 1E15 n/cm^2 exhibited substantial degradation, including a drastic reduction in on-current and an increase in on-resistance. Electrothermal testing, conducted through simultaneous current-voltage (J-V) measurements and thermal annealing, resulted in significant recovery. After four cycles of electro-thermal testing, the devices demonstrated significant improvements in performance, with a substantial recovery of on-current and a reduction in on-resistance compared to the post-radiation condition, approaching pre-radiation levels. Most recovery occurred during the first two cycles, with diminishing improvements in later cycles, indicating that most thermally recoverable traps were mitigated early. Capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements revealed a substantial reduction in carrier concentration, decreasing from 3.2E16 cm^-3 pre-radiation to 5.5E15 cm^-3 after the first electro-thermal testing cycle, indicating an over 82% reduction. Following the third cycle, the carrier concentration partially recovered to 9.9E15 cm^-3, reflecting a carrier removal rate of ~22 cm^-1. The breakdown voltage exhibited a remarkable enhancement, increasing from approximately 300 V to 1.28 kV (a ~325% improvement) after the first electro-thermal testing, attributed to the reduction in carrier concentration by compensating radiation-induced traps. Subsequent testing reduced breakdown voltage slightly to 940 V due to partial recovery of carrier concentration, but it remained significantly higher than pre-radiation levels, highlighting the promise of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ power devices for high-power applications in radiation-intense environments.

### VecInfer: Efficient LLM Inference with Low-Bit KV Cache via   Outlier-Suppressed Vector Quantization
**Authors**: Dingyu Yao, Chenxu Yang, Zhengyang Tong, Zheng Lin, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Weiping Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-07T17:35:28Z

**Summary**: The Key-Value (KV) cache introduces substantial memory overhead during large language model (LLM) inference. Although existing vector quantization (VQ) methods reduce KV cache usage and provide flexible representational capacity across bit-widths, they suffer severe performance degradation at ultra-low bit-widths due to key cache outliers that hinder effective codebook utilization. To address this challenge, we propose VecInfer, a novel VQ method for aggressive KV cache compression while enabling efficient inference. By applying smooth and Hadamard transformations, VecInfer suppresses outliers in the key cache, enabling the codebook to comprehensively cover the original data distribution and thereby reducing quantization difficulty. To facilitate efficient deployment, we design an optimized CUDA kernel that fuses computation with dequantization to minimize memory access overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VecInfer consistently outperforms existing quantization baselines across both long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning tasks. With only 2-bit quantization, VecInfer achieves performance comparable to full precision, while delivering up to $\mathbf{2.7\times}$ speedup in large-batch self-attention computation and $\mathbf{8.3\times}$ reduction in single-batch end-to-end latency on Llama-3.1-8B with a 196k sequence length.

### On Enhancing Delay SLAs in TCP Networks through Joint Routing and   Transport Assistant Deployment
**Authors**: José Gómez-delaHiz, Mohamed Faten Zhani, Jaime Galán-Jiménez, John Kaippallimalil

**Updated**: 2025-10-07T08:43:07Z

**Summary**: The Transport Control Protocol has long been the primary transport protocol for applications requiring performance and reliability over the Internet. Unfortunately, due its retransmission mechanism, TCP incurs high packet delivery delays when segments are lost. To address this issue, previous research proposed to use a novel network function, namely Transport Assistant, deployed within the network to cache and retransmit lost packets, thus reducing retransmission delays. In this paper, we propose to jointly route the flows and deploy TAs in order to minimize packet delivery delays in best-effort networks (scenario 1) or to satisfy delay-based Service Level Agreements in QoS-based networks (scenario 2). We hence formulate the joint routing and TA deployment problem as Integer Linear Program for the two scenarios and propose a heuristic solution for large-scale instances of the problem. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the benefits of performing joint routing flows and TA deployment in reducing packet delivery delays (up to 16.4%) while minimizing deployment costs (up to 60.98%).

### H1B-KV: Hybrid One-Bit Caches for Memory-Efficient Large Language Model   Inference
**Authors**: Harshil Vejendla

**Updated**: 2025-10-07T02:39:35Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires caching a growing list of past key-value (KV) pairs, making long-context inference a memory-bound problem. While recent methods have explored quantizing the cache, evicting tokens, or using binary sketches for keys (e.g., Loki), these approaches often provide an incomplete solution by leaving one component (like values) uncompressed or by discarding context information. This paper introduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression scheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV represents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling hardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using 4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter LLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x reduction. We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches full-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on complex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task understanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval). Our results show H1B-KV significantly outperforms leading quantization (KIVI), token eviction (SparseLLM), and key-only sketching (Loki) methods in quality-per-byte, establishing it as a robust solution for deploying LLMs in memory-constrained environments.

### cMPI: Using CXL Memory Sharing for MPI One-Sided and Two-Sided   Inter-Node Communications
**Authors**: Xi Wang, Bin Ma, Jongryool Kim, Byungil Koh, Hoshik Kim, Dong Li

**Updated**: 2025-10-07T00:32:45Z

**Summary**: Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a foundational programming model for high-performance computing. MPI libraries traditionally employ network interconnects (e.g., Ethernet and InfiniBand) and network protocols (e.g., TCP and RoCE) with complex software stacks for cross-node communication. We present cMPI, the first work to optimize MPI point-to-point communication (both one-sided and two-sided) using CXL memory sharing on a real CXL platform, transforming cross-node communication into memory transactions and data copies within CXL memory, bypassing traditional network protocols. We analyze performance across various interconnects and find that CXL memory sharing achieves 7.2x-8.1x lower latency than TCP-based interconnects deployed in small- and medium-scale clusters. We address challenges of CXL memory sharing for MPI communication, including data object management over the dax representation [50], cache coherence, and atomic operations. Overall, cMPI outperforms TCP over standard Ethernet NIC and high-end SmartNIC by up to 49x and 72x in latency and bandwidth, respectively, for small messages.

### KVLinC : KV Cache Quantization with Hadamard Rotation and Linear   Correction
**Authors**: Utkarsh Saxena, Kaushik Roy

**Updated**: 2025-10-06T21:08:11Z

**Summary**: Quantizing the key-value (KV) cache is a promising strategy for improving the inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, aggressive quantization to very low precision (e.g., 2 bits) introduces significant errors in the stored key and value tensors, which propagate through the dot-product attention mechanism and ultimately degrade generation quality. To address this, we propose KVLinC, a framework to mitigate attention errors introduced by KV cache quantization in the extreme low-precision regime. KVLinC combines a Hadamard rotation, which reduces quantization error in values, with lightweight linear correction adapters that explicitly compensate for errors introduced by quantized keys. Across extensive evaluations on the LLaMA, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 model families, KVLinC consistently matches or surpasses strong baselines while achieving higher KV-cache compression. Furthermore, we implement a custom attention kernel that results in upto 2.55x faster inference compared to Flash Attention baseline, enabling efficient long-context LLM inference.

### LightCache: Memory-Efficient, Training-Free Acceleration for Video   Generation
**Authors**: Yang Xiao, Gen Li, Kaiyuan Deng, Yushu Wu, Zheng Zhan, Yanzhi Wang, Xiaolong Ma, Bo Hui

**Updated**: 2025-10-06T20:54:44Z

**Summary**: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper, we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage, while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/LightCache .

### Unifying Autoregressive and Diffusion-Based Sequence Generation
**Authors**: Nima Fathi, Torsten Scholak, Pierre-André Noël

**Updated**: 2025-10-06T17:09:39Z

**Summary**: We present significant extensions to diffusion-based sequence generation models, blurring the line with autoregressive language models. We introduce hyperschedules, which assign distinct noise schedules to individual token positions, generalizing both autoregressive models (e.g., GPT) and conventional diffusion models (e.g., SEDD, MDLM) as special cases. Second, we propose two hybrid token-wise noising processes that interpolate between absorbing and uniform processes, enabling the model to fix past mistakes, and we introduce a novel inference algorithm that leverages this new feature in a simplified context inspired from MDLM. To support efficient training and inference, we design attention masks compatible with KV-caching. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art perplexity and generate diverse, high-quality sequences across standard benchmarks, suggesting a promising path for autoregressive diffusion-based sequence generation.

### Fine-Grained AI Model Caching and Downloading With Coordinated   Multipoint Broadcasting in Multi-Cell Edge Networks
**Authors**: Yang Fu, Peng Qin, Yueyue Zhang, Pao Cheng, Jun Lu, Yifei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-06T13:23:04Z

**Summary**: 6G networks are envisioned to support on-demand AI model downloading to accommodate diverse inference requirements of end users. By proactively caching models at edge nodes, users can retrieve the requested models with low latency for on-device AI inference. However, the substantial size of contemporary AI models poses significant challenges for edge caching under limited storage capacity, as well as for the concurrent delivery of heterogeneous models over wireless channels. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained AI model caching and downloading system that exploits parameter reusability, stemming from the common practice of fine-tuning task-specific models from a shared pre-trained model with frozen parameters. This system selectively caches model parameter blocks (PBs) at edge nodes, eliminating redundant storage of reusable parameters across different cached models. Additionally, it incorporates coordinated multipoint (CoMP) broadcasting to simultaneously deliver reusable PBs to multiple users, thereby enhancing downlink spectrum utilization. Under this arrangement, we formulate a model downloading delay minimization problem to jointly optimize PB caching, migration (among edge nodes), and broadcasting beamforming. To tackle this intractable problem, we develop a distributed multi-agent learning framework that enables edge nodes to explicitly learn mutual influence among their actions, thereby facilitating cooperation. Furthermore, a data augmentation approach is proposed to adaptively generate synthetic training samples through a predictive model, boosting sample efficiency and accelerating policy learning. Both theoretical analysis and simulation experiments validate the superior convergence performance of the proposed learning framework.

### Predictive Feature Caching for Training-free Acceleration of Molecular   Geometry Generation
**Authors**: Johanna Sommer, John Rachwan, Nils Fleischmann, Stephan Günnemann, Bertrand Charpentier

**Updated**: 2025-10-06T09:49:14Z

**Summary**: Flow matching models generate high-fidelity molecular geometries but incur significant computational costs during inference, requiring hundreds of network evaluations. This inference overhead becomes the primary bottleneck when such models are employed in practice to sample large numbers of molecular candidates. This work discusses a training-free caching strategy that accelerates molecular geometry generation by predicting intermediate hidden states across solver steps. The proposed method operates directly on the SE(3)-equivariant backbone, is compatible with pretrained models, and is orthogonal to existing training-based accelerations and system-level optimizations. Experiments on the GEOM-Drugs dataset demonstrate that caching achieves a twofold reduction in wall-clock inference time at matched sample quality and a speedup of up to 3x compared to the base model with minimal sample quality degradation. Because these gains compound with other optimizations, applying caching alongside other general, lossless optimizations yield as much as a 7x speedup.

### Demystifying MaskGIT Sampler and Beyond: Adaptive Order Selection in   Masked Diffusion
**Authors**: Satoshi Hayakawa, Yuhta Takida, Masaaki Imaizumi, Hiromi Wakaki, Yuki Mitsufuji

**Updated**: 2025-10-06T06:30:22Z

**Summary**: Masked diffusion models have shown promising performance in generating high-quality samples in a wide range of domains, but accelerating their sampling process remains relatively underexplored. To investigate efficient samplers for masked diffusion, this paper theoretically analyzes the MaskGIT sampler for image modeling, revealing its implicit temperature sampling mechanism. Through this analysis, we introduce the "moment sampler," an asymptotically equivalent but more tractable and interpretable alternative to MaskGIT, which employs a "choose-then-sample" approach by selecting unmasking positions before sampling tokens. In addition, we improve the efficiency of choose-then-sample algorithms through two key innovations: a partial caching technique for transformers that approximates longer sampling trajectories without proportional computational cost, and a hybrid approach formalizing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in adaptive unmasking. Experiments in image and text domains demonstrate our theory as well as the efficiency of our proposed methods, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of masked diffusion samplers.

### Joint Probing and Scheduling for Cache-Aided Hybrid   Satellite-Terrestrial Networks
**Authors**: Zhou Zhang, Yizhu Wang, Saman Atapattu, Sumei Sun

**Updated**: 2025-10-06T05:04:57Z

**Summary**: Caching is crucial in hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks to reduce latency, optimize throughput, and improve data availability by storing frequently accessed content closer to users, especially in bandwidth-limited satellite systems, requiring strategic Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. This paper addresses throughput optimization in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks through opportunistic cooperative caching. We propose a joint probing and scheduling strategy to enhance content retrieval efficiency. The strategy leverages the LEO satellite to probe satellite-to-ground links and cache states of multiple cooperative terrestrial stations, enabling dynamic user scheduling for content delivery. Using an optimal stopping theoretic approach with two levels of incomplete information, we make real-time decisions on satellite-terrestrial hybrid links and caching probing. Our threshold-based strategy optimizes probing and scheduling, significantly improving average system throughput by exploiting cooperative caching, satellite-terrestrial link transmission, and time diversity from dynamic user requests. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed strategies.

### FEB-Cache: Frequency-Guided Exposure Bias Reduction for Enhancing   Diffusion Transformer Caching
**Authors**: Zhen Zou, Feng Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-10-06T04:28:05Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has exhibited impressive generation capabilities but faces great challenges due to its high computational complexity. To address this issue, various methods, notably feature caching, have been introduced. However, these approaches focus on aligning non-cache diffusion without analyzing why caching damage the generation processes. In this paper, we first confirm that the cache greatly amplifies the exposure bias, resulting in a decline in the generation quality. However, directly applying noise scaling is challenging for this issue due to the non-smoothness of exposure bias. We found that this phenomenon stems from the mismatch between its frequency response characteristics and the simple cache of Attention and MLP. Since these two components exhibit unique preferences for frequency signals, which provides us with a caching strategy to separate Attention and MLP to achieve an enhanced fit of exposure bias and reduce it. Based on this, we introduced FEB-Cache, a joint caching strategy that aligns with the non-exposed bias diffusion process (which gives us a higher performance cap) of caching Attention and MLP based on the frequency-guided cache table. Our approach combines a comprehensive understanding of the caching mechanism and offers a new perspective on leveraging caching to accelerate the diffusion process. Empirical results indicate that FEB-Cache optimizes model performance while concurrently facilitating acceleration. Code is available at https://github.com/aSleepyTree/EB-Cache.

### Compressed Convolutional Attention: Efficient Attention in a Compressed   Latent Space
**Authors**: Tomas Figliolia, Nicholas Alonso, Rishi Iyer, Quentin Anthony, Beren Millidge

**Updated**: 2025-10-06T04:24:23Z

**Summary**: Multi-headed Attention's (MHA) quadratic compute and linearly growing KV-cache make long-context transformers expensive to train and serve. Prior works such as Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) shrink the cache, speeding decode, but leave compute, which determines prefill and training speed, largely unchanged. We introduce Compressed Convolutional Attention (CCA), a novel attention method which down-projects queries, keys, and values and performs the entire attention operation inside the shared latent space. This simple design dramatically cuts parameters, KV-cache, and FLOPs all at once by the desired compression factor. Because CCA is orthogonal to head-sharing, we combine the two to form Compressed Convolutional Grouped Query Attention (CCGQA), which further tightens the compute-bandwidth Pareto frontier so that users can tune compression toward either FLOP or memory limits without sacrificing quality. Experiments show that CCGQA consistently outperforms both GQA and MLA at equal KV-cache compression on dense and MoE models. Additionally, we show that CCGQA outperforms all other attention methods on MoE models with half the KV-cache of GQA and MLA, achieving an 8x KV-cache compression with no drop in performance compared to standard MHA. CCA and CCGQA also dramatically reduce the FLOP cost of attention which leads to substantially faster training and prefill than existing methods. On H100 GPUs, our fused CCA/CCGQA kernel reduces prefill latency by about 1.7x at a sequence length of 16k relative to MHA, and accelerates backward by about 1.3x.

### Code Generation and Conic Constraints for Model-Predictive Control on   Microcontrollers with Conic-TinyMPC
**Authors**: Ishaan Mahajan, Khai Nguyen, Sam Schoedel, Elakhya Nedumaran, Moises Mata, Brian Plancher, Zachary Manchester

**Updated**: 2025-10-06T02:46:01Z

**Summary**: Model-predictive control (MPC) is a powerful framework for controlling dynamic systems under constraints, but it remains challenging to deploy on resource-constrained platforms, especially for problems involving conic constraints. To address this, we extend recent work developing fast, structure-exploiting, cached ADMM solvers for embedded applications, to provide support for second-order cones, as well as C++ code generation from Python, MATLAB, and Julia for easy deployment. Microcontroller benchmarks show that our solver provides up to a two-order-of-magnitude speedup, ranging from 10.6x to 142.7x, over state-of-the-art embedded solvers on QP and SOCP problems, and enables us to fit order-of-magnitude larger problems in memory. We validate our solver's deployed performance through simulation and hardware experiments, including conically-constrained trajectory tracking on a 27g Crazyflie quadrotor.

### CAOTE: KV Cache Selection for LLMs via Attention Output Error-Based   Token Eviction
**Authors**: Raghavv Goel, Junyoung Park, Mukul Gagrani, Dalton Jones, Matthew Morse, Harper Langston, Mingu Lee, Chris Lott

**Updated**: 2025-10-05T22:17:34Z

**Summary**: While long context support of large language models has extended their abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors. This is the first method which uses value tokens on top of attention-based eviction scores in closed-form. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

### Learning Semantics, Not Addresses: Runtime Neural Prefetching for Far   Memory
**Authors**: Yutong Huang, Zhiyuan Guo, Yiying Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-05T21:29:28Z

**Summary**: Memory prefetching has long boosted CPU caches and is increasingly vital for far-memory systems, where large portions of memory are offloaded to cheaper, remote tiers. While effective prefetching requires accurate prediction of future accesses, prior ML approaches have been limited to simulation or small-scale hardware. We introduce FarSight, the first Linux-based far-memory system to leverage deep learning by decoupling application semantics from runtime memory layout. This separation enables offline-trained models to predict access patterns over a compact ordinal vocabulary, which are resolved at runtime through lightweight mappings. Across four data-intensive workloads, FarSight delivers up to 3.6x higher performance than the state-of-the-art.

### PATCHEDSERVE: A Patch Management Framework for SLO-Optimized Hybrid   Resolution Diffusion Serving
**Authors**: Desen Sun, Zepeng Zhao, Yuke Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-05T18:13:39Z

**Summary**: The Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model has emerged as one of the most widely adopted generative models. However, serving diffusion models at the granularity of entire images introduces significant challenges, particularly under multi-resolution workloads. First, image-level serving obstructs batching across requests. Second, heterogeneous resolutions exhibit distinct locality characteristics, making it difficult to apply a uniform cache policy effectively.   To address these challenges, we present PatchedServe, a Patch Management Framework for SLO-Optimized Hybrid-Resolution Diffusion Serving. PatchedServe is the first SLO-optimized T2I diffusion serving framework designed to handle heterogeneous resolutions. Specifically, it incorporates a novel patch-based processing workflow that substantially improves throughput for hybrid-resolution inputs. Moreover, PatchedServe devises a patch-level cache reuse policy to fully exploit diffusion redundancies and integrates an SLO-aware scheduling algorithm with lightweight online latency prediction to improve responsiveness. Our evaluation demonstrates that PatchedServe achieves 30.1 % higher SLO satisfaction than the state-of-the-art diffusion serving system, while preserving image quality.

### Let Features Decide Their Own Solvers: Hybrid Feature Caching for   Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Shikang Zheng, Guantao Chen, Qinming Zhou, Yuqi Lin, Lixuan He, Chang Zou, Peiliang Cai, Jiacheng Liu, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-05T13:01:08Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers offer state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video synthesis, but their iterative sampling process remains a major bottleneck due to the high cost of transformer forward passes at each timestep. To mitigate this, feature caching has emerged as a training-free acceleration technique that reuses or forecasts hidden representations. However, existing methods often apply a uniform caching strategy across all feature dimensions, ignoring their heterogeneous dynamic behaviors. Therefore, we adopt a new perspective by modeling hidden feature evolution as a mixture of ODEs across dimensions, and introduce HyCa, a Hybrid ODE solver inspired caching framework that applies dimension-wise caching strategies. HyCa achieves near-lossless acceleration across diverse domains and models, including 5.55 times speedup on FLUX, 5.56 times speedup on HunyuanVideo, 6.24 times speedup on Qwen-Image and Qwen-Image-Edit without retraining.

### PatternKV: Flattening KV Representation Expands Quantization Headroom
**Authors**: Ji Zhang, Yiwei Li, Shaoxiong Feng, Peiwen Yuan, Xinglin Wang, Jiayi Shi, Yueqi Zhang, Chuyi Tan, Boyuan Pan, Yao Hu, Kan Li

**Updated**: 2025-10-05T12:09:14Z

**Summary**: KV cache in autoregressive LLMs eliminates redundant recomputation but has emerged as the dominant memory and bandwidth bottleneck during inference, notably with long contexts and test-time scaling. KV quantization is a key lever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV distribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior work focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings. In this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that evolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic regularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a pattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern vectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes only the residual. This reshaping of the KV distribution flattens the quantization target and narrows its range, thereby improving the fidelity of low-bit KV quantization. Across long-context and test-time scaling settings on multiple backbones, PatternKV delivers consistent 2-bit gains, with a 0.08% average 4-bit drop relative to FP16, improves test-time scaling accuracy by 10% on average, and raises throughput by 1.4x while supporting 1.25x larger batches.

### ObCLIP: Oblivious CLoud-Device Hybrid Image Generation with Privacy   Preservation
**Authors**: Haoqi Wu, Wei Dai, Ming Xu, Li Wang, Qiang Yan

**Updated**: 2025-10-05T11:09:10Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Models have gained significant popularity due to their remarkable capabilities in image generation, albeit at the cost of intensive computation requirement. Meanwhile, despite their widespread deployment in inference services such as Midjourney, concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive information in uploaded user prompts have arisen. Existing solutions either lack rigorous privacy guarantees or fail to strike an effective balance between utility and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose ObCLIP, a plug-and-play safeguard that enables oblivious cloud-device hybrid generation. By oblivious, each input prompt is transformed into a set of semantically similar candidate prompts that differ only in sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, ethnicity). The cloud server processes all candidate prompts without knowing which one is the real one, thus preventing any prompt leakage. To mitigate server cost, only a small portion of denoising steps is performed upon the large cloud model. The intermediate latents are then sent back to the client, which selects the targeted latent and completes the remaining denoising using a small device model. Additionally, we analyze and incorporate several cache-based accelerations that leverage temporal and batch redundancy, effectively reducing computation cost with minimal utility degradation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that ObCLIP provides rigorous privacy and comparable utility to cloud models with slightly increased server cost.

### ZSMerge: Zero-Shot KV Cache Compression for Memory-Efficient   Long-Context LLMs
**Authors**: Xin Liu, Xudong Wang, Pei Liu, Guoming Tang

**Updated**: 2025-10-05T08:34:30Z

**Summary**: The linear growth of key-value (KV) cache memory and quadratic computational in attention mechanisms complexity pose significant bottlenecks for large language models (LLMs) in long-context processing. While existing KV cache optimization methods address these challenges through token pruning or feature merging, they often incur irreversible information loss or require costly parameter retraining. To this end, we propose ZSMerge, a dynamic KV cache compression framework designed for efficient cache management, featuring three key operations: (1) fine-grained memory allocation guided by multi-dimensional token importance metrics at head-level granularity, (2) a residual merging mechanism that preserves critical context through compensated attention scoring, and (3) a zero-shot adaptation mechanism compatible with diverse LLM architectures without requiring retraining. ZSMerge significantly enhances memory efficiency and inference speed with negligible performance degradation across LLMs. When applied to LLaMA2-7B, it demonstrates a 20:1 compression ratio for key-value cache retention (reducing memory footprint to 5\% of baseline) while sustaining comparable generation quality, coupled with triple throughput gains at extreme 54k-token contexts that eliminate out-of-memory failures. The code is available at https://github.com/SusCom-Lab/ZSMerge.

**Summary**: Modern computer systems often rely on syslog, a simple, universal protocol that records every critical event across heterogeneous infrastructure. However, healthcare's rapidly growing clinical AI stack has no equivalent. As hospitals rush to pilot large language models and other AI-based clinical decision support tools, we still lack a standard way to record how, when, by whom, and for whom these AI models are used. Without that transparency and visibility, it is challenging to measure real-world performance and outcomes, detect adverse events, or correct bias or dataset drift. In the spirit of syslog, we introduce MedLog, a protocol for event-level logging of clinical AI. Any time an AI model is invoked to interact with a human, interface with another algorithm, or act independently, a MedLog record is created. This record consists of nine core fields: header, model, user, target, inputs, artifacts, outputs, outcomes, and feedback, providing a structured and consistent record of model activity. To encourage early adoption, especially in low-resource settings, and minimize the data footprint, MedLog supports risk-based sampling, lifecycle-aware retention policies, and write-behind caching; detailed traces for complex, agentic, or multi-stage workflows can also be captured under MedLog. MedLog can catalyze the development of new databases and software to store and analyze MedLog records. Realizing this vision would enable continuous surveillance, auditing, and iterative improvement of medical AI, laying the foundation for a new form of digital epidemiology.

### Algorithm Generation via Creative Ideation
**Authors**: Ruiying Ma, Chieh-Jan Mike Liang, Yanjie Gao, Francis Y. Yan

**Updated**: 2025-10-04T15:52:31Z

**Summary**: Designing system algorithms remains challenging, where the discontinuous nature of the solution space often forces system engineers to rely on generic heuristics at the expense of performance. We study whether LLMs can practically drive algorithm generation, and find that they are biased towards well-known generic designs, rather than making the creative leaps needed to navigate the discontinuous solution space. To address this limitation, we introduce MetaMuse, a framework for creative ideation built on three self-reflection principles: (1) quantifying solution diversity and usefulness in measurable performance space, rather than abstract idea space, (2) steering ideation through external stimuli, rather than internal randomness, and (3) constructing executable solutions using waypoint reasoning, rather than free-form chain-of-thought. Extensive evaluation shows that MetaMuse can generate high-performing solutions for two critical problems at a global cloud provider: cache replacement (reducing cache misses by up to 35.76%) and online bin packing (reducing bin usage by up to 30.93%).

**Authors**: S. Choo, S. Varshney, J. Shah, A. K. Manjeshwar, D. K. Lee, K. A. Mkhoyan, R. D. James, B. Jalan

**Updated**: 2025-10-04T15:25:04Z

**Summary**: Freestanding ferroelectric membranes are promising for flexible electronics, nonvolatile memory, photonics, and spintronics, but their synthesis is challenged by the need for reproducibility with precise stoichiometric control. Here, we demonstrate the adsorption-controlled growth of single-crystalline, epitaxial BaTiO3 films by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on a binary oxide sacrificial layer. Using a simple water-droplet lift-off method, we obtained submillimeter- to millimeter-sized membranes that retained crystallinity, as confirmed by high-resolution X-ray diffraction, and exhibited robust tetragonal symmetry by Raman spectroscopy. Impedance spectroscopy confirmed a high dielectric constant of 1340, reflecting the robust dielectric response of the membranes. Ferroelectric functionality was revealed by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and further verified by polarization-electric field (P-E) loop measurements with Positive-Up-Negative-Down (PUND). The P-E loops exhibited a remnant polarization of 5 microC cm-2 and a coercive field of 63 kV cm-1. These results were interpreted in relation to c- and a-domain configurations. These results establish hybrid MBE as a generalizable route for producing stoichiometry-controlled ferroelectric membranes, enabling their integration into next-generation flexible and multifunctional quantum oxide devices.

### Detecting and Preventing Latent Risk Accumulation in High-Performance   Software Systems
**Authors**: Jahidul Arafat, Kh. M. Moniruzzaman, Shamim Hossain, Fariha Tasmin, Kamrujjaman, Ahsan Habib Tareq

**Updated**: 2025-10-04T07:22:39Z

**Summary**: Modern distributed systems employ aggressive optimization strategies that create latent risks - hidden vulnerabilities where exceptional performance masks catastrophic fragility when optimizations fail. Cache layers achieving 99% hit rates can obscure database bottlenecks until cache failures trigger 100x load amplification and cascading collapse. Current reliability engineering focuses on reactive incident response rather than proactive detection of optimization-induced vulnerabilities. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for systematic latent risk detection, prevention, and optimization through integrated mathematical modeling, intelligent perturbation testing, and risk-aware performance optimization. We introduce the Latent Risk Index (LRI) that correlates strongly with incident severity (r=0.863, p<0.001), enabling predictive risk assessment. Our framework integrates three systems: HYDRA employing six optimization-aware perturbation strategies achieving 89.7% risk discovery rates, RAVEN providing continuous production monitoring with 92.9% precision and 93.8% recall across 1,748 scenarios, and APEX enabling risk-aware optimization maintaining 96.6% baseline performance while reducing latent risks by 59.2%. Evaluation across three testbed environments demonstrates strong statistical validation with large effect sizes (Cohen d>2.0) and exceptional reproducibility (r>0.92). Production deployment over 24 weeks shows 69.1% mean time to recovery reduction, 78.6% incident severity reduction, and 81 prevented incidents generating 1.44M USD average annual benefits with 3.2-month ROI. Our approach transforms reliability engineering from reactive incident management to proactive risk-aware optimization.

### Ironman: Accelerating Oblivious Transfer Extension for   Privacy-Preserving AI with Near-Memory Processing
**Authors**: Chenqi Lin, Kang Yang, Tianshi Xu, Ling Liang, Yufei Wang, Zhaohui Chen, Runsheng Wang, Mingyu Gao, Meng Li

**Updated**: 2025-10-04T05:59:01Z

**Summary**: With the wide application of machine learning (ML), privacy concerns arise with user data as they may contain sensitive information. Privacy-preserving ML (PPML) based on cryptographic primitives has emerged as a promising solution in which an ML model is directly computed on the encrypted data to provide a formal privacy guarantee. However, PPML frameworks heavily rely on the oblivious transfer (OT) primitive to compute nonlinear functions. OT mainly involves the computation of single-point correlated OT (SPCOT) and learning parity with noise (LPN) operations. As OT is still computed extensively on general-purpose CPUs, it becomes the latency bottleneck of modern PPML frameworks.   In this paper, we propose a novel OT accelerator, dubbed Ironman, to significantly increase the efficiency of OT and the overall PPML framework. We observe that SPCOT is computation-bounded, and thus propose a hardware-friendly SPCOT algorithm with a customized accelerator to improve SPCOT computation throughput. In contrast, LPN is memory-bandwidth-bounded due to irregular memory access patterns. Hence, we further leverage the near-memory processing (NMP) architecture equipped with memory-side cache and index sorting to improve effective memory bandwidth. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate Ironman achieves a 39.2-237.4 times improvement in OT throughput across different NMP configurations compared to the full-thread CPU implementation. For different PPML frameworks, Ironman demonstrates a 2.1-3.4 times reduction in end-to-end latency for both CNN and Transformer models.

### Follow-Your-Shape: Shape-Aware Image Editing via Trajectory-Guided   Region Control
**Authors**: Zeqian Long, Mingzhe Zheng, Kunyu Feng, Xinhua Zhang, Hongyu Liu, Harry Yang, Linfeng Zhang, Qifeng Chen, Yue Ma

**Updated**: 2025-10-04T05:28:39Z

**Summary**: While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.

### Taming Latency-Memory Trade-Off in MoE-Based LLM Serving via   Fine-Grained Expert Offloading
**Authors**: Hanfei Yu, Xingqi Cui, Hong Zhang, Hao Wang, Hao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-04T03:45:40Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained immense success in revolutionizing various applications, including content generation, search and recommendation, and AI-assisted operation. To reduce high training costs, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a popular backbone for modern LLMs. However, despite the benefits, serving MoE-based LLMs experience severe memory inefficiency due to sparsely activated experts. Recent studies propose to offload inactive experts from GPU memory to CPU memory to improve the serving efficiency of MoE models. However, they either incur high inference latency or high model memory footprints due to coarse-grained designs.   To tame the latency-memory trade-off in MoE serving, we present FineMoE, a fine-grained expert offloading system for MoE serving that achieves low inference latency with memory efficiency. We design FineMoE to extract fine-grained expert selection patterns from MoE models and semantic hints from input prompts to efficiently guide expert prefetching, caching, and offloading decisions. FineMoE is prototyped on top of HuggingFace Transformers and deployed on a six-GPU testbed. Experiments with open-source MoE models and real-world workloads show that FineMoE reduces inference latency by 47% and improves expert hit rate by 39% over state-of-the-art solutions.

### Cache-to-Cache: Direct Semantic Communication Between Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Tianyu Fu, Zihan Min, Hanling Zhang, Jichao Yan, Guohao Dai, Wanli Ouyang, Yu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-03T17:52:32Z

**Summary**: Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size, supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus, we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5% higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average 2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/C2C.

### Memory Forcing: Spatio-Temporal Memory for Consistent Scene Generation   on Minecraft
**Authors**: Junchao Huang, Xinting Hu, Boyao Han, Shaoshuai Shi, Zhuotao Tian, Tianyu He, Li Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-10-03T17:35:16Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency, whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context. We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames, while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended sequences.

### Towards Economical Inference: Enabling DeepSeek's Multi-Head Latent   Attention in Any Transformer-based LLMs
**Authors**: Tao Ji, Bin Guo, Yuanbin Wu, Qipeng Guo, Lixing Shen, Zhan Chen, Xipeng Qiu, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui

**Updated**: 2025-10-03T15:37:19Z

**Summary**: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) is an innovative architecture proposed by DeepSeek, designed to ensure efficient and economical inference by significantly compressing the Key-Value (KV) cache into a latent vector. Compared to MLA, standard LLMs employing Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and its variants such as Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) exhibit significant cost disadvantages. Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA without pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This paper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning from MHA to MLA (MHA2MLA), which includes two key components: for partial-RoPE, we remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the attention scores, for low-rank approximation, we introduce joint SVD approximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values. These carefully designed strategies enable MHA2MLA to recover performance using only a small fraction (0.3% to 0.6%) of the data, significantly reducing inference costs while seamlessly integrating with compression techniques such as KV cache quantization. For example, the KV cache size of Llama2-7B is reduced by 92.19%, with only a 0.5% drop in LongBench performance.

### Life Estimation of HVDC Cable Insulation under Load Cycles: from   Macroscopic to Microscopic Charge Conduction Modelling
**Authors**: Bassel Diban, Giovanni Mazzanti

**Updated**: 2025-10-03T10:06:44Z

**Summary**: This paper goes one step forward in the life estimation of HVDC cable insulation under load cycles by introducing for the first time a microscopic model of charge conduction and transport i.e., Bipolar Charge Transport BCT model for electric field calculation inside the insulation thickness. The paper firstly includes the development and the validation of BCT model with that found in literature. Then, the parameters of the developed BCT model are optimized using Pulsed Electro-Acoustic PEA space charge measurements. Followed by the integration of the developed, validated and optimized model into the electric field calculation for life estimation of a 500 kV DC-XLPE insulated cable subjected to Type Test load cycles according to Cigre Techical Brochure 852. The developed microscopic model is compared to the macroscopic models already found in the literature. The microscopic model shows a comparable electric field inversion similarly to macroscopic models. However, the behavior of the microscopic model is noticed to be different under heating and cooling load cycles. In hot cable, the maximum electric field stabilizes at different amplitude and position inside the insulation thickness in both models. This investigation has been carried out in the framework of the HEU-NEWGEN research project.

### TokenFlow: Responsive LLM Text Streaming Serving under Request Burst via   Preemptive Scheduling
**Authors**: Junyi Chen, Chuheng Du, Renyuan Liu, Shuochao Yao, Dingtian Yan, Jiang Liao, Shengzhong Liu, Fan Wu, Guihai Chen

**Updated**: 2025-10-03T06:43:24Z

**Summary**: Real-time LLM interactions demand streamed token generations, where text tokens are progressively generated and delivered to users while balancing two objectives: responsiveness (i.e., low time-to-first-token) and steady generation (i.e.,required time-between-tokens). Standard LLM serving systems suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV cache between GPU and CPU memory in the background and overlapping I/O with computation to minimize request preemption overhead. Extensive experiments on Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200) demonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput (accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to 80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.

### Bayesian Test-time Adaptation for Object Recognition and Detection with   Vision-language Models
**Authors**: Lihua Zhou, Mao Ye, Shuaifeng Li, Nianxin Li, Jinlin Wu, Xiatian Zhu, Lei Deng, Hongbin Liu, Jiebo Luo, Zhen Lei

**Updated**: 2025-10-03T06:27:33Z

**Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection), and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction. This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood (measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition and detection benchmarks.

### KAIROS: Unified Training for Universal Non-Autoregressive Time Series   Forecasting
**Authors**: Kuiye Ding, Fanda Fan, Zheya Wang, Hongxiao Li, Yifan Wang, Lei Wang, Chunjie Luo, Jianfeng Zhan

**Updated**: 2025-10-03T05:10:02Z

**Summary**: In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time series.

### Learning to Parallel: Accelerating Diffusion Large Language Models via   Learnable Parallel Decoding
**Authors**: Wenrui Bao, Zhiben Chen, Dan Xu, Yuzhang Shang

**Updated**: 2025-10-03T00:40:49Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires $\mathcal{O}(n)$ sequential steps for $n$ tokens, fundamentally limiting inference throughput. Recent diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) enable parallel token generation through iterative denoising. However, current parallel decoding strategies rely on fixed, input-agnostic heuristics (e.g., confidence thresholds), which fail to adapt to input-specific characteristics, resulting in suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across diverse NLP tasks. In this work, we explore a more flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding. We propose Learning to Parallel Decode (Learn2PD), a framework that trains a lightweight and adaptive filter model to predict, for each token position, whether the current prediction matches the final output. This learned filter approximates an oracle parallel decoding strategy that unmasks tokens only when correctly predicted. Importantly, the filter model is learned in a post-training manner, requiring only a small amount of computation to optimize it (minute-level GPU time). Additionally, we introduce End-of-Text Prediction (EoTP) to detect decoding completion at the end of sequence, avoiding redundant decoding of padding tokens. Experiments on the LLaDA benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves up to 22.58$\times$ speedup without any performance drop, and up to 57.51$\times$ when combined with KV-Cache.

### ElasticMoE: An Efficient Auto Scaling Method for Mixture-of-Experts   Models
**Authors**: Gursimran Singh, Timothy Yu, Haley Li, Cheng Chen, Hanieh Sadri, Qintao Zhang, Yu Zhang, Ying Xiong, Yong Zhang, Zhenan Fan

**Updated**: 2025-10-02T23:16:35Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models promise efficient scaling of large language models (LLMs) by activating only a small subset of experts per token, but their parallelized inference pipelines make elastic serving challenging. Existing strategies fall short: horizontal scaling provisions entire replicas of the current configuration, often tens to hundreds of accelerators, leading to coarse granularity, long provisioning delays, and costly overprovisioning. Vertical scaling offers finer adjustments but typically requires instance restarts, incurring downtime. These limitations make current approaches ill-suited for the bursty, short-lived traffic patterns common in cloud deployments.   We present ElasticMoE, an elastic scaling framework for MoE LLMs that achieves fine-grained, low-latency, and zero-downtime scaling. ElasticMoE decouples inference execution from memory operations, enabling scaling steps to proceed concurrently with serving. An HBM Management Module (HMM) reuses weights and KV caches via zero-copy remapping, while high-bandwidth peer-to-peer transfers bring newly added accelerators online without interrupting service. A virtual memory based expert redistribution mechanism migrates MoE experts without costly buffer reallocations, reducing peak memory usage during expert parallelism reconfiguration.   Our evaluation on Ascend NPUs with three popular MoE LLMs shows that ElasticMoE achieves up to 9x lower scale-up latency, up to 2x better throughput during scaling, and significantly improves SLO attainment compared to baselines. By enabling fine-grained, concurrent scaling with minimal disruption, ElasticMoE advances the practicality of deploying massive MoE LLMs in dynamic cloud environments.

**Authors**: Kristjan Greenewald, Luis Lastras, Thomas Parnell, Vraj Shah, Lucian Popa, Giulio Zizzo, Chulaka Gunasekara, Ambrish Rawat, David Cox

**Updated**: 2025-10-02T19:25:29Z

**Summary**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), an adapter architecture which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence after the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the prior keys and values. This enables building what we call intrinsics, i.e. specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We train a set of aLoRA-based intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while significantly improving inference efficiency. We contributed our Activated LoRA implementation to the Huggingface PEFT library https://github.com/huggingface/peft.

### ChunkKV: Semantic-Preserving KV Cache Compression for Efficient   Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Xiang Liu, Zhenheng Tang, Peijie Dong, Zeyu Li, Yue Liu, Bo Li, Xuming Hu, Xiaowen Chu

**Updated**: 2025-10-02T19:09:19Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant GPU memory when processing long texts, with the key value (KV) cache consuming up to 70\% of total memory during inference. Although existing compression methods reduce memory by evaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic relationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded performance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache compression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as basic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures and contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even under aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index reuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved indices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by 26.5\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench, Needle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\% in precision while maintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that semantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and performance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective solution to the memory bottleneck problem.

### Evict3R: Training-Free Token Eviction for Memory-Bounded Streaming   Visual Geometry Transformers
**Authors**: Soroush Mahdi, Fardin Ayar, Ehsan Javanmardi, Manabu Tsukada, Mahdi Javanmardi

**Updated**: 2025-10-02T18:38:00Z

**Summary**: Streaming visual transformers like StreamVGGT achieve strong 3D perception but suffer from unbounded growth of key value (KV) memory, which limits scalability. We propose a training-free, inference-time token eviction policy that bounds memory by discarding redundant tokens while keeping the most informative ones. Our method uses significantly less memory with little to no drop in accuracy: on 7-Scenes with long sequences it reduces peak memory from 18.63 GB to 9.39 GB while accuracy and completeness drop by only 0.003. Under strict memory budgets, eviction enables denser frame sampling, which improves reconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline. Experiments across video depth estimation (Sintel, KITTI), 3D reconstruction (7-Scenes, NRGBD), and camera pose estimation (Sintel, TUM-dynamics) show that our approach closely matches StreamVGGT at a fraction of the memory and makes long-horizon streaming inference more practical.

### GATEBLEED: Exploiting On-Core Accelerator Power Gating for High   Performance & Stealthy Attacks on AI
**Authors**: Joshua Kalyanapu, Farshad Dizani, Darsh Asher, Azam Ghanbari, Rosario Cammarota, Aydin Aysu, Samira Mirbagher Ajorpaz

**Updated**: 2025-10-02T18:20:18Z

**Summary**: As power consumption from AI training and inference continues to increase, AI accelerators are being integrated directly into the CPU. Intel's Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) is one such example, debuting on the 4th generation Intel Xeon Scalable CPU. We discover a timing side and covert channel, GATEBLEED, caused by the aggressive power gating utilized to keep the CPU within operating limits. We show that the GATEBLEED side channel is a threat to AI privacy as many ML models such as transformers and CNNs make critical computationally-heavy decisions based on private values like confidence thresholds and routing logits. Timing delays from selective powering down of AMX components mean that each matrix multiplication is a potential leakage point when executed on the AMX accelerator. Our research identifies over a dozen potential gadgets across popular ML libraries (HuggingFace, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.), revealing that they can leak sensitive and private information. GATEBLEED poses a risk for local and remote timing inference, even under previous protective measures. GATEBLEED can be used as a high performance, stealthy remote covert channel and a generic magnifier for timing transmission channels, capable of bypassing traditional cache defenses to leak arbitrary memory addresses and evading state of the art microarchitectural attack detectors under realistic network conditions and system configurations in which previous attacks fail. We implement an end-to-end microarchitectural inference attack on a transformer model optimized with Intel AMX, achieving a membership inference accuracy of 81% and a precision of 0.89. In a CNN-based or transformer-based mixture-of-experts model optimized with Intel AMX, we leak expert choice with 100% accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first side-channel attack on AI privacy that exploits hardware optimizations.

### KaVa: Latent Reasoning via Compressed KV-Cache Distillation
**Authors**: Anna Kuzina, Maciej Pioro, Paul N. Whatmough, Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi

**Updated**: 2025-10-02T17:59:51Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant computational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic artifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that internalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of supervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning traces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this gap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher into a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the representational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV trajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within compressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a rich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the approach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly smaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales to larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish compressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent reasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency and deployability of latent inference.

### KVComm: Enabling Efficient LLM Communication through Selective KV   Sharing
**Authors**: Xiangyu Shi, Marco Chiesa, Gerald Q. Maguire Jr., Dejan Kostic

**Updated**: 2025-10-02T16:01:54Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems, where effective inter-model communication is crucial. Existing communication protocols either rely on natural language, incurring high inference costs and information loss, or on hidden states, which suffer from information concentration bias and inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose KVComm, a novel communication framework that enables efficient communication between LLMs through selective sharing of KV pairs. KVComm leverages the rich information encoded in the KV pairs while avoiding the pitfalls of hidden states. We introduce a KV layer-wise selection strategy based on attention importance scores with a Gaussian prior to identify the most informative KV pairs for communication. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and model pairs demonstrate that KVComm achieves comparable performance to the upper-bound method, which directly merges inputs to one model without any communication, while transmitting as few as 30\% of layers' KV pairs. Our study highlights the potential of KV pairs as an effective medium for inter-LLM communication, paving the way for scalable and efficient multi-agent systems.

### DiCache: Let Diffusion Model Determine Its Own Cache
**Authors**: Jiazi Bu, Pengyang Ling, Yujie Zhou, Yibin Wang, Yuhang Zang, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-02T14:42:41Z

**Summary**: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level priors to determine caching timings and adopting handcrafted rules for multi-step cache utilization. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail to cope with diverse samples. In this paper, a strong sample-specific correlation is revealed between the variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion model and those of deep-layer features. Moreover, we have observed that the features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a shallow-layer online probe to obtain an on-the-fly indicator for the caching error in real time, enabling the model to dynamically customize the caching schedule for each sample. (2) Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment adaptively approximates the deep-layer feature output from multi-step historical caches based on the shallow-layer feature trajectory, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved fidelity over state-of-the-art approaches on various leading diffusion models including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo and Flux.

### QSpec: Speculative Decoding with Complementary Quantization Schemes
**Authors**: Juntao Zhao, Wenhao Lu, Sheng Wang, Lingpeng Kong, Chuan Wu

**Updated**: 2025-10-02T14:09:03Z

**Summary**: Quantization is widely adopted to accelerate inference and reduce memory consumption in large language models (LLMs). While activation-weight joint quantization enables efficient low-precision decoding, it suffers from substantial performance degradation on multi-step reasoning tasks. We propose QSpec, a novel quantization paradigm that decouples efficiency from quality by integrating two complementary schemes via speculative decoding: low-precision joint quantization for fast drafting and high-precision weight-only quantization for accurate verification. QSpec reuses both weights and KV cache across stages, enabling near-zero-cost switching without retraining or auxiliary models. Compared to high-precision baselines, QSpec achieves up to 1.64x speedup without quality degradation, and outperforms state-of-the-art speculative decoding methods by up to 1.55x in batched settings. Furthermore, QSpec supports plug-and-play deployment and generalizes well across model scales, quantization methods, and workloads. These properties make QSpec a practical and scalable solution for high-fidelity quantized LLM serving under memory-constrained scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/hku-netexplo-lab/QSpec.

### Study of the $^{20}$Ne($p,γ$)$^{21}$Na reaction at LUNA
**Authors**: A. Caciolli

**Updated**: 2025-10-02T10:49:54Z

**Summary**: The NeNa-MgAl cycles are involved in the synthesis of Ne, Na, Mg, and Al isotopes. The $^{20}$Ne($p,\gamma$)$^{21}$Na (Q = 2431.68 keV) reaction is the first and slowest reaction of the NeNa cycle and it controls the speed at which the entire cycle proceeds. At the state of the art, the uncertainty on the 20Ne(p,{\gamma})21Na reaction rate affects the production of the elements in the NeNa cycle. In particular, in the temperature range from 0.1 GK to 1 GK, the rate is dominated by the 366 keV resonance corresponding to the excited state of EX = 2797.5 keV and by the direct capture component. The present study focus on the study of the 366 keV resonance and the direct capture below 400 keV. At LUNA (Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics) the $^{20}$Ne($p,\gamma$)$^{21}$Na reaction has been measured using the intense proton beam delivered by the LUNA 400 kV accelerator and a windowless differential-pumping gas target. The products of the reaction are detected with two high-purity germanium detectors. The experimental details and preliminary results on the 366 keV resonance and on the direct capture component at very low energies will be shown, together with their possible impact on the $^{20}$Ne($p,\gamma$)$^{21}$Na reaction rate.

### PiCa: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Column Space Projection
**Authors**: Junseo Hwang, Wonguk Cho, Taesup Kim

**Updated**: 2025-10-02T04:11:07Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning large foundation models is essential for building expert models tailored to specialized tasks and domains, but fully updating billions of parameters is computationally prohibitive. Reducing the number of trainable parameters using parameter-efficient fine-tuning is therefore crucial not only to reduce training costs but also to mitigate storage, caching, and serving overheads during deployment. Prior works, such as Singular Vectors-guided Fine-Tuning, have shown that exploiting the geometry of pre-trained weights can significantly improve parameter-efficiency, but they lack a solid theoretical foundation. In this paper, we introduce Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning with Column Space Projection (PiCa), a novel theoretically grounded PEFT method. We prove that projecting gradients onto the principal column space of pre-trained weights provides an effective inductive bias for adaptation and further enhance parameter efficiency through a novel weight-sharing strategy. Across diverse NLP and vision tasks, PiCa consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under comparable or smaller parameter budgets, demonstrating both theoretical rigor and practical effectiveness.

### Faster LLM Inference using DBMS-Inspired Preemption and Cache   Replacement Policies
**Authors**: Kyoungmin Kim, Jiacheng Li, Kijae Hong, Anastasia Ailamaki

**Updated**: 2025-10-01T20:30:18Z

**Summary**: LLMs are increasingly used world-wide from daily tasks to agentic systems and data analytics, requiring significant GPU resources. LLM inference systems, however, are slow compared to database systems, and inference performance and mechanism have been often regarded as a black box, limiting the expansion of the use of LLMs inside databases and other performance-critical applications. This paper first analyzes the LLM inference performance and focuses on a data management issue inside LLM inference. We find that inference systems lack an adequate resource cost model and optimization strategy to schedule requests with their intermediate results in a cache reside in GPU memory when executing multiple concurrent inference requests. We adapt classic database techniques by building cost models for concurrent inference requests and a new cache replacement policy tailored for LLM inference, which can substantially save GPU costs.

### StreamAgent: Towards Anticipatory Agents for Streaming Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Haolin Yang, Feilong Tang, Linxiao Zhao, Xiang An, Ming Hu, Huifa Li, Xinlin Zhuang, Boqian Wang, Yifan Lu, Xiaofeng Zhang, Abdalla Swikir, Junjun He, Zongyuan Ge, Imran Razzak

**Updated**: 2025-10-01T19:06:10Z

**Summary**: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.

### Autoregressive Adversarial Post-Training for Real-Time Interactive Video   Generation
**Authors**: Shanchuan Lin, Ceyuan Yang, Hao He, Jianwen Jiang, Yuxi Ren, Xin Xia, Yang Zhao, Xuefeng Xiao, Lu Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-10-01T18:55:20Z

**Summary**: Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive, preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation. This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to a minute long (1440 frames).

### HiSpec: Hierarchical Speculative Decoding for LLMs
**Authors**: Avinash Kumar, Sujay Sanghavi, Poulami Das

**Updated**: 2025-10-01T18:04:14Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate heuristics.   We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical }\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE) models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by 1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

### InfVSR: Breaking Length Limits of Generic Video Super-Resolution
**Authors**: Ziqing Zhang, Kai Liu, Zheng Chen, Xi Li, Yucong Chen, Bingnan Duan, Linghe Kong, Yulun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-01T14:21:45Z

**Summary**: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR, achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.

### AdaBlock-dLLM: Semantic-Aware Diffusion LLM Inference via Adaptive Block   Size
**Authors**: Guanxi Lu, Hao Mark Chen, Yuto Karashima, Zhican Wang, Daichi Fujiki, Hongxiang Fan

**Updated**: 2025-10-01T11:26:36Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off. However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing. Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free, plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.

### Expected Attention: KV Cache Compression by Estimating Attention from   Future Queries Distribution
**Authors**: Alessio Devoto, Maximilian Jeblick, Simon Jégou

**Updated**: 2025-10-01T08:12:14Z

**Summary**: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$ that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20 techniques}$.

### GUI-KV: Efficient GUI Agents via KV Cache with Spatio-Temporal Awareness
**Authors**: Kung-Hsiang Huang, Haoyi Qiu, Yutong Dai, Caiming Xiong, Chien-Sheng Wu

**Updated**: 2025-10-01T05:37:54Z

**Summary**: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on vision-language models have emerged as a promising approach to automate human-computer workflows. However, they also face the inefficiency challenge as they process long sequences of high-resolution screenshots and solving long-horizon tasks, making inference slow, costly and memory-bound. While key-value (KV) caching can mitigate this, storing the full cache is prohibitive for image-heavy contexts. Existing cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs. In this work, we first analyze attention patterns in GUI agent workloads and find that, unlike in natural images, attention sparsity is uniformly high across all transformer layers. This insight motivates a simple uniform budget allocation strategy, which we show empirically outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes. Building on this, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI agents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i) spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of hidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii) temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history. Across standard GUI agent benchmarks and models, GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets. Notably, in a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the full-cache baseline. These results demonstrate that exploiting GUI-specific redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.

### DeepSearch: Overcome the Bottleneck of Reinforcement Learning with   Verifiable Rewards via Monte Carlo Tree Search
**Authors**: Fang Wu, Weihao Xuan, Heli Qi, Ximing Lu, Aaron Tu, Li Erran Li, Yejin Choi

**Updated**: 2025-10-01T05:09:42Z

**Summary**: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration, DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration, which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3) adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves 62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged computation.

### ThinKV: Thought-Adaptive KV Cache Compression for Efficient Reasoning   Models
**Authors**: Akshat Ramachandran, Marina Neseem, Charbel Sakr, Rangharajan Venkatesan, Brucek Khailany, Tushar Krishna

**Updated**: 2025-10-01T04:09:02Z

**Summary**: The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV) cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve. Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots, eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill, GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

### Detailed Derivation of the Scalar Explicit Expressions Governing the   Electric Field, Current Density, and Volumetric Power Density in the Four   Types of Linear Divergent MHD Channels Under a Unidirectional Applied   Magnetic Field
**Authors**: Osama A. Marzouk

**Updated**: 2025-10-01T02:56:59Z

**Summary**: The current study belongs to the field of applied mathematics in plasma physics and electric power, where mathematical analysis of the algebraic equations governing the electric field vector, and the electric-current density field vector within a Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) linear two-dimensional divergent supersonic channel is utilized to derive analytical expressions for these important fields, as well as closed-form equations for the volumetric power density (output electric power per unit volume of the plasma channel). The expressions presented here describe analytically the operation of the MHD channel as an electric power source within an Open-Cycle Magnetohydrodynamic (OCMHD) generator. The four common types of the MHD linear channels are covered here: namely, (1) continuous-electrode Faraday channel, (2) linear Hall channel, (3) segmented-electrode Faraday channel, and (4) diagonal-electrode channel. The mathematical results, their detailed derivation, and the companion graphical illustrations aid in making a proper decision regarding which channel type is the most suitable for a given application.Under typical operational conditions of 5 S/m plasma electric conductivity, 5 T magnetic field, and 2,000 m/s plasma speed, as well as an optimized load factor of 0.5, we estimate the following numerical values (unsigned magnitudes) for the continuous-electrode Faraday channel (with a Hall parameter of 1): useful electric field (across the external electric load): 5 kV/m, useful electric current-density (between the terminal electrodes within the channel): 12.5 kA/m2 , volumetric power density (dissipated by the load per unit volume of plasma): 62.5 MW/m3 , and electric efficiency (for the electric field or voltage): 50%. For the Halllinear channel (with a Hall parameter of 5), these quantitative performance values become25 kV/m, 4.808 kA/m2, 120.19 MW/m3, and 46.30%.

### Rationale-Augmented Retrieval with Constrained LLM Re-Ranking for Task   Discovery
**Authors**: Bowen Wei

**Updated**: 2025-10-01T01:28:59Z

**Summary**: Head Start programs utilizing GoEngage face significant challenges when new or rotating staff attempt to locate appropriate Tasks (modules) on the platform homepage. These difficulties arise from domain-specific jargon (e.g., IFPA, DRDP), system-specific nomenclature (e.g., Application Pool), and the inherent limitations of lexical search in handling typos and varied word ordering. We propose a pragmatic hybrid semantic search system that synergistically combines lightweight typo-tolerant lexical retrieval, embedding-based vector similarity, and constrained large language model (LLM) re-ranking. Our approach leverages the organization's existing Task Repository and Knowledge Base infrastructure while ensuring trustworthiness through low false-positive rates, evolvability to accommodate terminological changes, and economic efficiency via intelligent caching, shortlist generation, and graceful degradation mechanisms. We provide a comprehensive framework detailing required resources, a phased implementation strategy with concrete milestones, an offline evaluation protocol utilizing curated test cases (Hit@K, Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR), and an online measurement methodology incorporating query success metrics, zero-result rates, and dwell-time proxies.

### Learning to Route: A Rule-Driven Agent Framework for Hybrid-Source   Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Haoyue Bai, Haoyu Wang, Shengyu Chen, Zhengzhang Chen, Lu-An Tang, Wei Cheng, Haifeng Chen, Yanjie Fu

**Updated**: 2025-09-30T22:19:44Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on general Question Answering (QA), yet they often struggle in domain-specific scenarios where accurate and up-to-date information is required. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by enriching LLMs with external knowledge, but existing systems primarily rely on unstructured documents, while largely overlooking relational databases, which provide precise, timely, and efficiently queryable factual information, serving as indispensable infrastructure in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research. Motivated by this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis that reveals three central observations: (i) databases and documents offer complementary strengths across queries, (ii) naively combining both sources introduces noise and cost without consistent accuracy gains, and (iii) selecting the most suitable source for each query is crucial to balance effectiveness and efficiency. We further observe that query types show consistent regularities in their alignment with retrieval paths, suggesting that routing decisions can be effectively guided by systematic rules that capture these patterns. Building on these insights, we propose a rule-driven routing framework. A routing agent scores candidate augmentation paths based on explicit rules and selects the most suitable one; a rule-making expert agent refines the rules over time using QA feedback to maintain adaptability; and a path-level meta-cache reuses past routing decisions for semantically similar queries to reduce latency and cost. Experiments on three QA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms static strategies and learned routing baselines, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining moderate computational cost.

### Free Draft-and-Verification: Toward Lossless Parallel Decoding for   Diffusion Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shutong Wu, Jiawei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-30T21:28:04Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However, this bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently compatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not competitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their inherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding algorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free Draft-and-Verification (Freedave), a novel fast sampling algorithm tailored for DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding. Specifically, we propose a pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is guaranteed to reproduce the same sequence generated by static sampling, without introducing extra model forward calls. By applying Freedave, the throughput of DLLMs can be boosted up to $2.8\times$ without performance degradation on math reasoning tasks.

## Keyword: LLM Inference 
 ### StreamingVLM: Real-Time Understanding for Infinite Video Streams
**Authors**: Ruyi Xu, Guangxuan Xiao, Yukang Chen, Liuning He, Kelly Peng, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:59:58Z

**Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks, a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks, which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense, per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning, improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by +5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

### VisPile: A Visual Analytics System for Analyzing Multiple Text Documents   With Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs
**Authors**: Adam Coscia, Alex Endert

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:59:08Z

**Summary**: Intelligence analysts perform sensemaking over collections of documents using various visual and analytic techniques to gain insights from large amounts of text. As data scales grow, our work explores how to leverage two AI technologies, large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs), in a visual text analysis tool, enhancing sensemaking and helping analysts keep pace. Collaborating with intelligence community experts, we developed a visual analytics system called VisPile. VisPile integrates an LLM and a KG into various UI functions that assist analysts in grouping documents into piles, performing sensemaking tasks like summarization and relationship mapping on piles, and validating LLM- and KG-generated evidence. Our paper describes the tool, as well as feedback received from six professional intelligence analysts that used VisPile to analyze a text document corpus.

### Anchoring the Universe with Characteristic Redshifts using Raychaudhuri   Equation Informed Reconstruction Algorithm (REIRA)
**Authors**: Shibendu Gupta Choudhury, Purba Mukherjee, Anjan Ananda Sen

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:59:02Z

**Summary**: We study the robustness and physical implications of a set of characteristic redshifts that capture key features of the late-time Universe. Using both model-independent reconstructions as well as different dark energy (DE) parameterizations, we show that these redshifts remain stable across cosmological models and reconstruction algorithm, making them reliable geometric anchors of the expansion history. Moreover, the Alcock-Paczy\'nski corrections at these redshift anchors are found to be unity with high statistical significance, making them natural isotropy points in the comoving distance-redshift relation. We also find that certain redshifts anchors $(z < 1)$ coincide with epochs where strong deviations from the Planck $\Lambda$CDM baseline are apparent irrespective of DE parametrisation like CPL or reconstruction algorithm, indicating their potential as probes of new physics in cosmological evolution. Finally, we demonstrate, for the first time, that a Raychaudhuri Equation Informed Reconstruction Algorithm, substantially enhances the precision of the inferred distance measures and the Hubble expansion rate as well as results tighter constraints in the DE parameter space. These results demonstrate that combining geometric reconstruction with physics-informed kinematic information offers a powerful and consistent algorithm to probe new physics in the late-time dynamics of our Universe.

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:58:15Z

**Summary**: We present CLARITY (Clinical Assistant for Routing, Inference and Triage), an AI-driven platform designed to facilitate patient-to-specialist routing, clinical consultations, and severity assessment of patient conditions. Its hybrid architecture combines a Finite State Machine (FSM) for structured dialogue flows with collaborative agents that employ Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze symptoms and prioritize referrals to appropriate specialists. Built on a modular microservices framework, CLARITY ensures safe, efficient, and robust performance, flexible and readily scalable to meet the demands of existing workflows and IT solutions in healthcare. We report integration of our clinical assistant into a large-scale national interhospital platform, with more than 55,000 content-rich user dialogues completed within the two months of deployment, 2,500 of which were expert-annotated for subsequent validation. The validation results show that CLARITY surpasses human-level performance in terms of the first-attempt routing precision, naturally requiring up to 3 times shorter duration of the consultation than with a human.

### Prompting Test-Time Scaling Is A Strong LLM Reasoning Data Augmentation
**Authors**: Sondos Mahmoud Bsharat, Zhiqiang Shen

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:57:04Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples, P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data. Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of +26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B); P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and +3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

### Defensive Model Expansion for Robust Bayesian Inference
**Authors**: Antonio R. Linero

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:55:28Z

**Summary**: Some applied researchers hesitate to use nonparametric methods, worrying that they will lose power in small samples or overfit the data when simpler models are sufficient. We argue that at least some of these concerns are unfounded when nonparametric models are strongly shrunk towards parametric submodels. We consider expanding a parametric model with a nonparametric component that is heavily shrunk toward zero. This construction allows the model to adapt automatically: if the parametric model is correct, the nonparametric component disappears, recovering parametric efficiency, while if it is misspecified, the flexible component activates to capture the missing signal. We show that this adaptive behavior follows from simple and general conditions. Specifically, we prove that Bayesian nonparametric models anchored to linear regression, including variants of Gaussian processes regression and Bayesian additive regression trees, consistently identify the correct parametric submodel when it holds and give asymptotically efficient inference for regression coefficients. In simulations, we find that the "general BART" model performs identically to correctly specified linear regression when the parametric model holds, and substantially outperform it when nonlinear effects are present. This suggests a practical paradigm: "defensive model expansion" as a safeguard against model misspecification.

### Detecting and Filtering Unsafe Training Data via Data Attribution with   Denoised Representation
**Authors**: Yijun Pan, Taiwei Shi, Jieyu Zhao, Jiaqi W. Ma

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:54:29Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to even small amounts of unsafe training data, making effective detection and filtering essential for trustworthy model development. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection approaches primarily rely on moderation classifiers, which require significant computation overhead for training and are limited to predefined taxonomies. In this work, we explore data attribution approaches that measure the similarity between individual training samples and a small set of unsafe target examples, based on data representations such as hidden states or gradients. We identify a key limitation in existing methods: unsafe target texts contain both critical tokens that make them unsafe and neutral tokens (e.g., stop words or benign facts) that are necessary to form fluent language, and the latter of which makes the overall representations ``noisy'' for the purpose of detecting unsafe training data. To address this challenge, we propose Denoised Representation Attribution (DRA), a novel representation-based data attribution approach that denoises training and target representations for unsafe data detection. Across tasks of filtering jailbreaks and detecting gender bias, the proposed approach leads to significant improvement for data attribution methods, outperforming SOTA methods that are mostly based on moderation classifiers.

### LiveOIBench: Can Large Language Models Outperform Human Contestants in   Informatics Olympiads?
**Authors**: Kaijian Zou, Aaron Xiong, Yunxiang Zhang, Frederick Zhang, Yueqi Ren, Jirong Yang, Ayoung Lee, Shitanshu Bhushan, Lu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:54:24Z

**Summary**: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility. To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems, each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable 81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile, underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models. Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data, code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:53:53Z

**Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to transform the research process as we know it by automating the discovery of new solutions. Given a task, the typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem. Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e., one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem. We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven solution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts against predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference, LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g., achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator construction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and strategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the urgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.

### Vision Language Models: A Survey of 26K Papers
**Authors**: Fengming Lin

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:43:17Z

**Summary**: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across 26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2) steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs, parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones; contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues and years.

### Untangling Component Imbalance in Hybrid Linear Attention Conversion   Methods
**Authors**: Martin Benfeghoul, Teresa Delgado, Adnan Oomerjee, Haitham Bou Ammar, Jun Wang, Zafeirios Fountas

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:42:09Z

**Summary**: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases, prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

### Hypothesis testing on invariant subspaces of non-diagonalizable matrices   with applications to network statistics
**Authors**: Jérôme R. Simons

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:39:49Z

**Summary**: We generalise the inference procedure for eigenvectors of symmetrizable matrices of Tyler (1981) to that of invariant and singular subspaces of non-diagonalizable matrices. Wald tests for invariant vectors and $t$-tests for their individual coefficients perform well in simulations, despite the matrix being not symmetric. Using these results, it is now possible to perform inference on network statistics that depend on eigenvectors of non-symmetric adjacency matrices as they arise in empirical applications from directed networks. Further, we find that statisticians only need control over the first-order Davis-Kahan bound to control convergence rates of invariant subspace estimators to higher-orders. For general invariant subspaces, the minimal eigenvalue separation dominates the first-order bound potentially slowing convergence rates considerably. In an example, we find that accounting for uncertainty in network estimates changes empirical conclusions about the ranking of nodes' popularity.

### Verbalized Sampling: How to Mitigate Mode Collapse and Unlock LLM   Diversity
**Authors**: Jiayi Zhang, Simon Yu, Derek Chong, Anthony Sicilia, Michael R. Tomz, Christopher D. Manning, Weiyan Shi

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:38:52Z

**Summary**: Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple, training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g., "Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities"). Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation, open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

### FSP-DETR: Few-Shot Prototypical Parasitic Ova Detection
**Authors**: Shubham Trehan, Udhav Ramachandran, Akash Rao, Ruth Scimeca, Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:38:40Z

**Summary**: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision. Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in low-shot and open-set scenarios.

### GraphMERT: Efficient and Scalable Distillation of Reliable Knowledge   Graphs from Unstructured Data
**Authors**: Margarita Belova, Jiaxin Xiao, Shikhar Tuli, Niraj K. Jha

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:36:14Z

**Summary**: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to baselines.   Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual (with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g., Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

### Zero-shot Structure Learning and Planning for Autonomous Robot   Navigation using Active Inference
**Authors**: Daria de tinguy, Tim Verbelen, Emilio Gamba, Bart Dhoedt

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:28:12Z

**Summary**: Autonomous navigation in unfamiliar environments requires robots to simultaneously explore, localise, and plan under uncertainty, without relying on predefined maps or extensive training. We present a biologically inspired, Active Inference-based framework, Active Inference MAPping and Planning (AIMAPP). This model unifies mapping, localisation, and decision-making within a single generative model. Inspired by hippocampal navigation, it uses topological reasoning, place-cell encoding, and episodic memory to guide behaviour. The agent builds and updates a sparse topological map online, learns state transitions dynamically, and plans actions by minimising Expected Free Energy. This allows it to balance goal-directed and exploratory behaviours. We implemented a ROS-compatible navigation system that is sensor and robot-agnostic, capable of integrating with diverse hardware configurations. It operates in a fully self-supervised manner, is resilient to drift, and supports both exploration and goal-directed navigation without any pre-training. We demonstrate robust performance in large-scale real and simulated environments against state-of-the-art planning models, highlighting the system's adaptability to ambiguous observations, environmental changes, and sensor noise. The model offers a biologically inspired, modular solution to scalable, self-supervised navigation in unstructured settings. AIMAPP is available at https://github.com/decide-ugent/AIMAPP.

### ProbRes: Probabilistic Jump Diffusion for Open-World Egocentric Activity   Recognition
**Authors**: Sanjoy Kundu, Shanmukha Vellamcheti, Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:23:46Z

**Summary**: Open-world egocentric activity recognition poses a fundamental challenge due to its unconstrained nature, requiring models to infer unseen activities from an expansive, partially observed search space. We introduce ProbRes, a Probabilistic Residual search framework based on jump-diffusion that efficiently navigates this space by balancing prior-guided exploration with likelihood-driven exploitation. Our approach integrates structured commonsense priors to construct a semantically coherent search space, adaptively refines predictions using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and employs a stochastic search mechanism to locate high-likelihood activity labels while minimizing exhaustive enumeration efficiently. We systematically evaluate ProbRes across multiple openness levels (L0-L3), demonstrating its adaptability to increasing search space complexity. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets (GTEA Gaze, GTEA Gaze+, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charades-Ego), we establish a clear taxonomy for open-world recognition, delineating the challenges and methodological advancements necessary for egocentric activity understanding. Our results highlight the importance of structured search strategies, paving the way for scalable and efficient open-world activity recognition.

### Navigation and Exploration with Active Inference: from Biology to   Industry
**Authors**: Daria de Tinguy, Tim Verbelen, Bart Dhoedt

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:20:54Z

**Summary**: By building and updating internal cognitive maps, animals exhibit extraordinary navigation abilities in complex, dynamic environments. Inspired by these biological mechanisms, we present a real time robotic navigation system grounded in the Active Inference Framework (AIF). Our model incrementally constructs a topological map, infers the agent's location, and plans actions by minimising expected uncertainty and fulfilling perceptual goals without any prior training. Integrated into the ROS2 ecosystem, we validate its adaptability and efficiency across both 2D and 3D environments (simulated and real world), demonstrating competitive performance with traditional and state of the art exploration approaches while offering a biologically inspired navigation approach.

### Quantifying Fairness in LLMs Beyond Tokens: A Semantic and Statistical   Perspective
**Authors**: Weijie Xu, Yiwen Wang, Chi Xue, Xiangkun Hu, Xi Fang, Guimin Dong, Chandan K. Reddy

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:14:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases, undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose FiSCo (Fine-grained Semantic Comparison), a novel statistical framework to evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender, race, and age. Experiments show that FiSCo more reliably identifies nuanced biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming various evaluation metrics.

### Robo-Instruct: Simulator-Augmented Instruction Alignment For Finetuning   Code LLMs
**Authors**: Zichao Hu, Junyi Jessy Li, Arjun Guha, Joydeep Biswas

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:11:46Z

**Summary**: Code LLMs have shown promising results with converting tasks in natural language to programs that can be executed by service robots. We are interested in finetuning small, specialized LLMs for this purpose, but collecting datasets of task-program pairs specific to each robot is time-consuming and expensive. While approaches such as SELF-INSTRUCT and EVOL-INSTRUCT are capable of generating novel tasks given a few examples, they are unable to provide the corresponding programs that correctly abide by physical-world and robot-constraints using the provided programming interface. Using a simulator is a natural potential solution to checking for such constraints, but building simulation environments that can handle arbitrary tasks and their necessary objects and locations, is challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce ROBO-INSTRUCT, which synthesizes task-specific simulation environments on the fly during program execution, by opportunistically inferring entity properties and enforcing corresponding constraints based on how the entities are used in the task program. Additionally, ROBO-INSTRUCT integrates an LLM-aided post-processing procedure to refine instructions for better alignment with robot programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ROBO-INSTRUCT across multiple LLMs, showing that our fine-tuned models outperform all baseline methods and even match or surpass the performance of several larger and proprietary models.

### AutoPR: Let's Automate Your Academic Promotion!
**Authors**: Qiguang Chen, Zheng Yan, Mingda Yang, Libo Qin, Yixin Yuan, Hanjing Li, Jinhao Liu, Yiyan Ji, Dengyun Peng, Jiannan Guan, Mengkang Hu, Yantao Du, Wanxiang Che

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:08:36Z

**Summary**: As the volume of peer-reviewed research surges, scholars increasingly rely on social platforms for discovery, while authors invest considerable effort in promoting their work to ensure visibility and citations. To streamline this process and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic Promotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate, engaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity (accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment (timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438% rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most to these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research problem and provide a roadmap for scalable, impactful automated scholarly communication.

### Doc2Query++: Topic-Coverage based Document Expansion and its Application   to Dense Retrieval via Dual-Index Fusion
**Authors**: Tzu-Lin Kuo, Wei-Ning Chiu, Wei-Yun Ma, Pu-Jen Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:07:48Z

**Summary**: Document expansion (DE) via query generation tackles vocabulary mismatch in sparse retrieval, yet faces limitations: uncontrolled generation producing hallucinated or redundant queries with low diversity; poor generalization from in-domain training (e.g., MS MARCO) to out-of-domain data like BEIR; and noise from concatenation harming dense retrieval. While Large Language Models (LLMs) enable cross-domain query generation, basic prompting lacks control, and taxonomy-based methods rely on domain-specific structures, limiting applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce Doc2Query++, a DE framework that structures query generation by first inferring a document's latent topics via unsupervised topic modeling for cross-domain applicability, then using hybrid keyword selection to create a diverse and relevant keyword set per document. This guides LLM not only to leverage keywords, which ensure comprehensive topic representation, but also to reduce redundancy through diverse, relevant terms. To prevent noise from query appending in dense retrieval, we propose Dual-Index Fusion strategy that isolates text and query signals, boosting performance in dense settings. Extensive experiments show Doc2Query++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving substantial gains in MAP, nDCG@10 and Recall@100 across diverse datasets on both sparse and dense retrieval.

### WUGNECTIVES: Novel Entity Inferences of Language Models from Discourse   Connectives
**Authors**: Daniel Brubaker, William Sheffield, Junyi Jessy Li, Kanishka Misra

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:07:45Z

**Summary**: The role of world knowledge has been particularly crucial to predict the discourse connective that marks the discourse relation between two arguments, with language models (LMs) being generally successful at this task. We flip this premise in our work, and instead study the inverse problem of understanding whether discourse connectives can inform LMs about the world. To this end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates LMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time, there was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type, with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a concessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release WUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives.

### Hierarchical Indexing with Knowledge Enrichment for Multilingual Video   Corpus Retrieval
**Authors**: Yu Wang, Tianhao Tan, Yifei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:06:01Z

**Summary**: Retrieving relevant instructional videos from multilingual medical archives is crucial for answering complex, multi-hop questions across language boundaries. However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into coarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025 M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video collections.

### Beyond Surface Reasoning: Unveiling the True Long Chain-of-Thought   Capacity of Diffusion Large Language Models
**Authors**: Qiguang Chen, Hanjing Li, Libo Qin, Dengyun Peng, Jinhao Liu, Jiangyi Wang, Chengyue Wu, Xie Chen, Yantao Du, Wanxiang Che

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:58:14Z

**Summary**: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high throughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive alternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection, reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements, diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.

### SwarmGPT: Combining Large Language Models with Safe Motion Planning for   Drone Swarm Choreography
**Authors**: Martin Schuck, Dinushka Orrin Dahanaggamaarachchi, Ben Sprenger, Vedant Vyas, Siqi Zhou, Angela P. Schoellig

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:52:36Z

**Summary**: Drone swarm performances -- synchronized, expressive aerial displays set to music -- have emerged as a captivating application of modern robotics. Yet designing smooth, safe choreographies remains a complex task requiring expert knowledge. We present SwarmGPT, a language-based choreographer that leverages the reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) to streamline drone performance design. The LLM is augmented by a safety filter that ensures deployability by making minimal corrections when safety or feasibility constraints are violated. By decoupling high-level choreographic design from low-level motion planning, our system enables non-experts to iteratively refine choreographies using natural language without worrying about collisions or actuator limits. We validate our approach through simulations with swarms up to 200 drones and real-world experiments with up to 20 drones performing choreographies to diverse types of songs, demonstrating scalable, synchronized, and safe performances. Beyond entertainment, this work offers a blueprint for integrating foundation models into safety-critical swarm robotics applications.

### COMPACT: Common-token Optimized Model Pruning Across Channels and Tokens
**Authors**: Eugene Kwek, Wenpeng Yin

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:50:18Z

**Summary**: Making large language models (LLMs) more efficient in memory, latency, and serving cost is crucial for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at scale. Pruning is a promising technique, but existing pruning methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout, requiring custom inference code, while depth pruning can cause abrupt accuracy drops. Also, while many pruning approaches are effective against LLMs, they struggle to maintain performance on small language models (SLMs). In this work, we propose COMPACT, which jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/LM head layers and (ii) prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations, aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT inherits strengths of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab. vs. FFN pruning), competitive pruning times, and strong memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream performance, with substantial reductions in parameters, GPU memory, and latency.

### Evaluating Robustness of Large Language Models Against Multilingual   Typographical Errors
**Authors**: Yihong Liu, Raoyuan Zhao, Lena Altinger, Hinrich Schütze, Michael A. Hedderich

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:49:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual, real-world applications with user inputs -- naturally introducing typographical errors (typos). Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the robustness of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing behavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering, mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance but may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource ones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into English. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and multilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly available.

### Conditional Flow Matching for Bayesian Posterior Inference
**Authors**: So Won Jeong, Percy S. Zhai, Veronika Ročová

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:48:28Z

**Summary**: We propose a generative multivariate posterior sampler via flow matching. It offers a simple training objective, and does not require access to likelihood evaluation. The method learns a dynamic, block-triangular velocity field in the joint space of data and parameters, which results in a deterministic transport map from a source distribution to the desired posterior. The inverse map, named vector rank, is accessible by reversibly integrating the velocity over time. It is advantageous to leverage the dynamic design: proper constraints on the velocity yield a monotone map, which leads to a conditional Brenier map, enabling a fast and simultaneous generation of Bayesian credible sets whose contours correspond to level sets of Monge-Kantorovich data depth. Our approach is computationally lighter compared to GAN-based and diffusion-based counterparts, and is capable of capturing complex posterior structures. Finally, frequentist theoretical guarantee on the consistency of the recovered posterior distribution, and of the corresponding Bayesian credible sets, is provided.

### Statistical methods: Basic concepts, interpretations, and cautions
**Authors**: Sander Greenland

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:29:52Z

**Summary**: The study of associations and their causal explanations is a central research activity whose methodology varies tremendously across fields. Even within specialized subfields, comparisons across textbooks and journals reveals that the basics are subject to considerable variation and controversy. This variation is often obscured by the singular viewpoints presented within textbooks and journal guidelines, which may be deceptively written as if the norms they adopt are unchallenged. Furthermore, human limitations and the vastness within fields imply that no one can have expertise across all subfields and that interpretations will be severely constrained by the limitations of studies of human populations.   The present chapter outlines an approach to statistical methods that attempts to recognize these problems from the start, rather than assume they are absent as in the claims of 'statistical significance' and 'confidence' ordinarily attached to statistical tests and interval estimates. It does so by grounding models and statistics in data description, and treating inferences from them as speculations based on assumptions that cannot be fully validated or checked using the analysis data.

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:28:43Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in mathematical and logical reasoning, yet statistics, as a distinct and integrative discipline, remains underexplored in benchmarking efforts. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{StatEval}, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs. We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our web platform: https://stateval.github.io/.

### Interpretable Generative and Discriminative Learning for Multimodal and   Incomplete Clinical Data
**Authors**: Albert Belenguer-Llorens, Carlos Sevilla-Salcedo, Janaina Mourao-Miranda, Vanessa Gómez-Verdejo

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:20:24Z

**Summary**: Real-world clinical problems are often characterized by multimodal data, usually associated with incomplete views and limited sample sizes in their cohorts, posing significant limitations for machine learning algorithms. In this work, we propose a Bayesian approach designed to efficiently handle these challenges while providing interpretable solutions. Our approach integrates (1) a generative formulation to capture cross-view relationships with a semi-supervised strategy, and (2) a discriminative task-oriented formulation to identify relevant information for specific downstream objectives. This dual generative-discriminative formulation offers both general understanding and task-specific insights; thus, it provides an automatic imputation of the missing views while enabling robust inference across different data sources. The potential of this approach becomes evident when applied to the multimodal clinical data, where our algorithm is able to capture and disentangle the complex interactions among biological, psychological, and sociodemographic modalities.

### MRMR: A Realistic and Expert-Level Multidisciplinary Benchmark for   Reasoning-Intensive Multimodal Retrieval
**Authors**: Siyue Zhang, Yuan Gao, Xiao Zhou, Yilun Zhao, Tingyu Song, Arman Cohan, Anh Tuan Luu, Chen Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:14:56Z

**Summary**: We introduce MRMR, the first expert-level multidisciplinary multimodal retrieval benchmark requiring intensive reasoning. MRMR contains 1,502 queries spanning 23 domains, with positive documents carefully verified by human experts. Compared to prior benchmarks, MRMR introduces three key advancements. First, it challenges retrieval systems across diverse areas of expertise, enabling fine-grained model comparison across domains. Second, queries are reasoning-intensive, with images requiring deeper interpretation such as diagnosing microscopic slides. We further introduce Contradiction Retrieval, a novel task requiring models to identify conflicting concepts. Finally, queries and documents are constructed as image-text interleaved sequences. Unlike earlier benchmarks restricted to single images or unimodal documents, MRMR offers a realistic setting with multi-image queries and mixed-modality corpus documents. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 4 categories of multimodal retrieval systems and 14 frontier models on MRMR. The text embedding model Qwen3-Embedding with LLM-generated image captions achieves the highest performance, highlighting substantial room for improving multimodal retrieval models. Although latest multimodal models such as Ops-MM-Embedding perform competitively on expert-domain queries, they fall short on reasoning-intensive tasks. We believe that MRMR paves the way for advancing multimodal retrieval in more realistic and challenging scenarios.

### Language Model Guided Reinforcement Learning in Quantitative Trading
**Authors**: Adam Darmanin, Vince Vella

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:06:15Z

**Summary**: Algorithmic trading requires short-term tactical decisions consistent with long-term financial objectives. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been applied to such problems, but adoption is limited by myopic behaviour and opaque policies. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer complementary strategic reasoning and multi-modal signal interpretation when guided by well-structured prompts.   This paper proposes a hybrid framework in which LLMs generate high-level trading strategies to guide RL agents. We evaluate (i) the economic rationale of LLM-generated strategies through expert review, and (ii) the performance of LLM-guided agents against unguided RL baselines using Sharpe Ratio (SR) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD).   Empirical results indicate that LLM guidance improves both return and risk metrics relative to standard RL.

### Unsupervised full-field Bayesian inference of orthotropic   hyperelasticity from a single biaxial test: a myocardial case study
**Authors**: Rogier P. Krijnen, Akshay Joshi, Siddhant Kumar, Mathias Peirlinck

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:59:49Z

**Summary**: Fully capturing this behavior in traditional homogenized tissue testing requires the excitation of multiple deformation modes, i.e. combined triaxial shear tests and biaxial stretch tests. Inherently, such multimodal experimental protocols necessitate multiple tissue samples and extensive sample manipulations. Intrinsic inter-sample variability and manipulation-induced tissue damage might have an adverse effect on the inversely identified tissue behavior. In this work, we aim to overcome this gap by focusing our attention to the use of heterogeneous deformation profiles in a parameter estimation problem. More specifically, we adapt EUCLID, an unsupervised method for the automated discovery of constitutive models, towards the purpose of parameter identification for highly nonlinear, orthotropic constitutive models using a Bayesian inference approach and three-dimensional continuum elements. We showcase its strength to quantitatively infer, with varying noise levels, the material model parameters of synthetic myocardial tissue slabs from a single heterogeneous biaxial stretch test. This method shows good agreement with the ground-truth simulations and with corresponding credibility intervals. Our work highlights the potential for characterizing highly nonlinear and orthotropic material models from a single biaxial stretch test with uncertainty quantification.

### TabImpute: Accurate and Fast Zero-Shot Missing-Data Imputation with a   Pre-Trained Transformer
**Authors**: Jacob Feitelberg, Dwaipayan Saha, Kyuseong Choi, Zaid Ahmad, Anish Agarwal, Raaz Dwivedi

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:55:12Z

**Summary**: Missing data is a pervasive problem in tabular settings. Existing solutions range from simple averaging to complex generative adversarial networks. However, due to huge variance in performance across real-world domains and time-consuming hyperparameter tuning, no default imputation method exists. Building on TabPFN, a recent tabular foundation model for supervised learning, we propose TabImpute, a pre-trained transformer that delivers accurate and fast zero-shot imputations requiring no fitting or hyperparameter tuning at inference-time. To train and evaluate TabImpute, we introduce (i) an entry-wise featurization for tabular settings, which enables a $100\times$ speedup over the previous TabPFN imputation method, (ii) a synthetic training data generation pipeline incorporating realistic missingness patterns, which boosts test-time performance, and (iii) MissBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluation of imputation methods with $42$ OpenML datasets and $13$ missingness patterns. MissBench spans domains such as medicine, finance, and engineering, showcasing TabImpute's robust performance compared to $11$ established imputation methods.

### CausalVLBench: Benchmarking Visual Causal Reasoning in Large   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Aneesh Komanduri, Karuna Bhaila, Xintao Wu

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:38:10Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability. Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks: causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning abilities of LVLMs.

### Efficient Autoregressive Inference for Transformer Probabilistic Models
**Authors**: Conor Hassan, Nasrulloh Loka, Cen-You Li, Daolang Huang, Paul E. Chang, Yang Yang, Francesco Silvestrin, Samuel Kaski, Luigi Acerbi

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:32:58Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based models for amortized probabilistic inference, such as neural processes, prior-fitted networks, and tabular foundation models, excel at single-pass marginal prediction. However, many real-world applications, from signal interpolation to multi-column tabular predictions, require coherent joint distributions that capture dependencies between predictions. While purely autoregressive architectures efficiently generate such distributions, they sacrifice the flexible set-conditioning that makes these models powerful for meta-learning. Conversely, the standard approach to obtain joint distributions from set-based models requires expensive re-encoding of the entire augmented conditioning set at each autoregressive step. We introduce a causal autoregressive buffer that preserves the advantages of both paradigms. Our approach decouples context encoding from updating the conditioning set. The model processes the context once and caches it. A dynamic buffer then captures target dependencies: as targets are incorporated, they enter the buffer and attend to both the cached context and previously buffered targets. This enables efficient batched autoregressive generation and one-pass joint log-likelihood evaluation. A unified training strategy allows seamless integration of set-based and autoregressive modes at minimal additional cost. Across synthetic functions, EEG signals, cognitive models, and tabular data, our method matches predictive accuracy of strong baselines while delivering up to 20 times faster joint sampling. Our approach combines the efficiency of autoregressive generative models with the representational power of set-based conditioning, making joint prediction practical for transformer-based probabilistic models.

### Multimodal Policy Internalization for Conversational Agents
**Authors**: Zhenhailong Wang, Jiateng Liu, Amin Fazel, Ritesh Sarkhel, Xing Fan, Xiang Li, Chenlei Guo, Heng Ji, Ruhi Sarikaya

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:28:30Z

**Summary**: Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied. Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI), a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy, generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and comprehensive evaluations to foster future research.

### Hybrid Models for Natural Language Reasoning: The Case of Syllogistic   Logic
**Authors**: Manuel Vargas Guzmán, Jakub Szymanik, Maciej Malicki

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:27:29Z

**Summary**: Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability: compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning. Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality. To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural reasoning systems.

### Getting Your Indices in a Row: Full-Text Search for LLM Training Data   for Real World
**Authors**: Ines Altemir Marinas, Anastasiia Kucherenko, Alexander Sternfeld, Andrei Kucharavy

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:26:11Z

**Summary**: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is determined by their training data. Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet.   In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster, we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline, curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.   We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener computation.

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:24:06Z

**Summary**: Stochastic processes out-of-equilibrium often involve asymmetric contributions that break detailed balance and lead to non-monotonic entropy production, limiting thermodynamic interpretations and inference techniques. Here we use Dyson maps to restore monotonic entropy growth in those processes, allowing the use of standard tools from statistical physics, providing a general and computationally tractable method applicable to a broad class of Markovian systems.

### Neural Beam Field for Spatial Beam RSRP Prediction
**Authors**: Keqiang Guo, Yuheng Zhong, Xin Tong, Jiangbin Lyu, Rui Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:23:25Z

**Summary**: Accurately predicting beam-level reference signal received power (RSRP) is essential for beam management in dense multi-user wireless networks, yet challenging due to high measurement overhead and fast channel variations. This paper proposes Neural Beam Field (NBF), a hybrid neural-physical framework for efficient and interpretable spatial beam RSRP prediction. Central to our approach is the introduction of the Multi-path Conditional Power Profile (MCPP), a learnable physical intermediary representing the site-specific propagation environment. This approach decouples the environment from specific antenna/beam configurations, which helps the model learn site-specific multipath features and enhances its generalization capability. We adopt a decoupled ``blackbox-whitebox" design: a Transformer-based deep neural network (DNN) learns the MCPP from sparse user measurements and positions, while a physics-inspired module analytically infers beam RSRP statistics. To improve convergence and adaptivity, we further introduce a Pretrain-and-Calibrate (PaC) strategy that leverages ray-tracing priors for physics-grounded pretraining and then RSRP data for on-site calibration. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that NBF significantly outperforms conventional table-based channel knowledge maps (CKMs) and pure blackbox DNNs in prediction accuracy, training efficiency, and generalization, while maintaining a compact model size. The proposed framework offers a scalable and physically grounded solution for intelligent beam management in next-generation dense wireless networks.

### MP1: MeanFlow Tames Policy Learning in 1-step for Robotic Manipulation
**Authors**: Juyi Sheng, Ziyi Wang, Peiming Li, Mengyuan Liu

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:18:38Z

**Summary**: In robot manipulation, robot learning has become a prevailing approach. However, generative models within this field face a fundamental trade-off between the slow, iterative sampling of diffusion models and the architectural constraints of faster Flow-based methods, which often rely on explicit consistency losses. To address these limitations, we introduce MP1, which pairs 3D point-cloud inputs with the MeanFlow paradigm to generate action trajectories in one network function evaluation (1-NFE). By directly learning the interval-averaged velocity via the "MeanFlow Identity", our policy avoids any additional consistency constraints. This formulation eliminates numerical ODE-solver errors during inference, yielding more precise trajectories. MP1 further incorporates CFG for improved trajectory controllability while retaining 1-NFE inference without reintroducing structural constraints. Because subtle scene-context variations are critical for robot learning, especially in few-shot learning, we introduce a lightweight Dispersive Loss that repels state embeddings during training, boosting generalization without slowing inference. We validate our method on the Adroit and Meta-World benchmarks, as well as in real-world scenarios. Experimental results show MP1 achieves superior average task success rates, outperforming DP3 by 10.2% and FlowPolicy by 7.3%. Its average inference time is only 6.8 ms-19x faster than DP3 and nearly 2x faster than FlowPolicy. Our project page is available at https://mp1-2254.github.io/, and the code can be accessed at https://github.com/LogSSim/MP1.

### Flattery in Motion: Benchmarking and Analyzing Sycophancy in Video-LLMs
**Authors**: Wenrui Zhou, Mohamed Hendy, Shu Yang, Qingsong Yang, Zikun Guo, Yuyu Luo, Lijie Hu, Di Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:15:28Z

**Summary**: As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications that demand grounded multimodal reasoning, ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance. However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE (Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on sycophancy into the video domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. Furthermore, we propose two potential training-free mitigation strategies, revealing potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias: (i) enhancing visual grounding through interpretable key-frame selection and (ii) steering model behavior away from sycophancy via targeted, inference-time intervention on its internal neural representations. Our code is available at https://github.com/William030422/Video-Sycophancy.

### Adaptive Attacks on Trusted Monitors Subvert AI Control Protocols
**Authors**: Mikhail Terekhov, Alexander Panfilov, Daniil Dzenhaliou, Caglar Gulcehre, Maksym Andriushchenko, Ameya Prabhu, Jonas Geiping

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:12:44Z

**Summary**: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice, most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires, as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:05:13Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across general NLP tasks, but their utility in automating numerical experiments of complex physical system -- a critical and labor-intensive component -- remains underexplored. As the major workhorse of computational science over the past decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components -- CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge, numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability, solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation of numerical experiments for complex physical systems.

### ARS: Adaptive Reasoning Suppression for Efficient Large Reasoning   Language Models
**Authors**: Dongqi Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:04:19Z

**Summary**: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression (ARS)}, a novel training-free approach that dynamically suppresses redundant reasoning steps while preserving accuracy through adaptive certainty monitoring. ARS introduces a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism with progressive suppression thresholds, achieving superior efficiency compared to static suppression methods. Our extensive evaluation across mathematical reasoning benchmarks using multiple model architectures demonstrates that ARS achieves up to 53%, 46.1%, and 57.9% in token, latency and energy reduction, while maintaining or improving accuracy.

### Dynamic Weight-based Temporal Aggregation for Low-light Video   Enhancement
**Authors**: Ruirui Lin, Guoxi Huang, Nantheera Anantrasirichai

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:00:31Z

**Summary**: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast, and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art methods.

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:59:24Z

**Summary**: Observations of density variations in stellar streams are a promising probe of low-mass dark matter substructure in the Milky Way. However, survey systematics such as variations in seeing and sky brightness can also induce artificial fluctuations in the observed densities of known stellar streams. These variations arise because survey conditions affect both object detection and star-galaxy misclassification rates. To mitigate these effects, we use Balrog synthetic source injections in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 data to calculate detection rate variations and classification rates as functions of survey properties. We show that these rates are nearly separable with respect to survey properties and can be estimated with sufficient statistics from the synthetic catalogs. Applying these corrections reduces the standard deviation of relative detection rates across the DES footprint by a factor of five, and our corrections significantly change the inferred linear density of the Phoenix stream when including faint objects. Additionally, for artificial streams with DES like survey properties we are able to recover density power spectra with reduced bias. We also find that uncorrected power-spectrum results for LSST-like data can be around five times more biased, highlighting the need for such corrections in future ground based surveys.

### Domain-Adapted Pre-trained Language Models for Implicit Information   Extraction in Crash Narratives
**Authors**: Xixi Wang, Jordanka Kovaceva, Miguel Costa, Shuai Wang, Francisco Camara Pereira, Robert Thomson

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:45:07Z

**Summary**: Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However, large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in, for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100 categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT. Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations in the dataset.

### K-ASTRO: Structure-Aware Adaptation of LLMs for Code Vulnerability   Detection
**Authors**: Yifan Zhang, Michael Sandborn, Stefan Larson, Yu Huang, Kevin Leach

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:41:55Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming software engineering tasks, including code vulnerability detection-a critical area of software security. However, existing methods often rely on resource-intensive models or graph-based techniques, limiting their accessibility and practicality. This paper introduces K-ASTRO, a lightweight Transformer model that combines semantic embeddings from LLMs with structural features of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to improve both efficiency and accuracy in code vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces an AST-based augmentation technique inspired by mutation testing, a structure-aware attention mechanism that incorporates augmented AST features, and a joint adaptation pipeline to unify code semantics and syntax. Experimental results on three large-scale datasets, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and PrimeVul-demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while enabling rapid inference on CPUs with minimal training time. By offering a scalable, interpretable, and efficient solution, K-ASTRO bridges the gap between LLM advancements and practical software vulnerability detection, providing open-sourced tools to foster further research.

### The choice of Planck CMB likelihood in cosmological analyses
**Authors**: Hidde Jense, Marc Viña, Erminia Calabrese, Colin Hill

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:37:48Z

**Summary**: We compare cosmological parameters from different Planck sky maps and likelihood pipelines, assessing robustness of cosmological results with respect to the choice of the latest Planck maps-likelihood combination. We show that, for the Planck multipole range retained in combination with ground-based observations, different products give very similar cosmological solutions; small remaining differences are reduced by the addition of other CMB datasets to Planck. In particular, constraints on extended cosmological models benefit from the addition of small-scale power from ground-based experiments and are completely insensitive to the choice of Planck maps and likelihood. For this work we derive and release a nuisance-marginalized dataset and CamSpec-NPIPE-lite likelihood for the Planck NPIPE data injected into the CamSpec likelihood - which are usually used to obtain the reference Planck PR4 cosmology. Using the extracted CMB spectra we show that the additional constraining power for cosmology is coming from polarization at all scales and from temperature at multipoles above 1500 when going from PR3 to PR4. We also show that full marginalization over the CamSpec foreground nuisance parameters can impact parameter inference and model selections when truncating some scales; our new likelihood enables correct combinations with other CMB datasets.

### Generative modelling for mass-mapping with fast uncertainty   quantification
**Authors**: Jessica J. Whitney, Tobías I. Liaudat, Matthew A. Price, Matthijs Mars, Jason D. McEwen

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:35:57Z

**Summary**: Understanding the nature of dark matter in the Universe is an important goal of modern cosmology. A key method for probing this distribution is via weak gravitational lensing mass-mapping - a challenging ill-posed inverse problem where one infers the convergence field from observed shear measurements. Upcoming stage IV surveys, such as those made by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid satellite, will provide a greater quantity and precision of data for lensing analyses, necessitating high-fidelity mass-mapping methods that are computationally efficient and that also provide uncertainties for integration into downstream cosmological analyses. In this work we introduce MMGAN, a novel mass-mapping method based on a regularised conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which generates approximate posterior samples of the convergence field given shear data. We adopt Wasserstein GANs to improve training stability and apply regularisation techniques to overcome mode collapse, issues that otherwise are particularly acute for conditional GANs. We train and validate our model on a mock COSMOS-style dataset before applying it to true COSMOS survey data. Our approach significantly outperforms the Kaiser-Squires technique and achieves similar reconstruction fidelity as alternative state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Notably, while alternative approaches for generating samples from a learned posterior are slow (e.g. requiring $\sim$10 GPU minutes per posterior sample), MMGAN can produce a high-quality convergence sample in less than a second.

### The 1st Solution for CARE Liver Task Challenge 2025: Contrast-Aware   Semi-Supervised Segmentation with Domain Generalization and Test-Time   Adaptation
**Authors**: Jincan Lou, Jingkun Chen, Haoquan Li, Hang Li, Wenjian Huang, Weihua Chen, Fan Wang, Jianguo Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:33:24Z

**Summary**: Accurate liver segmentation from contrast-enhanced MRI is essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, it remains challenging due to limited annotated data, heterogeneous enhancement protocols, and significant domain shifts across scanners and institutions. Traditional image-to-image translation frameworks have made great progress in domain generalization, but their application is not straightforward. For example, Pix2Pix requires image registration, and cycle-GAN cannot be integrated seamlessly into segmentation pipelines. Meanwhile, these methods are originally used to deal with cross-modality scenarios, and often introduce structural distortions and suffer from unstable training, which may pose drawbacks in our single-modality scenario. To address these challenges, we propose CoSSeg-TTA, a compact segmentation framework for the GED4 (Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced hepatobiliary phase MRI) modality built upon nnU-Netv2 and enhanced with a semi-supervised mean teacher scheme to exploit large amounts of unlabeled volumes. A domain adaptation module, incorporating a randomized histogram-based style appearance transfer function and a trainable contrast-aware network, enriches domain diversity and mitigates cross-center variability. Furthermore, a continual test-time adaptation strategy is employed to improve robustness during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms the nnU-Netv2 baseline, achieving superior Dice score and Hausdorff Distance while exhibiting strong generalization to unseen domains under low-annotation conditions.

**Authors**: Minjun Kim, Hyeonseok Lim, Hangyeol Yoo, Inho Won, Seungwoo Song, Minkyung Cho, Junhun Yuk, Changsu Choi, Dongjae Shin, Huige Lee, Hoyun Song, Alice Oh, Kyungtae Lim

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:31:25Z

**Summary**: This work presents the first large-scale investigation into constructing a fully open bilingual large language model (LLM) for a non-English language, specifically Korean, trained predominantly on synthetic data. We introduce KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore, the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future multilingual LLM research.

### The Speech-LLM Takes It All: A Truly Fully End-to-End Spoken Dialogue   State Tracking Approach
**Authors**: Nizar El Ghazal, Antoine Caubrière, Valentin Vielzeuf

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:27:01Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a comparative study of context management strategies for end-to-end Spoken Dialog State Tracking using Speech-LLMs. We systematically evaluate traditional multimodal context (combining text history and spoken current turn), full spoken history, and compressed spoken history approaches. Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed analysis confirms that improvements stem from more effective context utilization.

### Direction Estimation of Sound Sources Using Microphone Arrays and Signal   Strength
**Authors**: Mahdi Ali Pour, Zahra Habibzadeh

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:26:59Z

**Summary**: Sound-tracking refers to the process of determining the direction from which a sound originates, making it a fundamental component of sound source localization. This capability is essential in a variety of applications, including security systems, acoustic monitoring, and speaker tracking, where accurately identifying the direction of a sound source enables real-time responses, efficient resource allocation, and improved situational awareness. While sound-tracking is closely related to localization, it specifically focuses on identifying the direction of the sound source rather than estimating its exact position in space. Despite its utility, sound-tracking systems face several challenges, such as maintaining directional accuracy and precision, along with the need for sophisticated hardware configurations and complex signal processing algorithms. This paper presents a sound-tracking method using three electret microphones. We estimate the direction of a sound source using a lightweight method that analyzes signals from three strategically placed microphones. By comparing the average power of the received signals, the system infers the most probable direction of the sound. The results indicate that the power level from each microphone effectively determines the sound source direction. Our system employs a straightforward and cost-effective hardware design, ensuring simplicity and affordability in implementation. It achieves a localization error of less than 6 degrees and a precision of 98%. Additionally, its effortless integration with various systems makes it versatile and adaptable. Consequently, this technique presents a robust and reliable solution for sound-tracking and localization, with potential applications spanning diverse domains such as security systems, smart homes, and acoustic monitoring.

### A first look at quasar-galaxy clustering at $z\simeq7.3$
**Authors**: Jan-Torge Schindler, Joseph F. Hennawi, Frederick B. Davies, Sarah E. I. Bosman, Feige Wang, Jinyi Yang, Anna-Christina Eilers, Xiaohui Fan, Koki Kakiichi, Elia Pizzati, Riccardo Nanni

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:25:43Z

**Summary**: We present JWST observations of the environments surrounding two high-redshift quasars -- J0252$-$0503 at $z = 7.0$ and J1007$+$2115 at $z = 7.5$ -- which enable the first constraints on quasar-galaxy clustering at $z \sim 7.3$. Galaxies in the vicinity of the quasars are selected through ground-based and JWST/NIRCam imaging and then spectroscopically confirmed with JWST/NIRSpec using the multi-shutter assembly (MSA). Over both fields, we identify 51 $z>5$ galaxies, of which eight are found within a $\Delta v_{\textrm{LOS}}=\pm1500 \rm{km} \rm{s}^{-1}$ line-of-sight velocity window from the quasars and another eight in the background. The galaxy J0252\_8713, located just $7\,\rm{pkpc}$ and $\Delta v_{\textrm{LOS}} \approx 360\,\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ from quasar J0252$-$0503, emerges as a compelling candidate for one of the most distant quasar-galaxy mergers. Combining the galaxy discoveries over the two fields, we measure the quasar-galaxy cross-correlation and obtain a correlation length of $r_0^{\rm{QG}}\approx7.6_{-1.6}^{+1.7}\,h^{-1}\,\rm{cMpc}$, based on a power-law model with a fixed slope of $\gamma_{\rm{QG}} = 2.0$. Under the assumption that quasars and galaxies trace the same underlying dark matter density fluctuations, we infer a minimum dark matter halo mass for $z\simeq7.3$ quasars of $\log_{10}(M_{\textrm{halo, min}}/\textrm{M}_{\odot})= 11.6\pm0.6$ in a halo model framework. Compared to measurements from EIGER at $\langle z \rangle = 6.25$ and ASPIRE at $\langle z \rangle = 6.7$ (where $\log_{10}(M_{\textrm{halo, min}}/\textrm{M}_{\odot}) \gtrsim 12.3$), our clustering results provide tentative evidence for a non-monotonic redshift evolution of quasar clustering properties. We further estimate a quasar duty cycle of $f_{\rm{duty}}\approx0.1\%$, consistent with constraints from quasar proximity zones and IGM damping wings. (abridged)

### On the Representations of Entities in Auto-regressive Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Victor Morand, Josiane Mothe, Benjamin Piwowarski

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:23:44Z

**Summary**: Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text, grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language. Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs) internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_, extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training. Our code is avalable at https://github.com/VictorMorand/EntityRepresentations .

### Active Model Selection for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yavuz Durmazkeser, Patrik Okanovic, Andreas Kirsch, Torsten Hoefler, Nezihe Merve Gürel

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:20:47Z

**Summary**: We introduce LLM SELECTOR, the first framework for active model selection of Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best LLM for the task.

### Preference Discerning with LLM-Enhanced Generative Retrieval

**Summary**: In sequential recommendation, models recommend items based on user's interaction history. To this end, current models usually incorporate information such as item descriptions and user intent or preferences. User preferences are usually not explicitly given in open-source datasets, and thus need to be approximated, for example via large language models (LLMs). Current approaches leverage approximated user preferences only during training and rely solely on the past interaction history for recommendations, limiting their ability to dynamically adapt to changing preferences, potentially reinforcing echo chambers. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm, namely preference discerning, which explicitly conditions a generative recommendation model on user preferences in natural language within its context. To evaluate preference discerning, we introduce a novel benchmark that provides a holistic evaluation across various scenarios, including preference steering and sentiment following. Upon evaluating current state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, we discover that their ability to dynamically adapt to evolving user preferences is limited. To address this, we propose a new method named Mender ($\textbf{M}$ultimodal Prefer$\textbf{en}$ce $\textbf{D}$iscern$\textbf{er}$), which achieves state-of-the-art performance in our benchmark. Our results show that Mender effectively adapts its recommendation guided by human preferences, even if not observed during training, paving the way toward more flexible recommendation models.

### Anemoi: A Semi-Centralized Multi-agent System Based on Agent-to-Agent   Communication MCP server from Coral Protocol
**Authors**: Xinxing Ren, Caelum Forder, Qianbo Zang, Ahsen Tahir, Roman J. Georgio, Suman Deb, Peter Carroll, Önder Gürcan, Zekun Guo

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:12:06Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in generalist multi-agent systems (MAS) have largely followed a context-engineering plus centralized paradigm, where a planner agent coordinates multiple worker agents through unidirectional prompt passing. While effective under strong planner models, this design suffers from two critical limitations: (1) strong dependency on the planner's capability, which leads to degraded performance when a smaller LLM powers the planner; and (2) limited inter-agent communication, where collaboration relies on prompt concatenation rather than genuine refinement through structured discussions. To address these challenges, we propose Anemoi, a semi-centralized MAS built on the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication MCP server from Coral Protocol. Unlike traditional designs, Anemoi enables structured and direct inter-agent collaboration, allowing all agents to monitor progress, assess results, identify bottlenecks, and propose refinements in real time. This paradigm reduces reliance on a single planner, supports adaptive plan updates, and minimizes redundant context passing, resulting in more scalable execution. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Anemoi achieved 52.73% accuracy with a small LLM (GPT-4.1-mini) as the planner, surpassing the strongest open-source baseline OWL (43.63%) by +9.09% under identical LLM settings. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Anemoi.

### Confidence-weighted integration of human and machine judgments for   superior decision-making
**Authors**: Felipe Yáñez, Xiaoliang Luo, Omar Valerio Minero, Bradley C. Love

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:03:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can surpass humans in certain forecasting tasks. What role does this leave for humans in the overall decision process? One possibility is that humans, despite performing worse than LLMs, can still add value when teamed with them. A human and machine team can surpass each individual teammate when team members' confidence is well-calibrated and team members diverge in which tasks they find difficult (i.e., calibration and diversity are needed). We simplified and extended a Bayesian approach to combining judgments using a logistic regression framework that integrates confidence-weighted judgments for any number of team members. Using this straightforward method, we demonstrated its effectiveness in both image classification and neuroscience forecasting tasks. Combining human judgments with one or more machines consistently improved overall team performance. Our hope is that this simple and effective strategy for integrating the judgments of humans and machines will lead to productive collaborations.

**Authors**: Shubhi Bansal, Sreeharish A, Madhava Prasath J, Manikandan S, Sreekanth Madisetty, Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman, Chandravardhan Singh Raghaw, Gaurav Duggal, Nagendra Kumar

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:01:57Z

**Summary**: Mamba, a special case of the State Space Model, is gaining popularity as an alternative to template-based deep learning approaches in medical image analysis. While transformers are powerful architectures, they have drawbacks, including quadratic computational complexity and an inability to address long-range dependencies efficiently. This limitation affects the analysis of large and complex datasets in medical imaging, where there are many spatial and temporal relationships. In contrast, Mamba offers benefits that make it well-suited for medical image analysis. It has linear time complexity, which is a significant improvement over transformers. Mamba processes longer sequences without attention mechanisms, enabling faster inference and requiring less memory. Mamba also demonstrates strong performance in merging multimodal data, improving diagnosis accuracy and patient outcomes. The organization of this paper allows readers to appreciate the capabilities of Mamba in medical imaging step by step. We begin by defining core concepts of SSMs and models, including S4, S5, and S6, followed by an exploration of Mamba architectures such as pure Mamba, U-Net variants, and hybrid models with convolutional neural networks, transformers, and Graph Neural Networks. We also cover Mamba optimizations, techniques and adaptations, scanning, datasets, applications, experimental results, and conclude with its challenges and future directions in medical imaging. This review aims to demonstrate the transformative potential of Mamba in overcoming existing barriers within medical imaging while paving the way for innovative advancements in the field. A comprehensive list of Mamba architectures applied in the medical field, reviewed in this work, is available at Github.

**Summary**: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information, follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources. Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT integration.

### Uncertainty Quantification for Multi-level Models Using the   Survey-Weighted Pseudo-Posterior
**Authors**: Matthew R. Williams, F. Hunter McGuire, Terrance D. Savitsky

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:53:51Z

**Summary**: Parameter estimation and inference from complex survey samples typically focuses on global model parameters whose estimators have asymptotic properties, such as from fixed effects regression models. We present a motivating example of Bayesian inference for a multi-level or mixed effects model in which both the local parameters (e.g. group level random effects) and the global parameters may need to be adjusted for the complex sampling design. We evaluate the limitations of the survey-weighted pseudo-posterior and an existing automated post-processing method to incorporate the complex survey sample design for a wide variety of Bayesian models. We propose modifications to the automated process and demonstrate their improvements for multi-level models via a simulation study and a motivating example from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Reproduction examples are available from the authors and the updated R package is available via github:https://github.com/RyanHornby/csSampling

### TIT: A Tree-Structured Instruction Tuning Approach for LLM-Based Code   Translation
**Authors**: He Jiang, Yufu Wang, Hao Lin, Peiyu Zou, Zhide Zhou, Ang Jia, Xiaochen Li, Zhilei Ren

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:53:46Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in automated source-to-target code translation through pretraining on extensive code corpora. However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two critical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific features, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the output, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic alignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets, resulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original source. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured Instruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT consists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the syntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic syntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality fine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation module aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and contrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction tuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused by the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs syntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend structured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code generation fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code based on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in code translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion.

### ChoirRec: Semantic User Grouping via LLMs for Conversion Rate Prediction   of Low-Activity Users
**Authors**: Dakai Zhai, Jiong Gao, Boya Du, Junwei Xu, Qijie Shen, Jialin Zhu, Yuning Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:48:09Z

**Summary**: Accurately predicting conversion rates (CVR) for low-activity users remains a fundamental challenge in large-scale e-commerce recommender systems.Existing approaches face three critical limitations: (i) reliance on noisy and unreliable behavioral signals; (ii) insufficient user-level information due to the lack of diverse interaction data; and (iii) a systemic training bias toward high-activity users that overshadows the needs of low-activity users.To address these challenges, we propose ChoirRec, a novel framework that leverages the semantic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct semantic user groups and enhance CVR prediction for low-activity users.With a dual-channel architecture designed for robust cross-user knowledge transfer, ChoirRec comprises three components: (i) a Semantic Group Generation module that utilizes LLMs to form reliable, cross-activity user clusters, thereby filtering out noisy signals; (ii) a Group-aware Hierarchical Representation module that enriches sparse user embeddings with informative group-level priors to mitigate data insufficiency; and (iii) a Group-aware Multi-granularity Modual that employs a dual-channel architecture and adaptive fusion mechanism to ensure effective learning and utilization of group knowledge. We conduct extensive offline and online experiments on Taobao, a leading industrial-scale e-commerce platform.ChoirRec improves GAUC by 1.16\% in offline evaluations, while online A/B testing reveals a 7.24\% increase in order volume, highlighting its substantial practical value in real-world applications.

### HINT: Helping Ineffective Rollouts Navigate Towards Effectiveness
**Authors**: Xinyi Wang, Jinyi Han, Zishang Jiang, Tingyun Li, Jiaqing Liang, Sihang Jiang, Zhaoqian Dai, Shuguang Ma, Fei Yu, Yanghua Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:42:03Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training. While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy. To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity, we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness, an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own, preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales, while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data efficiency.Code is available on Github.

### Utilizing dynamic sparsity on pretrained DETR
**Authors**: Reza Sedghi, Anand Subramoney, David Kappel

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:36:00Z

**Summary**: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge, especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification (SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers without full model retraining.

### The Potential of Second-Order Optimization for LLMs: A Study with Full   Gauss-Newton
**Authors**: Natalie Abreu, Nikhil Vyas, Sham Kakade, Depen Morwani

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:35:10Z

**Summary**: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure. This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton (GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning, implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2) the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

### Model-independent cosmological inference after the DESI DR2 data with   improved inverse distance ladder
**Authors**: Jia-Le Ling, Guo-Hong Du, Tian-Nuo Li, Jing-Fei Zhang, Shao-Jiang Wang, Xin Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:34:03Z

**Summary**: Recently, the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI survey have suggested hints of dynamical dark energy, challenging the standard $\Lambda $CDM model. In this work, we adopt an improved inverse distance ladder approach based on the latest cosmological data to provide a model-independent perspective, employing a global parametrization based on cosmic age (PAge). Our analysis incorporates DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and type Ia supernovae (SNe) observations from either the DESY5 or PantheonPlus datasets. For the DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets, we obtain $H_0 = 67.91 \pm 2.33~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$. This value is consistent with the Planck 2018 result, while shows $2.0 \sigma$ tension with the SH0ES measurement. Furthermore, by mapping specific cosmological models into PAge approximation parameter space $(p_{\mathrm{age}}, \eta)$, our model-independent analysis reveals a notable deviation from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model, as indicated by the DESY5 and DESI DR2 datasets. Finally, DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets provide nearly decisive evidence favoring the PAge model over the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the expansion history to better understand the deviations from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model.

### HoliTom: Holistic Token Merging for Fast Video Large Language Models
**Authors**: Kele Shao, Keda Tao, Can Qin, Haoxuan You, Yang Sui, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:28:40Z

**Summary**: Video large language models (video LLMs) excel at video comprehension but face significant computational inefficiency due to redundant video tokens. Existing token pruning methods offer solutions. However, approaches operating within the LLM (inner-LLM pruning), such as FastV, incur intrinsic computational overhead in shallow layers. In contrast, methods performing token pruning before the LLM (outer-LLM pruning) primarily address spatial redundancy within individual frames or limited temporal windows, neglecting the crucial global temporal dynamics and correlations across longer video sequences. This leads to sub-optimal spatio-temporal reduction and does not leverage video compressibility fully. Crucially, the synergistic potential and mutual influence of combining these strategies remain unexplored. To further reduce redundancy, we introduce HoliTom, a novel training-free holistic token merging framework. HoliTom employs outer-LLM pruning through global redundancy-aware temporal segmentation, followed by spatial-temporal merging to reduce visual tokens by over 90%, significantly alleviating the LLM's computational burden. Complementing this, we introduce a robust inner-LLM token similarity-based merging approach, designed for superior performance and compatibility with outer-LLM pruning. Evaluations demonstrate our method's promising efficiency-performance trade-off on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, reducing computational costs to 6.9% of FLOPs while maintaining 99.1% of the original performance. Furthermore, we achieve a 2.28x reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and a 1.32x acceleration in decoding throughput, highlighting the practical benefits of our integrated pruning approach for efficient video LLMs inference.

### Token-Level Policy Optimization: Linking Group-Level Rewards to   Token-Level Aggregation via Markov Likelihood
**Authors**: Xingyu Lin, Yilin Wen, En Wang, Du Su, Wenbin Liu, Chenfu Bao, Zhonghou Lv

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:25:28Z

**Summary**: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), particularly by boosting their mathematical performance. However, GRPO and related entropy-regularization methods still face challenges rooted in the sparse token rewards inherent to chain-of-thought (CoT). Current approaches often rely on undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments, which frequently lead to entropy collapse or model collapse. In this work, we propose TEPO, a novel token-level framework that incorporates Markov Likelihood (sequence likelihood) links group-level rewards with tokens via token-level aggregation. Experiments show that TEPO consistently outperforms existing baselines across key metrics (including @k and accuracy). It not only sets a new state of the art on mathematical reasoning tasks but also significantly enhances training stability.

### Agentic Exploration of Physics Models
**Authors**: Maximilian Nägele, Florian Marquardt

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:24:19Z

**Summary**: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

### MOCHA: Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment
**Authors**: Elena Camuffo, Francesco Barbato, Mete Ozay, Simone Milani, Umberto Michieli

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:21:45Z

**Summary**: We introduce MOCHA (Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment), a knowledge distillation approach that transfers region-level multimodal semantics from a large vision-language teacher (e.g., LLaVa) into a lightweight vision-only object detector student (e.g., YOLO). A translation module maps student features into a joint space, where the training of the student and translator is guided by a dual-objective loss that enforces both local alignment and global relational consistency. Unlike prior approaches focused on dense or global alignment, MOCHA operates at the object level, enabling efficient transfer of semantics without modifying the teacher or requiring textual input at inference. We validate our method across four personalized detection benchmarks under few-shot regimes. Results show consistent gains over baselines, with a +10.1 average score improvement. Despite its compact architecture, MOCHA reaches performance on par with larger multimodal models, proving its suitability for real-world deployment.

### Understanding the Effects of Domain Finetuning on LLMs
**Authors**: Eshaan Tanwar, Deepak Nathani, William Yang Wang, Tanmoy Chakraborty

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:14:06Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for specific domains exhibit strong performance; however, the underlying mechanisms by which this fine-tuning reshapes their parametric space are not well understood. Prior works primarily focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality. Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable framework for analysing specialisation in large language models.

### Boosting Multi-modal Keyphrase Prediction with Dynamic Chain-of-Thought   in Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Qihang Ma, Shengyu Li, Jie Tang, Dingkang Yang, Shaodong Chen, Yingyi Zhang, Chao Feng, Jiao Ran

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:13:07Z

**Summary**: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs. Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the "overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/DynamicCoT.

### Mem4Nav: Boosting Vision-and-Language Navigation in Urban Environments   with a Hierarchical Spatial-Cognition Long-Short Memory System
**Authors**: Lixuan He, Haoyu Dong, Zhenxing Chen, Yangcheng Yu, Jie Feng, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:08:39Z

**Summary**: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/Mem4Nav.

### NL2GenSym: Natural Language to Generative Symbolic Rules for SOAR   Cognitive Architecture via Large Language Models
**Authors**: Fang Yuan, Junjie Zeng, Yue Hu, Zhengqiu Zhu, Quanjun Yin, Yuxiang Xie

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:08:35Z

**Summary**: SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger counterparts.

### AMFT: Aligning LLM Reasoners by Meta-Learning the Optimal   Imitation-Exploration Balance
**Authors**: Lixuan He, Jie Feng, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:08:20Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned for reasoning tasks through a two-stage pipeline of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL), a process fraught with catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal trade-offs between imitation and exploration. Recent single-stage methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit, path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points), and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency, and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM alignment.

### A Multimodal Depth-Aware Method For Embodied Reference Understanding
**Authors**: Fevziye Irem Eyiokur, Dogucan Yaman, Hazım Kemal Ekenel, Alexander Waibel

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:05:00Z

**Summary**: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and reliable referent detection.

### ReTraceQA: Evaluating Reasoning Traces of Small Language Models in   Commonsense Question Answering
**Authors**: Francesco Maria Molfese, Luca Moroni, Ciro Porcaro, Simone Conia, Roberto Navigli

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:03:33Z

**Summary**: While Small Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on an increasingly wide array of commonsense reasoning benchmarks, current evaluation practices rely almost exclusively on the accuracy of their final answers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning processes that lead to those answers. To address this issue, we introduce ReTraceQA, a novel benchmark that introduces process-level evaluation for commonsense reasoning tasks. Our expert-annotated dataset reveals that in a substantial portion of instances (14-24%), SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning processes, suggesting that the capabilities of SLMs are often overestimated by evaluation metrics that focus only on comparing the final answer with the ground truth. Indeed, we show that when employing strong Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated judges for reasoning-aware evaluation rather than answer-only metrics, SLM performance drops significantly across all models and datasets, with scores decreasing by up to 25%.

### LLP: LLM-based Product Pricing in E-commerce
**Authors**: Hairu Wang, Sheng You, Qiheng Zhang, Xike Xie, Shuguang Han, Yuchen Wu, Fei Huang, Jufeng Chen

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:00:57Z

**Summary**: Unlike Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon), inexperienced individual sellers on Consumer-to-Consumer platforms (e.g., eBay) often face significant challenges in setting prices for their second-hand products efficiently. Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions. To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning. Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\footnote\{Xianyu is China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\}, significantly outperforming the previous pricing method. Under the same 30\% product coverage, it raises the static adoption rate (SAR) from 40\% to 72\%, and maintains a strong SAR of 47\% even at 90\% recall.

### Toward Mechanistic Explanation of Deductive Reasoning in Language Models
**Authors**: Davide Maltoni, Matteo Ferrara

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:49:00Z

**Summary**: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the logical inference required by the task.

### Localist LLMs -- A Mathematical Framework for Dynamic Locality Control
**Authors**: Joachim Diederich

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:44:59Z

**Summary**: We present a novel framework for training large language models with continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable, efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes, supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.

### Cell2Text: Multimodal LLM for Generating Single-Cell Descriptions from   RNA-Seq Data
**Authors**: Oussama Kharouiche, Aris Markogiannakis, Xiao Fei, Michail Chatzianastasis, Michalis Vazirgiannis

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:41:57Z

**Summary**: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by enabling the measurement of gene expression at cellular resolution, providing information for cell types, states, and disease contexts. Recently, single-cell foundation models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity, tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation. These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of unseen cells.

### Efficient Bayesian Inference from Noisy Pairwise Comparisons
**Authors**: Till Aczel, Lucas Theis, Wattenhofer Roger

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:37:20Z

**Summary**: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence. Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust, interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

### FLRC: Fine-grained Low-Rank Compressor for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yu-Chen Lu, Chong-Yan Chen, Chi-Chih Chang, Yu-Fang Hu, Kai-Chiang Wu

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:35:09Z

**Summary**: Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance, their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods, establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

### Safety Game: Balancing Safe and Informative Conversations with Blackbox   Agentic AI using LP Solvers
**Authors**: Tuan Nguyen, Long Tran-Thanh

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:32:43Z

**Summary**: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM ecosystems.

### Machine Learning Detection of Lithium Plating in Lithium-ion Cells: A   Gaussian Process Approach
**Authors**: Ayush Patnaik, Jackson Fogelquist, Adam B Zufall, Stephen K Robinson, Xinfan Lin

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:23:24Z

**Summary**: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process (GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data, (ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates (0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating detection.

### Large Language Model Prompt Datasets: An In-depth Analysis and Insights
**Authors**: Yuanming Zhang, Yan Lin, Arijit Khan, Huaiyu Wan

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:15:55Z

**Summary**: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

### RadioFlow: Efficient Radio Map Construction Framework with Flow Matching
**Authors**: Haozhe Jia, Wenshuo Chen, Xiucheng Wang, Nan Cheng, Hongbo Zhang, Kuimou Yu, Songning Lai, Nanjian Jia, Bowen Tian, Hongru Xiao, Yutao Yue

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:11:51Z

**Summary**: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency, which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling. Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over 4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline (RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable, energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G networks. We release the code at \href{https://github.com/Hxxxz0/RadioFlow}{GitHub}.

### GestureCoach: Rehearsing for Engaging Talks with LLM-Driven Gesture   Recommendations
**Authors**: Ashwin Ram, Varsha Suresh, Artin Saberpour Abadian, Vera Demberg, Jürgen Steimle

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:08:07Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces GestureCoach, a system designed to help speakers deliver more engaging talks by guiding them to gesture effectively during rehearsal. GestureCoach combines an LLM-driven gesture recommendation model with a rehearsal interface that proactively cues speakers to gesture appropriately. Trained on experts' gesturing patterns from TED talks, the model consists of two modules: an emphasis proposal module, which predicts when to gesture by identifying gesture-worthy text segments in the presenter notes, and a gesture identification module, which determines what gesture to use by retrieving semantically appropriate gestures from a curated gesture database. Results of a model performance evaluation and user study (N=30) show that the emphasis proposal module outperforms off-the-shelf LLMs in identifying suitable gesture regions, and that participants rated the majority of these predicted regions and their corresponding gestures as highly appropriate. A subsequent user study (N=10) showed that rehearsing with GestureCoach encouraged speakers to gesture and significantly increased gesture diversity, resulting in more engaging talks. We conclude with design implications for future AI-driven rehearsal systems.

### Verifying Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Its Computational Graph
**Authors**: Zheng Zhao, Yeskendir Koishekenov, Xianjun Yang, Naila Murray, Nicola Cancedda

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:06:04Z

**Summary**: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method: Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

### Issue Localization via LLM-Driven Iterative Code Graph Searching
**Authors**: Zhonghao Jiang, Xiaoxue Ren, Meng Yan, Wei Jiang, Yong Li, Zhongxin Liu

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:02:41Z

**Summary**: Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.

### Mask Tokens as Prophet: Fine-Grained Cache Eviction for Efficient dLLM   Inference
**Authors**: Jianuo Huang, Yaojie Zhang, Yicun Yang, Benhao Huang, Biqing Qi, Dongrui Liu, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:01:16Z

**Summary**: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to dominant autoregressive models (ARMs) by the ability of parallel decoding at the expense of substantial computation and memory costs. Specifically, the cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/jianuo-huang/MaskKV

### PrivATE: Differentially Private Confidence Intervals for Average   Treatment Effects
**Authors**: Maresa Schröder, Justin Hartenstein, Stefan Feuerriegel

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T11:49:39Z

**Summary**: The average treatment effect (ATE) is widely used to evaluate the effectiveness of drugs and other medical interventions. In safety-critical applications like medicine, reliable inferences about the ATE typically require valid uncertainty quantification, such as through confidence intervals (CIs). However, estimating treatment effects in these settings often involves sensitive data that must be kept private. In this work, we present PrivATE, a novel machine learning framework for computing CIs for the ATE under differential privacy. Specifically, we focus on deriving valid privacy-preserving CIs for the ATE from observational data. Our PrivATE framework consists of three steps: (i) estimating the differentially private ATE through output perturbation; (ii) estimating the differentially private variance in a doubly robust manner; and (iii) constructing the CIs while accounting for the uncertainty from both the estimation and privatization steps. Our PrivATE framework is model agnostic, doubly robust, and ensures valid CIs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using synthetic and real-world medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to derive a general, doubly robust framework for valid CIs of the ATE under ($\varepsilon,\delta$)-differential privacy.

### ShiZhi: A Chinese Lightweight Large Language Model for Court View   Generation
**Authors**: Zhitian Hou, Kun Zeng

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T11:42:17Z

**Summary**: Criminal Court View Generation (CVG) is a fundamental task in legal artificial intelligence, aiming to automatically generate the "Court View" section of a legal case document. Generating court views is challenging due to the diversity and complexity of case facts, and directly generating from raw facts may limit performance. In this paper, we present ShiZhi, the first large language model (LLM) specifically designed for court view generation. We construct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K cases, each containing fact descriptions paired with corresponding court views. Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation and 86.1\% accuracy with 92.5\% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that even a small LLM can generate reasonable and legally coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data. Our model and dataset are available at \href{https://github.com/ZhitianHou/ShiZhi}{https://github.com/ZhitianHou/ShiZhi}.

 ### VisPile: A Visual Analytics System for Analyzing Multiple Text Documents   With Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs
**Authors**: Adam Coscia, Alex Endert

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:59:08Z

**Summary**: Intelligence analysts perform sensemaking over collections of documents using various visual and analytic techniques to gain insights from large amounts of text. As data scales grow, our work explores how to leverage two AI technologies, large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs), in a visual text analysis tool, enhancing sensemaking and helping analysts keep pace. Collaborating with intelligence community experts, we developed a visual analytics system called VisPile. VisPile integrates an LLM and a KG into various UI functions that assist analysts in grouping documents into piles, performing sensemaking tasks like summarization and relationship mapping on piles, and validating LLM- and KG-generated evidence. Our paper describes the tool, as well as feedback received from six professional intelligence analysts that used VisPile to analyze a text document corpus.

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:58:15Z

**Summary**: We present CLARITY (Clinical Assistant for Routing, Inference and Triage), an AI-driven platform designed to facilitate patient-to-specialist routing, clinical consultations, and severity assessment of patient conditions. Its hybrid architecture combines a Finite State Machine (FSM) for structured dialogue flows with collaborative agents that employ Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze symptoms and prioritize referrals to appropriate specialists. Built on a modular microservices framework, CLARITY ensures safe, efficient, and robust performance, flexible and readily scalable to meet the demands of existing workflows and IT solutions in healthcare. We report integration of our clinical assistant into a large-scale national interhospital platform, with more than 55,000 content-rich user dialogues completed within the two months of deployment, 2,500 of which were expert-annotated for subsequent validation. The validation results show that CLARITY surpasses human-level performance in terms of the first-attempt routing precision, naturally requiring up to 3 times shorter duration of the consultation than with a human.

### Prompting Test-Time Scaling Is A Strong LLM Reasoning Data Augmentation
**Authors**: Sondos Mahmoud Bsharat, Zhiqiang Shen

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:57:04Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples, P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data. Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of +26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B); P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and +3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

### Detecting and Filtering Unsafe Training Data via Data Attribution with   Denoised Representation
**Authors**: Yijun Pan, Taiwei Shi, Jieyu Zhao, Jiaqi W. Ma

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:54:29Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to even small amounts of unsafe training data, making effective detection and filtering essential for trustworthy model development. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection approaches primarily rely on moderation classifiers, which require significant computation overhead for training and are limited to predefined taxonomies. In this work, we explore data attribution approaches that measure the similarity between individual training samples and a small set of unsafe target examples, based on data representations such as hidden states or gradients. We identify a key limitation in existing methods: unsafe target texts contain both critical tokens that make them unsafe and neutral tokens (e.g., stop words or benign facts) that are necessary to form fluent language, and the latter of which makes the overall representations ``noisy'' for the purpose of detecting unsafe training data. To address this challenge, we propose Denoised Representation Attribution (DRA), a novel representation-based data attribution approach that denoises training and target representations for unsafe data detection. Across tasks of filtering jailbreaks and detecting gender bias, the proposed approach leads to significant improvement for data attribution methods, outperforming SOTA methods that are mostly based on moderation classifiers.

### LiveOIBench: Can Large Language Models Outperform Human Contestants in   Informatics Olympiads?
**Authors**: Kaijian Zou, Aaron Xiong, Yunxiang Zhang, Frederick Zhang, Yueqi Ren, Jirong Yang, Ayoung Lee, Shitanshu Bhushan, Lu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:54:24Z

**Summary**: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility. To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems, each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable 81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile, underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models. Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data, code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

### Barbarians at the Gate: How AI is Upending Systems Research

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:53:53Z

**Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to transform the research process as we know it by automating the discovery of new solutions. Given a task, the typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem. Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e., one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem. We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven solution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts against predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference, LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g., achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator construction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and strategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the urgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.

### Vision Language Models: A Survey of 26K Papers
**Authors**: Fengming Lin

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:43:17Z

**Summary**: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across 26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2) steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs, parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones; contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues and years.

### Verbalized Sampling: How to Mitigate Mode Collapse and Unlock LLM   Diversity
**Authors**: Jiayi Zhang, Simon Yu, Derek Chong, Anthony Sicilia, Michael R. Tomz, Christopher D. Manning, Weiyan Shi

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:38:52Z

**Summary**: Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple, training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g., "Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities"). Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation, open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

### GraphMERT: Efficient and Scalable Distillation of Reliable Knowledge   Graphs from Unstructured Data
**Authors**: Margarita Belova, Jiaxin Xiao, Shikhar Tuli, Niraj K. Jha

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:36:14Z

**Summary**: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to baselines.   Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual (with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g., Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

### Energy-efficient User Clustering for UAV-enabled Wireless Networks Using   EM Algorithm
**Authors**: Salim Janji, Adrian Kliks

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:29:15Z

**Summary**: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be used to provide wireless connectivity to support the existing infrastructure in hot-spots or replace it in cases of destruction. UAV-enabled wireless provides several advantages in network performance due to drone small cells (DSCs) mobility despite the limited onboard energy. However, the problem of resource allocation has added complexity. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient user clustering mechanism based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) using a modified Expected-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The algorithm is intended to provide the initial user clustering and drone deployment upon which additional mechanisms can be employed to further enhance the system performance. The proposed algorithm improves the energy efficiency of the system by 25% and link reliability by 18.3% compared to other baseline methods.

### Quantifying Fairness in LLMs Beyond Tokens: A Semantic and Statistical   Perspective
**Authors**: Weijie Xu, Yiwen Wang, Chi Xue, Xiangkun Hu, Xi Fang, Guimin Dong, Chandan K. Reddy

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:14:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases, undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose FiSCo (Fine-grained Semantic Comparison), a novel statistical framework to evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender, race, and age. Experiments show that FiSCo more reliably identifies nuanced biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming various evaluation metrics.

### Robo-Instruct: Simulator-Augmented Instruction Alignment For Finetuning   Code LLMs
**Authors**: Zichao Hu, Junyi Jessy Li, Arjun Guha, Joydeep Biswas

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:11:46Z

**Summary**: Code LLMs have shown promising results with converting tasks in natural language to programs that can be executed by service robots. We are interested in finetuning small, specialized LLMs for this purpose, but collecting datasets of task-program pairs specific to each robot is time-consuming and expensive. While approaches such as SELF-INSTRUCT and EVOL-INSTRUCT are capable of generating novel tasks given a few examples, they are unable to provide the corresponding programs that correctly abide by physical-world and robot-constraints using the provided programming interface. Using a simulator is a natural potential solution to checking for such constraints, but building simulation environments that can handle arbitrary tasks and their necessary objects and locations, is challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce ROBO-INSTRUCT, which synthesizes task-specific simulation environments on the fly during program execution, by opportunistically inferring entity properties and enforcing corresponding constraints based on how the entities are used in the task program. Additionally, ROBO-INSTRUCT integrates an LLM-aided post-processing procedure to refine instructions for better alignment with robot programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ROBO-INSTRUCT across multiple LLMs, showing that our fine-tuned models outperform all baseline methods and even match or surpass the performance of several larger and proprietary models.

**Summary**: As the volume of peer-reviewed research surges, scholars increasingly rely on social platforms for discovery, while authors invest considerable effort in promoting their work to ensure visibility and citations. To streamline this process and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic Promotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate, engaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity (accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment (timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438% rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most to these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research problem and provide a roadmap for scalable, impactful automated scholarly communication.

### Doc2Query++: Topic-Coverage based Document Expansion and its Application   to Dense Retrieval via Dual-Index Fusion
**Authors**: Tzu-Lin Kuo, Wei-Ning Chiu, Wei-Yun Ma, Pu-Jen Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:07:48Z

**Summary**: Document expansion (DE) via query generation tackles vocabulary mismatch in sparse retrieval, yet faces limitations: uncontrolled generation producing hallucinated or redundant queries with low diversity; poor generalization from in-domain training (e.g., MS MARCO) to out-of-domain data like BEIR; and noise from concatenation harming dense retrieval. While Large Language Models (LLMs) enable cross-domain query generation, basic prompting lacks control, and taxonomy-based methods rely on domain-specific structures, limiting applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce Doc2Query++, a DE framework that structures query generation by first inferring a document's latent topics via unsupervised topic modeling for cross-domain applicability, then using hybrid keyword selection to create a diverse and relevant keyword set per document. This guides LLM not only to leverage keywords, which ensure comprehensive topic representation, but also to reduce redundancy through diverse, relevant terms. To prevent noise from query appending in dense retrieval, we propose Dual-Index Fusion strategy that isolates text and query signals, boosting performance in dense settings. Extensive experiments show Doc2Query++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving substantial gains in MAP, nDCG@10 and Recall@100 across diverse datasets on both sparse and dense retrieval.

### Hierarchical Indexing with Knowledge Enrichment for Multilingual Video   Corpus Retrieval
**Authors**: Yu Wang, Tianhao Tan, Yifei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T17:06:01Z

**Summary**: Retrieving relevant instructional videos from multilingual medical archives is crucial for answering complex, multi-hop questions across language boundaries. However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into coarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025 M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video collections.

### Beyond Surface Reasoning: Unveiling the True Long Chain-of-Thought   Capacity of Diffusion Large Language Models
**Authors**: Qiguang Chen, Hanjing Li, Libo Qin, Dengyun Peng, Jinhao Liu, Jiangyi Wang, Chengyue Wu, Xie Chen, Yantao Du, Wanxiang Che

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:58:14Z

**Summary**: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high throughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive alternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection, reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements, diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.

### DiskJoin: Large-scale Vector Similarity Join with SSD
**Authors**: Yanqi Chen, Xiao Yan, Alexandra Meliou, Eric Lo

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:56:23Z

**Summary**: Similarity join--a widely used operation in data science--finds all pairs of items that have distance smaller than a threshold. Prior work has explored distributed computation methods to scale similarity join to large data volumes but these methods require a cluster deployment, and efficiency suffers from expensive inter-machine communication. On the other hand, disk-based solutions are more cost-effective by using a single machine and storing the large dataset on high-performance external storage, such as NVMe SSDs, but in these methods the disk I/O time is a serious bottleneck. In this paper, we propose DiskJoin, the first disk-based similarity join algorithm that can process billion-scale vector datasets efficiently on a single machine. DiskJoin improves disk I/O by tailoring the data access patterns to avoid repetitive accesses and read amplification. It also uses main memory as a dynamic cache and carefully manages cache eviction to improve cache hit rate and reduce disk retrieval time. For further acceleration, we adopt a probabilistic pruning technique that can effectively prune a large number of vector pairs from computation. Our evaluation on real-world, large-scale datasets shows that DiskJoin significantly outperforms alternatives, achieving speedups from 50x to 1000x.

### A Digital Twin for Diesel Engines: Operator-infused Physics-Informed   Neural Networks with Transfer Learning for Engine Health Monitoring
**Authors**: Kamaljyoti Nath, Varun Kumar, Daniel J. Smith, George Em Karniadakis

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:54:09Z

**Summary**: Improving diesel engine efficiency, reducing emissions, and enabling robust health monitoring have been critical research topics in engine modelling. While recent advancements in the use of neural networks for system monitoring have shown promising results, such methods often focus on component-level analysis, lack generalizability, and physical interpretability. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid framework that combines physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with deep operator networks (DeepONet) to enable accurate and computationally efficient parameter identification in mean-value diesel engine models. Our method leverages physics-based system knowledge in combination with data-driven training of neural networks to enhance model applicability. Incorporating offline-trained DeepONets to predict actuator dynamics significantly lowers the online computation cost when compared to the existing PINN framework. To address the re-training burden typical of PINNs under varying input conditions, we propose two transfer learning (TL) strategies: (i) a multi-stage TL scheme offering better runtime efficiency than full online training of the PINN model and (ii) a few-shot TL scheme that freezes a shared multi-head network body and computes physics-based derivatives required for model training outside the training loop. The second strategy offers a computationally inexpensive and physics-based approach for predicting engine dynamics and parameter identification, offering computational efficiency over the existing PINN framework. Compared to existing health monitoring methods, our framework combines the interpretability of physics-based models with the flexibility of deep learning, offering substantial gains in generalization, accuracy, and deployment efficiency for diesel engine diagnostics.

### SwarmGPT: Combining Large Language Models with Safe Motion Planning for   Drone Swarm Choreography
**Authors**: Martin Schuck, Dinushka Orrin Dahanaggamaarachchi, Ben Sprenger, Vedant Vyas, Siqi Zhou, Angela P. Schoellig

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:52:36Z

**Summary**: Drone swarm performances -- synchronized, expressive aerial displays set to music -- have emerged as a captivating application of modern robotics. Yet designing smooth, safe choreographies remains a complex task requiring expert knowledge. We present SwarmGPT, a language-based choreographer that leverages the reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) to streamline drone performance design. The LLM is augmented by a safety filter that ensures deployability by making minimal corrections when safety or feasibility constraints are violated. By decoupling high-level choreographic design from low-level motion planning, our system enables non-experts to iteratively refine choreographies using natural language without worrying about collisions or actuator limits. We validate our approach through simulations with swarms up to 200 drones and real-world experiments with up to 20 drones performing choreographies to diverse types of songs, demonstrating scalable, synchronized, and safe performances. Beyond entertainment, this work offers a blueprint for integrating foundation models into safety-critical swarm robotics applications.

### Insights into the OER, ORR, and HER Activity of a New MXene-Family   SnSiGeN4 Photocatalyst for Water Splitting: A First-Principles Study
**Authors**: Chhatra Bahadur Subba, Bhanu Chettri, Amel Laref, Zeesham Abbas, Amna Parveen, Dibya Prakash Rai, Zaithanzauva Pachuau

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:50:25Z

**Summary**: The development of efficient and cost-effective catalysts for clean energy conversion remains a central challenge in materials science. Although platinum serves as the benchmark catalyst, its scarcity and high cost hinder large-scale deployment. In this study, we propose a newly predicted SnSiGeN4 MXene-family monolayer as a promising candidate for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigated its electronic, vibrational, and optical properties across multiple exchange-correlation functionals, including hybrid approaches, revealing a wide and tunable band gap. Simulated infrared and Raman spectra further confirm the dynamical stability and the presence of catalytically active sites. Guided by these findings, we studied photocatalytic reaction analyses that demonstrate that the computed overpotentials for OER, ORR, and HER are comparable to those of Pt-based catalysts and outperform Ir-based systems, positioning SnSiGeN4 as a sustainable, high-performance platform for next-generation UV-visible-light-driven photocatalysis.

### COMPACT: Common-token Optimized Model Pruning Across Channels and Tokens
**Authors**: Eugene Kwek, Wenpeng Yin

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:50:18Z

**Summary**: Making large language models (LLMs) more efficient in memory, latency, and serving cost is crucial for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at scale. Pruning is a promising technique, but existing pruning methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout, requiring custom inference code, while depth pruning can cause abrupt accuracy drops. Also, while many pruning approaches are effective against LLMs, they struggle to maintain performance on small language models (SLMs). In this work, we propose COMPACT, which jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/LM head layers and (ii) prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations, aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT inherits strengths of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab. vs. FFN pruning), competitive pruning times, and strong memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream performance, with substantial reductions in parameters, GPU memory, and latency.

### Evaluating Robustness of Large Language Models Against Multilingual   Typographical Errors
**Authors**: Yihong Liu, Raoyuan Zhao, Lena Altinger, Hinrich Schütze, Michael A. Hedderich

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:49:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual, real-world applications with user inputs -- naturally introducing typographical errors (typos). Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the robustness of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing behavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering, mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance but may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource ones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into English. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and multilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly available.

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:28:43Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in mathematical and logical reasoning, yet statistics, as a distinct and integrative discipline, remains underexplored in benchmarking efforts. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{StatEval}, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs. We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our web platform: https://stateval.github.io/.

### MRMR: A Realistic and Expert-Level Multidisciplinary Benchmark for   Reasoning-Intensive Multimodal Retrieval
**Authors**: Siyue Zhang, Yuan Gao, Xiao Zhou, Yilun Zhao, Tingyu Song, Arman Cohan, Anh Tuan Luu, Chen Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:14:56Z

**Summary**: We introduce MRMR, the first expert-level multidisciplinary multimodal retrieval benchmark requiring intensive reasoning. MRMR contains 1,502 queries spanning 23 domains, with positive documents carefully verified by human experts. Compared to prior benchmarks, MRMR introduces three key advancements. First, it challenges retrieval systems across diverse areas of expertise, enabling fine-grained model comparison across domains. Second, queries are reasoning-intensive, with images requiring deeper interpretation such as diagnosing microscopic slides. We further introduce Contradiction Retrieval, a novel task requiring models to identify conflicting concepts. Finally, queries and documents are constructed as image-text interleaved sequences. Unlike earlier benchmarks restricted to single images or unimodal documents, MRMR offers a realistic setting with multi-image queries and mixed-modality corpus documents. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 4 categories of multimodal retrieval systems and 14 frontier models on MRMR. The text embedding model Qwen3-Embedding with LLM-generated image captions achieves the highest performance, highlighting substantial room for improving multimodal retrieval models. Although latest multimodal models such as Ops-MM-Embedding perform competitively on expert-domain queries, they fall short on reasoning-intensive tasks. We believe that MRMR paves the way for advancing multimodal retrieval in more realistic and challenging scenarios.

### Language Model Guided Reinforcement Learning in Quantitative Trading
**Authors**: Adam Darmanin, Vince Vella

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T16:06:15Z

**Summary**: Algorithmic trading requires short-term tactical decisions consistent with long-term financial objectives. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been applied to such problems, but adoption is limited by myopic behaviour and opaque policies. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer complementary strategic reasoning and multi-modal signal interpretation when guided by well-structured prompts.   This paper proposes a hybrid framework in which LLMs generate high-level trading strategies to guide RL agents. We evaluate (i) the economic rationale of LLM-generated strategies through expert review, and (ii) the performance of LLM-guided agents against unguided RL baselines using Sharpe Ratio (SR) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD).   Empirical results indicate that LLM guidance improves both return and risk metrics relative to standard RL.

### Precoder Design in Multi-User FDD Systems with VQ-VAE and GNN
**Authors**: Srikar Allaparapu, Michael Baur, Benedikt Böck, Michael Joham, Wolfgang Utschick

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:55:18Z

**Summary**: Robust precoding is efficiently feasible in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems by incorporating the learnt statistics of the propagation environment through a generative model. We build on previous work that successfully designed site-specific precoders based on a combination of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). In this paper, by utilizing a vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we circumvent one of the key drawbacks of GMMs, i.e., the number of GMM components scales exponentially to the feedback bits. In addition, the deep learning architecture of the VQ-VAE allows us to jointly train the GNN together with VQ-VAE along with pilot optimization forming an end-to-end (E2E) model, resulting in considerable performance gains in sum rate for multi-user wireless systems. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed frameworks over the conventional methods involving the sub-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) pilot matrix and iterative precoder algorithms enabling the deployment of systems characterized by fewer pilots or feedback bits.

### CausalVLBench: Benchmarking Visual Causal Reasoning in Large   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Aneesh Komanduri, Karuna Bhaila, Xintao Wu

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:38:10Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability. Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks: causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning abilities of LVLMs.

### Site-Specific RIS Deployment in Cellular Networks via Calibrated Ray   Tracing
**Authors**: Sina Beyraghi, Javad Shabanpour, Giovanni Geraci, Paul Almasan, Angel Lozano

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:33:28Z

**Summary**: This work introduces a fully-automated RIS deployment strategy validated through a digital twin, powered by Sionna ray tracing, of a UK city. On a scene calibrated with measured data, the method jointly optimizes RIS placement, orientation, configuration, and BS beamforming across 4G, 5G, and hypothetical 6G frequencies. Candidate RIS sites are identified via scattering-based rays, while user clustering reduces deployment overhead. Results show that meaningful coverage enhancement requires dense, large-aperture RIS deployments, raising questions about the practicality and cost of large-scale RIS adoption.

### Multimodal Policy Internalization for Conversational Agents
**Authors**: Zhenhailong Wang, Jiateng Liu, Amin Fazel, Ritesh Sarkhel, Xing Fan, Xiang Li, Chenlei Guo, Heng Ji, Ruhi Sarikaya

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:28:30Z

**Summary**: Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied. Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI), a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy, generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and comprehensive evaluations to foster future research.

### D-TPT: Dimensional Entropy Maximization for Calibrating Test-Time Prompt   Tuning in Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Jisu Han, Wonjun Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:27:44Z

**Summary**: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

### Hybrid Models for Natural Language Reasoning: The Case of Syllogistic   Logic
**Authors**: Manuel Vargas Guzmán, Jakub Szymanik, Maciej Malicki

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:27:29Z

**Summary**: Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability: compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning. Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality. To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural reasoning systems.

### Getting Your Indices in a Row: Full-Text Search for LLM Training Data   for Real World
**Authors**: Ines Altemir Marinas, Anastasiia Kucherenko, Alexander Sternfeld, Andrei Kucharavy

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:26:11Z

**Summary**: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is determined by their training data. Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet.   In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster, we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline, curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.   We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener computation.

### Cross-Platform Narrative Prediction: Leveraging Platform-Invariant   Discourse Networks
**Authors**: Patrick Gerard, Luca Luceria, Leonardo Blas, Emilio Ferrara

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:19:36Z

**Summary**: Online narratives spread unevenly across platforms, with content emerging on one site often appearing on others, hours, days or weeks later. Existing cross-platform information diffusion models often treat platforms as isolated systems, disregarding cross-platform activity that might make these patterns more predictable. In this work, we frame cross-platform prediction as a network proximity problem: rather than tracking individual users across platforms or relying on brittle signals like shared URLs or hashtags, we construct platform-invariant discourse networks that link users through shared narrative engagement. We show that cross-platform neighbor proximity provides a strong predictive signal: adoption patterns follow discourse network structure even without direct cross-platform influence. Our highly-scalable approach substantially outperforms diffusion models and other baselines while requiring less than 3% of active users to make predictions. We also validate our framework through retrospective deployment. We sequentially process a datastream of 5.7M social media posts occurred during the 2024 U.S. election, to simulate real-time collection from four platforms (X, TikTok, Truth Social, and Telegram): our framework successfully identified emerging narratives, including crises-related rumors, yielding over 94% AUC with sufficient lead time to support proactive intervention.

### Flattery in Motion: Benchmarking and Analyzing Sycophancy in Video-LLMs
**Authors**: Wenrui Zhou, Mohamed Hendy, Shu Yang, Qingsong Yang, Zikun Guo, Yuyu Luo, Lijie Hu, Di Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:15:28Z

**Summary**: As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications that demand grounded multimodal reasoning, ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance. However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE (Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on sycophancy into the video domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. Furthermore, we propose two potential training-free mitigation strategies, revealing potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias: (i) enhancing visual grounding through interpretable key-frame selection and (ii) steering model behavior away from sycophancy via targeted, inference-time intervention on its internal neural representations. Our code is available at https://github.com/William030422/Video-Sycophancy.

### Adaptive Attacks on Trusted Monitors Subvert AI Control Protocols
**Authors**: Mikhail Terekhov, Alexander Panfilov, Daniil Dzenhaliou, Caglar Gulcehre, Maksym Andriushchenko, Ameya Prabhu, Jonas Geiping

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:12:44Z

**Summary**: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice, most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires, as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

### CAFL-L: Constraint-Aware Federated Learning with Lagrangian Dual   Optimization for On-Device Language Models
**Authors**: Dongqi Zheng, Wenjin Fu

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:06:28Z

**Summary**: We introduce Constraint-Aware Federated Learning with Lagrangian Dual Optimization (CAFL-L), a principled extension of FedAvg that explicitly incorporates device-level resource constraints including energy, communication, memory, and thermal budgets. CAFL-L employs Lagrangian dual optimization to dynamically adapt training hyperparameters -- freezing depth, local steps, batch size, and communication compression -- while preserving training stability through token-budget preservation via gradient accumulation. Experiments on a character-level language model demonstrate that CAFL-L achieves superior constraint satisfaction compared to standard FedAvg (reducing memory usage by 20% and communication by 95%) while maintaining competitive validation performance, making it practical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T15:05:13Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across general NLP tasks, but their utility in automating numerical experiments of complex physical system -- a critical and labor-intensive component -- remains underexplored. As the major workhorse of computational science over the past decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components -- CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge, numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability, solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation of numerical experiments for complex physical systems. Code and data are available at https://github.com/NREL-Theseus/cfdllmbench/.

### Demystifying and Navigating AI Ethics in Power Electronics
**Authors**: Fanfan Lin, Peter Wilson, Xinze Li, Alan Mantooth

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:51:02Z

**Summary**: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming power electronics, with AI-related publications in IEEE Power Electronics Society selected journals increasing more than fourfold from 2020 to 2025. However, the ethical dimensions of this transformation have received limited attention. This article underscores the urgent need for an ethical framework to guide responsible AI integration in power electronics, not only to prevent AI-related incidents but also to comply with legal and regulatory responsibilities. In this context, this article identifies four core pillars of AI ethics in power electronics: Security & Safety, Explainability & Transparency, Energy Sustainability, and Evolving Roles of Engineers. Each pillar is supported by practical and actionable insights to ensure that ethical principles are embedded in algorithm design, system deployment, and workforce development. The authors advocate for power electronics engineers to lead the ethical discourse, given their deep technical understanding of both AI systems and power conversion technologies. The paper concludes by calling on the IEEE Power Electronics Society to spearhead the establishment of ethical standards and best practices that ensure AI innovations are not only technically advanced but also trustworthy, safe, and sustainable.

### Domain-Adapted Pre-trained Language Models for Implicit Information   Extraction in Crash Narratives
**Authors**: Xixi Wang, Jordanka Kovaceva, Miguel Costa, Shuai Wang, Francisco Camara Pereira, Robert Thomson

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:45:07Z

**Summary**: Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However, large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in, for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100 categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT. Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations in the dataset.

### K-ASTRO: Structure-Aware Adaptation of LLMs for Code Vulnerability   Detection
**Authors**: Yifan Zhang, Michael Sandborn, Stefan Larson, Yu Huang, Kevin Leach

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:41:55Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming software engineering tasks, including code vulnerability detection-a critical area of software security. However, existing methods often rely on resource-intensive models or graph-based techniques, limiting their accessibility and practicality. This paper introduces K-ASTRO, a lightweight Transformer model that combines semantic embeddings from LLMs with structural features of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to improve both efficiency and accuracy in code vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces an AST-based augmentation technique inspired by mutation testing, a structure-aware attention mechanism that incorporates augmented AST features, and a joint adaptation pipeline to unify code semantics and syntax. Experimental results on three large-scale datasets, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and PrimeVul-demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while enabling rapid inference on CPUs with minimal training time. By offering a scalable, interpretable, and efficient solution, K-ASTRO bridges the gap between LLM advancements and practical software vulnerability detection, providing open-sourced tools to foster further research.

**Authors**: Minjun Kim, Hyeonseok Lim, Hangyeol Yoo, Inho Won, Seungwoo Song, Minkyung Cho, Junhun Yuk, Changsu Choi, Dongjae Shin, Huige Lee, Hoyun Song, Alice Oh, Kyungtae Lim

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:31:25Z

**Summary**: This work presents the first large-scale investigation into constructing a fully open bilingual large language model (LLM) for a non-English language, specifically Korean, trained predominantly on synthetic data. We introduce KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore, the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future multilingual LLM research.

### The Speech-LLM Takes It All: A Truly Fully End-to-End Spoken Dialogue   State Tracking Approach
**Authors**: Nizar El Ghazal, Antoine Caubrière, Valentin Vielzeuf

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:27:01Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a comparative study of context management strategies for end-to-end Spoken Dialog State Tracking using Speech-LLMs. We systematically evaluate traditional multimodal context (combining text history and spoken current turn), full spoken history, and compressed spoken history approaches. Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed analysis confirms that improvements stem from more effective context utilization.

### On the Representations of Entities in Auto-regressive Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Victor Morand, Josiane Mothe, Benjamin Piwowarski

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:23:44Z

**Summary**: Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text, grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language. Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs) internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_, extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training. Our code is avalable at https://github.com/VictorMorand/EntityRepresentations .

### Active Model Selection for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yavuz Durmazkeser, Patrik Okanovic, Andreas Kirsch, Torsten Hoefler, Nezihe Merve Gürel

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:20:47Z

**Summary**: We introduce LLM SELECTOR, the first framework for active model selection of Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best LLM for the task.

### Preference Discerning with LLM-Enhanced Generative Retrieval
**Authors**: Fabian Paischer, Liu Yang, Linfeng Liu, Shuai Shao, Kaveh Hassani, Jiacheng Li, Ricky Chen, Zhang Gabriel Li, Xiaoli Gao, Wei Shao, Xue Feng, Nima Noorshams, Sem Park, Bo Long, Hamid Eghbalzadeh

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:19:09Z

**Summary**: In sequential recommendation, models recommend items based on user's interaction history. To this end, current models usually incorporate information such as item descriptions and user intent or preferences. User preferences are usually not explicitly given in open-source datasets, and thus need to be approximated, for example via large language models (LLMs). Current approaches leverage approximated user preferences only during training and rely solely on the past interaction history for recommendations, limiting their ability to dynamically adapt to changing preferences, potentially reinforcing echo chambers. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm, namely preference discerning, which explicitly conditions a generative recommendation model on user preferences in natural language within its context. To evaluate preference discerning, we introduce a novel benchmark that provides a holistic evaluation across various scenarios, including preference steering and sentiment following. Upon evaluating current state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, we discover that their ability to dynamically adapt to evolving user preferences is limited. To address this, we propose a new method named Mender ($\textbf{M}$ultimodal Prefer$\textbf{en}$ce $\textbf{D}$iscern$\textbf{er}$), which achieves state-of-the-art performance in our benchmark. Our results show that Mender effectively adapts its recommendation guided by human preferences, even if not observed during training, paving the way toward more flexible recommendation models.

### Differentially Private 2D Human Pose Estimation
**Authors**: Kaushik Bhargav Sivangi, Paul Henderson, Fani Deligianni

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:14:33Z

**Summary**: Human pose estimation (HPE) has become essential in numerous applications including healthcare, activity recognition, and human-computer interaction. However, the privacy implications of processing sensitive visual data present significant deployment barriers in critical domains. While traditional anonymization techniques offer limited protection and often compromise data utility for broader motion analysis, Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal privacy guarantees but typically degrades model performance when applied naively. In this work, we present the first comprehensive framework for differentially private 2D human pose estimation (2D-HPE) by applying Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) to this task. To effectively balance privacy with performance, we adopt Projected DP-SGD (PDP-SGD), which projects the noisy gradients to a low-dimensional subspace. Next, we incorporate Feature Differential Privacy(FDP) to selectively privatize only sensitive features while retaining public visual cues. Finally, we propose a hybrid feature-projective DP framework that combines both approaches to balance privacy and accuracy for HPE. We evaluate our approach on the MPII dataset across varying privacy budgets, training strategies, and clipping norms. Our combined feature-projective method consistently outperforms vanilla DP-SGD and individual baselines, achieving up to 82.61\% mean PCKh@0.5 at $\epsilon = 0.8$, substantially closing the gap to the non-private performance. This work lays foundation for privacy-preserving human pose estimation in real-world, sensitive applications.

### Anemoi: A Semi-Centralized Multi-agent System Based on Agent-to-Agent   Communication MCP server from Coral Protocol
**Authors**: Xinxing Ren, Caelum Forder, Qianbo Zang, Ahsen Tahir, Roman J. Georgio, Suman Deb, Peter Carroll, Önder Gürcan, Zekun Guo

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:12:06Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in generalist multi-agent systems (MAS) have largely followed a context-engineering plus centralized paradigm, where a planner agent coordinates multiple worker agents through unidirectional prompt passing. While effective under strong planner models, this design suffers from two critical limitations: (1) strong dependency on the planner's capability, which leads to degraded performance when a smaller LLM powers the planner; and (2) limited inter-agent communication, where collaboration relies on prompt concatenation rather than genuine refinement through structured discussions. To address these challenges, we propose Anemoi, a semi-centralized MAS built on the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication MCP server from Coral Protocol. Unlike traditional designs, Anemoi enables structured and direct inter-agent collaboration, allowing all agents to monitor progress, assess results, identify bottlenecks, and propose refinements in real time. This paradigm reduces reliance on a single planner, supports adaptive plan updates, and minimizes redundant context passing, resulting in more scalable execution. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Anemoi achieved 52.73% accuracy with a small LLM (GPT-4.1-mini) as the planner, surpassing the strongest open-source baseline OWL (43.63%) by +9.09% under identical LLM settings. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Anemoi.

### Confidence-weighted integration of human and machine judgments for   superior decision-making
**Authors**: Felipe Yáñez, Xiaoliang Luo, Omar Valerio Minero, Bradley C. Love

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:03:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can surpass humans in certain forecasting tasks. What role does this leave for humans in the overall decision process? One possibility is that humans, despite performing worse than LLMs, can still add value when teamed with them. A human and machine team can surpass each individual teammate when team members' confidence is well-calibrated and team members diverge in which tasks they find difficult (i.e., calibration and diversity are needed). We simplified and extended a Bayesian approach to combining judgments using a logistic regression framework that integrates confidence-weighted judgments for any number of team members. Using this straightforward method, we demonstrated its effectiveness in both image classification and neuroscience forecasting tasks. Combining human judgments with one or more machines consistently improved overall team performance. Our hope is that this simple and effective strategy for integrating the judgments of humans and machines will lead to productive collaborations.

### Cross-Receiver Generalization for RF Fingerprint Identification via   Feature Disentanglement and Adversarial Training
**Authors**: Yuhao Pan, Xiucheng Wang, Nan Cheng, Wenchao Xu

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T14:01:05Z

**Summary**: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver, as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.

**Summary**: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information, follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources. Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT integration.

### TIT: A Tree-Structured Instruction Tuning Approach for LLM-Based Code   Translation
**Authors**: He Jiang, Yufu Wang, Hao Lin, Peiyu Zou, Zhide Zhou, Ang Jia, Xiaochen Li, Zhilei Ren

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:53:46Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in automated source-to-target code translation through pretraining on extensive code corpora. However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two critical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific features, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the output, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic alignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets, resulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original source. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured Instruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT consists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the syntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic syntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality fine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation module aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and contrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction tuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused by the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs syntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend structured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code generation fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code based on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in code translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion.

### ChoirRec: Semantic User Grouping via LLMs for Conversion Rate Prediction   of Low-Activity Users
**Authors**: Dakai Zhai, Jiong Gao, Boya Du, Junwei Xu, Qijie Shen, Jialin Zhu, Yuning Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:48:09Z

**Summary**: Accurately predicting conversion rates (CVR) for low-activity users remains a fundamental challenge in large-scale e-commerce recommender systems.Existing approaches face three critical limitations: (i) reliance on noisy and unreliable behavioral signals; (ii) insufficient user-level information due to the lack of diverse interaction data; and (iii) a systemic training bias toward high-activity users that overshadows the needs of low-activity users.To address these challenges, we propose ChoirRec, a novel framework that leverages the semantic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct semantic user groups and enhance CVR prediction for low-activity users.With a dual-channel architecture designed for robust cross-user knowledge transfer, ChoirRec comprises three components: (i) a Semantic Group Generation module that utilizes LLMs to form reliable, cross-activity user clusters, thereby filtering out noisy signals; (ii) a Group-aware Hierarchical Representation module that enriches sparse user embeddings with informative group-level priors to mitigate data insufficiency; and (iii) a Group-aware Multi-granularity Modual that employs a dual-channel architecture and adaptive fusion mechanism to ensure effective learning and utilization of group knowledge. We conduct extensive offline and online experiments on Taobao, a leading industrial-scale e-commerce platform.ChoirRec improves GAUC by 1.16\% in offline evaluations, while online A/B testing reveals a 7.24\% increase in order volume, highlighting its substantial practical value in real-world applications.

### HINT: Helping Ineffective Rollouts Navigate Towards Effectiveness
**Authors**: Xinyi Wang, Jinyi Han, Zishang Jiang, Tingyun Li, Jiaqing Liang, Sihang Jiang, Zhaoqian Dai, Shuguang Ma, Fei Yu, Yanghua Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:42:03Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training. While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy. To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity, we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness, an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own, preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales, while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data efficiency.Code is available on Github.

### Utilizing dynamic sparsity on pretrained DETR
**Authors**: Reza Sedghi, Anand Subramoney, David Kappel

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:36:00Z

**Summary**: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge, especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification (SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers without full model retraining.

### The Potential of Second-Order Optimization for LLMs: A Study with Full   Gauss-Newton
**Authors**: Natalie Abreu, Nikhil Vyas, Sham Kakade, Depen Morwani

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:35:10Z

**Summary**: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure. This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton (GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning, implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2) the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

### HoliTom: Holistic Token Merging for Fast Video Large Language Models
**Authors**: Kele Shao, Keda Tao, Can Qin, Haoxuan You, Yang Sui, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:28:40Z

**Summary**: Video large language models (video LLMs) excel at video comprehension but face significant computational inefficiency due to redundant video tokens. Existing token pruning methods offer solutions. However, approaches operating within the LLM (inner-LLM pruning), such as FastV, incur intrinsic computational overhead in shallow layers. In contrast, methods performing token pruning before the LLM (outer-LLM pruning) primarily address spatial redundancy within individual frames or limited temporal windows, neglecting the crucial global temporal dynamics and correlations across longer video sequences. This leads to sub-optimal spatio-temporal reduction and does not leverage video compressibility fully. Crucially, the synergistic potential and mutual influence of combining these strategies remain unexplored. To further reduce redundancy, we introduce HoliTom, a novel training-free holistic token merging framework. HoliTom employs outer-LLM pruning through global redundancy-aware temporal segmentation, followed by spatial-temporal merging to reduce visual tokens by over 90%, significantly alleviating the LLM's computational burden. Complementing this, we introduce a robust inner-LLM token similarity-based merging approach, designed for superior performance and compatibility with outer-LLM pruning. Evaluations demonstrate our method's promising efficiency-performance trade-off on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, reducing computational costs to 6.9% of FLOPs while maintaining 99.1% of the original performance. Furthermore, we achieve a 2.28x reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and a 1.32x acceleration in decoding throughput, highlighting the practical benefits of our integrated pruning approach for efficient video LLMs inference.

### Token-Level Policy Optimization: Linking Group-Level Rewards to   Token-Level Aggregation via Markov Likelihood
**Authors**: Xingyu Lin, Yilin Wen, En Wang, Du Su, Wenbin Liu, Chenfu Bao, Zhonghou Lv

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:25:28Z

**Summary**: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), particularly by boosting their mathematical performance. However, GRPO and related entropy-regularization methods still face challenges rooted in the sparse token rewards inherent to chain-of-thought (CoT). Current approaches often rely on undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments, which frequently lead to entropy collapse or model collapse. In this work, we propose TEPO, a novel token-level framework that incorporates Markov Likelihood (sequence likelihood) links group-level rewards with tokens via token-level aggregation. Experiments show that TEPO consistently outperforms existing baselines across key metrics (including @k and accuracy). It not only sets a new state of the art on mathematical reasoning tasks but also significantly enhances training stability.

### MOCHA: Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment
**Authors**: Elena Camuffo, Francesco Barbato, Mete Ozay, Simone Milani, Umberto Michieli

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:21:45Z

**Summary**: We introduce MOCHA (Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment), a knowledge distillation approach that transfers region-level multimodal semantics from a large vision-language teacher (e.g., LLaVa) into a lightweight vision-only object detector student (e.g., YOLO). A translation module maps student features into a joint space, where the training of the student and translator is guided by a dual-objective loss that enforces both local alignment and global relational consistency. Unlike prior approaches focused on dense or global alignment, MOCHA operates at the object level, enabling efficient transfer of semantics without modifying the teacher or requiring textual input at inference. We validate our method across four personalized detection benchmarks under few-shot regimes. Results show consistent gains over baselines, with a +10.1 average score improvement. Despite its compact architecture, MOCHA reaches performance on par with larger multimodal models, proving its suitability for real-world deployment.

### Understanding the Effects of Domain Finetuning on LLMs
**Authors**: Eshaan Tanwar, Deepak Nathani, William Yang Wang, Tanmoy Chakraborty

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:14:06Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for specific domains exhibit strong performance; however, the underlying mechanisms by which this fine-tuning reshapes their parametric space are not well understood. Prior works primarily focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality. Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable framework for analysing specialisation in large language models.

### Mem4Nav: Boosting Vision-and-Language Navigation in Urban Environments   with a Hierarchical Spatial-Cognition Long-Short Memory System
**Authors**: Lixuan He, Haoyu Dong, Zhenxing Chen, Yangcheng Yu, Jie Feng, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:08:39Z

**Summary**: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/Mem4Nav.

### NL2GenSym: Natural Language to Generative Symbolic Rules for SOAR   Cognitive Architecture via Large Language Models
**Authors**: Fang Yuan, Junjie Zeng, Yue Hu, Zhengqiu Zhu, Quanjun Yin, Yuxiang Xie

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:08:35Z

**Summary**: SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger counterparts.

### AMFT: Aligning LLM Reasoners by Meta-Learning the Optimal   Imitation-Exploration Balance
**Authors**: Lixuan He, Jie Feng, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:08:20Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned for reasoning tasks through a two-stage pipeline of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL), a process fraught with catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal trade-offs between imitation and exploration. Recent single-stage methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit, path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points), and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency, and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM alignment.

### A Multimodal Depth-Aware Method For Embodied Reference Understanding
**Authors**: Fevziye Irem Eyiokur, Dogucan Yaman, Hazım Kemal Ekenel, Alexander Waibel

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:05:00Z

**Summary**: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and reliable referent detection.

### ReTraceQA: Evaluating Reasoning Traces of Small Language Models in   Commonsense Question Answering
**Authors**: Francesco Maria Molfese, Luca Moroni, Ciro Porcaro, Simone Conia, Roberto Navigli

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:03:33Z

**Summary**: While Small Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on an increasingly wide array of commonsense reasoning benchmarks, current evaluation practices rely almost exclusively on the accuracy of their final answers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning processes that lead to those answers. To address this issue, we introduce ReTraceQA, a novel benchmark that introduces process-level evaluation for commonsense reasoning tasks. Our expert-annotated dataset reveals that in a substantial portion of instances (14-24%), SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning processes, suggesting that the capabilities of SLMs are often overestimated by evaluation metrics that focus only on comparing the final answer with the ground truth. Indeed, we show that when employing strong Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated judges for reasoning-aware evaluation rather than answer-only metrics, SLM performance drops significantly across all models and datasets, with scores decreasing by up to 25%.

### Deep Learning to Identify the Spatio-Temporal Cascading Effects of Train   Delays in a High-Density Network
**Authors**: Vu Duc Anh Nguyen, Ziyue Li

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:03:00Z

**Summary**: The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern economies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays. Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live, interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live, explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events (arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial advantage for a reliable decision support tool.

### LLP: LLM-based Product Pricing in E-commerce
**Authors**: Hairu Wang, Sheng You, Qiheng Zhang, Xike Xie, Shuguang Han, Yuchen Wu, Fei Huang, Jufeng Chen

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T13:00:57Z

**Summary**: Unlike Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon), inexperienced individual sellers on Consumer-to-Consumer platforms (e.g., eBay) often face significant challenges in setting prices for their second-hand products efficiently. Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions. To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning. Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\footnote\{Xianyu is China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\}, significantly outperforming the previous pricing method. Under the same 30\% product coverage, it raises the static adoption rate (SAR) from 40\% to 72\%, and maintains a strong SAR of 47\% even at 90\% recall.

### Localist LLMs -- A Mathematical Framework for Dynamic Locality Control
**Authors**: Joachim Diederich

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:44:59Z

**Summary**: We present a novel framework for training large language models with continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable, efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes, supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.

### Cell2Text: Multimodal LLM for Generating Single-Cell Descriptions from   RNA-Seq Data
**Authors**: Oussama Kharouiche, Aris Markogiannakis, Xiao Fei, Michail Chatzianastasis, Michalis Vazirgiannis

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:41:57Z

**Summary**: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by enabling the measurement of gene expression at cellular resolution, providing information for cell types, states, and disease contexts. Recently, single-cell foundation models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity, tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation. These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of unseen cells.

### Benchmarking and Mitigate Sycophancy in Medical Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Zikun Guo, Xinyue Xu, Pei Xiang, Shu Yang, Xin Han, Di Wang, Lijie Hu

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:35:53Z

**Summary**: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable, exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses, with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for evidence anchored defenses.

### FLRC: Fine-grained Low-Rank Compressor for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yu-Chen Lu, Chong-Yan Chen, Chi-Chih Chang, Yu-Fang Hu, Kai-Chiang Wu

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:35:09Z

**Summary**: Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance, their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods, establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

### Safety Game: Balancing Safe and Informative Conversations with Blackbox   Agentic AI using LP Solvers
**Authors**: Tuan Nguyen, Long Tran-Thanh

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:32:43Z

**Summary**: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM ecosystems.

### Large Language Model Prompt Datasets: An In-depth Analysis and Insights
**Authors**: Yuanming Zhang, Yan Lin, Arijit Khan, Huaiyu Wan

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:15:55Z

**Summary**: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:11:51Z

**Summary**: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency, which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling. Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over 4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline (RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable, energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G networks. We release the code at \href{https://github.com/Hxxxz0/RadioFlow}{GitHub}.

### GestureCoach: Rehearsing for Engaging Talks with LLM-Driven Gesture   Recommendations
**Authors**: Ashwin Ram, Varsha Suresh, Artin Saberpour Abadian, Vera Demberg, Jürgen Steimle

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:08:07Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces GestureCoach, a system designed to help speakers deliver more engaging talks by guiding them to gesture effectively during rehearsal. GestureCoach combines an LLM-driven gesture recommendation model with a rehearsal interface that proactively cues speakers to gesture appropriately. Trained on experts' gesturing patterns from TED talks, the model consists of two modules: an emphasis proposal module, which predicts when to gesture by identifying gesture-worthy text segments in the presenter notes, and a gesture identification module, which determines what gesture to use by retrieving semantically appropriate gestures from a curated gesture database. Results of a model performance evaluation and user study (N=30) show that the emphasis proposal module outperforms off-the-shelf LLMs in identifying suitable gesture regions, and that participants rated the majority of these predicted regions and their corresponding gestures as highly appropriate. A subsequent user study (N=10) showed that rehearsing with GestureCoach encouraged speakers to gesture and significantly increased gesture diversity, resulting in more engaging talks. We conclude with design implications for future AI-driven rehearsal systems.

### Verifying Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Its Computational Graph
**Authors**: Zheng Zhao, Yeskendir Koishekenov, Xianjun Yang, Naila Murray, Nicola Cancedda

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:06:04Z

**Summary**: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method: Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

### Issue Localization via LLM-Driven Iterative Code Graph Searching
**Authors**: Zhonghao Jiang, Xiaoxue Ren, Meng Yan, Wei Jiang, Yong Li, Zhongxin Liu

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T12:02:41Z

**Summary**: Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.

### MLLMEraser: Achieving Test-Time Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language   Models through Activation Steering
**Authors**: Chenlu Ding, Jiancan Wu, Leheng Sheng, Fan Zhang, Yancheng Yuan, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T11:47:30Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across vision-language tasks, yet their large-scale deployment raises pressing concerns about memorized private data, outdated knowledge, and harmful content. Existing unlearning approaches for MLLMs typically adapt training-based strategies such as gradient ascent or preference optimization, but these methods are computationally expensive, irreversible, and often distort retained knowledge. In this work, we propose MLLMEraser, an input-aware, training-free framework for test-time unlearning. Our approach leverages activation steering to enable dynamic knowledge erasure without parameter updates. Specifically, we construct a multimodal erasure direction by contrasting adversarially perturbed, knowledge-recall image-text pairs with knowledge-erasure counterparts, capturing both textual and visual discrepancies. To prevent unnecessary interference, we further design an input-aware steering mechanism that adaptively determines when and how the erasure direction should be applied, preserving utility on retained knowledge while enforcing forgetting on designated content. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL demonstrate that MLLMEraser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM unlearning baselines, achieving stronger forgetting performance with lower computational cost and minimal utility degradation.

### ShiZhi: A Chinese Lightweight Large Language Model for Court View   Generation
**Authors**: Zhitian Hou, Kun Zeng

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T11:42:17Z

**Summary**: Criminal Court View Generation (CVG) is a fundamental task in legal artificial intelligence, aiming to automatically generate the "Court View" section of a legal case document. Generating court views is challenging due to the diversity and complexity of case facts, and directly generating from raw facts may limit performance. In this paper, we present ShiZhi, the first large language model (LLM) specifically designed for court view generation. We construct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K cases, each containing fact descriptions paired with corresponding court views. Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation and 86.1\% accuracy with 92.5\% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that even a small LLM can generate reasonable and legally coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data. Our model and dataset are available at \href{https://github.com/ZhitianHou/ShiZhi}{https://github.com/ZhitianHou/ShiZhi}.

### MaP: A Unified Framework for Reliable Evaluation of Pre-training   Dynamics
**Authors**: Jiapeng Wang, Changxin Tian, Kunlong Chen, Ziqi Liu, Jiaxin Mao, Wayne Xin Zhao, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T11:40:27Z

**Summary**: Reliable evaluation is fundamental to the progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the evaluation process during pre-training is plagued by significant instability that obscures true learning dynamics. In this work, we systematically diagnose this instability, attributing it to two distinct sources: \textit{Parameter Instability} from training stochasticity and \textit{Evaluation Instability} from noisy measurement protocols. To counteract both sources of noise, we introduce \textbf{MaP}, a dual-pronged framework that synergistically integrates checkpoint \underline{M}erging \underline{a}nd the \underline{P}ass@k metric. Checkpoint merging smooths the parameter space by averaging recent model weights, while Pass@k provides a robust, low-variance statistical estimate of model capability. Extensive experiments show that MaP yields significantly smoother performance curves, reduces inter-run variance, and ensures more consistent model rankings. Ultimately, MaP provides a more reliable and faithful lens for observing LLM training dynamics, laying a crucial empirical foundation for LLM research.

### LightMamba: Efficient Mamba Acceleration on FPGA with Quantization and   Hardware Co-design
**Authors**: Renjie Wei, Songqiang Xu, Linfeng Zhong, Zebin Yang, Qingyu Guo, Yuan Wang, Runsheng Wang, Meng Li

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T11:26:17Z

**Summary**: State space models (SSMs) like Mamba have recently attracted much attention. Compared to Transformer-based large language models (LLMs), Mamba achieves linear computation complexity with the sequence length and demonstrates superior performance. However, Mamba is hard to accelerate due to the scattered activation outliers and the complex computation dependency, rendering existing LLM accelerators inefficient. In this paper, we propose LightMamba that co-designs the quantization algorithm and FPGA accelerator architecture for efficient Mamba inference. We first propose an FPGA-friendly post-training quantization algorithm that features rotation-assisted quantization and power-of-two SSM quantization to reduce the majority of computation to 4-bit. We further design an FPGA accelerator that partially unrolls the Mamba computation to balance the efficiency and hardware costs. Through computation reordering as well as fine-grained tiling and fusion, the hardware utilization and memory efficiency of the accelerator get drastically improved. We implement LightMamba on Xilinx Versal VCK190 FPGA and achieve 4.65x to 6.06x higher energy efficiency over the GPU baseline. When evaluated on Alveo U280 FPGA, LightMamba reaches 93 tokens/s, which is 1.43x that of the GPU baseline. Our code is available at https://github.com/PKU-SEC-Lab/LightMamba.

**Authors**: Mariat James Elizebeth, Shufeng Chen, Halima El Badaoui, Siddartha Khastgir, Paul Jennings

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T11:24:48Z

**Summary**: Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft are expected to be quieter and more cost-effective than helicopters, offering major economic and social benefits through improved connectivity. Their adoption will require new ground infrastructure and airspace redesign, introducing risks involving multiple stakeholders (Regulators, eVTOL operators, Air navigation service providers, Vertiport operators, OEMs, Pilots, etc.). To assess these risks for the UK airspace, systems-thinking based System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) was conducted. To manage the large number of Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) and requirements generated due to the complexity of the analysis, a novel extension to STPA for the prioritization of results was applied. 317 UCAs were identified in total out of which 110 high-priority UCAs were analyzed (Step-4), resulting in 377 causal factors and 432 requirements. These were prioritized to produce a targeted list of 124 distinct high-priority requirements, 56 of which were identified as gaps in existing aviation regulations, policies, or procedures.. These highlight opportunities for regulatory updates in areas such as organizational performance, certification processes, training, collision avoidance, energy management, and automation. The findings provide regulators with safety considerations that could shape new or updated regulations, compliance methods, and guidance materials for the safe deployment of eVTOLs.

### CLARity: Reasoning Consistency Alone Can Teach Reinforced Experts
**Authors**: Jiuheng Lin, Cong Jiang, Zirui Wu, Jiarui Sun, Yansong Feng

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T11:21:09Z

**Summary**: Training expert LLMs in domains with scarce data is difficult, often relying on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, standard outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency. Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose CLARity, a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARity integrates a consistency-aware reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to to better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and professionalism. Thus, CLARity offers a generalizable solution that enables smaller models to effectively guide expert models by reasoning consistency.Our code is open sourced at: https://github.com/Infinite-set/CLARity

### Inflated Excellence or True Performance? Rethinking Medical Diagnostic   Benchmarks with Dynamic Evaluation
**Authors**: Xiangxu Zhang, Lei Li, Yanyun Zhou, Xiao Zhou, Yingying Zhang, Xian Wu

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T11:19:04Z

**Summary**: Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions, DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy, DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions: veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.

### MomentSeg: Moment-Centric Sampling for Enhanced Video Pixel   Understanding
**Authors**: Ming Dai, Sen Yang, Boqiang Duan, Wankou Yang, Jingdong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T11:18:21Z

**Summary**: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues, while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated \texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP), which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at: https://github.com/Dmmm1997/MomentSeg

**Authors**: Amina Ferrad, Johann Huber, François Hélénon, Julien Gleyze, Mahdi Khoramshahi, Stéphane Doncieux

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T11:08:06Z

**Summary**: Robotics research has made significant strides in learning, yet mastering basic skills like object placement remains a fundamental challenge. A key bottleneck is the acquisition of large-scale, high-quality data, which is often a manual and laborious process. Inspired by Graspit!, a foundational work that used simulation to automatically generate dexterous grasp poses, we introduce Placeit!, an evolutionary-computation framework for generating valid placement positions for rigid objects. Placeit! is highly versatile, supporting tasks from placing objects on tables to stacking and inserting them. Our experiments show that by leveraging quality-diversity optimization, Placeit! significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all scenarios for generating diverse valid poses. A pick&place pipeline built on our framework achieved a 90% success rate over 120 real-world deployments. This work positions Placeit! as a powerful tool for open-environment pick-and-place tasks and as a valuable engine for generating the data needed to train simulation-based foundation models in robotics.

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T11:03:31Z

**Summary**: We introduce SynthID-Image, a deep learning-based system for invisibly watermarking AI-generated imagery. This paper documents the technical desiderata, threat models, and practical challenges of deploying such a system at internet scale, addressing key requirements of effectiveness, fidelity, robustness, and security. SynthID-Image has been used to watermark over ten billion images and video frames across Google's services and its corresponding verification service is available to trusted testers. For completeness, we present an experimental evaluation of an external model variant, SynthID-O, which is available through partnerships. We benchmark SynthID-O against other post-hoc watermarking methods from the literature, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both visual quality and robustness to common image perturbations. While this work centers on visual media, the conclusions on deployment, constraints, and threat modeling generalize to other modalities, including audio. This paper provides a comprehensive documentation for the large-scale deployment of deep learning-based media provenance systems.

### Detecting Data Contamination from Reinforcement Learning Post-training   for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yongding Tao, Tian Wang, Yihong Dong, Huanyu Liu, Kechi Zhang, Xiaolong Hu, Ge Li

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T10:58:50Z

**Summary**: Data contamination poses a significant threat to the reliable evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue arises when benchmark samples may inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique. Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase contamination, our method makes detection possible.

### DSPO: Stable and Efficient Policy Optimization for Agentic Search and   Reasoning
**Authors**: Chenyang Gu, Yewen Pu, Bruce Yang, Xiaofan Li, Huan Gao

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T10:53:25Z

**Summary**: Enhancing LLMs with the ability to actively search external knowledge is crucial for complex and real-world tasks. Current approaches either rely on prompting to elicit the model's innate agent capabilities, or suffer from performance ceilings and collapse when applying RL to complex interactive tasks, leaving their true agentic potential untapped. To address this, we introduce \textbf{D}ynamic-filter \textbf{S}equence-level \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (DSPO), an improved RL algorithm designed for robust agent training through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample filtering. We train our model purely through RL to interleave multi-turn search and reasoning, obviating the need for supervised demonstration data. Across multiple QA benchmarks, our DSPO-trained 7B model improves over a comparable previous work by \textbf{34.1\%}, and even outperforms the 14B model from previous work in complex multihop QA such as HotpotQA by nearly \textbf{9\% relative}, maintaining exceptional training stability.

### Can Large Language Models Master Complex Card Games?
**Authors**: Wei Wang, Fuqing Bie, Junzhe Chen, Dan Zhang, Shiyu Huang, Evgeny Kharlamov, Jie Tang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T10:49:14Z

**Summary**: Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data, and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality data, (2) LLMs can achieve a certain level of proficiency in multiple complex card games simultaneously, with performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/THUDM/LLM4CardGame

### Fundamentals of Building Autonomous LLM Agents
**Authors**: Victor de Lamo Castrillo, Habtom Kahsay Gidey, Alexander Lenz, Alois Knoll

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T10:32:39Z

**Summary**: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought; a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for autonomous and intelligent behavior.

### CrisiText: A dataset of warning messages for LLM training in emergency   communication
**Authors**: Giacomo Gonella, Gian Maria Campedelli, Stefano Menini, Marco Guerini

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T10:32:11Z

**Summary**: Effectively identifying threats and mitigating their potential damage during crisis situations, such as natural disasters or violent attacks, is paramount for safeguarding endangered individuals. To tackle these challenges, AI has been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than 400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and few-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in out-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic post-editor.

### Characterizing 5G User Throughput via Uncertainty Modeling and   Crowdsourced Measurements
**Authors**: Javier Albert-Smet, Zoraida Frias, Luis Mendo, Sergio Melones, Eduardo Yraola

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T10:29:32Z

**Summary**: Characterizing application-layer user throughput in next-generation networks is increasingly challenging as the higher capacity of the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) shifts connectivity bottlenecks towards deeper parts of the network. Traditional methods, such as drive tests and operator equipment counters, are costly, limited, or fail to capture end-to-end (E2E) Quality of Service (QoS) and its variability. In this work, we leverage large-scale crowdsourced measurements-including E2E, radio, contextual and network deployment features collected by the user equipment (UE)-to propose an uncertainty-aware and explainable approach for downlink user throughput estimation. We first validate prior 4G methods, improving R^2 by 8.7%, and then extend them to 5G NSA and 5G SA, providing the first benchmarks for 5G crowdsourced datasets. To address the variability of throughput, we apply NGBoost, a model that outputs both point estimates and calibrated confidence intervals, representing its first use in the field of computer communications. Finally, we use the proposed model to analyze the evolution from 4G to 5G SA, and show that throughput bottlenecks move from the RAN to transport and service layers, as seen by E2E metrics gaining importance over radio-related features.

**Authors**: Vijay M. Galshetwar, Praful Hambarde, Prashant W. Patil, Akshay Dudhane, Sachin Chaudhary, Santosh Kumar Vipparathi, Subrahmanyam Murala

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T10:15:59Z

**Summary**: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and video restoration techniques developed to mitigate weather-induced visual impairments. We categorize existing approaches into traditional prior-based methods and modern data-driven models, including CNNs, transformers, diffusion models, and emerging vision-language models (VLMs). Restoration strategies are further classified based on their scope: single-task models, multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable reference for advancing weather-resilient vision systems in smart transportation environments. Lastly, to stay current with rapid advancements in this field, we will maintain regular updates of the latest relevant papers and their open-source implementations at https://github.com/ChaudharyUPES/A-comprehensive-review-on-Multi-weather-restoration

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex) problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin). PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and 5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities.

### Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention with Large Language Models for Cross-Domain   Sequential Recommendation
**Authors**: Wangyu Wu, Xuhang Chen, Zhenhong Chen, Jing-En Jiang, Kim-Fung Tsang, Xiaowei Huang, Fei Ma, Jimin Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T10:12:09Z

**Summary**: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations. A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer electronics.

### Techno-economic analysis of self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic systems   for grid-scale energy generation
**Authors**: Jihun Lim, Sungwon Lee

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T10:08:15Z

**Summary**: To facilitate the widespread adoption of renewable energy, dispatchable, zero-emission power sources are essential for grid stability. This work performs a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system, an architecture that integrates solar charging to function as a standalone power generation asset. Using theory-based models for conventional air-bridge InGaAs and Si diode cells, our analysis reveals that while the system is not currently competitive from a pure levelized of storage cost (LCOS) perspective due to the high capital expenditure for thermal battery materials, its primary value lies in its competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), which is comparable to that of conventional dispatchable generators such as gas turbines. Furthermore, we show that a full Si-based TPV system, utilizing a 50-{\mu}m-thick air-bridge cell for enhanced photon utilization, can also achieve an LCOE that is competitive with such conventional power sources at scales exceeding the gigawatt-hour level, despite its lower conversion efficiency relative to its InGaAs counterpart. This highlights a practical engineering pathway for leveraging the immense manufacturing scalability of Si, offering a lower-risk route to deployment compared to III-V materials. Ultimately, this work establishes the self-sustainable TPV architecture as a compelling pathway toward providing grid-scale, on-demand, zero-emission power.

### On the Reliability of Large Language Models for Causal Discovery
**Authors**: Tao Feng, Lizhen Qu, Niket Tandon, Zhuang Li, Xiaoxi Kang, Gholamreza Haffari

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T10:06:02Z

**Summary**: This study investigates the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in causal discovery. Using newly available open-source LLMs, OLMo and BLOOM, which provide access to their pre-training corpora, we investigate how LLMs address causal discovery through three research questions. We examine: (i) the impact of memorization for accurate causal relation prediction, (ii) the influence of incorrect causal relations in pre-training data, and (iii) the contextual nuances that influence LLMs' understanding of causal relations. Our findings indicate that while LLMs are effective in recognizing causal relations that occur frequently in pre-training data, their ability to generalize to new or rare causal relations is limited. Moreover, the presence of incorrect causal relations significantly undermines the confidence of LLMs in corresponding correct causal relations, and the contextual information critically affects the outcomes of LLMs to discern causal connections between random variables.

### HANDO: Hierarchical Autonomous Navigation and Dexterous   Omni-loco-manipulation
**Authors**: Jingyuan Sun, Chaoran Wang, Mingyu Zhang, Cui Miao, Hongyu Ji, Zihan Qu, Han Sun, Bing Wang, Qingyi Si

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T10:04:30Z

**Summary**: Seamless loco-manipulation in unstructured environments requires robots to leverage autonomous exploration alongside whole-body control for physical interaction. In this work, we introduce HANDO (Hierarchical Autonomous Navigation and Dexterous Omni-loco-manipulation), a two-layer framework designed for legged robots equipped with manipulators to perform human-centered mobile manipulation tasks. The first layer utilizes a goal-conditioned autonomous exploration policy to guide the robot to semantically specified targets, such as a black office chair in a dynamic environment. The second layer employs a unified whole-body loco-manipulation policy to coordinate the arm and legs for precise interaction tasks-for example, handing a drink to a person seated on the chair. We have conducted an initial deployment of the navigation module, and will continue to pursue finer-grained deployment of whole-body loco-manipulation.

### Filling in the Clinical Gaps in Benchmark: Case for HealthBench for the   Japanese medical system
**Authors**: Shohei Hisada, Endo Sunao, Himi Yamato, Shoko Wakamiya, Eiji Aramaki

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T10:00:56Z

**Summary**: This study investigates the applicability of HealthBench, a large-scale, rubric-based medical benchmark, to the Japanese context. Although robust evaluation frameworks are essential for the safe development of medical LLMs, resources in Japanese are scarce and often consist of translated multiple-choice questions. Our research addresses this issue in two ways. First, we establish a performance baseline by applying a machine-translated version of HealthBench's 5,000 scenarios to evaluate two models: a high-performing multilingual model (GPT-4.1) and a Japanese-native open-source model (LLM-jp-3.1). Secondly, we use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach to systematically classify the benchmark's scenarios and rubric criteria. This allows us to identify 'contextual gaps' where the content is misaligned with Japan's clinical guidelines, healthcare systems or cultural norms. Our findings reveal a modest performance drop in GPT-4.1 due to rubric mismatches, as well as a significant failure in the Japanese-native model, which lacked the required clinical completeness. Furthermore, our classification shows that, despite most scenarios being applicable, a significant proportion of the rubric criteria require localisation. This work underscores the limitations of direct benchmark translation and highlights the urgent need for a context-aware, localised adaptation, a "J-HealthBench", to ensure the reliable and safe evaluation of medical LLMs in Japan.

### System Prompt Optimization with Meta-Learning
**Authors**: Yumin Choi, Jinheon Baek, Sung Ju Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-10-10T09:56:06Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, with optimizing their input prompts playing a pivotal role in maximizing their performance. However, while LLM prompts consist of both the task-agnostic system prompts and task-specific user prompts, existing work on prompt optimization has focused on user prompts specific to individual queries or tasks, and largely overlooked the system prompt that is, once optimized, applicable across different tasks and domains. Motivated by this, we introduce the novel problem of bilevel system prompt optimization, whose objective is to design system prompts that are robust to diverse user prompts and transferable to unseen tasks. To tackle this problem, we then propose a meta-learning framework, which meta-learns the system prompt by optimizing it over various user prompts across multiple datasets, while simultaneously updating the user prompts in an iterative manner to ensure synergy between them. We conduct experiments on 14 unseen datasets spanning 5 different domains, on which we show that our approach produces system prompts that generalize effectively to diverse user prompts. Also, our findings reveal that the optimized system prompt enables rapid adaptation even to unseen tasks, requiring fewer optimization steps for test-time user prompts while achieving improved performance.
