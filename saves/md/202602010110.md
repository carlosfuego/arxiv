 ### SMOG: Scalable Meta-Learning for Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization
**Authors**: Leonard Papenmeier, Petru Tighineanu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:51:58Z

**Summary**: Multi-objective optimization aims to solve problems with competing objectives, often with only black-box access to a problem and a limited budget of measurements. In many applications, historical data from related optimization tasks is available, creating an opportunity for meta-learning to accelerate the optimization. Bayesian optimization, as a promising technique for black-box optimization, has been extended to meta-learning and multi-objective optimization independently, but methods that simultaneously address both settings - meta-learned priors for multi-objective Bayesian optimization - remain largely unexplored. We propose SMOG, a scalable and modular meta-learning model based on a multi-output Gaussian process that explicitly learns correlations between objectives. SMOG builds a structured joint Gaussian process prior across meta- and target tasks and, after conditioning on metadata, yields a closed-form target-task prior augmented by a flexible residual multi-output kernel. This construction propagates metadata uncertainty into the target surrogate in a principled way. SMOG supports hierarchical, parallel training: meta-task Gaussian processes are fit once and then cached, achieving linear scaling with the number of meta-tasks. The resulting surrogate integrates seamlessly with standard multi-objective Bayesian optimization acquisition functions.

### Causal Autoregressive Diffusion Language Model
**Authors**: Junhao Ruan, Bei Li, Yongjing Yin, Pengcheng Huang, Xin Chen, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai, Tong Xiao, JingBo Zhu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:38:29Z

**Summary**: In this work, we propose Causal Autoregressive Diffusion (CARD), a novel framework that unifies the training efficiency of ARMs with the high-throughput inference of diffusion models. CARD reformulates the diffusion process within a strictly causal attention mask, enabling dense, per-token supervision in a single forward pass. To address the optimization instability of causal diffusion, we introduce a soft-tailed masking schema to preserve local context and a context-aware reweighting mechanism derived from signal-to-noise principles. This design enables dynamic parallel decoding, where the model leverages KV-caching to adaptively generate variable-length token sequences based on confidence. Empirically, CARD outperforms existing discrete diffusion baselines while reducing training latency by 3 $\times$ compared to block diffusion methods. Our results demonstrate that CARD achieves ARM-level data efficiency while unlocking the latency benefits of parallel generation, establishing a robust paradigm for next-generation efficient LLMs.

### Heterogeneous Computing: The Key to Powering the Future of AI Agent Inference
**Authors**: Yiren Zhao, Junyi Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:11:46Z

**Summary**: AI agent inference is driving an inference heavy datacenter future and exposes bottlenecks beyond compute - especially memory capacity, memory bandwidth and high-speed interconnect. We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference.

### Macro-Scale Electrostatic Origami Motor
**Authors**: Alex S. Miller, Leo McElroy, Jeffrey H. Lang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:53:24Z

**Summary**: Foldable robots have been an active area of robotics research due to their high volume-to-mass ratio, easy packability, and shape adaptability. For locomotion, previously developed foldable robots have either embedded linear actuators in, or attached non-folding rotary motors to, their structure. Further, those actuators directly embedded in the structure of the folding medium all contributed to linear or folding motion, not to continuous rotary motion. On the macro-scale there has not yet been a folding continuous rotary actuator. This paper details the development and testing of the first macro-scale origami rotary motor that can be folded flat, and then unfurled to operate. Using corona discharge for torque production, the prototype motor achieved an expansion ratio of 2.5:1, reached a top speed of 1440 rpm when driven at -29 kV, and exhibited a maximum output torque over 0.15 mN m with an active component torque density of 0.04 Nm/kg.

### SONIC: Segmented Optimized Nexus for Information Compression in Key-Value Caching
**Authors**: Hong Chen, Xiang Liu, Bo Wang, Yuxuan Fan, Yuanlin Chu, Zongluo Li, Xiaowen Chu, Xuming Hu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:18:08Z

**Summary**: The linear growth of Key-Value (KV) cache remains a bottleneck for multi-turn LLM deployment. Existing KV cache compression methods often fail to account for the structural properties of multi-turn dialogues, relying on heuristic eviction that risks losing critical context. We propose \textbf{SONIC}, a learning-based framework that compresses historical segments into compact and semantically rich \textbf{Nexus} tokens. By integrating dynamic budget training, SONIC allows flexible adaptation to varying memory constraints without retraining. Experiments show that at compression ratios of 80\% and 50\%, SONIC consistently outperforms baselines such as H2O and StreamingLLM on four diverse multi-turn benchmarks. Specifically, on the widely used MTBench101 benchmark, SONIC achieves an average score improvement of 35.55\% over state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness in sustaining coherent multi-turn dialogues. Furthermore, SONIC enhances deployment efficiency, accelerating the overall inference process by 50.1\% compared to full-context generation.

### Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy with Salience Estimation in Autoregressive Video Diffusion
**Authors**: Hanmo Chen, Chenghao Xu, Xu Yang, Xuan Chen, Cheng Deng

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:55:29Z

**Summary**: Video generation is pivotal to digital media creation, and recent advances in autoregressive video generation have markedly enhanced the efficiency of real-time video synthesis. However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation. Our code will be released upon paper acceptance.

### d3LLM: Ultra-Fast Diffusion LLM using Pseudo-Trajectory Distillation
**Authors**: Yu-Yang Qian, Junda Su, Lanxiang Hu, Peiyuan Zhang, Zhijie Deng, Peng Zhao, Hao Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:45:13Z

**Summary**: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer capabilities beyond those of autoregressive (AR) LLMs, such as parallel decoding and random-order generation. However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/d3LLM.

### Low-Rank Key Value Attention
**Authors**: James O'Neill, Robert Clancy, Mariia Matskevichus, Fergal Reid

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:29:26Z

**Summary**: The key-value (KV) cache is a primary memory bottleneck in Transformers. We propose Low-Rank Key-Value (LRKV) attention, which reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads, while being compute efficient. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, providing a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and full independence. After pretraining models of size 128M to 6.3B parameters, LRKV consistently achieves the lowest test loss among standard MHA, MQA/GQA, and MLA while using only 45-53\% of MHA's KV cache. LRKV reaches equivalent baseline quality 18-25\% faster (measured in training steps). After supervised midtraining, LRKV achieves the highest downstream task performance across ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, MMLU, GSM8K, and HumanEval benchmarks.

### Trajectory-Guided Diffusion for Foreground-Preserving Background Generation in Multi-Layer Documents
**Authors**: Taewon Kang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:28:48Z

**Summary**: We present a diffusion-based framework for document-centric background generation that achieves foreground preservation and multi-page stylistic consistency through latent-space design rather than explicit constraints. Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, we offer a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling.

### Delayed Momentum Aggregation: Communication-efficient Byzantine-robust Federated Learning with Partial Participation
**Authors**: Kaoru Otsuka, Yuki Takezawa, Makoto Yamada

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:10:07Z

**Summary**: Partial participation is essential for communication-efficient federated learning at scale, yet existing Byzantine-robust methods typically assume full client participation. In the partial participation setting, a majority of the sampled clients may be Byzantine, once Byzantine clients dominate, existing methods break down immediately. We introduce delayed momentum aggregation, a principle where the central server aggregates cached momentum from non-sampled clients along with fresh momentum from sampled clients. This principle ensures Byzantine clients remain a minority from the server's perspective even when they dominate the sampled set. We instantiate this principle in our optimizer DeMoA. We analyze the convergence rate of DeMoA, showing that DeMoA is Byzantine-robust under partial participation. Experiments show that, with 20% Byzantine ratio and only 10% partial participation rate, DeMoA achieves the best accuracy even when existing methods fail empirically.

### FreqKV: Key-Value Compression in Frequency Domain for Context Window Extension
**Authors**: Jushi Kai, Yixuan Wang, Boyi Zeng, Haoli Bai, Bo Jiang, Ziwei He, Zhouhan Lin

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:31:34Z

**Summary**: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods for large language models (LLMs) often rely on token eviction, which risks losing critical local information in both long prefilling and decoding scenarios. When extrapolating beyond the pretrained context length, their performance degrades sharply on long-context benchmarks. Motivated by the observation in the frequency domain that the context information is concentrated in the low-frequency components, we propose FreqKV, a parameter-free and architecture-agnostic approach. It iteratively compresses the increasing KV cache in the frequency domain, allowing models to process lengthy contexts efficiently. With minimal training at 8K length, FreqKV extends the context window of LLaMA-2-7B up to 256K tokens while maintaining stable perplexity. Extensive experiments across prefilling and decoding demonstrate that FreqKV enables robust context window extension and consistently outperforms existing KV cache compression methods on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3, highlighting its effectiveness for both understanding and generation in long contexts.

### Why Attention Patterns Exist: A Unifying Temporal Perspective Analysis
**Authors**: Qingyue Yang, Jie Wang, Xing Li, Yinqi Bai, Xialiang Tong, Huiling Zhen, Jianye Hao, Mingxuan Yuan, Bin Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T13:40:23Z

**Summary**: Attention patterns play a crucial role in both training and inference of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have identified individual patterns such as retrieval heads, sink heads, and diagonal traces, yet these observations remain fragmented and lack a unifying explanation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Temporal Attention Pattern Predictability Analysis (TAPPA), a unifying framework that explains diverse attention patterns by analyzing their underlying mathematical formulations} from a temporally continuous perspective. TAPPA both deepens the understanding of attention behavior and guides inference acceleration approaches. Specifically, TAPPA characterizes attention patterns as predictable patterns with clear regularities and unpredictable patterns that appear effectively random. Our analysis further reveals that this distinction can be explained by the degree of query self-similarity along the temporal dimension. Focusing on the predictable patterns, we further provide a detailed mathematical analysis of three representative cases through the joint effect of queries, keys, and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We validate TAPPA by applying its insights to KV cache compression and LLM pruning tasks. Across these tasks, a simple metric motivated by TAPPA consistently improves performance over baseline methods. The code is available at https://github.com/MIRALab-USTC/LLM-TAPPA.

### Age Aware Content Fetching and Broadcast in a Sensing-as-a-Service System
**Authors**: Ankita Koley, Anu Krishna, Chandramani Singh, V Mahendran

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T13:32:04Z

**Summary**: We consider a Sensing-as-a-Service (S2aaS) system consisting of a sensor, a set of users, and a sensor cloud service provider (SCSP). The sensor updates its content each time it captures a new measurement. The SCSP occasionally fetches the content from the sensor, caches the latest fetched version and broadcasts it on being requested by the users. The SCSP incurs content fetching costs while fetching and broadcasting the contents. The SCSP also incurs an age cost if users do not receive the most recent version of the content after requesting. We study a content fetching and broadcast problem, aiming to minimize the time-averaged content fetching and age costs. The problem can be framed as a Markov decision process but cannot be elegantly solved owing to its multi-dimensional state space and complex dynamics. To address this, we first obtain the optimal policy for the homogeneous case with all the users having the same request probability and age cost. We extend this algorithm for heterogeneous case but the complexity grows exponentially with the number of users. To tackle this, we propose a low complexity Whittle index based algorithm, which performs very close to the optimal. The complexity of the algorithm is linear in number of users and serves as a heuristic for both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases.

### Don't be so Stief! Learning KV Cache low-rank approximation over the Stiefel manifold
**Authors**: Luca Benfenati, Matteo Risso, Andrea Vannozzi, Ahmet Caner Yüzügüler, Lukas Cavigelli, Enrico Macii, Daniele Jahier Pagliari, Alessio Burrello

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T13:19:24Z

**Summary**: Key--value (KV) caching enables fast autoregressive decoding but at long contexts becomes a dominant bottleneck in High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) capacity and bandwidth. A common mitigation is to compress cached keys and values by projecting per-head matrixes to a lower rank, storing only the projections in the HBM. However, existing post-training approaches typically fit these projections using SVD-style proxy objectives, which may poorly reflect end-to-end reconstruction after softmax, value mixing, and subsequent decoder-layer transformations.   For these reasons, we introduce StiefAttention, a post-training KV-cache compression method that learns \emph{orthonormal} projection bases by directly minimizing \emph{decoder-layer output reconstruction error}. StiefAttention additionally precomputes, for each layer, an error-rank profile over candidate ranks, enabling flexible layer-wise rank allocation under a user-specified error budget. Noteworthy, on Llama3-8B under the same conditions, StiefAttention outperforms EigenAttention by $11.9$ points on C4 perplexity and $5.4\%$ on 0-shot MMLU accuracy at iso-compression, yielding lower relative error and higher cosine similarity with respect to the original decoder-layer outputs.

### REST: Diffusion-based Real-time End-to-end Streaming Talking Head Generation via ID-Context Caching and Asynchronous Streaming Distillation
**Authors**: Haotian Wang, Yuzhe Weng, Jun Du, Haoran Xu, Xiaoyan Wu, Shan He, Bing Yin, Cong Liu, Qingfeng Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T12:58:13Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have significantly advanced the field of talking head generation (THG). However, slow inference speeds and prevalent non-autoregressive paradigms severely constrain the application of diffusion-based THG models. In this study, we propose REST, a pioneering diffusion-based, real-time, end-to-end streaming audio-driven talking head generation framework. To support real-time end-to-end generation, a compact video latent space is first learned through a spatiotemporal variational autoencoder with a high compression ratio. Additionally, to enable semi-autoregressive streaming within the compact video latent space, we introduce an ID-Context Cache mechanism, which integrates ID-Sink and Context-Cache principles into key-value caching for maintaining identity consistency and temporal coherence during long-term streaming generation. Furthermore, an Asynchronous Streaming Distillation (ASD) strategy is proposed to mitigate error accumulation and enhance temporal consistency in streaming generation, leveraging a non-streaming teacher with an asynchronous noise schedule to supervise the streaming student. REST bridges the gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches, achieving a breakthrough in efficiency for applications requiring real-time THG. Experimental results demonstrate that REST outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generation speed and overall performance.

### RecNet: Self-Evolving Preference Propagation for Agentic Recommender Systems
**Authors**: Bingqian Li, Xiaolei Wang, Junyi Li, Weitao Li, Long Zhang, Sheng Chen, Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T12:14:31Z

**Summary**: Agentic recommender systems leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to model complex user behaviors and support personalized decision-making. However, existing methods primarily model preference changes based on explicit user-item interactions, which are sparse, noisy, and unable to reflect the real-time, mutual influences among users and items. To address these limitations, we propose RecNet, a self-evolving preference propagation framework that proactively propagates real-time preference updates across related users and items. RecNet consists of two complementary phases. In the forward phase, the centralized preference routing mechanism leverages router agents to integrate preference updates and dynamically propagate them to the most relevant agents. To ensure accurate and personalized integration of propagated preferences, we further introduce a personalized preference reception mechanism, which combines a message buffer for temporary caching and an optimizable, rule-based filter memory to guide selective preference assimilation based on past experience and interests. In the backward phase, the feedback-driven propagation optimization mechanism simulates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, using LLMs for credit assignment, gradient analysis, and module-level optimization, enabling continuous self-evolution of propagation strategies. Extensive experiments on various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of RecNet in modeling preference propagation for recommender systems.

### VidLaDA: Bidirectional Diffusion Large Language Models for Efficient Video Understanding
**Authors**: Zhihao He, Tieyuan Chen, Kangyu Wang, Ziran Qin, Yang Shao, Chaofan Gan, Shijie Li, Zuxuan Wu, Weiyao Lin

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T11:14:49Z

**Summary**: Current Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) typically encode frames via a vision encoder and employ an autoregressive (AR) LLM for understanding and generation. However, this AR paradigm inevitably faces a dual efficiency bottleneck: strictly unidirectional attention compromises understanding efficiency by hindering global spatiotemporal aggregation, while serial decoding restricts generation efficiency. To address this, we propose VidLaDA, a Video LLM based on Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) that leverages bidirectional attention to unlock comprehensive spatiotemporal modeling and decode tokens in parallel. To further mitigate the computational overhead of diffusion decoding, we introduce MARS-Cache, an acceleration strategy that prunes redundancy by combining asynchronous visual cache refreshing with frame-wise chunk attention. Experiments show VidLaDA rivals state-of-the-art AR baselines (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA-Video) and outperforms DLM baselines, with MARS-Cache delivering over 12x speedup without compromising accuracy. Code and checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/ziHoHe/VidLaDA.

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T10:47:45Z

**Summary**: We demonstrate single spin spectroscopy of a fluorescent tumbling defect in silicon called the G center, behaving as a pseudo-molecule randomly reorienting itself in the crystalline matrix. Using high-resolution spin spectroscopy, we reveal a fine magnetic structure resulting from the spin principal axes jumping between discrete orientations in the crystal. Modeling the atomic reorientation of the defect shows that spin tumbling induces variations in the coupling to the microwave magnetic field, enabling position-dependent Rabi frequencies to be detected in coherent spin control experiments. By virtue of its pseudo-molecule configuration, the G center in silicon is a unique quantum system to investigate the mutual interaction between optical, spin and rotation properties in a highly versatile material.

### Fast and Geometrically Grounded Lorentz Neural Networks
**Authors**: Robert van der Klis, Ricardo Chávez Torres, Max van Spengler, Yuhui Ding, Thomas Hofmann, Pascal Mettes

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T10:44:32Z

**Summary**: Hyperbolic space is quickly gaining traction as a promising geometry for hierarchical and robust representation learning. A core open challenge is the development of a mathematical formulation of hyperbolic neural networks that is both efficient and captures the key properties of hyperbolic space. The Lorentz model of hyperbolic space has been shown to enable both fast forward and backward propagation. However, we prove that, with the current formulation of Lorentz linear layers, the hyperbolic norms of the outputs scale logarithmically with the number of gradient descent steps, nullifying the key advantage of hyperbolic geometry. We propose a new Lorentz linear layer grounded in the well-known ``distance-to-hyperplane" formulation. We prove that our formulation results in the usual linear scaling of output hyperbolic norms with respect to the number of gradient descent steps. Our new formulation, together with further algorithmic efficiencies through Lorentzian activation functions and a new caching strategy results in neural networks fully abiding by hyperbolic geometry while simultaneously bridging the computation gap to Euclidean neural networks.

### ScaleSim: Serving Large-Scale Multi-Agent Simulation with Invocation Distance-Based Memory Management
**Authors**: Zaifeng Pan, Yipeng Shen, Zhengding Hu, Zhuang Wang, Aninda Manocha, Zheng Wang, Zhongkai Yu, Yue Guan, Yufei Ding

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T09:52:16Z

**Summary**: LLM-based multi-agent simulations are increasingly adopted across application domains, but remain difficult to scale due to GPU memory pressure. Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations. ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.

### L$^3$: Large Lookup Layers
**Authors**: Albert Tseng, Christopher De Sa

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T09:37:31Z

**Summary**: Modern sparse language models typically achieve sparsity through Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers, which dynamically route tokens to dense MLP "experts." However, dynamic hard routing has a number of drawbacks, such as potentially poor hardware efficiency and needing auxiliary losses for stable training. In contrast, the tokenizer embedding table, which is natively sparse, largely avoids these issues by selecting a single embedding per token at the cost of not having contextual information. In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks.

### ConceptMoE: Adaptive Token-to-Concept Compression for Implicit Compute Allocation
**Authors**: Zihao Huang, Jundong Zhou, Xingwei Qu, Qiyang Min, Ge Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T08:58:22Z

**Summary**: Large language models allocate uniform computation across all tokens, ignoring that some sequences are trivially predictable while others require deep reasoning. We introduce ConceptMoE, which dynamically merges semantically similar tokens into concept representations, performing implicit token-level compute allocation. A learnable chunk module identifies optimal boundaries by measuring inter-token similarity, compressing sequences by a target ratio $R$ before they enter the compute-intensive concept model. Crucially, the MoE architecture enables controlled evaluation: we reallocate saved computation to match baseline activated FLOPs (excluding attention map computation) and total parameters, isolating genuine architectural benefits. Under these conditions, ConceptMoE consistently outperforms standard MoE across language and vision-language tasks, achieving +0.9 points on language pretraining, +2.3 points on long context understanding, and +0.6 points on multimodal benchmarks. When converting pretrained MoE during continual training with layer looping, gains reach +5.5 points, demonstrating practical applicability. Beyond performance, ConceptMoE reduces attention computation by up to $R^2\times$ and KV cache by $R\times$. At $R=2$, empirical measurements show prefill speedups reaching 175\% and decoding speedups up to 117\% on long sequences. The minimal architectural modifications enable straightforward integration into existing MoE, demonstrating that adaptive concept-level processing fundamentally improves both effectiveness and efficiency of large language models.

### NOSA: Native and Offloadable Sparse Attention
**Authors**: Yuxiang Huang, Pengjie Wang, Jicheng Han, Weilin Zhao, Zhou Su, Ao Sun, Hongya Lyu, Hengyu Zhao, Yudong Wang, Chaojun Xiao, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T08:26:24Z

**Summary**: Decoding throughput improvements from larger inference batches are limited by GPU memory, which is largely consumed by the key-value (KV) cache. Prior training-free KV cache offloading alleviates this by keeping redundant context on the CPU and fetching only a sparse subset for attention, but it often degrades long-generation quality due to training-inference mismatch on sparse patterns. Meanwhile, trainable sparse attention is incompatible with efficient offloading, as unconstrained KV accesses may force large CPU-to-GPU transfers and erase throughput gains. To this end, we propose NOSA, a trainable sparse attention mechanism natively designed for KV cache offloading. NOSA explicitly constrains the volume of CPU-GPU KV transfers, thereby achieving low communication overhead and high decoding throughput. We further build NOSI, a KV cache offloading inference system that fully unlocks NOSA's efficiency. Empirical results on 1,3,8B LLMs demonstrate that NOSA outperforms KV cache offloading baselines on general, long-input, and long-generation tasks, while boosting decoding throughput by up to 5.04x, 1.92x, and 1.83x over FullAttn, InfLLMv2, and ShadowKV, respectively. We release our code at https://github.com/thunlp/NOSA.

### Theoretically Optimal Attention/FFN Ratios in Disaggregated LLM Serving
**Authors**: Chendong Song, Meixuan Wang, Hang Zhou, Hong Liang, Yuan Lyu, Zixi Chen, Yuwei Fan, Zijie Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T07:22:27Z

**Summary**: Attention-FFN disaggregation (AFD) is an emerging architecture for LLM decoding that separates state-heavy, KV-cache-dominated Attention computation from stateless, compute-intensive FFN computation, connected by per-step communication. While AFD enables independent scaling of memory and compute resources, its performance is highly sensitive to the Attention/FFN provisioning ratio: mis-sizing induces step-level blocking and costly device idle time. We develop a tractable analytical framework for sizing AFD bundles in an $r$A-$1$F topology, where the key difficulty is that Attention-side work is nonstationary-token context grows and requests are continuously replenished with random lengths-while FFN work is stable given the aggregated batch. Using a probabilistic workload model, we derive closed-form rules for the optimal A/F ratio that maximize average throughput per instance across the system. A trace-calibrated AFD simulator validates the theory: across workloads, the theoretical optimal A/F ratio matches the simulation-optimal within 10%, and consistently reduces idle time.

### CacheFlow: Fast Human Motion Prediction by Cached Normalizing Flow
**Authors**: Takahiro Maeda, Jinkun Cao, Norimichi Ukita, Kris Kitani

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T06:43:16Z

**Summary**: Many density estimation techniques for 3D human motion prediction require a significant amount of inference time, often exceeding the duration of the predicted time horizon. To address the need for faster density estimation for 3D human motion prediction, we introduce a novel flow-based method for human motion prediction called CacheFlow. Unlike previous conditional generative models that suffer from poor time efficiency, CacheFlow takes advantage of an unconditional flow-based generative model that transforms a Gaussian mixture into the density of future motions. The results of the computation of the flow-based generative model can be precomputed and cached. Then, for conditional prediction, we seek a mapping from historical trajectories to samples in the Gaussian mixture. This mapping can be done by a much more lightweight model, thus saving significant computation overhead compared to a typical conditional flow model. In such a two-stage fashion and by caching results from the slow flow model computation, we build our CacheFlow without loss of prediction accuracy and model expressiveness. This inference process is completed in approximately one millisecond, making it 4 times faster than previous VAE methods and 30 times faster than previous diffusion-based methods on standard benchmarks such as Human3.6M and AMASS datasets. Furthermore, our method demonstrates improved density estimation accuracy and comparable prediction accuracy to a SOTA method on Human3.6M. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/meaten/CacheFlow.

### ACDiT: Interpolating Autoregressive Conditional Modeling and Diffusion Transformer
**Authors**: Jinyi Hu, Shengding Hu, Yuxuan Song, Yufei Huang, Mingxuan Wang, Hao Zhou, Zhiyuan Liu, Wei-Ying Ma, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T06:31:27Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive and diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in language models and visual generation, respectively. We present ACDiT, a novel Autoregressive blockwise Conditional Diffusion Transformer, that innovatively combines autoregressive and diffusion paradigms for continuous visual information. By introducing a block-wise autoregressive unit, ACDiT offers a flexible interpolation between token-wise autoregression and full-sequence diffusion, bypassing the limitations of discrete tokenization. The generation of each block is formulated as a conditional diffusion process, conditioned on prior blocks. ACDiT is easy to implement, as simple as applying a specially designed Skip-Causal Attention Mask on the standard diffusion transformer during training. During inference, the process iterates between diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding that can make full use of KV-Cache. We validate the effectiveness of ACDiT on image, video, and text generation and show that ACDiT performs best among all autoregressive baselines under similar model scales on visual generation tasks. We also demonstrate that, benefiting from autoregressive modeling, pretrained ACDiT can be transferred in visual understanding tasks despite being trained with the generative objective. The analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive and diffusion demonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in long-horizon visual generation tasks. We hope that ACDiT offers a novel perspective on visual autoregressive generation and sheds light on new avenues for unified models.

### Native LLM and MLLM Inference at Scale on Apple Silicon
**Authors**: Wayner Barrios

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T06:19:19Z

**Summary**: The growing adoption of Apple Silicon for machine learning development has created demand for efficient inference solutions that leverage its unique unified memory architecture. However, existing tools either lack native optimization (PyTorch MPS) or focus solely on text models, leaving multimodal workloads underserved. We present vllm-mlx, a framework for efficient LLM and MLLM inference on Apple Silicon built natively on MLX. For text models, we achieve 21\% to 87\% higher throughput than llama-cpp across models ranging from Qwen3-0.6B to Nemotron-30B, while providing continuous batching that scales to 4.3x aggregate throughput at 16 concurrent requests. For multimodal models, we introduce content-based prefix caching that eliminates redundant vision encoding by identifying identical images through content hashing, regardless of input format. Our evaluation on Apple M4 Max demonstrates throughput of up to 525 tokens per second on text models and 28x speedup on repeated image queries, reducing multimodal latency from 21.7 seconds to under 1 second. Video analysis with up to 64 frames achieves 24.7x cache speedup. We release our implementation as open source to support efficient inference on consumer Apple hardware.

### Ira: Efficient Transaction Replay for Distributed Systems
**Authors**: Adithya Bhat, Harshal Bhadreshkumar Shah, Mohsen Minaei

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T05:38:59Z

**Summary**: In primary-backup replication, consensus latency is bounded by the time for backup nodes to replay (re-execute) transactions proposed by the primary. In this work, we present Ira, a framework to accelerate backup replay by transmitting compact \emph{hints} alongside transaction batches. Our key insight is that the primary, having already executed transactions, possesses knowledge of future access patterns which is exactly the information needed for optimal replay.   We use Ethereum for our case study and present a concrete protocol, Ira-L, within our framework to improve cache management of Ethereum block execution. The primaries implementing Ira-L provide hints that consist of the working set of keys used in an Ethereum block and one byte of metadata per key indicating the table to read from, and backups use these hints for efficient block replay.   We evaluated Ira-L against the state-of-the-art Ethereum client reth over two weeks of Ethereum mainnet activity ($100,800$ blocks containing over $24$ million transactions). Our hints are compact, adding a median of $47$ KB compressed per block ($\sim5\%$ of block payload). We observe that the sequential hint generation and block execution imposes a $28.6\%$ wall-time overhead on the primary, though the direct cost from hints is $10.9\%$ of execution time; all of which can be pipelined and parallelized in production deployments. On the backup side, we observe that Ira-L achieves a median per-block speedup of $25\times$ over baseline reth. With $16$ prefetch threads, aggregate replay time drops from $6.5$ hours to $16$ minutes ($23.6\times$ wall-time speedup).

### ZipMoE: Efficient On-Device MoE Serving via Lossless Compression and Cache-Affinity Scheduling
**Authors**: Yuchen Yang, Yaru Zhao, Pu Yang, Shaowei Wang, Zhi-Hua Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T02:51:59Z

**Summary**: While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures substantially bolster the expressive power of large-language models, their prohibitive memory footprint severely impedes the practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, especially when model behavior must be preserved without relying on lossy quantization. In this paper, we present ZipMoE, an efficient and semantically lossless on-device MoE serving system. ZipMoE exploits the synergy between the hardware properties of edge devices and the statistical redundancy inherent to MoE parameters via a caching-scheduling co-design with provable performance guarantee. Fundamentally, our design shifts the paradigm of on-device MoE inference from an I/O-bound bottleneck to a compute-centric workflow that enables efficient parallelization. We implement a prototype of ZipMoE and conduct extensive experiments on representative edge computing platforms using popular open-source MoE models and real-world workloads. Our evaluation reveals that ZipMoE achieves up to $72.77\%$ inference latency reduction and up to $6.76\times$ higher throughput than the state-of-the-art systems.

### Planner-Auditor Twin: Agentic Discharge Planning with FHIR-Based LLM Planning, Guideline Recall, Optional Caching and Self-Improvement
**Authors**: Kaiyuan Wu, Aditya Nagori, Rishikesan Kamaleswaran

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T23:04:11Z

**Summary**: Objective: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical discharge planning, but their use is constrained by hallucination, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence. We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.   Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.   Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.   Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning. Separating an LLM Planner from a rule-based, observational Auditor enables systematic reliability measurement and safer iteration without model retraining.   Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework offers a practical pathway toward safer automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data access and deterministic auditing, supported by reproducible ablations and reliability-focused evaluation.

### ChunkWise LoRA: Adaptive Sequence Partitioning for Memory-Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation and Accelerated LLM Inference
**Authors**: Ketan Thakkar, Maitreyi Chatterjee, Ramasubramanian Balasubramanian, Achyuthan Jootoo, Rajendra Ugrani

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T22:58:28Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have enabled efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) with minimal additional parameters. However, existing LoRA methods apply static rank configurations uniformly across all input tokens, ignoring variation in token complexity and computational requirements. In this work, we propose ChunkWise LoRA, a dynamic and adaptive approach that partitions sequences into variable-length chunks based on token complexity and assigns each chunk a tailored low-rank configuration. Our system introduces a runtime scheduler that estimates token difficulty, performs adaptive chunking, and selects per-chunk LoRA rank and scaling using a rank-ladder mechanism. To preserve output consistency, we further introduce a boundary-safe composition module and integrate policy-driven KV-cache strategies. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Wikitext-103 and SQuAD demonstrate that ChunkWise LoRA achieves up to 34\% lower latency and 38% memory reduction compared to baseline LoRA, while maintaining or improving task performance metrics like BLEU, EM, and perplexity. The proposed framework remains fully compatible with existing transformer architectures and inference frameworks, providing a practical solution for real-world deployment of parameter-efficient LLMs.

### Non-Markov Multi-Round Conversational Image Generation with History-Conditioned MLLMs
**Authors**: Haochen Zhang, Animesh Sinha, Felix Juefei-Xu, Haoyu Ma, Kunpeng Li, Zhipeng Fan, Meng Dong, Xiaoliang Dai, Tingbo Hou, Peizhao Zhang, Zecheng He

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T17:32:34Z

**Summary**: Conversational image generation requires a model to follow user instructions across multiple rounds of interaction, grounded in interleaved text and images that accumulate as chat history. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can generate and edit images, most existing multi-turn benchmarks and training recipes are effectively Markov: the next output depends primarily on the most recent image, enabling shortcut solutions that ignore long-range history. In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum. We demonstrate that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization.

### Toward Ultra-Long-Horizon Agentic Science: Cognitive Accumulation for Machine Learning Engineering

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T16:23:21Z

**Summary**: The advancement of artificial intelligence toward agentic science is currently bottlenecked by the challenge of ultra-long-horizon autonomy, the ability to sustain strategic coherence and iterative correction over experimental cycles spanning days or weeks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%. Our findings demonstrate that ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.

### S$^3$-Attention:Attention-Aligned Endogenous Retrieval for Memory-Bounded Long-Context Inference
**Authors**: Qingsen Ma, Dianyun Wang, Yaoye Wang, Lechen Ning, Sujie Zhu, Xiaohang Zhang, Jiaming Lyu, Linhao Ren, Zhenbo Xu, Zhaofeng He

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T15:54:56Z

**Summary**: Large language models are increasingly applied to multi-document and long-form inputs, yet long-context inference remains memory- and noise-inefficient. Key-value (KV) caching scales linearly with context length, while external retrieval methods often return lexically similar but causally irrelevant passages.   We present S3-Attention, a memory-first inference-time framework that treats long-context processing as attention-aligned endogenous retrieval. S3-Attention decodes transient key and query projections into top-k sparse feature identifiers using lightweight sparse autoencoders, and constructs a CPU-based inverted index mapping features to token positions or spans during a single streaming scan. This design allows the KV cache to be discarded entirely and bounds GPU memory usage by the scan chunk size.   At generation time, feature co-activation is used to retrieve compact evidence spans, optionally fused with BM25 for exact lexical matching. Under a unified LongBench evaluation protocol with fixed prompting, decoding, and matched token budgets, S3-Hybrid closely matches full-context inference across multiple model families and improves robustness in several information-dense settings. We also report an engineering limitation of the current prototype, which incurs higher wall-clock latency than optimized full-KV baselines, motivating future kernel-level optimization.

### Predictor-Free and Hardware-Aware Federated Neural Architecture Search via Pareto-Guided Supernet Training
**Authors**: Bostan Khan, Masoud Daneshtalab

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T13:58:23Z

**Summary**: Federated Neural Architecture Search (FedNAS) aims to automate model design for privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) but currently faces two critical bottlenecks: unguided supernet training that yields suboptimal models, and costly multi-hour pipelines for post-training subnet discovery. We introduce DeepFedNAS, a novel, two-phase framework underpinned by a multi-objective fitness function that synthesizes mathematical network design with architectural heuristics. Enabled by a re-engineered supernet, DeepFedNAS introduces Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training, which leverages a pre-computed Pareto-optimal cache of high-fitness architectures as an intelligent curriculum to optimize shared supernet weights. Subsequently, its Predictor-Free Search Method eliminates the need for costly accuracy surrogates by utilizing this fitness function as a direct, zero-cost proxy for accuracy, enabling on-demand subnet discovery in mere seconds. DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., up to 1.21% absolute improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter and communication efficiency, and a substantial ~61x speedup in total post-training search pipeline time. By reducing the pipeline from over 20 hours to approximately 20 minutes (including initial cache generation) and enabling 20-second individual subnet searches, DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical. The complete source code and experimental scripts are available at: https://github.com/bostankhan6/DeepFedNAS

### MVAR: Visual Autoregressive Modeling with Scale and Spatial Markovian Conditioning
**Authors**: Jinhua Zhang, Wei Long, Minghao Han, Weiyi You, Shuhang Gu

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T13:38:40Z

**Summary**: Essential to visual generation is efficient modeling of visual data priors. Conventional next-token prediction methods define the process as learning the conditional probability distribution of successive tokens. Recently, next-scale prediction methods redefine the process to learn the distribution over multi-scale representations, significantly reducing generation latency. However, these methods condition each scale on all previous scales and require each token to consider all preceding tokens, exhibiting scale and spatial redundancy. To better model the distribution by mitigating redundancy, we propose Markovian Visual AutoRegressive modeling (MVAR), a novel autoregressive framework that introduces scale and spatial Markov assumptions to reduce the complexity of conditional probability modeling. Specifically, we introduce a scale-Markov trajectory that only takes as input the features of adjacent preceding scale for next-scale prediction, enabling the adoption of a parallel training strategy that significantly reduces GPU memory consumption. Furthermore, we propose spatial-Markov attention, which restricts the attention of each token to a localized neighborhood of size k at corresponding positions on adjacent scales, rather than attending to every token across these scales, for the pursuit of reduced modeling complexity. Building on these improvements, we reduce the computational complexity of attention calculation from O(N^2) to O(Nk), enabling training with just eight NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs and eliminating the need for KV cache during inference. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that MVAR achieves comparable or superior performance with both small model trained from scratch and large fine-tuned models, while reducing the average GPU memory footprint by 3.0x.

### MeCo: Enhancing LLM-Empowered Multi-Robot Collaboration via Similar Task Memoization
**Authors**: Baiqing Wang, Helei Cui, Bo Zhang, Xiaolong Zheng, Bin Guo, Zhiwen Yu

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T13:15:58Z

**Summary**: Multi-robot systems have been widely deployed in real-world applications, providing significant improvements in efficiency and reductions in labor costs. However, most existing multi-robot collaboration methods rely on extensive task-specific training, which limits their adaptability to new or diverse scenarios. Recent research leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enable more flexible collaboration without specialized training. Yet, current LLM-empowered approaches remain inefficient: when confronted with identical or similar tasks, they must replan from scratch because they omit task-level similarities. To address this limitation, we propose MeCo, a similarity-aware multi-robot collaboration framework that applies the principle of ``cache and reuse'' (a.k.a., memoization) to reduce redundant computation. Unlike simple task repetition, identifying and reusing solutions for similar but not identical tasks is far more challenging, particularly in multi-robot settings. To this end, MeCo introduces a new similarity testing method that retrieves previously solved tasks with high relevance, enabling effective plan reuse without re-invoking LLMs. Furthermore, we present MeCoBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate performance on similar-task collaboration scenarios. Experimental results show that MeCo substantially reduces planning costs and improves success rates compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

### Context Tokens are Anchors: Understanding the Repetition Curse in dMLLMs from an Information Flow Perspective
**Authors**: Qiyan Zhao, Xiaofeng Zhang, Shuochen Chang, Qianyu Chen, Xiaosong Yuan, Xuhang Chen, Luoqi Liu, Jiajun Zhang, Xu-Yao Zhang, Da-Han Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T11:54:42Z

**Summary**: Recent diffusion-based Multimodal Large Language Models (dMLLMs) suffer from high inference latency and therefore rely on caching techniques to accelerate decoding. However, the application of cache mechanisms often introduces undesirable repetitive text generation, a phenomenon we term the \textbf{Repeat Curse}. To better investigate underlying mechanism behind this issue, we analyze repetition generation through the lens of information flow. Our work reveals three key findings: (1) context tokens aggregate semantic information as anchors and guide the final predictions; (2) as information propagates across layers, the entropy of context tokens converges in deeper layers, reflecting the model's growing prediction certainty; (3) Repetition is typically linked to disruptions in the information flow of context tokens and to the inability of their entropy to converge in deeper layers. Based on these insights, we present \textbf{CoTA}, a plug-and-play method for mitigating repetition. CoTA enhances the attention of context tokens to preserve intrinsic information flow patterns, while introducing a penalty term to the confidence score during decoding to avoid outputs driven by uncertain context tokens. With extensive experiments, CoTA demonstrates significant effectiveness in alleviating repetition and achieves consistent performance improvements on general tasks.

### Efficient Autoregressive Video Diffusion with Dummy Head
**Authors**: Hang Guo, Zhaoyang Jia, Jiahao Li, Bin Li, Yuanhao Cai, Jiangshan Wang, Yawei Li, Yan Lu

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T11:20:43Z

**Summary**: The autoregressive video diffusion model has recently gained considerable research interest due to its causal modeling and iterative denoising. In this work, we identify that the multi-head self-attention in these models under-utilizes historical frames: approximately 25% heads attend almost exclusively to the current frame, and discarding their KV caches incurs only minor performance degradation. Building upon this, we propose Dummy Forcing, a simple yet effective method to control context accessibility across different heads. Specifically, the proposed heterogeneous memory allocation reduces head-wise context redundancy, accompanied by dynamic head programming to adaptively classify head types. Moreover, we develop a context packing technique to achieve more aggressive cache compression. Without additional training, our Dummy Forcing delivers up to 2.0x speedup over the baseline, supporting video generation at 24.3 FPS with less than 0.5% quality drop. Project page is available at https://csguoh.github.io/project/DummyForcing/.

### Mixing Importance with Diversity: Joint Optimization for KV Cache Compression in Large Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Xuyang Liu, Xiyan Gui, Yuchao Zhang, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T10:49:58Z

**Summary**: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this, we propose MixKV, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. MixKV adapts to head-wise semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MixKV consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme compression (budget=64), MixKV improves baseline methods by an average of 5.1% across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves remarkable gains of 8.0% and 9.0% for SnapKV and AdaKV on GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency. Furthermore, MixKV extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable performance gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/xuyang-liu16/MixKV.

**Summary**: Cause-effect chains, as a widely used modeling method in real-time embedded systems, are extensively applied in various safety-critical domains. End-to-end latency, as a key real-time attribute of cause-effect chains, is crucial in many applications. But the analysis of end-to-end latency for cause-effect chains on multicore platforms with shared caches still presents an unresolved issue. Traditional methods typically assume that the worst-case execution time (WCET) of each task in the cause-effect chain is known. However, in the absence of scheduling information, these methods often assume that all shared cache accesses result in misses, leading to an overestimation of WCET and, consequently, affecting the accuracy of end-to-end latency. However, effectively integrating scheduling information into the WCET analysis process of the chains may introduce two challenges: first, how to leverage the structural characteristics of the chains to optimize shared cache analysis, and second, how to improve analysis accuracy while avoiding state space explosion.   To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end latency analysis framework designed for multi-chain systems on multicore platforms with shared caches. This framework extracts scheduling information and structural characteristics of cause-effect chains, constructing fine-grained and scalable inter-core memory access contexts at the basic block level for time-sensitive shared cache analysis. This results in more accurate WCET (TSC-WCET) estimates, which are then used to derive the end-to-end latency. Finally, we conduct experiments on dual-core and quad-core systems with various cache configurations, which show that under certain settings, the average maximum end-to-end latency of cause-effect chains is reduced by up to 34% and 26%.

### LLM-AutoDP: Automatic Data Processing via LLM Agents for Model Fine-tuning
**Authors**: Wei Huang, Anda Cheng, Yinggui Wang, Lei Wang, Tao Wei

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T08:37:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be fine-tuned on domain-specific data to enhance their performance in specialized fields. However, such data often contains numerous low-quality samples, necessitating effective data processing (DP). In practice, DP strategies are typically developed through iterative manual analysis and trial-and-error adjustment. These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data. To further accelerate strategy search, we introduce three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, which reduces data volume while maintaining distributional integrity; Processing Target Selection, which uses a binary classifier to identify low-quality samples for focused processing; Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism}, which minimizes redundant computations by reusing prior processing results. Results show that models trained on data processed by our framework achieve over 80% win rates against models trained on unprocessed data. Compared to AutoML baselines based on LLM agents, LLM-AutoDP achieves approximately a 65% win rate. Moreover, our acceleration techniques reduce the total searching time by up to 10 times, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.

**Authors**: Abdul Hasib, A. S. M. Ahsanul Sarkar Akib, Nihal Das Ankur, Anish Giri

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T08:32:07Z

**Summary**: The integration of physical security systems with environmental safety monitoring represents a critical advancement in smart infrastructure management. Traditional approaches maintain these systems as independent silos, creating operational inefficiencies, delayed emergency responses, and increased management complexity. This paper presents a comprehensive dual-modality Internet of Things framework that seamlessly integrates RFID-based access control with multi-sensor environmental safety monitoring through a unified cloud architecture. The system comprises two coordinated subsystems: Subsystem 1 implements RFID authentication with servo-actuated gate control and real-time Google Sheets logging, while Subsystem 2 provides comprehensive safety monitoring incorporating flame detection, water flow measurement, LCD status display, and personnel identification. Both subsystems utilize ESP32 microcontrollers for edge processing and wireless connectivity. Experimental evaluation over 45 days demonstrates exceptional performance metrics: 99.2\% RFID authentication accuracy with 0.82-second average response time, 98.5\% flame detection reliability within 5-meter range, and 99.8\% cloud data logging success rate. The system maintains operational integrity during network disruptions through intelligent local caching mechanisms and achieves total implementation cost of 5,400 BDT (approximately \$48), representing an 82\% reduction compared to commercial integrated solutions. This research establishes a practical framework for synergistic security-safety integration, demonstrating that professional-grade performance can be achieved through careful architectural design and component optimization while maintaining exceptional cost-effectiveness and accessibility for diverse application scenarios.

### Window-Diffusion: Accelerating Diffusion Language Model Inference with Windowed Token Pruning and Caching
**Authors**: Fengrui Zuo, Zhiwei Ke, Yiming Liu, Wenqi Lou, Chao Wang, Xvehai Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T07:49:20Z

**Summary**: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate text through iterative denoising, but inference requires full-sequence attention at every iteration, resulting in substantial redundant computation on masked tokens. Block-wise diffusion can reduce this cost, yet it typically relies on retraining and constrained update orders, limiting its direct applicability to pretrained DLMs. Our token-level analysis reveals pronounced structural locality in DLM inference. Decoding is driven by a small set of prefix-localized active tokens; the influence of distant undecoded context diminishes rapidly, and decoded tokens exhibit stage-wise temporal stability, enabling reuse of intermediate representations except for a brief post-decode transient. Motivated by these observations, we propose \textbf{\placeholder}\footnote{The source code is available at https://github.com/vhicrgit/Window-Diffusion.}, a window-based token pruning and caching method for inference. We maintain a local computation window that slides rightward as denoising progresses, and partition undecoded tokens into: (i) \textit{active tokens} that are computed online, (ii) \textit{buffer tokens} whose KV states are cached and periodically refreshed, and (iii) \textit{far-field tokens} that are pruned outside the window. Computation is restricted to active and buffer tokens within the window, while far-field tokens are omitted at each stage. Experiments on LLaDA and Dream show that, under matched compute budgets, our method achieves up to $99\times$ inference speedup while largely preserving generation performance.

### Beyond Speedup -- Utilizing KV Cache for Sampling and Reasoning
**Authors**: Zeyu Xing, Xing Li, Hui-Ling Zhen, Mingxuan Yuan, Sinno Jialin Pan

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T07:44:52Z

**Summary**: KV caches, typically used only to speed up autoregressive decoding, encode contextual information that can be reused for downstream tasks at no extra cost. We propose treating the KV cache as a lightweight representation, eliminating the need to recompute or store full hidden states. Despite being weaker than dedicated embeddings, KV-derived representations are shown to be sufficient for two key applications: \textbf{(i) Chain-of-Embedding}, where they achieve competitive or superior performance on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2-7B-Instruct; and \textbf{(ii) Fast/Slow Thinking Switching}, where they enable adaptive reasoning on Qwen3-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distil-Qwen-14B, reducing token generation by up to $5.7\times$ with minimal accuracy loss. Our findings establish KV caches as a free, effective substrate for sampling and reasoning, opening new directions for representation reuse in LLM inference.

### KV Admission: Learning What to Write for Efficient Long-Context Inference
**Authors**: Yen-Chieh Huang, Pi-Cheng Hsiu, Rui Fang, Ming-Syan Chen

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T07:38:12Z

**Summary**: Long-context LLM inference is bottlenecked by the quadratic attention complexity and linear KV cache growth. Prior approaches mitigate this via post-hoc selection or eviction but overlook the root inefficiency: indiscriminate writing to memory. In this paper, we formalize KV cache management as a causal system of three primitives: KV Admission, Selection, and Eviction. We instantiate KV Admission via Write-Gated KV (WG-KV), a lightweight mechanism that learns to predict token utility before cache entry. By filtering out low-utility states early to maintain a compact global cache alongside a sliding local cache, WG-KV reduces memory usage by 46-68% and delivers 3.03-3.70x prefill and 1.85-2.56x decode speedups on Llama and Qwen models, while maintaining compatibility with FlashAttention and Paged-KV systems. These results demonstrate that learning what to write is a principled and practical recipe for efficient long-context inference. Code is available at https://github.com/EMCLab-Sinica/WG-KV.

### SuperInfer: SLO-Aware Rotary Scheduling and Memory Management for LLM Inference on Superchips
**Authors**: Jiahuan Yu, Mingtao Hu, Zichao Lin, Minjia Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T07:01:46Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) serving faces a fundamental tension between stringent latency Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and limited GPU memory capacity. When high request rates exhaust the KV cache budget, existing LLM inference systems often suffer severe head-of-line (HOL) blocking. While prior work explored PCIe-based offloading, these approaches cannot sustain responsiveness under high request rates, often failing to meet tight Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) SLOs. We present SuperInfer, a high-performance LLM inference system designed for emerging Superchips (e.g., NVIDIA GH200) with tightly coupled GPU-CPU architecture via NVLink-C2C. SuperInfer introduces RotaSched, the first proactive, SLO-aware rotary scheduler that rotates requests to maintain responsiveness on Superchips, and DuplexKV, an optimized rotation engine that enables full-duplex transfer over NVLink-C2C. Evaluations on GH200 using various models and datasets show that SuperInfer improves TTFT SLO attainment rates by up to 74.7% while maintaining comparable TBT and throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems, demonstrating that SLO-aware scheduling and memory co-design unlocks the full potential of Superchips for responsive LLM serving.

### PocketGS: On-Device Training of 3D Gaussian Splatting for High Perceptual Modeling
**Authors**: Wenzhi Guo, Guangchi Fang, Shu Yang, Bing Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T05:29:37Z

**Summary**: Efficient and high-fidelity 3D scene modeling is a long-standing pursuit in computer graphics. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods achieve impressive real-time modeling performance, they rely on resource-unconstrained training assumptions that fail on mobile devices, which are limited by minute-scale training budgets and hardware-available peak-memory. We present PocketGS, a mobile scene modeling paradigm that enables on-device 3DGS training under these tightly coupled constraints while preserving high perceptual fidelity. Our method resolves the fundamental contradictions of standard 3DGS through three co-designed operators: G builds geometry-faithful point-cloud priors; I injects local surface statistics to seed anisotropic Gaussians, thereby reducing early conditioning gaps; and T unrolls alpha compositing with cached intermediates and index-mapped gradient scattering for stable mobile backpropagation. Collectively, these operators satisfy the competing requirements of training efficiency, memory compactness, and modeling fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PocketGS is able to outperform the powerful mainstream workstation 3DGS baseline to deliver high-quality reconstructions, enabling a fully on-device, practical capture-to-rendering workflow.

### The Geometric Reasoner: Manifold-Informed Latent Foresight Search for Long-Context Reasoning
**Authors**: Ren Zhuang, Ben Wang, Shuifa Sun

**Updated**: 2026-01-28T03:14:37Z

**Summary**: Scaling test-time compute enhances long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off between computational cost and coverage quality: either incurring high training expense or yielding redundant trajectories. We introduce The Geometric Reasoner (TGR), a training-free framework that performs manifold-informed latent foresight search under strict memory bounds. At each chunk boundary, TGR scores candidate latent anchors via a lightweight look-ahead estimate combined with soft geometric regularizers that encourage smooth trajectories and diverse exploration. Chunk-wise KV cache resets keep memory linear in chunk length. On challenging math and code benchmarks, TGR improves robust trajectory coverage, measured by the area under the Pass@$k$ curve (AUC), by up to 13 points on Qwen3-8B, with negligible overhead of about 1.1--1.3 times.

**Authors**: Jucheng Shen, Gaurav Sarkar, Yeonju Ro, Sharath Nittur Sridhar, Zhangyang Wang, Aditya Akella, Souvik Kundu

**Updated**: 2026-01-27T22:50:35Z

**Summary**: We present CadLLM, a training-free method to accelerate the inference throughput of diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs). We first investigate the dynamic nature of token unmasking confidence across blocks and steps. Based on this observation, we present a lightweight adaptive approach that controls the generation block size, step size, and threshold based on the average confidence of unmasked tokens. We further reduce softmax overhead by dynamically leveraging a subset of the vocabulary to regulate sampling breadth. CadLLM is a plug-and-play, model-agnostic method compatible with KV-cache-based dLLMs. Extensive experiments on four popular tasks demonstrate that CadLLM yields up to 2.28x throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline with competitive accuracy.

### Delta Fair Sharing: Performance Isolation for Multi-Tenant Storage Systems
**Authors**: Tyler Griggs, Soujanya Ponnapalli, Dev Bali, Wenjie Ma, James DeLoye, Audrey Cheng, Jaewan Hong, Natacha Crooks, Scott Shenker, Ion Stoica, Matei Zaharia

**Updated**: 2026-01-27T20:06:42Z

**Summary**: Modern storage systems, often deployed to support multiple tenants in the cloud, must provide performance isolation. Unfortunately, traditional approaches such as fair sharing do not provide performance isolation for storage systems, because their resources (e.g., write buffers and read caches) exhibit high preemption delays. These delays lead to unacceptable spikes in client tail latencies, as clients may be forced to wait arbitrarily long to receive their fair share of resources.   We introduce Delta Fair Sharing, a family of algorithms for sharing resources with high preemption delays. These algorithms satisfy two key properties: $δ$-fairness, which bounds a client's delay in receiving its fair share of resources to $δ$ time units, and $δ$-Pareto-efficiency, which allocates unused resources to clients with unmet demand. Together, these properties capture resource-acquisition delays end-to-end, bound well-behaved clients' tail-latency spikes to $δ$ time units, and ensure high utilization. We implement such algorithms in FAIRDB, an extension of RocksDB. Our evaluation shows that FAIRDB isolates well-behaved clients from high-demand workloads better than state-of-the-art alternatives.

### Explicit Multi-head Attention for Inter-head Interaction in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Runyu Peng, Yunhua Zhou, Demin Song, Kai Lv, Bo Wang, Qipeng Guo, Xipeng Qiu

**Updated**: 2026-01-27T13:45:03Z

**Summary**: In large language models built upon the Transformer architecture, recent studies have shown that inter-head interaction can enhance attention performance. Motivated by this, we propose Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA), a simple yet effective attention variant that explicitly models cross-head interaction. MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank "virtual heads". This enables a practical key-value cache compression strategy that reduces KV-cache memory usage by 50% with negligible performance loss on knowledge-intensive and scientific reasoning tasks, and only a 3.59% accuracy drop for Olympiad-level mathematical benchmarks.

### Optimizing FaaS Platforms for MCP-enabled Agentic Workflows
**Authors**: Varad Kulkarni, Vaibhav Jha, Nikhil Reddy, Anand Eswaran, Praveen Jayachandran, Yogesh Simmhan

**Updated**: 2026-01-27T10:56:16Z

**Summary**: Agentic workflows that use autonomous AI Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers is rapidly rising. This introduces challenges in scalable cloud deployment and state management. Traditional hosting on Virtual Machines (VMs) is resource-intensive and lacks elasticity. Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms offer modularity, autoscaling and cost efficiency but are inherently stateless. In this paper, we present the FAME, a FaaS-based architecture for orchestrating MCP-enabled agentic workflows. FAME decomposes agentic patterns such as ReAct into composable agents: Planner, Actor and Evaluator, that are each a FaaS function built using LangGraph and are orchestrated as a FaaS workflow. This enables modular composition as AWS Step Functions and avoids function timeouts seen for monolithic agentic workflows. To address context persistence across user requests in a conversation, FAME automates agent memory persistence and injection using DynamoDB. It also optimizes MCP server deployment through AWS Lambda wrappers, caches tool outputs in S3 and proposes function fusion strategies. We evaluate FAME on two representative applications, on research paper summarization and log analytics, under diverse memory and caching configurations. Results show up to 13x latency reduction, 88% fewer input tokens and 66% in cost savings, along with improved workflow completion rates. This demonstrates the viability of serverless platforms for hosting complex, multi-agent AI workflows at scale.

### RPO:Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization

**Updated**: 2026-01-27T09:38:32Z

**Summary**: Within the domain of large language models, reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms necessitate the generation of a complete reasoning trajectory beginning from the input query, which incurs significant computational overhead during the rollout phase of training. To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/yhz5613813/RPO.

### MeanCache: From Instantaneous to Average Velocity for Accelerating Flow Matching Inference
**Authors**: Huanlin Gao, Ping Chen, Fuyuan Shi, Ruijia Wu, Li YanTao, Qiang Hui, Yuren You, Ting Lu, Chao Tan, Shaoan Zhao, Zhaoxiang Liu, Fang Zhao, Kai Wang, Shiguo Lian

**Updated**: 2026-01-27T08:35:50Z

**Summary**: We present MeanCache, a training-free caching framework for efficient Flow Matching inference. Existing caching methods reduce redundant computation but typically rely on instantaneous velocity information (e.g., feature caching), which often leads to severe trajectory deviations and error accumulation under high acceleration ratios. MeanCache introduces an average-velocity perspective: by leveraging cached Jacobian--vector products (JVP) to construct interval average velocities from instantaneous velocities, it effectively mitigates local error accumulation. To further improve cache timing and JVP reuse stability, we develop a trajectory-stability scheduling strategy as a practical tool, employing a Peak-Suppressed Shortest Path under budget constraints to determine the schedule. Experiments on FLUX.1, Qwen-Image, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that MeanCache achieves 4.12X and 4.56X and 3.59X acceleration, respectively, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art caching baselines in generation quality. We believe this simple yet effective approach provides a new perspective for Flow Matching inference and will inspire further exploration of stability-driven acceleration in commercial-scale generative models.

### Token Caching for Diffusion Transformer Acceleration
**Authors**: Jinming Lou, Wenyang Luo, Yufan Liu, Bing Li, Xinmiao Ding, Weiming Hu, Yuming Li, Chenguang Ma

**Updated**: 2026-01-27T08:13:13Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have gained substantial interest in diffusion generative modeling due to their outstanding performance. However, their computational demands, particularly the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms and multi-step inference processes, present substantial bottlenecks that limit their practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose TokenCache, a novel acceleration method that leverages the token-based multi-block architecture of transformers to reduce redundant computations. TokenCache tackles three critical questions: (1) Which tokens should be pruned and reused by the caching mechanism to eliminate redundancy? (2) Which blocks should be targeted for efficient caching? (3) At which time steps should caching be applied to balance speed and quality? In response to these challenges, TokenCache introduces a Cache Predictor that hierarchically addresses these issues by (1) Token pruning: assigning importance scores to each token to determine which tokens to prune and reuse; (2) Block selection: allocating pruning ratio to each block to adaptively select blocks for caching; (3) Temporal Scheduling: deciding at which time steps to apply caching strategies. Experimental results across various models demonstrate that TokenCache achieves an effective trade-off between generation quality and inference speed for diffusion transformers.

### PIM-malloc: A Fast and Scalable Dynamic Memory Allocator for Processing-In-Memory (PIM) Architectures
**Authors**: Dongjae Lee, Bongjoon Hyun, Youngjin Kwon, Minsoo Rhu

**Updated**: 2026-01-27T07:10:00Z

**Summary**: The ability to dynamically allocate memory is fundamental in modern programming languages. However, this feature is not adequately supported in current general-purpose PIM devices. To identify key design principles that PIM must consider, we conduct a design space exploration of PIM memory allocators, examining various strategies for metadata placement and management of the allocator. Based on this exploration, we introduce PIM-malloc, a fast and scalable memory allocator for general-purpose PIM that operates on real PIM hardware, achieving a x66 improvement in memory allocation performance. This design is further enhanced with a lightweight, per-PIM core hardware cache, specifically designed for dynamic memory allocation, achieving an additional 31% performance improvement. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of PIM-malloc by developing several representative PIM workloads, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing programmability.

### Reconstructing KV Caches with Cross-layer Fusion For Enhanced Transformers
**Authors**: Hongzhan Lin, Zhiqi Bai, Xinmiao Zhang, Sen Yang, Xiang Li, Siran Yang, Yunlong Xu, Jiaheng Liu, Yongchi Zhao, Jiamang Wang, Yuchi Xu, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng

**Updated**: 2026-01-27T07:00:22Z

**Summary**: Transformer decoders have achieved strong results across tasks, but the memory required for the KV cache becomes prohibitive at long sequence lengths. Although Cross-layer KV Cache sharing (e.g., YOCO, CLA) offers a path to mitigate KV Cache bottleneck, it typically underperforms within-layer methods like GQA. To understand the root cause, we investigate the information flow of keys and values of the top-layers. Our preliminary reveals a clear distribution: values are predominantly derived from the bottom layer, while keys draw more information from both bottom and middle layers. Building upon this, we propose FusedKV, whose top-layer KV caches are a learnable fusion of the most informative ones from the bottom and middle layers. This fusion operates directly on post-RoPE keys, preserving relative positional information without the computational cost of re-applying rotary embeddings. To further improve efficiency, we propose FusedKV-Lite, an cross-layer sharing approach, where top-layer KV caches are directly derived from the bottom-layer values and the middle-layer keys. Compared to FusedKV, FusedKV-Lite reduces I/O overhead at the cost of a slight increase in perplexity. In experiments on LLMs ranging from 332M to 4B parameters, our proposed method reduce 50\% cache memory while achieving lower validation perplexity than the standard Transformer decoder, establishing it as a memory-efficient, high-performance architectural alternative.

### CollectiveKV: Decoupling and Sharing Collaborative Information in Sequential Recommendation
**Authors**: Jingyu Li, Zhaocheng Du, Qianhui Zhu, kaiyuan Li, Zhicheng Zhang, Song-Li Wu, Chaolang Li, Pengwen Dai

**Updated**: 2026-01-27T04:22:42Z

**Summary**: Sequential recommendation models are widely used in applications, yet they face stringent latency requirements. Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV. Experiments on five sequential recommendation models and three datasets show that our method can compress the KV cache to only 0.8% of its original size, while maintaining or even enhancing model performance.

### KUBEDIRECT: Unleashing the Full Power of the Cluster Manager for Serverless Computing
**Authors**: Sheng Qi, Zhiquan Zhang, Xuanzhe Liu, Xin Jin

**Updated**: 2026-01-27T03:47:16Z

**Summary**: FaaS platforms rely on cluster managers like Kubernetes for resource management. Kubernetes is popular due to its state-centric APIs that decouple the control plane into modular controllers. However, to scale out a burst of FaaS instances, message passing becomes the primary bottleneck as controllers have to exchange extensive state through the API Server. Existing solutions opt for a clean-slate redesign of cluster managers, but at the expense of compatibility with existing ecosystem and substantial engineering effort.   We present KUBEDIRECT, a Kubernetes-based cluster manager for FaaS. We find that there exists a common narrow waist across FaaS platform that allows us to achieve both efficiency and external compatibility. Our insight is that the sequential structure of the narrow waist obviates the need for a single source of truth, allowing us to bypass the API Server and perform direct message passing for efficiency. However, our approach introduces a set of ephemeral states across controllers, making it challenging to enforce end-to-end semantics due to the absence of centralized coordination. KUBEDIRECT employs a novel state management scheme that leverages the narrow waist as a hierarchical write-back cache, ensuring consistency and convergence to the desired state. KUBEDIRECT can seamlessly integrate with Kubernetes, adding ~150 LoC per controller. Experiments show that KUBEDIRECT reduces serving latency by 26.7x over Knative, and has similar performance as the state-of-the-art clean-slate platform Dirigent.

### The Promise and Reality of Continuous Integration Caching: An Empirical Study of Travis CI Builds
**Authors**: Taher A. Ghaleb, Daniel Alencar da Costa, Ying Zou

**Updated**: 2026-01-27T03:23:19Z

**Summary**: Continuous Integration (CI) provides early feedback by automatically building software, but long build durations can hinder developer productivity. CI services offer caching mechanisms to speed up builds by reusing infrequently changing artifacts, yet little is known about how caching is adopted in practice and what challenges it entails. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of CI caching in Travis CI, analyzing 513,384 builds from 1,279 GitHub projects. We find that only 30% of projects adopt CI caching, and early adoption is strongly associated with project maturity, such as more dependencies, more commits, and longer CI lifespans. To understand why many projects do not adopt caching, we submitted pull requests enabling caching in non-adopting projects, and nearly half were accepted or merged. Developer feedback suggests that non- or late adoption mainly stems from limited awareness of CI caching support. We also examine cache maintenance and identify five common activities, performed by 24% of cache-enabled projects. Although one-third of projects see substantial build-time reductions, cache uploads occur in 97% of builds, and 33% of projects contain stale cached artifacts. Finally, our analysis of reported caching issues shows developers mainly struggle with corrupted or outdated caches or request broader caching features. Overall, CI caching does not help all projects, needs ongoing maintenance, and is more complex in practice than many developers expect.

### The Stateless Pattern: Ephemeral Coordination as the Third Pillar of Digital Sovereignty
**Authors**: Sean Carlin, Kevin Curran

**Updated**: 2026-01-27T03:21:33Z

**Summary**: For the past three decades, the architecture of the internet has rested on two primary pillars - communication on the World Wide Web and Value such as Bitcoin/Distributed ledgers. However, a third critical pillar, Private Coordination has remained dependent on centralised intermediaries, effectively creating a surveillance architecture by default. This paper introduces the 'Stateless Pattern', a novel network topology that replaces the traditional 'Fortress' security model (database-centric) with a 'Mist' model (ephemeral relays). By utilising client-side cryptography and self-destructing server instances, we demonstrate a protocol where the server acts as a blind medium rather than a custodian of state. We present empirical data from a live deployment (https://signingroom.io), analysing over 1,900 requests and cache-hit ratios to validate the system's 'Zero-Knowledge' properties and institutional utility. The findings suggest that digital privacy can be commoditised as a utility, technically enforcing specific articles of the universal declaration of human rights not through policy, but through physics.

### Streaming-dLLM: Accelerating Diffusion LLMs via Suffix Pruning and Dynamic Decoding
**Authors**: Zhongyu Xiao, Zhiwei Hao, Jianyuan Guo, Yong Luo, Jia Liu, Jie Xu, Han Hu

**Updated**: 2026-01-27T03:21:28Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer a compelling paradigm for natural language generation, leveraging parallel decoding and bidirectional attention to achieve superior global coherence compared to autoregressive models. While recent works have accelerated inference via KV cache reuse or heuristic decoding, they overlook the intrinsic inefficiencies within the block-wise diffusion process. Specifically, they suffer from spatial redundancy by modeling informative-sparse suffix regions uniformly and temporal inefficiency by applying fixed denoising schedules across all the decoding process. To address this, we propose Streaming-dLLM, a training-free framework that streamlines inference across both spatial and temporal dimensions. Spatially, we introduce attenuation guided suffix modeling to approximate the full context by pruning redundant mask tokens. Temporally, we employ a dynamic confidence aware strategy with an early exit mechanism, allowing the model to skip unnecessary iterations for converged tokens. Extensive experiments show that Streaming-dLLM achieves up to 68.2X speedup while maintaining generation quality, highlighting its effectiveness in diffusion decoding. The code is available at https://github.com/xiaoshideta/Streaming-dLLM.

### EPAS: Efficient Training with Progressive Activation Sharing
**Authors**: Rezaul Karim, Maryam Dialameh, Yang Liu, Boxing Chen, Walid Ahmed

**Updated**: 2026-01-27T01:51:08Z

**Summary**: We present a novel method for Efficient training with Progressive Activation Sharing (EPAS). This method bridges progressive training paradigm with the phenomenon of redundant QK (or KV ) activations across deeper layers of transformers. EPAS gradually grows a sharing region during training by switching decoder layers to activation sharing mode. This results in throughput increase due to reduced compute. To utilize deeper layer redundancy, the sharing region starts from the deep end of the model and grows towards the shallow end. The EPAS trained models allow for variable region lengths of activation sharing for different compute budgets during inference. Empirical evaluations with QK activation sharing in LLaMA models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters show up to an 11.1% improvement in training throughput and up to a 29% improvement in inference throughput while maintaining similar loss curve to the baseline models. Furthermore, applying EPAS in continual pretraining to transform TinyLLaMA into an attention-sharing model yields up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing the significance of progressive training in cross layer activation sharing models.

### Diversity-Augmented Negative Sampling for Implicit Collaborative Filtering
**Authors**: Yueqing Xuan, Kacper Sokol, Mark Sanderson, Jeffrey Chan

**Updated**: 2026-01-27T00:38:16Z

**Summary**: Recommenders built upon implicit collaborative filtering are typically trained to distinguish between users' positive and negative preferences. When direct observations of the latter are unavailable, negative training data are constructed with sampling techniques. But since items often exhibit clustering in the latent space, existing methods tend to oversample negatives from dense regions, resulting in homogeneous training data and limited model expressiveness. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel negative sampler with diversity guarantees. To achieve them, our approach first pairs each positive item of a user with one that they have not yet interacted with; this instance, called hard negative, is chosen as the top-scoring item according to the model. Instead of discarding the remaining highly informative items, we store them in a user-specific cache. Next, our diversity-augmented sampler selects a representative subset of negatives from the cache, ensuring its dissimilarity from the corresponding user's hard negatives. Our generator then combines these items with the hard negatives, replacing them to produce more effective (synthetic) negative training data that are informative and diverse. Experiments show that our method consistently leads to superior recommendation quality without sacrificing computational efficiency.

### Agentic Plan Caching: Test-Time Memory for Fast and Cost-Efficient LLM Agents
**Authors**: Qizheng Zhang, Michael Wornow, Gerry Wan, Kunle Olukotun

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T22:37:12Z

**Summary**: LLM-based agent applications have shown increasingly remarkable capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs and latency due to extensive planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots, are insufficient for agent applications where outputs depend on external data and environmental contexts. We propose Agentic Plan Caching (APC), a novel test-time memory that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from planning stages of agent applications across semantically similar tasks to reduce the cost and latency of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agent applications shows that our system can reduce costs by 50.31% and latency by 27.28% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

### Randomization Boosts KV Caching, Learning Balances Query Load: A Joint Perspective
**Authors**: Fangzhou Wu, Sandeep Silwal, Qiuyi, Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T22:20:59Z

**Summary**: KV caching is a fundamental technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference by reusing key-value (KV) pairs from previous queries, but its effectiveness under limited memory is highly sensitive to the eviction policy. The default Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction algorithm struggles with dynamic online query arrivals, especially in multi-LLM serving scenarios, where balancing query load across workers and maximizing cache hit rate of each worker are inherently conflicting objectives. We give the first unified mathematical model that captures the core trade-offs between KV cache eviction and query routing. Our analysis reveals the theoretical limitations of existing methods and leads to principled algorithms that integrate provably competitive randomized KV cache eviction with learning-based methods to adaptively route queries with evolving patterns, thus balancing query load and cache hit rate. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive experiments across 4 benchmarks and 3 prefix-sharing settings, demonstrating improvements of up to 6.92$\times$ in cache hit rate, 11.96$\times$ reduction in latency, 14.06$\times$ reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT), and 77.4% increase in throughput over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/fzwark/KVRouting.

### GaNI: Global and Near Field Illumination Aware Neural Inverse Rendering
**Authors**: Jiaye Wu, Saeed Hadadan, Geng Lin, Matthias Zwicker, David Jacobs, Roni Sengupta

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T22:00:11Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present GaNI, a Global and Near-field Illumination-aware neural inverse rendering technique that can reconstruct geometry, albedo, and roughness parameters from images of a scene captured with co-located light and camera. Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera focus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and near-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We introduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct the geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse neural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo and roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple technical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that NeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections from the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of near-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle specular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant illumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during capture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and additional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method outperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering techniques. Our approach produces significantly better reflectance and slightly better geometry than capture strategies that do not require a dark room.

### HiCache: A Plug-in Scaled-Hermite Upgrade for Taylor-Style Cache-then-Forecast Diffusion Acceleration
**Authors**: Liang Feng, Shikang Zheng, Jiacheng Liu, Yuqi Lin, Qinming Zhou, Peiliang Cai, Xinyu Wang, Junjie Chen, Chang Zou, Yue Ma, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T18:39:41Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but often incur prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. Recent feature caching methods accelerate inference via temporal extrapolation, yet can suffer quality degradation from inaccurate modeling of the complex dynamics of feature evolution. We propose HiCache (Hermite Polynomial-based Feature Cache), a training-free acceleration framework that improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature-derivative approximations in diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials as a potentially optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. We further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability while preserving predictive accuracy, and is also effective when applied standalone or integrated with TaylorSeer. Extensive experiments demonstrate HiCache's superiority, achieving 5.55x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while matching or exceeding baseline quality, and maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video generation, and super-resolution tasks. Moreover, HiCache can be naturally added to previous caching methods to enhance their performance, e.g., improving ClusCa from 0.9480 to 0.9840 in terms of image rewards.

### HERMES: KV Cache as Hierarchical Memory for Efficient Streaming Video Understanding
**Authors**: Haowei Zhang, Shudong Yang, Jinlan Fu, See-Kiong Ng, Xipeng Qiu

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:57:42Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant improvement in offline video understanding. However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.

### AGSP-DSA: An Adaptive Graph Signal Processing Framework for Robust Multimodal Fusion with Dynamic Semantic Alignment
**Authors**: KV Karthikeya, Ashok Kumar Das, Shantanu Pal, Vivekananda Bhat K, Arun Sekar Rajasekaran

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T15:35:03Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce an Adaptive Graph Signal Processing with Dynamic Semantic Alignment (AGSP DSA) framework to perform robust multimodal data fusion over heterogeneous sources, including text, audio, and images. The requested approach uses a dual-graph construction to learn both intra-modal and inter-modal relations, spectral graph filtering to boost the informative signals, and effective node embedding with Multi-scale Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Semantic aware attention mechanism: each modality may dynamically contribute to the context with respect to contextual relevance. The experimental outcomes on three benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSEI, AVE, and MM-IMDB, show that AGSP-DSA performs as the state of the art. More precisely, it achieves 95.3% accuracy, 0.936 F1-score, and 0.924 mAP on CMU-MOSEI, improving MM-GNN by 2.6 percent in accuracy. It gets 93.4% accuracy and 0.911 F1-score on AVE and 91.8% accuracy and 0.886 F1-score on MM-IMDB, which demonstrate good generalization and robustness in the missing modality setting. These findings verify the efficiency of AGSP-DSA in promoting multimodal learning in sentiment analysis, event recognition and multimedia classification.

### Exploring Fine-Tuning for In-Context Retrieval and Efficient KV-Caching in Long-Context Language Models
**Authors**: Francesco Maria Molfese, Momchil Hardalov, Rexhina Blloshmi, Bill Byrne, Adrià de Gispert

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T14:37:02Z

**Summary**: With context windows of millions of tokens, Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can encode entire document collections, offering a strong alternative to conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, it remains unclear whether fine-tuning strategies can improve long-context performance and translate to greater robustness under KV-cache compression techniques. In this work, we investigate which training strategies most effectively enhance LCLMs' ability to identify and use relevant information, as well as enhancing their robustness under KV-cache compression. Our experiments show substantial in-domain improvements, achieving gains of up to +20 points over the base model. However, out-of-domain generalization remains task dependent with large variance -- LCLMs excels on finance questions (+9 points), while RAG shows stronger performance on multiple-choice questions (+6 points) over the baseline models. Finally, we show that our fine-tuning approaches bring moderate improvements in robustness under KV-cache compression, with gains varying across tasks.

### Shift Parallelism: Low-Latency, High-Throughput LLM Inference for Dynamic Workloads
**Authors**: Mert Hidayetoglu, Aurick Qiao, Michael Wyatt, Jeff Rasley, Yuxiong He, Samyam Rajbhandari

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T12:31:58Z

**Summary**: Efficient parallelism is necessary for achieving low-latency, high-throughput inference with large language models (LLMs). Tensor parallelism (TP) is the state-of-the-art method for reducing LLM response latency, however GPU communications reduces combined token throughput. On the other hand, data parallelism (DP) obtains a higher throughput yet is slow in response latency. Best of both worlds does not exist, and it is not possible to combine TP and DP because of the KV cache variance across the parallelisms.   We notice Sequence Parallelism (SP - Ulysses in training) has similar properties as DP but with KV cache invariance. We adapt SP to inference, and combine it with TP to get the best of both worlds. Our solution: Shift Parallelism.   Shift Parallelism dynamically switches across TP and SP, and minimizes latency in low traffic without losing throughput in high traffic. The efficient GPU communications of Shift Parallelism yields up to i) 1.51x faster response in interactive workloads and ii) 50% higher throughput in batch workloads, compared to a TP-only solution.   We evaluate Shift Parallelism with real-world production traces with dynamic traffic patterns as well as synthetic benchmarking patterns across models, context sizes, and arrival rates. All results affirm the same: Shift Parallelism has a better the latency vs. throughput tradeoff than TP or DP, and hence obtains low latency without degrading throughput in dynamic workloads.

### Dynamic Thinking-Token Selection for Efficient Reasoning in Large Reasoning Models
**Authors**: Zhenyuan Guo, Tong Chen, Wenlong Meng, Chen Gong, Xin Yu, Chengkun Wei, Wenzhi Chen

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T11:31:40Z

**Summary**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at solving complex problems by explicitly generating a reasoning trace before deriving the final answer. However, these extended generations incur substantial memory footprint and computational overhead, bottlenecking LRMs' efficiency. This work uses attention maps to analyze the influence of reasoning traces and uncover an interesting phenomenon: only some decision-critical tokens in a reasoning trace steer the model toward the final answer, while the remaining tokens contribute negligibly. Building on this observation, we propose Dynamic Thinking-Token Selection (DynTS). This method identifies decision-critical tokens and retains only their associated Key-Value (KV) cache states during inference, evicting the remaining redundant entries to optimize efficiency.

### RASTP: Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning for Generative Recommendation with Semantic Identifiers
**Authors**: Tianyu Zhan, Kairui Fu, Zheqi Lv, Shengyu Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T06:37:34Z

**Summary**: Generative recommendation systems typically leverage Semantic Identifiers (SIDs), which represent each item as a sequence of tokens that encode semantic information. However, representing item ID with multiple SIDs significantly increases input sequence length, which is a major determinant of computational complexity and memory consumption. While existing efforts primarily focus on optimizing attention computation and KV cache, we propose RASTP (Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning), which directly prunes less informative tokens in the input sequence. Specifically, RASTP evaluates token importance by combining semantic saliency, measured via representation magnitude, and attention centrality, derived from cumulative attention weights. Since RASTP dynamically prunes low-information or irrelevant semantic tokens, experiments on three real-world Amazon datasets show that RASTP reduces training time by 26.7\%, while maintaining or slightly improving recommendation performance. The code has been open-sourced at https://github.com/Yuzt-zju/RASTP.

### Sequential Operating Simulation of Solid State Transformer-Driven Next-Generation 800 VDC Data Center
**Authors**: Jian Xu, Xinxiong Jiang, Yi Bao, Yuchen Zheng, Xuhui Chen, Qiang Xu, Siyang Liao, Deping Ke, Xiaoqi Gao

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T05:27:01Z

**Summary**: Artificial-intelligence (AI) workloads are driving rapid growth in data-center electricity use and rack power density, increasing demand for power-delivery systems that are efficient and robust to fast load transients. Conventional uninterruptible power supply (UPS) based AC distribution chains involve multiple conversion stages and line-frequency transformers, which compound losses and are less compatible with dynamic AI power profiles. Although solid-state transformers (SSTs) and 800 VDC distribution architecture are widely discussed, implementable topology/control details, and long-horizon validation with realistic operating profiles remain limited. This paper develops an SST-driven 800 VDC architecture that converts 10 kV MVAC to an 800V LVDC bus using a three-phase H-bridge AC/DC stage cascaded with a dual-active-bridge (DAB) DC/DC stage. A coordinated closed-loop control scheme, combining rectifier voltage/current regulation and DAB phase-shift control, is designed to maintain DC-bus voltage stability. The proposed system is implemented on the real-time digital simulation (RTDS) platform and evaluated via sequential simulations using real-world day- and month-scale operating profiles of data centers, benchmarked against a UPS supply chain. Numerical studies demonstrate tight 800 VDC regulation, reduced input-side energy consumption compared with the UPS baseline, and satisfactory power-quality performance. A capacitance sensitivity test quantifies tradeoffs between DC-bus ripple and low-frequency input-power oscillations, yielding a practical capacitance range for design. Overall, the work provides a reproducible evaluation workflow and actionable guidance for next-generation AI data centers.

### FP8-RL: A Practical and Stable Low-Precision Stack for LLM Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Zhaopeng Qiu, Shuang Yu, Jingqi Zhang, Shuai Zhang, Xue Huang, Jingyi Yang, Junjie Lai

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T05:12:05Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly bottlenecked by rollout (generation), where long output sequence lengths make attention and KV-cache memory dominate end-to-end step time. FP8 offers an attractive lever for accelerating RL by reducing compute cost and memory traffic during rollout, but applying FP8 in RL introduces unique engineering and algorithmic challenges: policy weights change every step (requiring repeated quantization and weight synchronization into the inference engine) and low-precision rollouts can deviate from the higher-precision policy assumed by the trainer, causing train-inference mismatch and potential instability. This report presents a practical FP8 rollout stack for LLM RL, implemented in the veRL ecosystem with support for common training backends (e.g., FSDP/Megatron-LM) and inference engines (e.g., vLLM/SGLang). We (i) enable FP8 W8A8 linear-layer rollout using blockwise FP8 quantization, (ii) extend FP8 to KV-cache to remove long-context memory bottlenecks via per-step QKV scale recalibration, and (iii) mitigate mismatch using importance-sampling-based rollout correction (token-level TIS/MIS variants). Across dense and MoE models, these techniques deliver up to 44% rollout throughput gains while preserving learning behavior comparable to BF16 baselines.

### RTeAAL Sim: Using Tensor Algebra to Represent and Accelerate RTL Simulation (Extended Version)
**Authors**: Yan Zhu, Boru Chen, Christopher W. Fletcher, Nandeeka Nayak

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T04:49:48Z

**Summary**: RTL simulation on CPUs remains a persistent bottleneck in hardware design. State-of-the-art simulators embed the circuit directly into the simulation binary, resulting in long compilation times and execution that is fundamentally CPU frontend-bound, with severe instruction-cache pressure.   This work proposes RTeAAL Sim, which reformulates RTL simulation as a sparse tensor algebra problem. By representing RTL circuits as tensors and simulation as a sparse tensor algebra kernel, RTeAAL Sim decouples simulation behavior from binary size and makes RTL simulation amenable to well-studied tensor algebra optimizations. We demonstrate that a prototype of our tensor-based simulator, even with a subset of these optimizations, already mitigates the compilation overhead and frontend pressure and achieves performance competitive with the highly optimized Verilator simulator across multiple CPUs and ISAs.

### A New Construction Structure on Multi-access Coded Caching with Linear Subpacketization: Cyclic Multi-Access Non-Half-Sum Disjoint Packing
**Authors**: Mengyuan Li, Minquan Cheng, Kai Wan, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2026-01-26T03:25:46Z

**Summary**: We consider the $(K,L,M,N)$ multi-access coded caching system introduced by Hachem et al., which consists of a central server with $N$ files and $K$ cache nodes, each of memory size $M$, where each user can access $L$ cache nodes in a cyclic wrap-around fashion. At present, several existing schemes achieve competitive transmission performance, but their subpacketization levels grow exponentially with the number of users. In contrast, schemes with linear or polynomial subpacketization always incur higher transmission loads. We aim to design a multi-access coded caching scheme with linear subpacketization $F$ while maintaining low transmission load. Recently, Cheng et al. proposed a construction framework for coded caching schemes with linear subpacketization (i.e., $F=K$) called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP). Inspired by this structure, we introduce a novel combinatorial structure named cyclic multi-access non-half-sum disjoint packing (CMA-NHSDP) by extending NHSDP to MACC system. By constructing CMA-NHSDP, we obtain a new class of multi-access coded caching schemes. Theoretical and numerical analyses show that our scheme achieves lower transmission loads than some existing schemes with linear subpacketization. Moreover, the proposed schemes achieves lower transmission load compared to existing schemes with exponential subpacketization in some case.

**Summary**: High-performance attention kernels are essential for Large Language Models. This paper presents analysis of CuTile-based Flash Attention memory behavior and a technique to improve its cache performance. In particular, our analysis on the NVIDIA GB10 (Grace Blackwell) identifies the main cause of L2 cache miss. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a new programming technique called Sawtooth Wavefront Reordering that reduces L2 misses. We validate it in both CUDA and CuTile, observing 50\% or greater reduction in L2 misses and up to 60\% increase in throughput on GB10.

**Authors**: Alexander H. Nitz, Keisi Kacanja, Kanchan Soni

**Summary**: A primary bottleneck in modern FFT-based matched-filter searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences is not raw processor throughput, but available memory bandwidth. Standard frequency-domain implementations, such as the FINDCHIRP algorithm, rely on streaming long template waveforms and data from main memory, which leads to significant processor stalling when template durations exceed cache capacities. In this work, we introduce \textit{Ratio-Filter Dechirping} as a solution, an algorithmic restructuring of the matched filter that transforms the operation from a memory-bound Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into a cache-efficient, compute-bound Finite Impulse Response (FIR) convolution. By utilizing a reference template to remove common orbital phase evolution, we produce slowly changing frequency-domain ratios that can be accurately implemented as short FIR filters. This method delivers a measured speedup of $8\times$ for the core filtering loop used in offline searches and should enable $>10\times$ for low-latency analysis. We find that this approach generalizes to a variety of searches that include physical features such as finite size effects, eccentricity, and precession. By dramatically reducing the computational cost of matched filtering, this approach enables the expansion of searches into dense or high-dimensional parameter spaces, such as those for eccentric or subsolar-mass signals, that are already limited by available computing budgets. Furthermore, this framework provides a natural path for hardware acceleration on GPU architectures.

### Decentralized Learning Strategies for Estimation Error Minimization with Graph Neural Networks
**Authors**: Xingran Chen, Navid NaderiAlizadeh, Alejandro Ribeiro, Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti

**Updated**: 2026-01-25T19:29:44Z

**Summary**: We address real-time sampling and estimation of autoregressive Markovian sources in dynamic yet structurally similar multi-hop wireless networks. Each node caches samples from others and communicates over wireless collision channels, aiming to minimize time-average estimation error via decentralized policies. Due to the high dimensionality of action spaces and complexity of network topologies, deriving optimal policies analytically is intractable. To address this, we propose a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for policy optimization. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our proposed policies are transferable, allowing a policy trained on one graph to be effectively applied to structurally similar graphs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed policy outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) the trained policies are transferable to larger networks, with performance gains increasing with the number of agents; (iii) the graphical training procedure withstands non-stationarity, even when using independent learning techniques; and (iv) recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity.

### MEIC-DT: Memory-Efficient Incremental Clustering for Long-Text Coreference Resolution with Dual-Threshold Constraints
**Authors**: Kangyang Luo, Shuzheng Si, Yuzhuo Bai, Cheng Gao, Zhitong Wang, Cheng Huang, Yingli Shen, Yufeng Han, Wenhao Li, Cunliang Kong, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2026-01-25T08:10:25Z

**Summary**: In the era of large language models (LLMs), supervised neural methods remain the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for Coreference Resolution. Yet, their full potential is underexplored, particularly in incremental clustering, which faces the critical challenge of balancing efficiency with performance for long texts. To address the limitation, we propose \textbf{MEIC-DT}, a novel dual-threshold, memory-efficient incremental clustering approach based on a lightweight Transformer. MEIC-DT features a dual-threshold constraint mechanism designed to precisely control the Transformer's input scale within a predefined memory budget. This mechanism incorporates a Statistics-Aware Eviction Strategy (\textbf{SAES}), which utilizes distinct statistical profiles from the training and inference phases for intelligent cache management. Furthermore, we introduce an Internal Regularization Policy (\textbf{IRP}) that strategically condenses clusters by selecting the most representative mentions, thereby preserving semantic integrity. Extensive experiments on common benchmarks demonstrate that MEIC-DT achieves highly competitive coreference performance under stringent memory constraints.

### Fast KVzip: Efficient and Accurate LLM Inference with Gated KV Eviction
**Authors**: Jang-Hyun Kim, Dongyoon Han, Sangdoo Yun

**Updated**: 2026-01-25T03:07:54Z

**Summary**: Efficient key-value (KV) cache management is crucial for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs), yet existing compression techniques often incur a trade-off between performance degradation and computational overhead. We propose a novel gating-based KV cache eviction method for frozen-weight LLMs that achieves high compression ratios with negligible computational cost. Our approach introduces lightweight sink-attention gating modules to identify and retain critical KV pairs, and integrates seamlessly into both the prefill and decoding stages. The proposed gate training algorithm relies on forward passes of an LLM, avoiding expensive backpropagation, while achieving strong task generalization through a task-agnostic reconstruction objective. Extensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-1M, Qwen3, and Gemma3 families show that our method maintains near-lossless performance while evicting up to 70% of the KV cache. The results are consistent across a wide range of tasks, including long-context understanding, code comprehension, and mathematical reasoning, demonstrating the generality of our approach.

### Athena: Synergizing Data Prefetching and Off-Chip Prediction via Online Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Rahul Bera, Zhenrong Lang, Caroline Hengartner, Konstantinos Kanellopoulos, Rakesh Kumar, Mohammad Sadrosadati, Onur Mutlu

**Updated**: 2026-01-24T22:39:07Z

**Summary**: Prefetching and off-chip prediction are two techniques proposed to hide long memory access latencies in high-performance processors. In this work, we demonstrate that: (1) prefetching and off-chip prediction often provide complementary performance benefits, yet (2) naively combining them often fails to realize their full performance potential, and (3) existing prefetcher control policies leave significant room for performance improvement behind.   Our goal is to design a holistic framework that can autonomously learn to coordinate an off-chip predictor with multiple prefetchers employed at various cache levels. To this end, we propose a new technique called Athena, which models the coordination between prefetchers and off-chip predictor (OCP) as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. Athena acts as the RL agent that observes multiple system-level features (e.g., prefetcher/OCP accuracy, bandwidth usage) over an epoch of program execution, and uses them as state information to select a coordination action (i.e., enabling the prefetcher and/or OCP, and adjusting prefetcher aggressiveness). At the end of every epoch, Athena receives a numerical reward that measures the change in multiple system-level metrics (e.g., number of cycles taken to execute an epoch). Athena uses this reward to autonomously and continuously learn a policy to coordinate prefetchers with OCP.   Our extensive evaluation using a diverse set of memory-intensive workloads shows that Athena consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art coordination policies across a wide range of system configurations with various combinations of underlying prefetchers, OCPs, and main memory bandwidths, while incurring only modest storage overhead.

### A Programming Model for Disaggregated Memory over CXL
**Authors**: Gal Assa, Moritz Lumme, Lucas Bürgi, Michal Friedman, Ori Lahav

**Updated**: 2026-01-24T09:52:16Z

**Summary**: CXL (Compute Express Link) is an emerging open industry-standard interconnect between processing and memory devices that is expected to revolutionize the way systems are designed.   It enables cache-coherent, shared memory pools in a disaggregated fashion at unprecedented scales, allowing algorithms to interact with various storage devices using simple loads and stores.   While CXL unleashes unique opportunities, it also introduces challenges of data management and crash consistency.   For example, CXL currently lacks an adequate programming model, making it impossible to reason about the correctness and behavior of systems on top.   In this work, we present CXL0, the first programming model for concurrent programs over CXL.   We propose a high-level abstraction for memory accesses and formally define operational semantics.   We demonstrate that CXL0 captures a wide range of current and future CXL setups and perform initial measurements on real hardware.   To illustrate the usefulness of CXL0, we present a general transformation that enhances any linearizable concurrent algorithm with durability in a distributed partial-crash setting.   We believe that this work will serve as a stepping stone for systems design and programming on top of CXL.

### On Fine-Grained I/O Complexity of Attention Backward Passes
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Song Yue, Jiahao Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-23T18:42:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional proficiency in handling extensive context windows in natural language. Nevertheless, the quadratic scaling of attention computation relative to sequence length creates substantial efficiency bottlenecks, necessitating the development of I/O-optimized algorithms. In this work, we conduct a systematic examination of the I/O complexity inherent in attention mechanisms, with a specific emphasis on the backward pass under both small and large cache settings. By leveraging the red-blue pebble game framework, we derive tight bounds for I/O complexity across the full spectrum of cache sizes. We validate that FlashAttention, one of the current industry standards, achieves optimality in the large-cache scenario for both forward and backward passes. Conversely, for small-cache environments, we introduce a novel algorithm that outperforms contemporary methods and successfully attains theoretical tight bounds. Furthermore, we expand our investigation to include sparse attention by establishing granular lower bounds for both forward and backward passes across all cache configurations. Ultimately, our results solidify the theoretical framework regarding I/O complexity in attention mechanisms, providing critical guidance for the development of efficient LLM training and inference systems.

### Bright and pure single-photon source in a silicon chip by nanoscale positioning of a color center in a microcavity
**Authors**: Baptiste Lefaucher, Yoann Baron, Jean-Baptiste Jager, Vincent Calvo, Christian Elsässer, Giuliano Coppola, Frédéric Mazen, Sébastien Kerdilès, Félix Cache, Anaïs Dréau, Jean-Michel Gérard

**Updated**: 2026-01-23T12:02:59Z

**Summary**: We present an all-silicon source of near-infrared linearly-polarized single photons, fabricated by nanoscale positioning of a color center in a silicon-on-insulator microcavity. The color center consists of a single W center, created at a well-defined position by Si$^{+}$ ion implantation through a 150 nm-diameter nanohole in a mask. A circular Bragg grating cavity resonant with the W's zero-phonon line at 1217 nm is fabricated at the same location as the nanohole. By Purcell enhancement of zero-phonon emission, we obtain a photon count rate of $1.29 \pm 0.01$ Mcounts/s at saturation under above-gap continuous-wave excitation with a Debye-Waller factor of $98.6\pm1.4 \%$. A clean photon antibunching behavior is observed up to pump powers ensuring saturation of the W's emission ($g^{(2)}(0)=0.06\pm0.02$ at $P=9.2P_{sat}$), evidencing that the density of additional parasitic fluorescent defects is very low. We also demonstrate the triggered emission of single photons with $93\pm2 \%$ purity under weak pulsed laser excitation. At high pulsed laser power, we reveal a detrimental effect of repumping processes, that could be mitigated using selective pumping schemes in the future. These results represent a major step towards on-demand sources of indistinguishable near-infrared single photons within silicon photonics chips.

**Authors**: Vishnu Raj, Gouthaman KV, Shiv Gehlot, Lars Villemoes, Arijit Biswas

**Updated**: 2026-01-23T11:07:08Z

**Summary**: We present GMLv2, a reference-based model designed for the prediction of subjective audio quality as measured by MUSHRA scores. GMLv2 introduces a Beta distribution-based loss to model the listener ratings and incorporates additional neural audio coding (NAC) subjective datasets to extend its generalization and applicability. Extensive evaluations on diverse testset demonstrate that proposed GMLv2 consistently outperforms widely used metrics, such as PEAQ and ViSQOL, both in terms of correlation with subjective scores and in reliably predicting these scores across diverse content types and codec configurations. Consequently, GMLv2 offers a scalable and automated framework for perceptual audio quality evaluation, poised to accelerate research and development in modern audio coding technologies.

### Visual Autoregressive Transformers Must Use $Ω(n^2 d)$ Memory
**Authors**: Yang Cao, Xiaoyu Li, Yekun Ke, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song

**Updated**: 2026-01-23T06:05:15Z

**Summary**: A fundamental challenge in Visual Autoregressive models is the substantial memory overhead required during inference to store previously generated representations. Despite various attempts to mitigate this issue through compression techniques, prior works have not explicitly formalized the problem of KV-cache compression in this context. In this work, we take the first step in formally defining the KV-cache compression problem for Visual Autoregressive transformers. We then establish a fundamental negative result, proving that any mechanism for sequential visual token generation under attention-based architectures must use at least $Ω(n^2 d)$ memory, when $d = Ω(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of tokens generated and $d$ is the embedding dimensionality. This result demonstrates that achieving truly sub-quadratic memory usage is impossible without additional structural constraints. Our proof is constructed via a reduction from a computational lower bound problem, leveraging randomized embedding techniques inspired by dimensionality reduction principles. Finally, we discuss how sparsity priors on visual representations can influence memory efficiency, presenting both impossibility results and potential directions for mitigating memory overhead.

### RevaMp3D: Architecting the Processor Core and Cache Hierarchy for Systems with Monolithically-Integrated Logic and Memory

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T23:08:40Z

**Summary**: Recent nano-technological advances enable the Monolithic 3D (M3D) integration of multiple memory and logic layers in a single chip, allowing for fine-grained connections between layers and significantly alleviating main memory bottlenecks. We show for a variety of workloads, on a state-of-the-art M3D-based system, that the performance and energy bottlenecks shift from main memory to the processor core and cache hierarchy. Therefore, there is a need to revisit current designs that have been conventionally tailored to tackle the memory bottleneck. Based on the insights from our design space exploration, we propose RevaMp3D, introducing five key changes. First, we propose removing the shared last-level cache, as this delivers speedups comparable to or exceeding those from increasing its size or reducing its latency across all workloads. Second, since improving L1 cache latency has a large impact on performance, we reduce L1 latency by leveraging an M3D layout to shorten its wires. Third, we repurpose the area from the removed cache to widen and scale up pipeline structures, accommodating more in-flight requests that are efficiently served by M3D memory. To avoid latency penalties from these larger structures, we leverage M3D layouts. Fourth, to facilitate high thread-level parallelism, we propose a new fine-grained synchronization technique, using M3D's dense inter-layer connectivity. Fifth, we leverage the M3D main memory to mitigate the core bottlenecks. We propose a processor frontend design that memoizes the repetitive fetched, decoded, and reordered instructions, stores them in main memory, and turns off the relevant parts of the core when possible. RevaMp3D provides 1.2x-2.9x speedup and 1.2x-1.4x energy reduction compared to a state-of-the-art M3D system. We also analyze RevaMp3D's design decisions across various memory latencies to facilitate latency-aware design decisions.

### Memory-V2V: Augmenting Video-to-Video Diffusion Models with Memory
**Authors**: Dohun Lee, Chun-Hao Paul Huang, Xuelin Chen, Jong Chul Ye, Duygu Ceylan, Hyeonho Jeong

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T19:59:17Z

**Summary**: Recent foundational video-to-video diffusion models have achieved impressive results in editing user provided videos by modifying appearance, motion, or camera movement. However, real-world video editing is often an iterative process, where users refine results across multiple rounds of interaction. In this multi-turn setting, current video editors struggle to maintain cross-consistency across sequential edits. In this work, we tackle, for the first time, the problem of cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing and introduce Memory-V2V, a simple, yet effective framework that augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory. Given an external cache of previously edited videos, Memory-V2V employs accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies to condition the current editing step on prior results. To further mitigate redundancy and computational overhead, we propose a learnable token compressor within the DiT backbone that compresses redundant conditioning tokens while preserving essential visual cues, achieving an overall speedup of 30%. We validate Memory-V2V on challenging tasks including video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing. Extensive experiments show that Memory-V2V produces videos that are significantly more cross-consistent with minimal computational overhead, while maintaining or even improving task-specific performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

### Space Filling Curves is All You Need: Communication-Avoiding Matrix Multiplication Made Simple
**Authors**: Evangelos Georganas, Alexander Heinecke, Pradeep Dubey

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T19:56:16Z

**Summary**: General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is the cornerstone of Deep Learning and HPC workloads; accordingly, academia and industry have heavily optimized this kernel. Modern platforms with matrix multiplication accelerators exhibit high FLOP/Byte machine balance, which makes implementing optimal matrix multiplication challenging. On modern CPU platforms with matrix engines, state-of-the-art vendor libraries tune input tensor layouts, parallelization schemes, and cache blocking to minimize data movement across the memory hierarchy and maximize throughput. However, the best settings for these parameters depend strongly on the target platform (number of cores, memory hierarchy, cache sizes) and on the shapes of the matrices, making exhaustive tuning infeasible; in practice this leads to performance "glass jaws". In this work we revisit space filling curves (SFC) to alleviate the problem of this cumbersome tuning. SFC convert multi-dimensional coordinates (e.g. 2D) into a single dimension (1D), keeping nearby points in the high-dimensional space close in the 1D order. We partition the Matrix Multiplication computation space using recent advancements in generalized SFC (Generalized Hilbert Curves), and we obtain platform-oblivious and shape-oblivious matrix-multiplication schemes that exhibit inherently high degree of data locality. Furthermore, we extend the SFC-based work partitioning to implement Communication-Avoiding (CA) algorithms that replicate the input tensors and provably minimize communication/data-movement on the critical path. The integration of CA-algorithms is seamless and yields compact code (~30 LOC), yet it achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple CPU platforms, outperforming vendor libraries by up to 2x(geometric-mean speedup) for a range of GEMM shapes.

### SemanticALLI: Caching Reasoning, Not Just Responses, in Agentic Systems
**Authors**: Varun Chillara, Dylan Kline, Christopher Alvares, Evan Wooten, Huan Yang, Shlok Khetan, Cade Bauer, Tré Guillory, Tanishka Shah, Yashodhara Dhariwal, Volodymyr Pavlov, George Popstefanov

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T19:42:21Z

**Summary**: Agentic AI pipelines suffer from a hidden inefficiency: they frequently reconstruct identical intermediate logic, such as metric normalization or chart scaffolding, even when the user's natural language phrasing is entirely novel. Conventional boundary caching fails to capture this inefficiency because it treats inference as a monolithic black box.   We introduce SemanticALLI, a pipeline-aware architecture within Alli (PMG's marketing intelligence platform), designed to operationalize redundant reasoning. By decomposing generation into Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR) and Visualization Synthesis (VS), SemanticALLI elevates structured intermediate representations (IRs) to first-class, cacheable artifacts.   The impact of caching within the agentic loop is substantial. In our evaluation, baseline monolithic caching caps at a 38.7% hit rate due to linguistic variance. In contrast, our structured approach allows for an additional stage, the Visualization Synthesis stage, to achieve an 83.10% hit rate, bypassing 4,023 LLM calls with a median latency of just 2.66 ms. This internal reuse reduces total token consumption, offering a practical lesson for AI system design: even when users rarely repeat themselves, the pipeline often does, at stable, structured checkpoints where caching is most reliable.

### FlashMoE: Reducing SSD I/O Bottlenecks via ML-Based Cache Replacement for Mixture-of-Experts Inference on Edge Devices
**Authors**: Byeongju Kim, Jungwan Lee, Donghyeon Han, Hoi-Jun Yoo, Sangyeob Kim

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T17:07:33Z

**Summary**: Recently, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained attention for efficiently scaling large language models. Although these models are extremely large, their sparse activation enables inference to be performed by accessing only a fraction of the model at a time. This property opens the possibility of on-device inference of MoE, which was previously considered infeasible for such large models. Consequently, various systems have been proposed to leverage this sparsity and enable efficient MoE inference for edge devices. However, previous MoE inference systems like Fiddler[8] or DAOP[13] rely on DRAM-based offloading and are not suitable for memory constrained on-device environments. As recent MoE models grow to hundreds of gigabytes, RAM-offloading solutions become impractical. To address this, we propose FlashMoE, a system that offloads inactive experts to SSD, enabling efficient MoE inference under limited RAM. FlashMoE incorporates a lightweight ML-based caching strategy that adaptively combines recency and frequency signals to maximize expert reuse, significantly reducing storage I/O. In addition, we built a user-grade desktop platform to demonstrate the practicality of FlashMoE. On this real hardware setup, FlashMoE improves cache hit rate by up to 51% over well-known offloading policies such as LRU and LFU, and achieves up to 2.6x speedup compared to existing MoE inference systems.

### Attacks on Approximate Caches in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Desen Sun, Shuncheng Jie, Sihang Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T14:44:17Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models that produce images and other content from user prompts, but they are computationally intensive. To mitigate this cost, recent academic and industry work has adopted approximate caching, which reuses intermediate states from similar prompts in a cache. While efficient, this optimization introduces new security risks by breaking isolation among users. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the security vulnerabilities introduced by approximate caching. First, we demonstrate a remote covert channel established with the approximate cache, where a sender injects prompts with special keywords into the cache system and a receiver can recover that even after days, to exchange information. Second, we introduce a prompt stealing attack using the approximate cache, where an attacker can recover existing cached prompts from hits. Finally, we introduce a poisoning attack that embeds the attacker's logos into the previously stolen prompt, leading to unexpected logo rendering for the requests that hit the poisoned cache prompts. These attacks are all performed remotely through the serving system, demonstrating severe security vulnerabilities in approximate caching. The code for this work is available.

### Evaluating Compiler Optimization Impacts on zkVM Performance
**Authors**: Thomas Gassmann, Stefanos Chaliasos, Thodoris Sotiropoulos, Zhendong Su

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T10:25:30Z

**Summary**: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are the cornerstone of programmable cryptography. They enable (1) privacy-preserving and verifiable computation across blockchains, and (2) an expanding range of off-chain applications such as credential schemes. Zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs) lower the barrier by turning ZKPs into a drop-in backend for standard compilation pipelines. This lets developers write proof-generating programs in conventional languages (e.g., Rust or C++) instead of hand-crafting arithmetic circuits. However, these VMs inherit compiler infrastructures tuned for traditional architectures rather than for proof systems. In particular, standard compiler optimizations assume features that are absent in zkVMs, including cache locality, branch prediction, or instruction-level parallelism. Therefore, their impact on proof generation is questionable.   We present the first systematic study of the impact of compiler optimizations on zkVMs. We evaluate 64 LLVM passes, six standard optimization levels, and an unoptimized baseline across 58 benchmarks on two RISC-V-based zkVMs (RISC Zero and SP1). While standard LLVM optimization levels do improve zkVM performance (over 40\%), their impact is far smaller than on traditional CPUs, since their decisions rely on hardware features rather than proof constraints. Guided by a fine-grained pass-level analysis, we~\emph{slightly} refine a small set of LLVM passes to be zkVM-aware, improving zkVM execution time by up to 45\% (average +4.6\% on RISC Zero, +1\% on SP1) and achieving consistent proving-time gains. Our work highlights the potential of compiler-level optimizations for zkVM performance and opens new direction for zkVM-specific passes, backends, and superoptimizers.

### Event-VStream: Event-Driven Real-Time Understanding for Long Video Streams
**Authors**: Zhenghui Guo, Yuanbin Man, Junyuan Sheng, Bowen Lin, Ahmed Ahmed, Bo Jiang, Boyuan Zhang, Miao Yin, Sian Jin, Omprakash Gnawal, Chengming Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T05:05:53Z

**Summary**: Real-time understanding of long video streams remains challenging for multimodal large language models (VLMs) due to redundant frame processing and rapid forgetting of past context. Existing streaming systems rely on fixed-interval decoding or cache pruning, which either produce repetitive outputs or discard crucial temporal information. We introduce Event-VStream, an event-aware framework that represents continuous video as a sequence of discrete, semantically coherent events. Our system detects meaningful state transitions by integrating motion, semantic, and predictive cues, and triggers language generation only at those boundaries. Each event embedding is consolidated into a persistent memory bank, enabling long-horizon reasoning while maintaining low latency. Across OVOBench-Realtime, and long-form Ego4D evaluations, Event-VStream achieves competitive performance. It improves over a VideoLLM-Online-8B baseline by +10.4 points on OVOBench-Realtime, achieves performance close to Flash-VStream-7B despite using only a general-purpose LLaMA-3-8B text backbone, and maintains around 70% GPT-5 win rate on 2-hour Ego4D streams.

### Side-Channel Attacks on Open vSwitch
**Authors**: Daewoo Kim, Sihang Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T04:12:03Z

**Summary**: Virtualization is widely adopted in cloud systems to manage resource sharing among users. A virtualized environment usually deploys a virtual switch within the host system to enable virtual machines to communicate with each other and with the physical network. The Open vSwitch (OVS) is one of the most popular software-based virtual switches. It maintains a cache hierarchy to accelerate packet forwarding from the host to virtual machines. We characterize the caching system inside OVS from a security perspective and identify three attack primitives. Based on the attack primitives, we present three remote attacks via OVS, breaking the isolation in virtualized environments. First, we identify remote covert channels using different caches. Second, we present a novel header recovery attack that leaks a remote user's packet header fields, breaking the confidentiality guarantees from the system. Third, we demonstrate a remote packet rate monitoring attack that recovers the packet rate of a remote victim. To defend against these attacks, we also discuss and evaluate mitigation solutions.

**Updated**: 2026-01-22T02:27:45Z

**Summary**: Post-training is essential for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to real-world applications. Deploying post-trained models faces significant challenges due to substantial memory overhead and noticeable inference latency. Existing work has identified significant redundancies in LLMs and proposed efficient architectures, namely intra-layer KV sharing and cross-layer KV sharing. However, these methods still result in high inference time overhead, remaining suboptimal for post-training pre-trained LLMs. In this paper, we identify that the \texttt{Softmax} operation is a primary bottleneck for LLM inference and discover that it is actually highly redundant during post-training. We propose Softmax \textbf{Uni}fication in \textbf{Att}e\textbf{n}tion (\textbf{UniAttn}), a novel post-training method that unifies Softmax activations across transformer blocks to reduce LLM inference costs. Additionally, UniAttn adopts a linear projection to compensate for the errors induced by Softmax unification. Experiments show that UniAttn matches the performance of standard post-training while significantly reducing inference costs, outperforming existing efficient architectures during post-training.

 ### RedSage: A Cybersecurity Generalist LLM
**Authors**: Naufal Suryanto, Muzammal Naseer, Pengfei Li, Syed Talal Wasim, Jinhui Yi, Juergen Gall, Paolo Ceravolo, Ernesto Damiani

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:59:57Z

**Summary**: Cybersecurity operations demand assistant LLMs that support diverse workflows without exposing sensitive data. Existing solutions either rely on proprietary APIs with privacy risks or on open models lacking domain adaptation. To bridge this gap, we curate 11.8B tokens of cybersecurity-focused continual pretraining data via large-scale web filtering and manual collection of high-quality resources, spanning 28.6K documents across frameworks, offensive techniques, and security tools. Building on this, we design an agentic augmentation pipeline that simulates expert workflows to generate 266K multi-turn cybersecurity samples for supervised fine-tuning. Combined with general open-source LLM data, these resources enable the training of RedSage, an open-source, locally deployable cybersecurity assistant with domain-aware pretraining and post-training. To rigorously evaluate the models, we introduce RedSage-Bench, a benchmark with 30K multiple-choice and 240 open-ended Q&A items covering cybersecurity knowledge, skills, and tool expertise. RedSage is further evaluated on established cybersecurity benchmarks (e.g., CTI-Bench, CyberMetric, SECURE) and general LLM benchmarks to assess broader generalization. At the 8B scale, RedSage achieves consistently better results, surpassing the baseline models by up to +5.59 points on cybersecurity benchmarks and +5.05 points on Open LLM Leaderboard tasks. These findings demonstrate that domain-aware agentic augmentation and pre/post-training can not only enhance cybersecurity-specific expertise but also help to improve general reasoning and instruction-following. All models, datasets, and code are publicly available.

### Discovering Hidden Gems in Model Repositories
**Authors**: Jonathan Kahana, Eliahu Horwitz, Yedid Hoshen

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:59:55Z

**Summary**: Public repositories host millions of fine-tuned models, yet community usage remains disproportionately concentrated on a small number of foundation checkpoints. We investigate whether this concentration reflects efficient market selection or if superior models are systematically overlooked. Through an extensive evaluation of over 2,000 models, we show the prevalence of "hidden gems", unpopular fine-tunes that significantly outperform their popular counterparts. Notably, within the Llama-3.1-8B family, we find rarely downloaded checkpoints that improve math performance from 83.2% to 96.0% without increasing inference costs. However, discovering these models through exhaustive evaluation of every uploaded model is computationally infeasible. We therefore formulate model discovery as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem and accelerate the Sequential Halving search algorithm by using shared query sets and aggressive elimination schedules. Our method retrieves top models with as few as 50 queries per candidate, accelerating discovery by over 50x.

### Hybrid Linear Attention Done Right: Efficient Distillation and Effective Architectures for Extremely Long Contexts
**Authors**: Yingfa Chen, Zhen Leng Thai, Zihan Zhou, Zhu Zhang, Xingyu Shen, Shuo Wang, Chaojun Xiao, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:59:53Z

**Summary**: Hybrid Transformer architectures, which combine softmax attention blocks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have shown a desirable performance-throughput tradeoff for long-context modeling, but their adoption and studies are hindered by the prohibitive cost of large-scale pre-training from scratch. Some recent studies have shown that pre-trained softmax attention blocks can be converted into RNN blocks through parameter transfer and knowledge distillation. However, these transfer methods require substantial amounts of training data (more than 10B tokens), and the resulting hybrid models also exhibit poor long-context performance, which is the scenario where hybrid models enjoy significant inference speedups over Transformer-based models. In this paper, we present HALO (Hybrid Attention via Layer Optimization), a pipeline for distilling Transformer models into RNN-attention hybrid models. We then present HypeNet, a hybrid architecture with superior length generalization enabled by a novel position encoding scheme (named HyPE) and various architectural modifications. We convert the Qwen3 series into HypeNet using HALO, achieving performance comparable to the original Transformer models while enjoying superior long-context performance and efficiency. The conversion requires just 2.3B tokens, less than 0.01% of their pre-training data

### UEval: A Benchmark for Unified Multimodal Generation
**Authors**: Bo Li, Yida Yin, Wenhao Chai, Xingyu Fu, Zhuang Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:59:52Z

**Summary**: We introduce UEval, a benchmark to evaluate unified models, i.e., models capable of generating both images and text. UEval comprises 1,000 expert-curated questions that require both images and text in the model output, sourced from 8 real-world tasks. Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations. Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is non-trivial, as simple LLM-as-a-judge methods can miss the subtleties. Different from previous works that rely on multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rate image quality or text accuracy, we design a rubric-based scoring system in UEval. For each question, reference images and text answers are provided to a MLLM to generate an initial rubric, consisting of multiple evaluation criteria, and human experts then refine and validate these rubrics. In total, UEval contains 10,417 validated rubric criteria, enabling scalable and fine-grained automatic scoring. UEval is challenging for current unified models: GPT-5-Thinking scores only 66.4 out of 100, while the best open-source model reaches merely 49.1. We observe that reasoning models often outperform non-reasoning ones, and transferring reasoning traces from a reasoning model to a non-reasoning model significantly narrows the gap. This suggests that reasoning may be important for tasks requiring complex multimodal understanding and generation.

### DynamicVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model for Dynamic Object Manipulation
**Authors**: Haozhe Xie, Beichen Wen, Jiarui Zheng, Zhaoxi Chen, Fangzhou Hong, Haiwen Diao, Ziwei Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:59:51Z

**Summary**: Manipulating dynamic objects remains an open challenge for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which, despite strong generalization in static manipulation, struggle in dynamic scenarios requiring rapid perception, temporal anticipation, and continuous control. We present DynamicVLA, a framework for dynamic object manipulation that integrates temporal reasoning and closed-loop adaptation through three key designs: 1) a compact 0.4B VLA using a convolutional vision encoder for spatially efficient, structurally faithful encoding, enabling fast multimodal inference; 2) Continuous Inference, enabling overlapping reasoning and execution for lower latency and timely adaptation to object motion; and 3) Latent-aware Action Streaming, which bridges the perception-execution gap by enforcing temporally aligned action execution. To fill the missing foundation of dynamic manipulation data, we introduce the Dynamic Object Manipulation (DOM) benchmark, built from scratch with an auto data collection pipeline that efficiently gathers 200K synthetic episodes across 2.8K scenes and 206 objects, and enables fast collection of 2K real-world episodes without teleoperation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate remarkable improvements in response speed, perception, and generalization, positioning DynamicVLA as a unified framework for general dynamic object manipulation across embodiments.

### DynaWeb: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning of Web Agents
**Authors**: Hang Ding, Peidong Liu, Junqiao Wang, Ziwei Ji, Meng Cao, Rongzhao Zhang, Lynn Ai, Eric Yang, Tianyu Shi, Lei Yu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:59:07Z

**Summary**: The development of autonomous web agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL), represents a significant step towards general-purpose AI assistants. However, training these agents is severely hampered by the challenges of interacting with the live internet, which is inefficient, costly, and fraught with risks. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers a promising solution by learning a world model of the environment to enable simulated interaction. This paper introduces DynaWeb, a novel MBRL framework that trains web agents through interacting with a web world model trained to predict naturalistic web page representations given agent actions. This model serves as a synthetic web environment where an agent policy can dream by generating vast quantities of rollout action trajectories for efficient online reinforcement learning. Beyond free policy rollouts, DynaWeb incorporates real expert trajectories from training data, which are randomly interleaved with on-policy rollouts during training to improve stability and sample efficiency. Experiments conducted on the challenging WebArena and WebVoyager benchmarks demonstrate that DynaWeb consistently and significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art open-source web agent models. Our findings establish the viability of training web agents through imagination, offering a scalable and efficient way to scale up online agentic RL.

### FineInstructions: Scaling Synthetic Instructions to Pre-Training Scale
**Authors**: Ajay Patel, Colin Raffel, Chris Callison-Burch

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:58:47Z

**Summary**: Due to limited supervised training data, large language models (LLMs) are typically pre-trained via a self-supervised "predict the next word" objective on a vast amount of unstructured text data. To make the resulting model useful to users, it is further trained on a far smaller amount of "instruction-tuning" data comprised of supervised training examples of instructions and responses. To overcome the limited amount of supervised data, we propose a procedure that can transform the knowledge in internet-scale pre-training documents into billions of synthetic instruction and answer training pairs. The resulting dataset, called FineInstructions, uses ~18M instruction templates created from real user-written queries and prompts. These instruction templates are matched to and instantiated with human-written source documents from unstructured pre-training corpora. With "supervised" synthetic training data generated at this scale, an LLM can be pre-trained from scratch solely with the instruction-tuning objective, which is far more in-distribution with the expected downstream usage of LLMs (responding to user prompts). We conduct controlled token-for-token training experiments and find pre-training on FineInstructions outperforms standard pre-training and other proposed synthetic pre-training techniques on standard benchmarks measuring free-form response quality. Our resources can be found at https://huggingface.co/fineinstructions .

### Think Twice: Branch-and-Rethink Reasoning Reward Model
**Authors**: Yizhu Jiao, Jiaqi Zeng, Julien Veron Vialard, Oleksii Kuchaiev, Jiawei Han, Olivier Delalleau

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:57:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1 performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise, evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting all-at-once scoring into focused, second-look reasoning, BR-RM reduces judgment diffusion and improves sensitivity to subtle yet consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains.

### Reasoning While Asking: Transforming Reasoning Large Language Models from Passive Solvers to Proactive Inquirers
**Authors**: Xin Chen, Feng Jiang, Yiqian Zhang, Hardy Chen, Shuo Yan, Wenya Xie, Min Yang, Shujian Huang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:56:12Z

**Summary**: Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, yet they remain fundamentally limited by a \emph{blind self-thinking} paradigm: performing extensive internal reasoning even when critical information is missing or ambiguous. We propose Proactive Interactive Reasoning (PIR), a new reasoning paradigm that transforms LLMs from passive solvers into proactive inquirers that interleave reasoning with clarification. Unlike existing search- or tool-based frameworks that primarily address knowledge uncertainty by querying external environments, PIR targets premise- and intent-level uncertainty through direct interaction with the user. PIR is implemented via two core components: (1) an uncertainty-aware supervised fine-tuning procedure that equips models with interactive reasoning capability, and (2) a user-simulator-based policy optimization framework driven by a composite reward that aligns model behavior with user intent. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and document editing demonstrate that PIR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 32.70\% higher accuracy, 22.90\% higher pass rate, and 41.36 BLEU improvement, while reducing nearly half of the reasoning computation and unnecessary interaction turns. Further reliability evaluations on factual knowledge, question answering, and missing-premise scenarios confirm the strong generalization and robustness of PIR.

### "Not in My Backyard": LLMs Uncover Online and Offline Social Biases Against Homelessness
**Authors**: Jonathan A. Karr, Benjamin F. Herbst, Matthew L. Sisk, Xueyun Li, Ting Hua, Matthew Hauenstein, Georgina Curto, Nitesh V. Chawla

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:55:57Z

**Summary**: Homelessness is a persistent social challenge, impacting millions worldwide. Over 876,000 people experienced homelessness (PEH) in the U.S. in 2025. Social bias is a significant barrier to alleviation, shaping public perception and influencing policymaking. Given that online textual media and offline city council discourse reflect and influence part of public opinion, it provides valuable insights to identify and track social biases against PEH. We present a new, manually-annotated multi-domain dataset compiled from Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes across ten U.S. cities. Our 16-category multi-label taxonomy creates a challenging long-tail classification problem: some categories appear in less than 1% of samples, while others exceed 70%. We find that small human-annotated datasets (1,702 samples) are insufficient for training effective classifiers, whether used to fine-tune encoder models or as few-shot examples for LLMs. To address this, we use GPT-4.1 to generate pseudo-labels on a larger unlabeled corpus. Training on this expanded dataset enables even small encoder models (ModernBERT, 150M parameters) to achieve 35.23 macro-F1, approaching GPT-4.1's 41.57. This demonstrates that \textbf{data quantity matters more than model size}, enabling low-cost, privacy-preserving deployment without relying on commercial APIs. Our results reveal that negative bias against PEH is prevalent both offline and online (especially on Reddit), with "not in my backyard" narratives showing the highest engagement. These findings uncover a type of ostracism that directly impacts poverty-reduction policymaking and provide actionable insights for practitioners addressing homelessness.

### StepShield: When, Not Whether to Intervene on Rogue Agents
**Authors**: Gloria Felicia, Michael Eniolade, Jinfeng He, Zitha Sasindran, Hemant Kumar, Milan Hussain Angati, Sandeep Bandarupalli

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:55:46Z

**Summary**: Existing agent safety benchmarks report binary accuracy, conflating early intervention with post-mortem analysis. A detector that flags a violation at step 8 enables intervention; one that reports it at step 48 provides only forensic value. This distinction is critical, yet current benchmarks cannot measure it. We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics. We further show that early detection has direct economic benefits: our cascaded HybridGuard detector reduces monitoring costs by 75% and projects to $108M in cumulative savings over five years at enterprise scale. By shifting the focus of evaluation from whether to when, StepShield provides a new foundation for building safer and more economically viable AI agents. The code and data are released under an Apache 2.0 license.

### Pay for Hints, Not Answers: LLM Shepherding for Cost-Efficient Inference
**Authors**: Ziming Dong, Hardik Sharma, Evan O'Toole, Jaya Prakash Champati, Kui Wu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:52:54Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art performance on complex reasoning tasks, but their inference costs limit deployment at scale. Small Language Models (SLMs) offer dramatic cost savings yet lag substantially in accuracy. Existing approaches - routing and cascading - treat the LLM as an all-or-nothing resource: either the query bypasses the LLM entirely, or the LLM generates a complete response at full cost. We introduce LLM Shepherding, a framework that requests only a short prefix (a hint) from the LLM and provides it to SLM. This simple mechanism is surprisingly effective for math and coding tasks: even hints comprising 10-30% of the full LLM response improve SLM accuracy significantly. Shepherding generalizes both routing and cascading, and it achieves lower cost under oracle decision-making. We develop a two-stage predictor that jointly determines whether a hint is needed and how many tokens to request. On the widely-used mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, CNK12) and code generation (HumanEval, MBPP) benchmarks, Shepherding reduces costs by 42-94% relative to LLM-only inference. Compared to state-of-the-art routing and cascading baselines, shepherding delivers up to 2.8x cost reduction while matching accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to exploit token-level budget control for SLM-LLM collaboration.

### World of Workflows: a Benchmark for Bringing World Models to Enterprise Systems
**Authors**: Lakshya Gupta, Litao Li, Yizhe Liu, Sriram Ganapathi Subramanian, Kaheer Suleman, Zichen Zhang, Haoye Lu, Sumit Pasupalak

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:51:54Z

**Summary**: Frontier large language models (LLMs) excel as autonomous agents in many domains, yet they remain untested in complex enterprise systems where hidden workflows create cascading effects across interconnected databases. Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.

### SWE-Replay: Efficient Test-Time Scaling for Software Engineering Agents
**Authors**: Yifeng Ding, Lingming Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:50:29Z

**Summary**: Test-time scaling has been widely adopted to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, the standard approach of repeatedly sampling trajectories from scratch is computationally expensive. While recent methods have attempted to mitigate costs using specialized value agents, they can suffer from model miscalibration and fail to generalize to modern agents that synthesize custom bash scripts as tools. In this paper, we introduce SWE-Replay, the first efficient and generalizable test-time scaling technique for modern agents without reliance on potentially noisy value estimates. SWE-Replay optimizes the scaling process by recycling trajectories from prior trials, dynamically choosing to either explore from scratch or exploit archived experience by branching at critical intermediate steps. This selection of intermediate steps is driven by the potential and reasoning significance of repository exploration, rather than external LLM-based quality estimates. Our evaluation shows that, on SWE-Bench Verified, SWE-Replay consistently outperforms naive scaling, reducing costs by up to 17.4% while maintaining or even improving performance by up to 3.8%. Further evaluation on SWE-Bench Pro and Multilingual validates the generalizability of SWE-Replay, establishing it as a robust foundation for efficient test-time scaling of software engineering agents.

### The Patient is not a Moving Document: A World Model Training Paradigm for Longitudinal EHR
**Authors**: Irsyad Adam, Zekai Chen, David Laprade, Shaun Porwal, David Laub, Erik Reinertsen, Arda Pekis, Kevin Brown

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:49:37Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) trained with next-word-prediction have achieved success as clinical foundation models. Representations from these language backbones yield strong linear probe performance across biomedical tasks, suggesting that patient semantics emerge from next-token prediction at scale. However, this paradigm treats patients as a document to be summarized rather than a dynamical system to be simulated; a patient's trajectory emerges from their state evolving under interventions and time, requiring models that simulate dynamics rather than predict tokens. To address this, we introduce SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR that grounds a joint-embedding prediction architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT). SFT grounds our model to reconstruct future patient states in token space, while JEPA predicts those futures in latent space from the initial patient representation alone, forcing trajectory dynamics to be encoded before the next state is observed. We validate across two large-scale cohorts: Memorial Sloan Kettering (23,319 oncology patients; 323,000+ patient-years) and INSPECT (19,402 pulmonary embolism patients). Using a linear probe evaluated at multiple points along the disease trajectory, we demonstrate that our training paradigm learns embeddings that capture disease dynamics not recoverable by autoregressive baselines, enabling SMB-Structure to achieve competitive performance on complex tasks characterized by high patient heterogeneity. Model weights are available at https://huggingface.co/standardmodelbio/SMB-v1-1.7B-Structure.

### A Federated and Parameter-Efficient Framework for Large Language Model Training in Medicine

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:48:21Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on medical benchmarks, including question answering and diagnosis. To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models. Evaluation settings included (1) in-domain training and testing, (2) external validation on independent cohorts, and (3) a low-resource new-site adaptation scenario using real-world clinical notes from the Yale New Haven Health System.

### Learning Hamiltonian Flow Maps: Mean Flow Consistency for Large-Timestep Molecular Dynamics
**Authors**: Winfried Ripken, Michael Plainer, Gregor Lied, Thorben Frank, Oliver T. Unke, Stefan Chmiela, Frank Noé, Klaus Robert Müller

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:47:46Z

**Summary**: Simulating the long-time evolution of Hamiltonian systems is limited by the small timesteps required for stable numerical integration. To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span $Δt$, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF). Our models maintain comparable training and inference cost, but support significantly larger integration timesteps while trained directly on widely-available trajectory-free MLFF datasets.

**Summary**: Current methods for converting circuit schematic images into machine-readable netlists struggle with component recognition and connectivity inference. In this paper, we present SINA, an open-source, fully automated circuit schematic image-to-netlist generator. SINA integrates deep learning for accurate component detection, Connected-Component Labeling (CCL) for precise connectivity extraction, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for component reference designator retrieval, while employing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for reliable reference designator assignments. In our experiments, SINA achieves 96.47% overall netlist-generation accuracy, which is 2.72x higher than state-of-the-art approaches.

### Evaluating Text Creativity across Diverse Domains: A Dataset and Large Language Model Evaluator
**Authors**: Qian Cao, Xiting Wang, Yuzhuo Yuan, Yahui Liu, Fang Luo, Ruihua Song

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:38:43Z

**Summary**: Creativity evaluation remains a challenging frontier for large language models (LLMs). Current evaluations heavily rely on inefficient and costly human judgments, hindering progress in enhancing machine creativity. While automated methods exist, ranging from psychological testing to heuristic- or prompting-based approaches, they often lack generalizability or alignment with human judgment. To address these issues, we propose a novel pairwise-comparison framework for assessing textual creativity that leverages shared contextual instructions to improve evaluation consistency. We introduce CreataSet, a large-scale dataset with 100K+ human-level and 1M+ synthetic creative instruction-response pairs spanning diverse open-domain tasks. Through training on CreataSet, we develop an LLM-based evaluator named CrEval. CrEval demonstrates remarkable superiority over existing methods in alignment with human judgments. Experimental results underscore the indispensable significance of integrating both human and synthetic data to train highly robust evaluators, and showcase the practical utility of CrEval in boosting the creativity of LLMs.

### Information-geometry-driven graph sequential growth
**Authors**: Harry T. Bond, Bertrand Gauthier, Kirstin Strokorb

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:37:08Z

**Summary**: We investigate the properties of a class of regularisation-free approaches for Gaussian graphical inference based on the information-geometry-driven sequential growth of initially edgeless graphs. Relating the growth of a graph to a coordinate descent process, we characterise the fully-corrective descents corresponding to information-optimal growths, and propose numerically efficient strategies for their approximation. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed procedures to reliably extract sparse graphical models while limiting the number of false detections, and illustrate how activation ranks can provide insight into the informational relevance of edge sets. The considered approaches are tuning-parameter-free and have complexities akin to coordinate descents.

### ECO: Quantized Training without Full-Precision Master Weights
**Authors**: Mahdi Nikdan, Amir Zandieh, Dan Alistarh, Vahab Mirrokni

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:35:01Z

**Summary**: Quantization has significantly improved the compute and memory efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) training. However, existing approaches still rely on accumulating their updates in high-precision: concretely, gradient updates must be applied to a high-precision weight buffer, known as $\textit{master weights}$. This buffer introduces substantial memory overhead, particularly for Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) models, where model parameters and optimizer states dominate memory usage. To address this, we introduce the Error-Compensating Optimizer (ECO), which eliminates master weights by applying updates directly to quantized parameters. ECO quantizes weights after each step and carefully injects the resulting quantization error into the optimizer momentum, forming an error-feedback loop with no additional memory. We prove that, under standard assumptions and a decaying learning rate, ECO converges to a constant-radius neighborhood of the optimum, while naive master-weight removal can incur an error that is inversely proportional to the learning rate. We show empirical results for pretraining small Transformers (30-800M), a Gemma-3 1B model, and a 2.1B parameter Sparse MoE model with FP8 quantization, and fine-tuning DeepSeek-MoE-16B in INT4 precision. Throughout, ECO matches baselines with master weights up to near-lossless accuracy, significantly shifting the static memory vs validation loss Pareto frontier.

### Investigating Associational Biases in Inter-Model Communication of Large Generative Models
**Authors**: Fethiye Irmak Dogan, Yuval Weiss, Kajal Patel, Jiaee Cheong, Hatice Gunes

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:29:55Z

**Summary**: Social bias in generative AI can manifest not only as performance disparities but also as associational bias, whereby models learn and reproduce stereotypical associations between concepts and demographic groups, even in the absence of explicit demographic information (e.g., associating doctors with men). These associations can persist, propagate, and potentially amplify across repeated exchanges in inter-model communication pipelines, where one generative model's output becomes another's input. This is especially salient for human-centred perception tasks, such as human activity recognition and affect prediction, where inferences about behaviour and internal states can lead to errors or stereotypical associations that propagate into unequal treatment. In this work, focusing on human activity and affective expression, we study how such associations evolve within an inter-model communication pipeline that alternates between image generation and image description. Using the RAF-DB and PHASE datasets, we quantify demographic distribution drift induced by model-to-model information exchange and assess whether these drifts are systematic using an explainability pipeline. Our results reveal demographic drifts toward younger representations for both actions and emotions, as well as toward more female-presenting representations, primarily for emotions. We further find evidence that some predictions are supported by spurious visual regions (e.g., background or hair) rather than concept-relevant cues (e.g., body or face). We also examine whether these demographic drifts translate into measurable differences in downstream behaviour, i.e., while predicting activity and emotion labels. Finally, we outline mitigation strategies spanning data-centric, training and deployment interventions, and emphasise the need for careful safeguards when deploying interconnected models in human-centred AI systems.

### What the flock knows that the birds do not: exploring the emergence of joint agency in multi-agent active inference
**Authors**: Domenico Maisto, Davide Nuzzi, Giovanni Pezzulo

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:28:50Z

**Summary**: Collective behavior pervades biological systems, from flocks of birds to neural assemblies and human societies. Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties -- such as joint agency or knowledge -- that transcend those of their individual components remains an open question. Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock'' that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit) collective knowledge and joint agency.

### NeuroFaith: Evaluating LLM Self-Explanation Faithfulness via Internal Representation Alignment
**Authors**: Milan Bhan, Jean-Noel Vittaut, Nicolas Chesneau, Sarath Chandar, Marie-Jeanne Lesot

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:24:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate plausible free text self-explanations to justify their answers. However, these natural language explanations may not accurately reflect the model's actual reasoning process, pinpointing a lack of faithfulness. Existing faithfulness evaluation methods rely primarily on behavioral tests or computational block analysis without examining the semantic content of internal neural representations. This paper proposes NeuroFaith, a flexible framework that measures the faithfulness of LLM free text self-explanation by identifying key concepts within explanations and mechanistically testing whether these concepts actually influence the model's predictions. We show the versatility of NeuroFaith across 2-hop reasoning and classification tasks. Additionally, we develop a linear faithfulness probe based on NeuroFaith to detect unfaithful self-explanations from representation space and improve faithfulness through steering. NeuroFaith provides a principled approach to evaluating and enhancing the faithfulness of LLM free text self-explanations, addressing critical needs for trustworthy AI systems.

### The Economics of No-regret Learning Algorithms
**Authors**: Jason Hartline

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:19:22Z

**Summary**: A fundamental challenge for modern economics is to understand what happens when actors in an economy are replaced with algorithms. Like rationality has enabled understanding of outcomes of classical economic actors, no-regret can enable the understanding of outcomes of algorithmic actors. This review article covers the classical computer science literature on no-regret algorithms to provide a foundation for an overview of the latest economics research on no-regret algorithms, focusing on the emerging topics of manipulation, statistical inference, and algorithmic collusion.

### Think Locally, Explain Globally: Graph-Guided LLM Investigations via Local Reasoning and Belief Propagation
**Authors**: Saurabh Jha, Rohan Arora, Bhavya, Noah Zheutlin, Paulina Toro Isaza, Laura Shwartz, Yu Deng, Daby Sow, Ruchi Mahindru, Ruchir Puri

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:18:39Z

**Summary**: LLM agents excel when environments are mostly static and the needed information fits in a model's context window, but they often fail in open-ended investigations where explanations must be constructed by iteratively mining evidence from massive, heterogeneous operational data. These investigations exhibit hidden dependency structure: entities interact, signals co-vary, and the importance of a fact may only become clear after other evidence is discovered. Because the context window is bounded, agents must summarize intermediate findings before their significance is known, increasing the risk of discarding key evidence. ReAct-style agents are especially brittle in this regime. Their retrieve-summarize-reason loop makes conclusions sensitive to exploration order and introduces run-to-run non-determinism, producing a reliability gap where Pass-at-k may be high but Majority-at-k remains low. Simply sampling more rollouts or generating longer reasoning traces does not reliably stabilize results, since hypotheses cannot be autonomously checked as new evidence arrives and there is no explicit mechanism for belief bookkeeping and revision. In addition, ReAct entangles semantic reasoning with controller duties such as tool orchestration and state tracking, so execution errors and plan drift degrade reasoning while consuming scarce context.   We address these issues by formulating investigation as abductive reasoning over a dependency graph and proposing EoG (Explanations over Graphs), a disaggregated framework in which an LLM performs bounded local evidence mining and labeling (cause vs symptom) while a deterministic controller manages traversal, state, and belief propagation to compute a minimal explanatory frontier. On a representative ITBench diagnostics task, EoG improves both accuracy and run-to-run consistency over ReAct baselines, including a 7x average gain in Majority-at-k entity F1.

### Where Do the Joules Go? Diagnosing Inference Energy Consumption
**Authors**: Jae-Won Chung, Ruofan Wu, Jeff J. Ma, Mosharaf Chowdhury

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:16:45Z

**Summary**: Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.

### How Many Ratings per Item are Necessary for Reliable Significance Testing?
**Authors**: Christopher Homan, Flip Korn, Deepak Pandita, Chris Welty

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:15:35Z

**Summary**: A cornerstone of machine learning evaluation is the (often hidden) assumption that model and human responses are reliable enough to evaluate models against unitary, authoritative, ``gold standard'' data, via simple metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The generative AI revolution would seem to explode this assumption, given the critical role stochastic inference plays. Yet, in spite of public demand for more transparency in AI -- along with strong evidence that humans are unreliable judges -- estimates of model reliability are conventionally based on, at most, a few output responses per input item. We adapt a method, previously used to evaluate the reliability of various metrics and estimators for machine learning evaluation, to determine whether an (existing or planned) dataset has enough responses per item to assure reliable null hypothesis statistical testing. We show that, for many common metrics, collecting even 5-10 responses per item (from each model and team of human evaluators) is not sufficient. We apply our methods to several of the very few extant gold standard test sets with multiple disaggregated responses per item and show that even these datasets lack enough responses per item. We show how our methods can help AI researchers make better decisions about how to collect data for AI evaluation.

### Wrapper-Aware Rate-Distortion Optimization in Feature Coding for Machines
**Authors**: Samuel Fernández-Menduiña, Hyomin Choi, Fabien Racapé, Eduardo Pavez, Antonio Ortega

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:08:48Z

**Summary**: Feature coding for machines (FCM) is a lossy compression paradigm for split-inference. The transmitter encodes the outputs of the first part of a neural network before sending them to the receiver for completing the inference. Practical FCM methods ``sandwich'' a traditional codec between pre- and post-processing neural networks, called wrappers, to make features easier to compress using video codecs. Since traditional codecs are non-differentiable, the wrappers are trained using a proxy codec, which is later replaced by a standard codec after training. These codecs perform rate-distortion optimization (RDO) based on the sum of squared errors (SSE). Because the RDO does not consider the post-processing wrapper, the inner codec can invest bits in preserving information that the post-processing later discards. In this paper, we modify the bit-allocation in the inner codec via a wrapper-aware weighted SSE metric. To make wrapper-aware RDO (WA-RDO) practical for FCM, we propose: 1) temporal reuse of weights across a group of pictures and 2) fixed, architecture- and task-dependent weights trained offline. Under MPEG test conditions, our methods implemented on HEVC match the VVC-based FCM state-of-the-art, effectively bridging a codec generation gap with minimal runtime overhead relative to SSE-RDO HEVC.

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:08:14Z

**Summary**: We present the number density of massive ($ \mathrm{ log (M_{*}/M_{\odot}) > 10.3} $) quiescent galaxies at $2<z<5$ using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectra. This work relies on spectra from RUBIES, which provides excellent data quality and an unparalleled, well-defined targeting strategy to robustly infer physical properties and number densities. We identify quiescent galaxy candidates within RUBIES through principal component analysis and construct a final sample using star formation histories derived from spectro-photometric fitting of the NIRSpec PRISM spectra and NIRCam photometry. By inverting the RUBIES selection function, we correct for survey incompleteness and calculate the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at these redshifts, providing the most complete spectroscopic estimates prior to cosmic noon to date. We find that early massive quiescent galaxies are surprisingly common ($\gtrsim 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ by $4<z<5$), which is consistent with previous studies based on JWST photometry alone and/or in smaller survey areas. We compare our number densities with predictions from six state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy formation simulations. At $z>3$, most simulations fail to produce enough massive quiescent galaxies, suggesting the treatment of feedback and/or the channels for early efficient formation are incomplete in most galaxy evolution models.

### VTC-R1: Vision-Text Compression for Efficient Long-Context Reasoning
**Authors**: Yibo Wang, Yongcheng Jing, Shunyu Liu, Hao Guan, Rong-cheng Tu, Chengyu Wang, Jun Huang, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:07:39Z

**Summary**: Long-context reasoning has significantly empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks, yet it introduces severe efficiency bottlenecks due to the computational complexity. Existing efficient approaches often rely on complex additional training or external models for compression, which limits scalability and discards critical fine-grained information. In this paper, we propose VTC-R1, a new efficient reasoning paradigm that integrates vision-text compression into the reasoning process. Instead of processing lengthy textual traces, VTC-R1 renders intermediate reasoning segments into compact images, which are iteratively fed back into vision-language models as "optical memory." We construct a training dataset based on OpenR1-Math-220K achieving 3.4x token compression and fine-tune representative VLMs-Glyph and Qwen3-VL. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME25, AMC23 and GPQA-D demonstrate that VTC-R1 consistently outperforms standard long-context reasoning. Furthermore, our approach significantly improves inference efficiency, achieving 2.7x speedup in end-to-end latency, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for reasoning-intensive applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/w-yibo/VTC-R1.

### AIRPET: Virtual Positron Emission Tomography
**Authors**: J. Renner, J. J. Gómez-Cadenas, R. Soleti

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:58:27Z

**Summary**: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a powerful medical imaging technique, but the design and evaluation of new PET scanner technologies present significant challenges. The process is typically divided into three major stages: 1. detector design and simulation, 2. image reconstruction, and 3. image interpretation. Each of these stages requires significant expertise, making it difficult for individuals or small teams to manage all three at once. AIRPET (AI-driven Revolution in Positron Emission Tomography) is a web-based platform designed to address this challenge by integrating all phases of PET design into a single, accessible, and AI-assisted workflow. AIRPET provides an interface to large language models (LLMs) for assisted geometry creation and an interface for basic PET image reconstruction with the potential for further expansion. Here we introduce AIRPET and outline its current functionality and proposed additions.

### Learning to Dial-a-Ride: A Deep Graph Reinforcement Learning Approach to the Electric Dial-a-Ride Problem
**Authors**: Sten Elling Tingstad Jacobsen, Attila Lischka, Balázs Kulcsár, Anders Lindman

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:51:04Z

**Summary**: Urban mobility systems are transitioning toward electric, on-demand services, creating operational challenges for fleet management under energy and service-quality constraints. The Electric Dial-a-Ride Problem (E-DARP) extends the classical dial-a-ride problem by incorporating limited battery capacity and nonlinear charging dynamics, increasing computational complexity and limiting the scalability of exact methods for real-time use. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning approach based on a graph neural network encoder and an attention-driven route construction policy. By operating directly on edge attributes such as travel time and energy consumption, the method captures non-Euclidean, asymmetric, and energy-dependent routing costs in real road networks. The learned policy jointly optimizes routing, charging, and service quality without relying on Euclidean assumptions or handcrafted heuristics. The approach is evaluated on two case studies using ride-sharing data from San Francisco. On benchmark instances, the method achieves solutions within 0.4% of best-known results while reducing computation times by orders of magnitude. A second case study considers large-scale instances with up to 250 request pairs, realistic energy models, and nonlinear charging. On these instances, the learned policy outperforms Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) by 9.5% in solution quality while achieving 100% service completion, with sub-second inference times compared to hours for the metaheuristic. Finally, sensitivity analyses quantify the impact of battery capacity, fleet size, ride-sharing capacity, and reward weights, while robustness experiments show that deterministically trained policies generalize effectively under stochastic conditions.

### MasalBench: A Benchmark for Contextual and Cross-Cultural Understanding of Persian Proverbs in LLMs
**Authors**: Ghazal Kalhor, Behnam Bahrak

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:49:44Z

**Summary**: In recent years, multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an inseparable part of daily life, making it crucial for them to master the rules of conversational language in order to communicate effectively with users. While previous work has evaluated LLMs' understanding of figurative language in high-resource languages, their performance in low-resource languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MasalBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' contextual and cross-cultural understanding of Persian proverbs, which are a key component of conversation in this low-resource language. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs on MasalBench and find that they perform well in identifying Persian proverbs in context, achieving accuracies above 0.90. However, their performance drops considerably when tasked with identifying equivalent English proverbs, with the best model achieving 0.79 accuracy. Our findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in cultural knowledge and analogical reasoning, and they provide a framework for assessing cross-cultural understanding in other low-resource languages. MasalBench is available at https://github.com/kalhorghazal/MasalBench.

### On the Paradoxical Interference between Instruction-Following and Task Solving
**Authors**: Yunjia Qi, Hao Peng, Xintong Shi, Amy Xin, Xiaozhi Wang, Bin Xu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:48:56Z

**Summary**: Instruction following aims to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent by specifying explicit constraints on how tasks should be performed. However, we reveal a counterintuitive phenomenon: instruction following can paradoxically interfere with LLMs' task-solving capability. We propose a metric, SUSTAINSCORE, to quantify the interference of instruction following with task solving. It measures task performance drop after inserting into the instruction a self-evident constraint, which is naturally met by the original successful model output and extracted from it. Experiments on current LLMs in mathematics, multi-hop QA, and code generation show that adding the self-evident constraints leads to substantial performance drops, even for advanced models such as Claude-Sonnet-4.5. We validate the generality of the interference across constraint types and scales. Furthermore, we identify common failure patterns, and by investigating the mechanisms of interference, we observe that failed cases allocate significantly more attention to constraints compared to successful ones. Finally, we use SUSTAINSCORE to conduct an initial investigation into how distinct post-training paradigms affect the interference, presenting empirical observations on current alignment strategies. We will release our code and data to facilitate further research

### A Bayesian approach to the survivor average causal effect in cluster-randomized crossover trials
**Authors**: Dane Isenberg, Michael O. Harhay, Andrew B. Forbes, Paul J. Young, Fan Li, Nandita Mitra

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:45:01Z

**Summary**: In cluster-randomized crossover (CRXO) trials, groups of individuals are randomly assigned to two or more sequences of alternating treatments. Since clusters serve as their own control, the CRXO design is typically more statistically efficient than the usual parallel-arm design. CRXO trials are increasingly popular in many areas of health research where the number of available clusters is limited. Further, in trials among severely ill patients, researchers often want to assess the effect of treatments on secondary non-terminal outcomes, but frequently in these studies, there are patients who do not survive to have these measurements fully recorded. In this paper, we provide a causal inference framework and treatment effect estimation methods for addressing truncation by death in the setting of CRXO trials. We target the survivor average causal effect (SACE) estimand, a well-defined subgroup treatment effect obtained via principal stratification. We propose novel structural and standard modeling assumptions that enable estimating the SACE within a Bayesian paradigm. We evaluate the small-sample performance of our proposed Bayesian approach for estimation of the SACE in CRXO trial settings via simulation studies. We apply our methods to a previously conducted two-period cross-sectional CRXO study examining the impact of proton pump inhibitors compared to histamine-2 receptor blockers on length of hospitalization among adults requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

### Optimizing Agentic Workflows using Meta-tools
**Authors**: Sami Abuzakuk, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Rishi Sharma, Rasmus Moorits Veski, Martijn de Vos

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:43:08Z

**Summary**: Agentic AI enables LLM to dynamically reason, plan, and interact with tools to solve complex tasks. However, agentic workflows often require many iterative reasoning steps and tool invocations, leading to significant operational expense, end-to-end latency and failures due to hallucinations. This work introduces Agent Workflow Optimization (AWO), a framework that identifies and optimizes redundant tool execution patterns to improve the efficiency and robustness of agentic workflows. AWO analyzes existing workflow traces to discover recurring sequences of tool calls and transforms them into meta-tools, which are deterministic, composite tools that bundle multiple agent actions into a single invocation. Meta-tools bypass unnecessary intermediate LLM reasoning steps and reduce operational cost while also shortening execution paths, leading to fewer failures. Experiments on two agentic AI benchmarks show that AWO reduces the number of LLM calls up to 11.9% while also increasing the task success rate by up to 4.2 percent points.

### Causal Autoregressive Diffusion Language Model
**Authors**: Junhao Ruan, Bei Li, Yongjing Yin, Pengcheng Huang, Xin Chen, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai, Tong Xiao, JingBo Zhu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:38:29Z

**Summary**: In this work, we propose Causal Autoregressive Diffusion (CARD), a novel framework that unifies the training efficiency of ARMs with the high-throughput inference of diffusion models. CARD reformulates the diffusion process within a strictly causal attention mask, enabling dense, per-token supervision in a single forward pass. To address the optimization instability of causal diffusion, we introduce a soft-tailed masking schema to preserve local context and a context-aware reweighting mechanism derived from signal-to-noise principles. This design enables dynamic parallel decoding, where the model leverages KV-caching to adaptively generate variable-length token sequences based on confidence. Empirically, CARD outperforms existing discrete diffusion baselines while reducing training latency by 3 $\times$ compared to block diffusion methods. Our results demonstrate that CARD achieves ARM-level data efficiency while unlocking the latency benefits of parallel generation, establishing a robust paradigm for next-generation efficient LLMs.

### OD-Stega: LLM-Based Relatively Secure Steganography via Optimized Distributions
**Authors**: Yu-Shin Huang, Peter Just, Hanyun Yin, Krishna Narayanan, Ruihong Huang, Chao Tian

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:37:33Z

**Summary**: We consider coverless steganography where a Large Language Model (LLM) is used to generate stego-texts in combination with arithmetic coding. An efficient method should embed secret bits in as few language tokens as possible while keeping the stego-text as natural as possible. We show that this problem is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of a replacement probability distribution of the next token generation, subject to a constraint on the divergence between the new distribution and the original one produced by the LLM. A closed-form solution is provided under either the KL divergence or the total variation constraint. Several important practical issues are also tackled: 1) An often-overlooked tokenization mismatch issue is resolved with a simple prompt selection approach, 2) The combination of the optimized distribution and the vocabulary truncation technique is considered, and 3) The incorporation of the proposed approach with existing (potentially non arithmetic coding based) techniques, e.g., the Discop technique.

### Per-parameter Task Arithmetic for Unlearning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chengyi Cai, Zesheng Ye, Jiangchao Yao, Jianzhong Qi, Bo Han, Xiaolu Zhang, Feng Liu, Jun Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:35:32Z

**Summary**: In large language model (LLM) unlearning, private information is required to be removed. Task arithmetic unlearns by subtracting a specific task vector (TV)--defined as the parameter difference between a privacy-information-tuned model and the original model. While efficient, it can cause over-forgetting by disrupting parameters essential for retaining other information. Motivated by the observation that each parameter exhibits different importance for forgetting versus retention, we propose a per-parameter task arithmetic (PerTA) mechanism to rescale the TV, allowing per-parameter adjustment. These weights quantify the relative importance of each parameter for forgetting versus retention, estimated via gradients (i.e., PerTA-grad) or the diagonal Fisher information approximation (i.e., PerTA-fisher). Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of PerTA, extend it to a more general form, and provide further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PerTA consistently improves upon standard TV, and in many cases surpasses widely used training-based unlearning methods in both forgetting effectiveness and overall model utility. By retaining the efficiency of task arithmetic while mitigating over-forgetting, PerTA offers a principled and practical framework for LLM unlearning.

### Align & Invert: Solving Inverse Problems with Diffusion and Flow-based Models via Representation Alignment
**Authors**: Loukas Sfountouris, Giannis Daras, Paris Giampouras

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:34:58Z

**Summary**: Enforcing alignment between the internal representations of diffusion or flow-based generative models and those of pretrained self-supervised encoders has recently been shown to provide a powerful inductive bias, improving both convergence and sample quality. In this work, we extend this idea to inverse problems, where pretrained generative models are employed as priors. We propose applying representation alignment (REPA) between diffusion or flow-based models and a DINOv2 visual encoder, to guide the reconstruction process at inference time. Although ground-truth signals are unavailable in inverse problems, we empirically show that aligning model representations of approximate target features can substantially enhance reconstruction quality and perceptual realism. We provide theoretical results showing (a) that REPA regularization can be viewed as a variational approach for minimizing a divergence measure in the DINOv2 embedding space, and (b) how under certain regularity assumptions REPA updates steer the latent diffusion states toward those of the clean image. These results offer insights into the role of REPA in improving perceptual fidelity. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by We integrate REPA into multiple state-of-the-art inverse problem solvers, and provide extensive experiments on super-resolution, box inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring confirming that our method consistently improves reconstruction quality, while also providing efficiency gains reducing the number of required discretization steps.

### The Ensemble Inverse Problem: Applications and Methods
**Authors**: Zhengyan Huan, Camila Pazos, Martin Klassen, Vincent Croft, Pierre-Hugues Beauchemin, Shuchin Aeron

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:34:41Z

**Summary**: We introduce a new multivariate statistical problem that we refer to as the Ensemble Inverse Problem (EIP). The aim of EIP is to invert for an ensemble that is distributed according to the pushforward of a prior under a forward process. In high energy physics (HEP), this is related to a widely known problem called unfolding, which aims to reconstruct the true physics distribution of quantities, such as momentum and angle, from measurements that are distorted by detector effects. In recent applications, the EIP also arises in full waveform inversion (FWI) and inverse imaging with unknown priors. We propose non-iterative inference-time methods that construct posterior samplers based on a new class of conditional generative models, which we call ensemble inverse generative models. For the posterior modeling, these models additionally use the ensemble information contained in the observation set on top of single measurements. Unlike existing methods, our proposed methods avoid explicit and iterative use of the forward model at inference time via training across several sets of truth-observation pairs that are consistent with the same forward model, but originate from a wide range of priors. We demonstrate that this training procedure implicitly encodes the likelihood model. The use of ensemble information helps posterior inference and enables generalization to unseen priors. We benchmark the proposed method on several synthetic and real datasets in inverse imaging, HEP, and FWI. The codes are available at https://github.com/ZhengyanHuan/The-Ensemble-Inverse-Problem--Applications-and-Methods.

### From Logits to Latents: Contrastive Representation Shaping for LLM Unlearning
**Authors**: Haoran Tang, Rajiv Khanna

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:34:37Z

**Summary**: Most LLM unlearning methods aim to approximate retrain-from-scratch behaviors with minimal distribution shift, often via alignment-style objectives defined in the prediction space. While effective at reducing forgotten content generation, such approaches may act as suppression: forgotten concepts can persist in representations and remain entangled with retained knowledge. We introduce CLReg, a contrastive representation regularizer that identifies forget features while pushing them away from retain features, explicitly reducing forget-retain interference with minimal shifts on retain features. We provide first theoretical insights that relate representation shaping to entanglement reduction. Across unlearning benchmarks and LLMs of different sizes, CLReg decreases forget-retain representation entanglement that facilitates mainstream unlearning methods without positing extra privacy risks, inspiring future work that reshapes the representation space to remove forget concepts.

### CAR-bench: Evaluating the Consistency and Limit-Awareness of LLM Agents under Real-World Uncertainty
**Authors**: Johannes Kirmayr, Lukas Stappen, Elisabeth André

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:33:42Z

**Summary**: Existing benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents focus on task completion under idealistic settings but overlook reliability in real-world, user-facing applications. In domains, such as in-car voice assistants, users often issue incomplete or ambiguous requests, creating intrinsic uncertainty that agents must manage through dialogue, tool use, and policy adherence. We introduce CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant domain. The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Beyond standard task completion, CAR-bench introduces Hallucination tasks that test agents' limit-awareness under missing tools or information, and Disambiguation tasks that require resolving uncertainty through clarification or internal information gathering. Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types. Even frontier reasoning LLMs achieve less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information to satisfy user requests in Hallucination tasks, underscoring the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings.

### When "Better" Prompts Hurt: Evaluation-Driven Iteration for LLM Applications
**Authors**: Daniel Commey

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:32:34Z

**Summary**: Evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) applications differs from traditional software testing because outputs are stochastic, high-dimensional, and sensitive to prompt and model changes. We present an evaluation-driven workflow - Define, Test, Diagnose, Fix - that turns these challenges into a repeatable engineering loop.   We introduce the Minimum Viable Evaluation Suite (MVES), a tiered set of recommended evaluation components for (i) general LLM applications, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and (iii) agentic tool-use workflows. We also synthesize common evaluation methods (automated checks, human rubrics, and LLM-as-judge) and discuss known judge failure modes.   In reproducible local experiments (Ollama; Llama 3 8B Instruct and Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct), we observe that a generic "improved" prompt template can trade off behaviors: on our small structured suites, extraction pass rate decreased from 100% to 90% and RAG compliance from 93.3% to 80% for Llama 3 when replacing task-specific prompts with generic rules, while instruction-following improved. These findings motivate evaluation-driven prompt iteration and careful claim calibration rather than universal prompt recipes.   All test suites, harnesses, and results are included for reproducibility.

### RobustExplain: Evaluating Robustness of LLM-Based Explanation Agents for Recommendation
**Authors**: Guilin Zhang, Kai Zhao, Jeffrey Friedman, Xu Chu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:28:56Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate natural-language explanations in recommender systems, acting as explanation agents that reason over user behavior histories. While prior work has focused on explanation fluency and relevance under fixed inputs, the robustness of LLM-generated explanations to realistic user behavior noise remains largely unexplored. In real-world web platforms, interaction histories are inherently noisy due to accidental clicks, temporal inconsistencies, missing values, and evolving preferences, raising concerns about explanation stability and user trust. We present RobustExplain, the first systematic evaluation framework for measuring the robustness of LLM-generated recommendation explanations. RobustExplain introduces five realistic user behavior perturbations evaluated across multiple severity levels and a multi-dimensional robustness metric capturing semantic, keyword, structural, and length consistency. Our goal is to establish a principled, task-level evaluation framework and initial robustness baselines, rather than to provide a comprehensive leaderboard across all available LLMs. Experiments on four representative LLMs (7B--70B) show that current models exhibit only moderate robustness, with larger models achieving up to 8% higher stability. Our results establish the first robustness benchmarks for explanation agents and highlight robustness as a critical dimension for trustworthy, agent-driven recommender systems at web scale.

### Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization for Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning
**Authors**: Chengyi Cai, Zesheng Ye, Peike Li, Bo Han, Jianzhong Qi, Feng Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:26:54Z

**Summary**: Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the model from revealing private information when queried about target images. Existing MLLM unlearning methods largely adopt approaches developed for LLMs. They treat all answer tokens uniformly, disregarding their varying importance in the unlearning process. Moreover, these methods focus exclusively on the language modality, disregarding visual cues that indicate key tokens in answers. In this paper, after formulating the problem of unlearning in multimodal question answering for MLLMs, we propose Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization (ViKeR). We leverage irrelevant visual inputs to predict ideal post-unlearning token-level distributions and use these distributions to regularize the unlearning process, thereby prioritizing key tokens. Further, we define key tokens in unlearning via information entropy and discuss ViKeR's effectiveness through token-level gradient reweighting, which amplifies updates on key tokens. Experiments on MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that our method effectively performs unlearning while mitigating forgetting and maintaining response coherence.

### PocketDP3: Efficient Pocket-Scale 3D Visuomotor Policy
**Authors**: Jinhao Zhang, Zhexuan Zhou, Huizhe Li, Yichen Lai, Wenlong Xia, Haoming Song, Youmin Gong, Jie Me

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:23:25Z

**Summary**: Recently, 3D vision-based diffusion policies have shown strong capability in learning complex robotic manipulation skills. However, a common architectural mismatch exists in these models: a tiny yet efficient point-cloud encoder is often paired with a massive decoder. Given a compact scene representation, we argue that this may lead to substantial parameter waste in the decoder. Motivated by this observation, we propose PocketDP3, a pocket-scale 3D diffusion policy that replaces the heavy conditional U-Net decoder used in prior methods with a lightweight Diffusion Mixer (DiM) built on MLP-Mixer blocks. This architecture enables efficient fusion across temporal and channel dimensions, significantly reducing model size. Notably, without any additional consistency distillation techniques, our method supports two-step inference without sacrificing performance, improving practicality for real-time deployment. Across three simulation benchmarks--RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld--PocketDP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer than 1% of the parameters of prior methods, while also accelerating inference. Real-world experiments further demonstrate the practicality and transferability of our method in real-world settings. Code will be released.

### TBDFiltering: Sample-Efficient Tree-Based Data Filtering
**Authors**: Robert Istvan Busa-Fekete, Julian Zimmert, Anne Xiangyi Zheng, Claudio Gentile, Andras Gyorgy

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:22:06Z

**Summary**: The quality of machine learning models depends heavily on their training data. Selecting high-quality, diverse training sets for large language models (LLMs) is a difficult task, due to the lack of cheap and reliable quality metrics. While querying existing LLMs for document quality is common, this is not scalable to the large number (billions) of documents used in training. Instead, practitioners often use classifiers trained on sparse quality signals. In this paper, we propose a text-embedding-based hierarchical clustering approach that adaptively selects the documents to be evaluated by the LLM to estimate cluster quality. We prove that our method is query efficient: under the assumption that the hierarchical clustering contains a subtree such that each leaf cluster in the tree is pure enough (i.e., it mostly contains either only good or only bad documents), with high probability, the method can correctly predict the quality of each document after querying a small number of documents. The number of such documents is proportional to the size of the smallest subtree with (almost) pure leaves, without the algorithm knowing this subtree in advance. Furthermore, in a comprehensive experimental study, we demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm compared to other classifier-based filtering methods.

### Adaptive Swarm Mesh Refinement using Deep Reinforcement Learning with Local Rewards
**Authors**: Niklas Freymuth, Philipp Dahlinger, Tobias Würth, Simon Reisch, Luise Kärger, Gerhard Neumann

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:22:03Z

**Summary**: Simulating physical systems is essential in engineering, but analytical solutions are limited to straightforward problems. Consequently, numerical methods like the Finite Element Method (FEM) are widely used. However, the FEM becomes computationally expensive as problem complexity and accuracy demands increase. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) improves the FEM by dynamically placing mesh elements on the domain, balancing computational speed and accuracy. Classical AMR depends on heuristics or expensive error estimators, which may lead to suboptimal performance for complex simulations. While AMR methods based on machine learning are promising, they currently only scale to simple problems. In this work, we formulate AMR as a system of collaborating, homogeneous agents that iteratively split into multiple new agents. This agent-wise perspective enables a spatial reward formulation focused on reducing the maximum mesh element error. Our approach, Adaptive Swarm Mesh Refinement++ (ASMR++), offers efficient, stable optimization and generates highly adaptive meshes at user-defined resolution at inference time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ASMR++ outperforms heuristic approaches and learned baselines, matching the performance of expensive error-based oracle AMR strategies. ASMR additionally generalizes to different domains during inference, and produces meshes that simulate up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than uniform refinements in more demanding settings.

### Exploring Diverse Generation Paths via Inference-time Stiefel Activation Steering
**Authors**: Dongxuan Zhu, Ly Tran Ho Khanh, Andy Yat-Ming Cheung, Man-Chung Yue, Viet Anh Nguyen

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:17:04Z

**Summary**: Language models often default to a narrow set of high-probability outputs, leaving their generation paths homogeneous and prone to mode collapse. Sampling-based strategies inject randomness but still struggle to guarantee diversity across multiple concurrent generation runs. We address this limitation by introducing STARS ($\textbf{St}$iefel-based $\textbf{A}$ctivation Steering for Diverse $\textbf{R}$ea$\textbf{S}$oning), a training-free, inference-time intervention method that transforms activation steering into an exploration engine. At each token, STARS collects the hidden activations of concurrent generation runs and optimizes multiple additive steering directions jointly on the Stiefel manifold. STARS maximizes the geometric volume of the steered activations, while the Stiefel manifold induces orthogonality of the steering interventions. This formulation explicitly promotes divergent activation vectors of concurrent generation runs, and implicitly promotes divergent generation trajectories. This manifold optimization formulation can be solved using a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm with convergence guarantees, but this algorithm is too time-consuming for real-time inference. To guarantee low latency, we further design a lightweight one-step update with an aggressive, closed-form stepsize. For test case generation and scientific discovery benchmarks, STARS consistently outperforms standard sampling methods, achieving greater diversity without sacrificing qualitative performance.

### LANCER: LLM Reranking for Nugget Coverage
**Authors**: Jia-Huei Ju, François G. Landry, Eugene Yang, Suzan Verberne, Andrew Yates

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:16:17Z

**Summary**: Unlike short-form retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), such as factoid question answering, long-form RAG requires retrieval to provide documents covering a wide range of relevant information. Automated report generation exemplifies this setting: it requires not only relevant information but also a more elaborate response with comprehensive information. Yet, existing retrieval methods are primarily optimized for relevance ranking rather than information coverage. To address this limitation, we propose LANCER, an LLM-based reranking method for nugget coverage. LANCER predicts what sub-questions should be answered to satisfy an information need, predicts which documents answer these sub-questions, and reranks documents in order to provide a ranked list covering as many information nuggets as possible. Our empirical results show that LANCER enhances the quality of retrieval as measured by nugget coverage metrics, achieving higher $α$-nDCG and information coverage than other LLM-based reranking methods. Our oracle analysis further reveals that sub-question generation plays an essential role.

### Rate-Distortion Optimization for Transformer Inference
**Authors**: Anderson de Andrade, Alon Harell, Ivan V. Bajić

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:12:46Z

**Summary**: Transformers achieve superior performance on many tasks, but impose heavy compute and memory requirements during inference. This inference can be made more efficient by partitioning the process across multiple devices, which, in turn, requires compressing its intermediate representations. In this work, we introduce a principled rate-distortion-based framework for lossy compression that learns compact encodings that explicitly trade off bitrate against accuracy. Experiments on language benchmarks show that the proposed codec achieves substantial savings with improved accuracy in some cases, outperforming more complex baseline methods. We characterize and analyze the rate-distortion performance of transformers, offering a unified lens for understanding performance in representation coding. This formulation extends information-theoretic concepts to define the gap between rate and entropy, and derive some of its bounds. We further develop probably approximately correct (PAC)-style bounds for estimating this gap. For different architectures and tasks, we empirically demonstrate that their rates are driven by these bounds, adding to the explainability of the formulation.

### Heterogeneous Computing: The Key to Powering the Future of AI Agent Inference
**Authors**: Yiren Zhao, Junyi Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:11:46Z

**Summary**: AI agent inference is driving an inference heavy datacenter future and exposes bottlenecks beyond compute - especially memory capacity, memory bandwidth and high-speed interconnect. We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference.

### LLMs as Orchestrators: Constraint-Compliant Multi-Agent Optimization for Recommendation Systems
**Authors**: Guilin Zhang, Kai Zhao, Jeffrey Friedman, Xu Chu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:11:09Z

**Summary**: Recommendation systems must optimize multiple objectives while satisfying hard business constraints such as fairness and coverage. For example, an e-commerce platform may require every recommendation list to include items from multiple sellers and at least one newly listed product; violating such constraints--even once--is unacceptable in production. Prior work on multi-objective recommendation and recent LLM-based recommender agents largely treat constraints as soft penalties or focus on item scoring and interaction, leading to frequent violations in real-world deployments. How to leverage LLMs for coordinating constrained optimization in recommendation systems remains underexplored. We propose DualAgent-Rec, an LLM-coordinated dual-agent framework for constrained multi-objective e-commerce recommendation. The framework separates optimization into an Exploitation Agent that prioritizes accuracy under hard constraints and an Exploration Agent that promotes diversity through unconstrained Pareto search. An LLM-based coordinator adaptively allocates resources between agents based on optimization progress and constraint satisfaction, while an adaptive epsilon-relaxation mechanism guarantees feasibility of final solutions. Experiments on the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset demonstrate that DualAgent-Rec achieves 100% constraint satisfaction and improves Pareto hypervolume by 4-6% over strong baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy-diversity trade-offs. These results indicate that LLMs can act as effective orchestration agents for deployable and constraint-compliant recommendation systems.

### Causal World Modeling for Robot Control

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:07:43Z

**Summary**: This work highlights that video world modeling, alongside vision-language pre-training, establishes a fresh and independent foundation for robot learning. Intuitively, video world models provide the ability to imagine the near future by understanding the causality between actions and visual dynamics. Inspired by this, we introduce LingBot-VA, an autoregressive diffusion framework that learns frame prediction and policy execution simultaneously. Our model features three carefully crafted designs: (1) a shared latent space, integrating vision and action tokens, driven by a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, (2) a closed-loop rollout mechanism, allowing for ongoing acquisition of environmental feedback with ground-truth observations, (3) an asynchronous inference pipeline, parallelizing action prediction and motor execution to support efficient control. We evaluate our model on both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios, where it shows significant promise in long-horizon manipulation, data efficiency in post-training, and strong generalizability to novel configurations. The code and model are made publicly available to facilitate the community.

### Mechanistic Data Attribution: Tracing the Training Origins of Interpretable LLM Units
**Authors**: Jianhui Chen, Yuzhang Luo, Liangming Pan

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:06:54Z

**Summary**: While Mechanistic Interpretability has identified interpretable circuits in LLMs, their causal origins in training data remain elusive. We introduce Mechanistic Data Attribution (MDA), a scalable framework that employs Influence Functions to trace interpretable units back to specific training samples. Through extensive experiments on the Pythia family, we causally validate that targeted intervention--removing or augmenting a small fraction of high-influence samples--significantly modulates the emergence of interpretable heads, whereas random interventions show no effect. Our analysis reveals that repetitive structural data (e.g., LaTeX, XML) acts as a mechanistic catalyst. Furthermore, we observe that interventions targeting induction head formation induce a concurrent change in the model's in-context learning (ICL) capability. This provides direct causal evidence for the long-standing hypothesis regarding the functional link between induction heads and ICL. Finally, we propose a mechanistic data augmentation pipeline that consistently accelerates circuit convergence across model scales, providing a principled methodology for steering the developmental trajectories of LLMs.

### SpecTran: Spectral-Aware Transformer-based Adapter for LLM-Enhanced Sequential Recommendation
**Authors**: Yu Cui, Feng Liu, Zhaoxiang Wang, Changwang Zhang, Jun Wang, Can Wang, Jiawei Chen

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:00:27Z

**Summary**: Traditional sequential recommendation (SR) models learn low-dimensional item ID embeddings from user-item interactions, often overlooking textual information such as item titles or descriptions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have inspired a surge of research that encodes item textual information with high-dimensional semantic embeddings, and designs transformation methods to inject such embeddings into SR models. These embedding transformation strategies can be categorized into two types, both of which exhibits notable drawbacks: 1) adapter-based methods suffer from pronounced dimension collapse, concentrating information into a few dominant dimensions; 2) SVD-based methods are rigid and manual, considering only a few principal spectral components while discarding rich information in the remaining spectrum.   To address these limitations, we propose SpecTran, a spectral-aware transformer-based adapter that operates in the spectral domain, attending to the full spectrum to select and aggregates informative components. A learnable spectral-position encoding injects singular-value cues as an inductive bias, guiding attention toward salient spectral components and promoting diversity across embedding dimensions. Across four real-world datasets and three SR backbones, it consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving an average improvement of 9.17%.

### Elign: Equivariant Diffusion Model Alignment from Foundational Machine Learning Force Fields
**Authors**: Yunyang Li, Lin Huang, Luojia Xia, Wenhe Zhang, Mark Gerstein

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:00:09Z

**Summary**: Generative models for 3D molecular conformations must respect Euclidean symmetries and concentrate probability mass on thermodynamically favorable, mechanically stable structures. However, E(3)-equivariant diffusion models often reproduce biases from semi-empirical training data rather than capturing the equilibrium distribution of a high-fidelity Hamiltonian. While physics-based guidance can correct this, it faces two computational bottlenecks: expensive quantum-chemical evaluations (e.g., DFT) and the need to repeat such queries at every sampling step. We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently. Experiments show that Elign generates conformations with lower gold-standard DFT energies and forces, while improving stability. Crucially, inference remains as fast as unguided sampling, since no energy evaluations are required during generation.

### Investigating Batch Inference in a Sequential Monte Carlo Framework for Neural Networks
**Authors**: Andrew Millard, Joshua Murphy, Peter Green, Simon Maskell

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:59:31Z

**Summary**: Bayesian inference allows us to define a posterior distribution over the weights of a generic neural network (NN). Exact posteriors are usually intractable, in which case approximations can be employed. One such approximation - variational inference - is computationally efficient when using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent as subsets of the data are used for likelihood and gradient evaluations, though the approach relies on the selection of a variational distribution which sufficiently matches the form of the posterior. Particle-based methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) do not assume a parametric family for the posterior by typically require higher computational cost. These sampling methods typically use the full-batch of data for likelihood and gradient evaluations, which contributes to this computational expense. We explore several methods of gradually introducing more mini-batches of data (data annealing) into likelihood and gradient evaluations of an SMC sampler. We find that we can achieve up to $6\times$ faster training with minimal loss in accuracy on benchmark image classification problems using NNs.

**Summary**: Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) aims to predict future events by inferring missing entities with dynamic knowledge structures. Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs. This limits structural information understanding, leading to unstructured, hallucination-prone inferences especially with temporal inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets. Additionally, we execute ablation studies and additional analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component.

### Utilising Gradient-Based Proposals Within Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers for Training of Partial Bayesian Neural Networks
**Authors**: Andrew Millard, Joshua Murphy, Simon Maskell, Zheng Zhao

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:52:32Z

**Summary**: Partial Bayesian neural networks (pBNNs) have been shown to perform competitively with fully Bayesian neural networks while only having a subset of the parameters be stochastic. Using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers as the inference method for pBNNs gives a non-parametric probabilistic estimation of the stochastic parameters, and has shown improved performance over parametric methods. In this paper we introduce a new SMC-based training method for pBNNs by utilising a guided proposal and incorporating gradient-based Markov kernels, which gives us better scalability on high dimensional problems. We show that our new method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of predictive performance and optimal loss. We also show that pBNNs scale well with larger batch sizes, resulting in significantly reduced training times and often better performance.

### Learning Decentralized LLM Collaboration with Multi-Agent Actor Critic
**Authors**: Shuo Liu, Tianle Chen, Ryan Amiri, Christopher Amato

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:50:30Z

**Summary**: Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

### Token-Guard: Towards Token-Level Hallucination Control via Self-Checking Decoding
**Authors**: Yifan Zhu, Huiqiang Rong, Haoran Luo

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:48:47Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate, generating content inconsistent with the input. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can mitigate hallucinations but require resource-intensive retrieval or large-scale fine-tuning. Decoding-based methods are lighter yet lack explicit hallucination control. To address this, we present Token-Guard, a token-level hallucination control method based on self-checking decoding. Token-Guard performs internal verification at each reasoning step to detect hallucinated tokens before they propagate. Candidate fragments are further evaluated in a latent space with explicit hallucination risk scoring, while iterative pruning and regeneration dynamically correct detected errors. Experiments on HALU datasets show Token-Guard substantially reduces hallucinations and improves generation accuracy, offering a scalable, modular solution for reliable LLM outputs. Our code is publicly available.

### Cognitive Load Estimation Using Brain Foundation Models and Interpretability for BCIs
**Authors**: Deeksha M. Shama, Dimitra Emmanouilidou, Ivan J. Tashev

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:43:20Z

**Summary**: Accurately monitoring cognitive load in real time is critical for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) that adapt to user engagement and support personalized learning. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive, cost-effective modality for capturing neural activity, though traditional methods often struggle with cross-subject variability and task-specific preprocessing. We propose leveraging Brain Foundation Models (BFMs), large pre-trained neural networks, to extract generalizable EEG features for cognitive load estimation. We adapt BFMs for long-term EEG monitoring and show that fine-tuning a small subset of layers yields improved accuracy over the state-of-the-art. Despite their scale, BFMs allow for real-time inference with a longer context window. To address often-overlooked interpretability challenges, we apply Partition SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify feature importance. Our findings reveal consistent emphasis on prefrontal regions linked to cognitive control, while longitudinal trends suggest learning progression. These results position BFMs as efficient and interpretable tools for continuous cognitive load monitoring in real-world BCIs.

### From Tokens to Blocks: A Block-Diffusion Perspective on Molecular Generation
**Authors**: Qianwei Yang, Dong Xu, Zhangfan Yang, Sisi Yuan, Zexuan Zhu, Jianqiang Li, Junkai Ji

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:42:24Z

**Summary**: Drug discovery can be viewed as a combinatorial search over an immense chemical space, motivating the development of deep generative models for de novo molecular design. Among these, GPT-based molecular language models (MLM) have shown strong molecular design performance by learning chemical syntax and semantics from large-scale data. However, existing MLMs face two fundamental limitations: they inadequately capture the graph-structured nature of molecules when formulated as next-token prediction problems, and they typically lack explicit mechanisms for target-aware generation. Here, we propose SoftMol, a unified framework that co-designs molecular representation, model architecture, and search strategy for target-aware molecular generation. SoftMol introduces soft fragments, a rule-free block representation of SMILES that enables diffusion-native modeling, and develops SoftBD, the first block-diffusion molecular language model that combines local bidirectional diffusion with autoregressive generation under molecular structural constraints. To favor generated molecules with high drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility, SoftBD is trained on a carefully curated dataset named ZINC-Curated. SoftMol further integrates a gated Monte Carlo tree search to assemble fragments in a target-aware manner. Experimental results show that, compared with current state-of-the-art models, SoftMol achieves 100% chemical validity, improves binding affinity by 9.7%, yields a 2-3x increase in molecular diversity, and delivers a 6.6x speedup in inference efficiency.

### Industrialized Deception: The Collateral Effects of LLM-Generated Misinformation on Digital Ecosystems
**Authors**: Alexander Loth, Martin Kappes, Marc-Oliver Pahl

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:42:22Z

**Summary**: Generative AI and misinformation research has evolved since our 2024 survey. This paper presents an updated perspective, transitioning from literature review to practical countermeasures. We report on changes in the threat landscape, including improved AI-generated content through Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal systems. Central to this work are our practical contributions: JudgeGPT, a platform for evaluating human perception of AI-generated news, and RogueGPT, a controlled stimulus generation engine for research. Together, these tools form an experimental pipeline for studying how humans perceive and detect AI-generated misinformation. Our findings show that detection capabilities have improved, but the competition between generation and detection continues. We discuss mitigation strategies including LLM-based detection, inoculation approaches, and the dual-use nature of generative AI. This work contributes to research addressing the adverse impacts of AI on information quality.

### Incorporating the ChEES Criterion into Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers
**Authors**: Andrew Millard, Joshua Murphy, Daniel Frisch, Simon Maskell

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:37:47Z

**Summary**: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are a powerful but computationally expensive way of performing non-parametric Bayesian inference. MCMC proposals which utilise gradients, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), can better explore the parameter space of interest if the additional hyper-parameters are chosen well. The No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) is a variant of HMC which is extremely effective at selecting these hyper-parameters but is slow to run and is not suited to GPU architectures. An alternative to NUTS, Change in the Estimator of the Expected Square HMC (ChEES-HMC) was shown not only to run faster than NUTS on GPU but also sample from posteriors more efficiently. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers are another sampling method which instead output weighted samples from the posterior. They are very amenable to parallelisation and therefore being run on GPUs while having additional flexibility in their choice of proposal over MCMC. We incorporate (ChEEs-HMC) as a proposal into SMC samplers and demonstrate competitive but faster performance than NUTS on a number of tasks.

### RNAGenScape: Property-Guided, Optimized Generation of mRNA Sequences with Manifold Langevin Dynamics
**Authors**: Danqi Liao, Chen Liu, Xingzhi Sun, Dié Tang, Haochen Wang, Scott Youlten, Srikar Krishna Gopinath, Haejeong Lee, Ethan C. Strayer, Antonio J. Giraldez, Smita Krishnaswamy

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:34:46Z

**Summary**: Generating property-optimized mRNA sequences is central to applications such as vaccine design and protein replacement therapy, but remains challenging due to limited data, complex sequence-function relationships, and the narrow space of biologically viable sequences. Generative methods that drift away from the data manifold can yield sequences that fail to fold, translate poorly, or are otherwise nonfunctional. We present RNAGenScape, a property-guided manifold Langevin dynamics framework for mRNA sequence generation that operates directly on a learned manifold of real data. By performing iterative local optimization constrained to this manifold, RNAGenScape preserves biological viability, accesses reliable guidance, and avoids excursions into nonfunctional regions of the ambient sequence space. The framework integrates three components: (1) an autoencoder jointly trained with a property predictor to learn a property-organized latent manifold, (2) a denoising autoencoder that projects updates back onto the manifold, and (3) a property-guided Langevin dynamics procedure that performs optimization along the manifold. Across three real-world mRNA datasets spanning two orders of magnitude in size, RNAGenScape increases median property gain by up to 148% and success rate by up to 30% while ensuring biological viability of generated sequences, and achieves competitive inference efficiency relative to existing generative approaches.

### SAC-GLAM: Improving Online RL for LLM agents with Soft Actor-Critic and Hindsight Relabeling
**Authors**: Loris Gaven, Clement Romac, Thomas Carta, Sylvain Lamprier, Olivier Sigaud, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:31:07Z

**Summary**: The past years have seen Large Language Models (LLMs) strive not only as generative models but also as agents solving textual sequential decision-making tasks. When facing complex environments where their zero-shot abilities are insufficient, recent work showed online Reinforcement Learning (RL) could be used for the LLM agent to discover and learn efficient strategies interactively. However, most prior work sticks to on-policy algorithms, which greatly reduces the scope of methods such agents could use for both exploration and exploitation, such as experience replay and hindsight relabeling. Yet, such methods may be key for LLM learning agents, and in particular when designing autonomous intrinsically motivated agents sampling and pursuing their own goals (i.e. autotelic agents). This paper presents and studies an adaptation of Soft Actor-Critic and hindsight relabeling to LLM agents. Our method not only paves the path towards autotelic LLM agents that learn online but can also outperform on-policy methods in more classic multi-goal RL environments.

### ToolWeaver: Weaving Collaborative Semantics for Scalable Tool Use in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Bowen Fang, Wen Ye, Yunyue Su, Jinghao Zhang, Qiang Liu, Yesheng Liu, Xin Sun, Shu Wu, Jiabing Yang, Baole Wei, Liang Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:29:53Z

**Summary**: Prevalent retrieval-based tool-use pipelines struggle with a dual semantic challenge: their retrievers often employ encoders that fail to capture complex semantics, while the Large Language Model (LLM) itself lacks intrinsic tool knowledge from its natural language pretraining. Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.

### DisContSE: Single-Step Diffusion Speech Enhancement Based on Joint Discrete and Continuous Embeddings
**Authors**: Yihui Fu, Tim Fingscheidt

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:27:14Z

**Summary**: Diffusion speech enhancement on discrete audio codec features gain immense attention due to their improved speech component reconstruction capability. However, they usually suffer from high inference computational complexity due to multiple reverse process iterations. Furthermore, they generally achieve promising results on non-intrusive metrics but show poor performance on intrusive metrics, as they may struggle in reconstructing the correct phones. In this paper, we propose DisContSE, an efficient diffusion-based speech enhancement model on joint discrete codec tokens and continuous embeddings. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we formulate both a discrete and a continuous enhancement module operating on discrete audio codec tokens and continuous embeddings, respectively, to achieve improved fidelity and intelligibility simultaneously. Second, a semantic enhancement module is further adopted to achieve optimal phonetic accuracy. Third, we achieve a single-step efficient reverse process in inference with a novel quantization error mask initialization strategy, which, according to our knowledge, is the first successful single-step diffusion speech enhancement based on an audio codec. Trained and evaluated on URGENT 2024 Speech Enhancement Challenge data splits, the proposed DisContSE excels top-reported time- and frequency-domain diffusion baseline methods in PESQ, POLQA, UTMOS, and in a subjective ITU-T P.808 listening test, clearly achieving an overall top rank.

### AgenticSimLaw: A Juvenile Courtroom Multi-Agent Debate Simulation for Explainable High-Stakes Tabular Decision Making
**Authors**: Jon Chun, Kathrine Elkins, Yong Suk Lee

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:26:10Z

**Summary**: We introduce AgenticSimLaw, a role-structured, multi-agent debate framework that provides transparent and controllable test-time reasoning for high-stakes tabular decision-making tasks. Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight. This work addresses key LLM-based multi-agent system challenges: organization through structured roles, observability through logged interactions, and responsibility through explicit non-deployment constraints for sensitive domains. Data, results, and code will be available on github.com under the MIT license.

### WorldLLM: Improving LLMs' world modeling using curiosity-driven theory-making
**Authors**: Guillaume Levy, Cedric Colas, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, Thomas Carta, Clement Romac

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:25:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess general world knowledge but often struggle to generate precise predictions in structured, domain-specific contexts such as simulations. These limitations arise from their inability to ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment dynamics.

### Belief Propagation Converges to Gaussian Distributions in Sparsely-Connected Factor Graphs
**Authors**: Tom Yates, Yuzhou Cheng, Ignacio Alzugaray, Danyal Akarca, Pedro A. M. Mediano, Andrew J. Davison

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:25:13Z

**Summary**: Belief Propagation (BP) is a powerful algorithm for distributed inference in probabilistic graphical models, however it quickly becomes infeasible for practical compute and memory budgets. Many efficient, non-parametric forms of BP have been developed, but the most popular is Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP), a variant that assumes all distributions are locally Gaussian. GBP is widely used due to its efficiency and empirically strong performance in applications like computer vision or sensor networks - even when modelling non-Gaussian problems. In this paper, we seek to provide a theoretical guarantee for when Gaussian approximations are valid in highly non-Gaussian, sparsely-connected factor graphs performing BP (common in spatial AI). We leverage the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to prove mathematically that variables' beliefs under BP converge to a Gaussian distribution in complex, loopy factor graphs obeying our 4 key assumptions. We then confirm experimentally that variable beliefs become increasingly Gaussian after just a few BP iterations in a stereo depth estimation task.

### Optimizing Multi-Hop Document Retrieval Through Intermediate Representations
**Authors**: Jiaen Lin, Jingyu Liu, Yingbo Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:19:47Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) encounters challenges when addressing complex queries, particularly multi-hop questions. While several methods tackle multi-hop queries by iteratively generating internal queries and retrieving external documents, these approaches are computationally expensive. In this paper, we identify a three-stage information processing pattern in LLMs during layer-by-layer reasoning, consisting of extraction, processing, and subsequent extraction steps. This observation suggests that the representations in intermediate layers contain richer information compared to those in other layers. Building on this insight, we propose Layer-wise RAG (L-RAG). Unlike prior methods that focus on generating new internal queries, L-RAG leverages intermediate representations from the middle layers, which capture next-hop information, to retrieve external knowledge. L-RAG achieves performance comparable to multi-step approaches while maintaining inference overhead similar to that of standard RAG. Experimental results show that L-RAG outperforms existing RAG methods on open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets, including MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA. The code is available in https://github.com/Olive-2019/L-RAG

### SONIC: Segmented Optimized Nexus for Information Compression in Key-Value Caching
**Authors**: Hong Chen, Xiang Liu, Bo Wang, Yuxuan Fan, Yuanlin Chu, Zongluo Li, Xiaowen Chu, Xuming Hu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:18:08Z

**Summary**: The linear growth of Key-Value (KV) cache remains a bottleneck for multi-turn LLM deployment. Existing KV cache compression methods often fail to account for the structural properties of multi-turn dialogues, relying on heuristic eviction that risks losing critical context. We propose \textbf{SONIC}, a learning-based framework that compresses historical segments into compact and semantically rich \textbf{Nexus} tokens. By integrating dynamic budget training, SONIC allows flexible adaptation to varying memory constraints without retraining. Experiments show that at compression ratios of 80\% and 50\%, SONIC consistently outperforms baselines such as H2O and StreamingLLM on four diverse multi-turn benchmarks. Specifically, on the widely used MTBench101 benchmark, SONIC achieves an average score improvement of 35.55\% over state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness in sustaining coherent multi-turn dialogues. Furthermore, SONIC enhances deployment efficiency, accelerating the overall inference process by 50.1\% compared to full-context generation.

### Information Filtering via Variational Regularization for Robot Manipulation
**Authors**: Jinhao Zhang, Wenlong Xia, Yaojia Wang, Zhexuan Zhou, Huizhe Li, Yichen Lai, Haoming Song, Youmin Gong, Jie Me

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:17:42Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based visuomotor policies built on 3D visual representations have achieved strong performance in learning complex robotic skills. However, most existing methods employ an oversized denoising decoder. While increasing model capacity can improve denoising, empirical evidence suggests that it also introduces redundancy and noise in intermediate feature blocks. Crucially, we find that randomly masking backbone features at inference time (without changing training) can improve performance, confirming the presence of task-irrelevant noise in intermediate features. To this end, we propose Variational Regularization (VR), a lightweight module that imposes a timestep-conditioned Gaussian over backbone features and applies a KL-divergence regularizer, forming an adaptive information bottleneck. Extensive experiments on three simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld) show that, compared to the baseline DP3, our approach improves the success rate by 6.1% on RoboTwin2.0 and by 4.1% on Adroit and MetaWorld, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Real-world experiments further demonstrate that our method performs well in practical deployments. Code will released.

### FreeFuse: Multi-Subject LoRA Fusion via Adaptive Token-Level Routing at Test Time
**Authors**: Yaoli Liu, Yao-Xiang Ding, Kun Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:14:07Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a training-free framework for multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple subject LoRAs. In contrast to prior studies that focus on retraining LoRA to alleviate feature conflicts, our analysis reveals that simply spatially confining the subject LoRA's output to its target region and preventing other LoRAs from directly intruding into this area is sufficient for effective mitigation. Accordingly, we implement Adaptive Token-Level Routing during the inference phase. We introduce FreeFuseAttn, a mechanism that exploits the flow matching model's intrinsic semantic alignment to dynamically match subject-specific tokens to their corresponding spatial regions at early denoising timesteps, thereby bypassing the need for external segmentors. FreeFuse distinguishes itself through high practicality: it necessitates no additional training, model modifications, or user-defined masks spatial conditions. Users need only provide subject activation words to achieve seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both identity preservation and compositional fidelity. Our code is available at https://github.com/yaoliliu/FreeFuse.

### Duality-Guided Graph Learning for Real-Time Joint Connectivity and Routing in LEO Mega-Constellations
**Authors**: Zhouyou Gu, Jinho Choi, Tony Q. S. Quek, Jihong Park

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:13:50Z

**Summary**: Laser inter-satellite links (LISLs) of low Earth orbit (LEO) mega-constellations enable high-capacity backbone connectivity in non-terrestrial networks, but their management is challenged by limited laser communication terminals, mechanical pointing constraints, and rapidly time-varying network topologies. This paper studies the joint problem of LISL connection establishment, traffic routing, and flow-rate allocation under heterogeneous global traffic demand and gateway availability. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer optimization over large-scale, time-varying constellation graphs and develop a Lagrangian dual decomposition that interprets per-link dual variables as congestion prices coordinating connectivity and routing decisions. To overcome the prohibitive latency of iterative dual updates, we propose DeepLaDu, a Lagrangian duality-guided deep learning framework that trains a graph neural network (GNN) to directly infer per-link (edge-level) congestion prices from the constellation state in a single forward pass. We enable scalable and stable training using a subgradient-based edge-level loss in DeepLaDu. We analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed approach and evaluate it using realistic Starlink-like constellations with optical and traffic constraints. Simulation results show that DeepLaDu achieves up to 20\% higher network throughput than non-joint or heuristic baselines, while matching the performance of iterative dual optimization with orders-of-magnitude lower computation time, suitable for real-time operation in dynamic LEO networks.

### Self-Compression of Chain-of-Thought via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Yiqun Chen, Jinyuan Feng, Wei Yang, Meizhi Zhong, Zhengliang Shi, Rui Li, Xiaochi Wei, Yan Gao, Yi Wu, Yao Hu, Zhiqiang Pu, Jiaxin Mao

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:13:10Z

**Summary**: The inference overhead induced by redundant reasoning undermines the interactive experience and severely bottlenecks the deployment of Large Reasoning Models. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based solutions tackle this problem by coupling a length penalty with outcome-based rewards. This simplistic reward weighting struggles to reconcile brevity with accuracy, as enforcing brevity may compromise critical reasoning logic. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a multi-agent RL framework that selectively penalizes redundant chunks, while preserving essential reasoning logic. Our framework, Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA), instantiates redundancy detection and evaluation through two specialized agents: \textbf{a Segmentation Agent} for decomposing the reasoning process into logical chunks, and \textbf{a Scoring Agent} for quantifying the significance of each chunk. The Segmentation and Scoring agents collaboratively define an importance-weighted length penalty during training, incentivizing \textbf{a Reasoning Agent} to prioritize essential logic without introducing inference overhead during deployment. Empirical evaluations across model scales demonstrate that SCMA reduces response length by 11.1\% to 39.0\% while boosting accuracy by 4.33\% to 10.02\%. Furthermore, ablation studies and qualitative analysis validate that the synergistic optimization within the MARL framework fosters emergent behaviors, yielding more powerful LRMs compared to vanilla RL paradigms.

**Authors**: Xi Fang, Haoyi Tao, Shuwen Yang, Chaozheng Huang, Suyang Zhong, Haocheng Lu, Han Lyu, Xinyu Li, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:05:40Z

**Summary**: This technical report introduces Uni-Parser, an industrial-grade document parsing engine tailored for scientific literature and patents, delivering high throughput, robust accuracy, and cost efficiency. Unlike pipeline-based document parsing methods, Uni-Parser employs a modular, loosely coupled multi-expert architecture that preserves fine-grained cross-modal alignments across text, equations, tables, figures, and chemical structures, while remaining easily extensible to emerging modalities. The system incorporates adaptive GPU load balancing, distributed inference, dynamic module orchestration, and configurable modes that support either holistic or modality-specific parsing. Optimized for large-scale cloud deployment, Uni-Parser achieves a processing rate of up to 20 PDF pages per second on 8 x NVIDIA RTX 4090D GPUs, enabling cost-efficient inference across billions of pages. This level of scalability facilitates a broad spectrum of downstream applications, ranging from literature retrieval and summarization to the extraction of chemical structures, reaction schemes, and bioactivity data, as well as the curation of large-scale corpora for training next-generation large language models and AI4Science models.

### Rapid estimation of global sea surface temperatures from sparse streaming in situ observations
**Authors**: Cassidy All, Kevin Ho, Maya Magnuski, Christopher Nicolaides, Louisa B. Ebby, Mohammad Farazmand

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:05:30Z

**Summary**: Reconstructing high-resolution sea surface temperatures (SST) from staggered SST measurements is essential for weather forecasting and climate projections. However, when SST measurements are sparse, the resulting inferred SST fields are rather inaccurate. Here, we demonstrate the ability of Sparse Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (S-DEIM) to reconstruct the high-resolution SST field from sparse in situ observations, without using a model. The S-DEIM estimate consists of two terms, one computed from instantaneous in situ observations using empirical interpolation, and the other learned from the historical time series of observations using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We train the RNNs using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's weekly high-resolution SST dataset spanning the years 1989-2021 which constitutes the training data. Subsequently, we examine the performance of S-DEIM on the test data, comprising January 2022 to January 2023. For this test data, S-DEIM infers the high-resolution SST from 100 in situ observations, constituting only 0.2% of the high-resolution spatial grid. We show that the resulting S-DEIM reconstructions are about 40% more accurate than earlier empirical interpolation methods, such as DEIM and Q-DEIM. Furthermore, 91% of S-DEIM estimates fall within $\pm 1^\circ$C of the true SST. We also demonstrate that S-DEIM is robust with respect to sensor placement: even when the sensors are distributed randomly, S-DEIM reconstruction error deteriorates only by 1-2%. S-DEIM is also computationally efficient. Training the RNN, which is performed only once offline, takes approximately one minute. Once trained, the S-DEIM reconstructions are computed in less than a second. As such, S-DEIM can be used for rapid SST reconstruction from sparse streaming observational data in real time.

### Near-Optimal Online Deployment and Routing for Streaming LLMs
**Authors**: Shaoang Li, Jian Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:04:59Z

**Summary**: The rapid pace at which new large language models (LLMs) appear, and older ones become obsolete, forces providers to manage a streaming inventory under a strict concurrency cap and per-query cost budgets. We cast this as an online decision problem that couples stage-wise deployment (at fixed maintenance windows) with per-query routing among live models. We introduce StageRoute, a hierarchical algorithm that (i) optimistically selects up to $M_{\max}$ models for the next stage using reward upper-confidence and cost lower-confidence bounds, and (ii) routes each incoming query by solving a budget- and throughput-constrained bandit subproblem over the deployed set. We prove a regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ with a matching lower bound, establishing near-optimality, and validate the theory empirically: StageRoute tracks a strong oracle under tight budgets across diverse workloads.

### Health Facility Location in Ethiopia: Leveraging LLMs to Integrate Expert Knowledge into Algorithmic Planning
**Authors**: Yohai Trabelsi, Guojun Xiong, Fentabil Getnet, Stéphane Verguet, Milind Tambe

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:03:50Z

**Summary**: Ethiopia's Ministry of Health is upgrading health posts to improve access to essential services, particularly in rural areas. Limited resources, however, require careful prioritization of which facilities to upgrade to maximize population coverage while accounting for diverse expert and stakeholder preferences. In collaboration with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we propose a hybrid framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge with optimization techniques. Classical optimization methods provide theoretical guarantees but require explicit, quantitative objectives, whereas stakeholder criteria are often articulated in natural language and difficult to formalize. To bridge these domains, we develop the Large language model and Extended Greedy (LEG) framework. Our framework combines a provable approximation algorithm for population coverage optimization with LLM-driven iterative refinement that incorporates human-AI alignment to ensure solutions reflect expert qualitative guidance while preserving coverage guarantees. Experiments on real-world data from three Ethiopian regions demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and its potential to inform equitable, data-driven health system planning.

### A Framework for Creating Non-Regressive Test Cases via Branch Consistency Analysis Driven by Descriptions
**Authors**: Pengyu Xue, Yuxiang Zhang, Zhen Yang, Xiaoxue Ren, Xiang Li, Pengfei Hu, Linhao Wu, Kainan Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:01:15Z

**Summary**: Automated test-generation research overwhelmingly assumes the correctness of focal methods, yet practitioners routinely face non-regression scenarios where the focal method may be defective. A baseline evaluation of EvoSuite and two leading Large Language Model (LLM)-based generators, namely ChatTester and ChatUniTest, on defective focal methods reveals that despite achieving up to 83% of branch coverage, none of the generated tests expose defects.   To resolve this problem, we first construct two new benchmarks, namely Defects4J-Desc and QuixBugs-Desc, for experiments. In particular, each focal method is equipped with an extra Natural Language Description (NLD) for code functionality understanding.   Subsequently, we propose DISTINCT, a Description-guided, branch-consistency analysis framework that transforms LLMs into fault-aware test generators. DISTINCT carries three iterative components: (1) a Generator that derives initial tests based on the NLDs and the focal method, (2) a Validator that iteratively fixes uncompilable tests using compiler diagnostics, and (3) an Analyzer that iteratively aligns test behavior with NLD semantics via branch-level analysis.   Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, DISTINCT achieves an average improvement of 14.64% in Compilation Success Rate (CSR) and 6.66% in Passing Rate (PR) across both benchmarks. It notably enhances Defect Detection Rate (DDR) on both benchmarks, with a particularly significant gain of 149.26% observed on Defects4J-Desc. In terms of code coverage, DISTINCT improves Statement Coverage (SC) by an average of 3.77% and Branch Coverage (BC) by 5.36%. These results set a new baseline for non-regressive test generation and highlight how description-driven reasoning enables LLMs to move beyond coverage chasing toward effective defect detection.

### From Meta-Thought to Execution: Cognitively Aligned Post-Training for Generalizable and Reliable LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Shaojie Wang, Liang Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:00:48Z

**Summary**: Current LLM post-training methods optimize complete reasoning trajectories through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability. Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19\% and 4.63\% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution respectively over standard methods, while reducing training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%, demonstrating that aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields not only superior generalization but also enhanced training efficiency.

### GenOM: Ontology Matching with Description Generation and Large Language Model
**Authors**: Yiping Song, Jiaoyan Chen, Renate A. Schmidt

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:00:15Z

**Summary**: Ontology matching (OM) plays an essential role in enabling semantic interoperability and integration across heterogeneous knowledge sources, particularly in the biomedical domain which contains numerous complex concepts related to diseases and pharmaceuticals. This paper introduces GenOM, a large language model (LLM)-based ontology alignment framework, which enriches the semantic representations of ontology concepts via generating textual definitions, retrieves alignment candidates with an embedding model, and incorporates exact matching-based tools to improve precision. Extensive experiments conducted on the OAEI Bio-ML track demonstrate that GenOM can often achieve competitive performance, surpassing many baselines including traditional OM systems and recent LLM-based methods. Further ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting, highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability.

### Hardware-Triggered Backdoors
**Authors**: Jonas Möller, Erik Imgrund, Thorsten Eisenhofer, Konrad Rieck

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:59:40Z

**Summary**: Machine learning models are routinely deployed on a wide range of computing hardware. Although such hardware is typically expected to produce identical results, differences in its design can lead to small numerical variations during inference. In this work, we show that these variations can be exploited to create backdoors in machine learning models. The core idea is to shape the model's decision function such that it yields different predictions for the same input when executed on different hardware. This effect is achieved by locally moving the decision boundary close to a target input and then refining numerical deviations to flip the prediction on selected hardware. We empirically demonstrate that these hardware-triggered backdoors can be created reliably across common GPU accelerators. Our findings reveal a novel attack vector affecting the use of third-party models, and we investigate different defenses to counter this threat.

### Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy with Salience Estimation in Autoregressive Video Diffusion
**Authors**: Hanmo Chen, Chenghao Xu, Xu Yang, Xuan Chen, Cheng Deng

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:55:29Z

**Summary**: Video generation is pivotal to digital media creation, and recent advances in autoregressive video generation have markedly enhanced the efficiency of real-time video synthesis. However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation. Our code will be released upon paper acceptance.

### Learn-to-Distance: Distance Learning for Detecting LLM-Generated Text
**Authors**: Hongyi Zhou, Jin Zhu, Erhan Xu, Kai Ye, Ying Yang, Chengchun Shi

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:55:15Z

**Summary**: Modern large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, and Gemini have transformed the way we learn, work, and communicate. Yet, their ability to produce highly human-like text raises serious concerns about misinformation and academic integrity, making it an urgent need for reliable algorithms to detect LLM-generated content. In this paper, we start by presenting a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms, revealing their underlying rationale and demonstrating their generalization ability. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text. Theoretically, we demonstrate that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with over 100 settings, and find that our approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in the majority of scenarios. In particular, it achieves relative improvements from 57.8\% to 80.6\% over the strongest baseline across different target LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, and Gemini).

### Not All Code Is Equal: A Data-Centric Study of Code Complexity and LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Lukas Twist, Shu Yang, Hanqi Yan, Jingzhi Gong, Di Wang, Helen Yannakoudakis, Jie M. Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:54:40Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit strong reasoning abilities, often attributed to their capacity to generate chain-of-thought-style intermediate reasoning. Recent work suggests that exposure to code can further enhance these skills, but existing studies largely treat code as a generic training signal, leaving open the question of which properties of code actually contribute to improved reasoning. To address this gap, we study the structural complexity of code, which captures control flow and compositional structure that may shape how models internalise multi-step reasoning during fine-tuning. We examine two complementary settings: solution-driven complexity, where complexity varies across multiple solutions to the same problem, and problem-driven complexity, where complexity reflects variation in the underlying tasks. Using cyclomatic complexity and logical lines of code to construct controlled fine-tuning datasets, we evaluate a range of open-weight LLMs on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that although code can improve reasoning, structural properties strongly determine its usefulness. In 83% of experiments, restricting fine-tuning data to a specific structural complexity range outperforms training on structurally diverse code, pointing to a data-centric path for improving reasoning beyond scaling.

### VSE: Variational state estimation of complex model-free process
**Authors**: Gustav Norén, Anubhab Ghosh, Fredrik Cumlin, Saikat Chatterjee

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:47:28Z

**Summary**: We design a variational state estimation (VSE) method that provides a closed-form Gaussian posterior of an underlying complex dynamical process from (noisy) nonlinear measurements. The complex process is model-free. That is, we do not have a suitable physics-based model characterizing the temporal evolution of the process state. The closed-form Gaussian posterior is provided by a recurrent neural network (RNN). The use of RNN is computationally simple in the inference phase. For learning the RNN, an additional RNN is used in the learning phase. Both RNNs help each other learn better based on variational inference principles. The VSE is demonstrated for a tracking application - state estimation of a stochastic Lorenz system (a benchmark process) using a 2-D camera measurement model. The VSE is shown to be competitive against a particle filter that knows the Lorenz system model and a recently proposed data-driven state estimation method that does not know the Lorenz system model.

### Acquiring Human-Like Mechanics Intuition from Scarce Observations via Deep Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Jingruo Peng, Shuze Zhu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:46:29Z

**Summary**: Humans can infer accurate mechanical outcomes from only a few observations, a capability known as mechanics intuition. The mechanisms behind such data-efficient learning remain unclear. Here, we propose a reinforcement learning framework in which an agent encodes continuous physical observation parameters into its state and is trained via episodic switching across closely related observations. With merely two or three observations, the agent acquires robust mechanics intuition that generalizes accurately over wide parameter ranges, substantially beyond the training data, as demonstrated on the brachistochrone and a large-deformation elastic plate. We explain this generalization through a unified theoretical view: it emerges when the learned value function enforces Bellman consistency across neighboring task parameters, rendering the Bellman residual stationary with respect to physical variations. This induces a smooth policy that captures a low-dimensional solution manifold underlying the continuum of tasks. Our work establishes episodic switching as a principled route to artificial mechanics intuition and offers a theoretical link to similar generalization abilities in biological learners.

**Summary**: Given the emergence of Generative AI over the last two years and the increasing focus on Agentic AI as a form of Multi-Agent System it is important to explore both how such technologies can impact the use of traditional Agent Toolkits and how the wealth of experience encapsulated in those toolkits can influence the design of the new agentic platforms. This paper presents an overview of our experience developing a prototype large language model (LLM) integration for the ASTRA programming language. It presents a brief overview of the toolkit, followed by three example implementations, concluding with a discussion of the experiences garnered through the examples.

### SimpleMem: Efficient Lifelong Memory for LLM Agents
**Authors**: Jiaqi Liu, Yaofeng Su, Peng Xia, Siwei Han, Zeyu Zheng, Cihang Xie, Mingyu Ding, Huaxiu Yao

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:45:24Z

**Summary**: To support long-term interaction in complex environments, LLM agents require memory systems that manage historical experiences. Existing approaches either retain full interaction histories via passive context extension, leading to substantial redundancy, or rely on iterative reasoning to filter noise, incurring high token costs. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleMem, an efficient memory framework based on semantic lossless compression. We propose a three-stage pipeline designed to maximize information density and token utilization: (1) Semantic Structured Compression, which distills unstructured interactions into compact, multi-view indexed memory units; (2) Online Semantic Synthesis, an intra-session process that instantly integrates related context into unified abstract representations to eliminate redundancy; and (3) Intent-Aware Retrieval Planning, which infers search intent to dynamically determine retrieval scope and construct precise context efficiently. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost, achieving an average F1 improvement of 26.4% in LoCoMo while reducing inference-time token consumption by up to 30-fold, demonstrating a superior balance between performance and efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/SimpleMem.

### Online Bayesian Experimental Design for Partially Observed Dynamical Systems
**Authors**: Sara Pérez-Vieites, Sahel Iqbal, Simo Särkkä, Dominik Baumann

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:45:20Z

**Summary**: Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled framework for optimizing data collection by choosing experiments that are maximally informative about unknown parameters. However, existing methods cannot deal with the joint challenge of (a) partially observable dynamical systems, where only noisy and incomplete observations are available, and (b) fully online inference, which updates posterior distributions and selects designs sequentially in a computationally efficient manner. Under partial observability, dynamical systems are naturally modeled as state-space models (SSMs), where latent states mediate the link between parameters and data, making the likelihood -- and thus information-theoretic objectives like the expected information gain (EIG) -- intractable. We address these challenges by deriving new estimators of the EIG and its gradient that explicitly marginalize latent states, enabling scalable stochastic optimization in nonlinear SSMs. Our approach leverages nested particle filters for efficient online state-parameter inference with convergence guarantees. Applications to realistic models, such as the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) and a moving source location task, show that our framework successfully handles both partial observability and online inference.

### d3LLM: Ultra-Fast Diffusion LLM using Pseudo-Trajectory Distillation
**Authors**: Yu-Yang Qian, Junda Su, Lanxiang Hu, Peiyuan Zhang, Zhijie Deng, Peng Zhao, Hao Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:45:13Z

**Summary**: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer capabilities beyond those of autoregressive (AR) LLMs, such as parallel decoding and random-order generation. However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/d3LLM.

### Evolution of Benchmark: Black-Box Optimization Benchmark Design through Large Language Model
**Authors**: Chen Wang, Sijie Ma, Zeyuan Ma, Yue-Jiao Gong

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:45:11Z

**Summary**: Benchmark Design in Black-Box Optimization (BBO) is a fundamental yet open-ended topic. Early BBO benchmarks are predominantly human-crafted, introducing expert bias and constraining diversity. Automating this design process can relieve the human-in-the-loop burden while enhancing diversity and objectivity. We propose Evolution of Benchmark (EoB), an automated BBO benchmark designer empowered by the large language model (LLM) and its program evolution capability. Specifically, we formulate benchmark design as a bi-objective optimization problem towards maximizing (i) landscape diversity and (ii) algorithm-differentiation ability across a portfolio of BBO solvers. Under this paradigm, EoB iteratively prompts LLM to evolve a population of benchmark programs and employs a reflection-based scheme to co-evolve the landscape and its corresponding program. Comprehensive experiments validate our EoB is a competitive candidate in multi-dimensional usages: 1) Benchmarking BBO algorithms; 2) Training and testing learning-assisted BBO algorithms; 3) Extending proxy for expensive real-world problems.

### LLM-Driven Scenario-Aware Planning for Autonomous Driving
**Authors**: He Li, Zhaowei Chen, Rui Gao, Guoliang Li, Qi Hao, Shuai Wang, Chengzhong Xu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:42:13Z

**Summary**: Hybrid planner switching framework (HPSF) for autonomous driving needs to reconcile high-speed driving efficiency with safe maneuvering in dense traffic. Existing HPSF methods often fail to make reliable mode transitions or sustain efficient driving in congested environments, owing to heuristic scene recognition and low-frequency control updates. To address the limitation, this paper proposes LAP, a large language model (LLM) driven, adaptive planning method, which switches between high-speed driving in low-complexity scenes and precise driving in high-complexity scenes, enabling high qualities of trajectory generation through confined gaps. This is achieved by leveraging LLM for scene understanding and integrating its inference into the joint optimization of mode configuration and motion planning. The joint optimization is solved using tree-search model predictive control and alternating minimization. We implement LAP by Python in Robot Operating System (ROS). High-fidelity simulation results show that the proposed LAP outperforms other benchmarks in terms of both driving time and success rate.

**Authors**: Naufal Suryanto, Muzammal Naseer, Pengfei Li, Syed Talal Wasim, Jinhui Yi, Juergen Gall, Paolo Ceravolo, Ernesto Damiani

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:59:57Z

**Summary**: Cybersecurity operations demand assistant LLMs that support diverse workflows without exposing sensitive data. Existing solutions either rely on proprietary APIs with privacy risks or on open models lacking domain adaptation. To bridge this gap, we curate 11.8B tokens of cybersecurity-focused continual pretraining data via large-scale web filtering and manual collection of high-quality resources, spanning 28.6K documents across frameworks, offensive techniques, and security tools. Building on this, we design an agentic augmentation pipeline that simulates expert workflows to generate 266K multi-turn cybersecurity samples for supervised fine-tuning. Combined with general open-source LLM data, these resources enable the training of RedSage, an open-source, locally deployable cybersecurity assistant with domain-aware pretraining and post-training. To rigorously evaluate the models, we introduce RedSage-Bench, a benchmark with 30K multiple-choice and 240 open-ended Q&A items covering cybersecurity knowledge, skills, and tool expertise. RedSage is further evaluated on established cybersecurity benchmarks (e.g., CTI-Bench, CyberMetric, SECURE) and general LLM benchmarks to assess broader generalization. At the 8B scale, RedSage achieves consistently better results, surpassing the baseline models by up to +5.59 points on cybersecurity benchmarks and +5.05 points on Open LLM Leaderboard tasks. These findings demonstrate that domain-aware agentic augmentation and pre/post-training can not only enhance cybersecurity-specific expertise but also help to improve general reasoning and instruction-following. All models, datasets, and code are publicly available.

### UEval: A Benchmark for Unified Multimodal Generation
**Authors**: Bo Li, Yida Yin, Wenhao Chai, Xingyu Fu, Zhuang Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:59:52Z

**Summary**: We introduce UEval, a benchmark to evaluate unified models, i.e., models capable of generating both images and text. UEval comprises 1,000 expert-curated questions that require both images and text in the model output, sourced from 8 real-world tasks. Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations. Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is non-trivial, as simple LLM-as-a-judge methods can miss the subtleties. Different from previous works that rely on multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rate image quality or text accuracy, we design a rubric-based scoring system in UEval. For each question, reference images and text answers are provided to a MLLM to generate an initial rubric, consisting of multiple evaluation criteria, and human experts then refine and validate these rubrics. In total, UEval contains 10,417 validated rubric criteria, enabling scalable and fine-grained automatic scoring. UEval is challenging for current unified models: GPT-5-Thinking scores only 66.4 out of 100, while the best open-source model reaches merely 49.1. We observe that reasoning models often outperform non-reasoning ones, and transferring reasoning traces from a reasoning model to a non-reasoning model significantly narrows the gap. This suggests that reasoning may be important for tasks requiring complex multimodal understanding and generation.

**Authors**: Hang Ding, Peidong Liu, Junqiao Wang, Ziwei Ji, Meng Cao, Rongzhao Zhang, Lynn Ai, Eric Yang, Tianyu Shi, Lei Yu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:59:07Z

**Summary**: The development of autonomous web agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL), represents a significant step towards general-purpose AI assistants. However, training these agents is severely hampered by the challenges of interacting with the live internet, which is inefficient, costly, and fraught with risks. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers a promising solution by learning a world model of the environment to enable simulated interaction. This paper introduces DynaWeb, a novel MBRL framework that trains web agents through interacting with a web world model trained to predict naturalistic web page representations given agent actions. This model serves as a synthetic web environment where an agent policy can dream by generating vast quantities of rollout action trajectories for efficient online reinforcement learning. Beyond free policy rollouts, DynaWeb incorporates real expert trajectories from training data, which are randomly interleaved with on-policy rollouts during training to improve stability and sample efficiency. Experiments conducted on the challenging WebArena and WebVoyager benchmarks demonstrate that DynaWeb consistently and significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art open-source web agent models. Our findings establish the viability of training web agents through imagination, offering a scalable and efficient way to scale up online agentic RL.

### FineInstructions: Scaling Synthetic Instructions to Pre-Training Scale
**Authors**: Ajay Patel, Colin Raffel, Chris Callison-Burch

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:58:47Z

**Summary**: Due to limited supervised training data, large language models (LLMs) are typically pre-trained via a self-supervised "predict the next word" objective on a vast amount of unstructured text data. To make the resulting model useful to users, it is further trained on a far smaller amount of "instruction-tuning" data comprised of supervised training examples of instructions and responses. To overcome the limited amount of supervised data, we propose a procedure that can transform the knowledge in internet-scale pre-training documents into billions of synthetic instruction and answer training pairs. The resulting dataset, called FineInstructions, uses ~18M instruction templates created from real user-written queries and prompts. These instruction templates are matched to and instantiated with human-written source documents from unstructured pre-training corpora. With "supervised" synthetic training data generated at this scale, an LLM can be pre-trained from scratch solely with the instruction-tuning objective, which is far more in-distribution with the expected downstream usage of LLMs (responding to user prompts). We conduct controlled token-for-token training experiments and find pre-training on FineInstructions outperforms standard pre-training and other proposed synthetic pre-training techniques on standard benchmarks measuring free-form response quality. Our resources can be found at https://huggingface.co/fineinstructions .

### Think Twice: Branch-and-Rethink Reasoning Reward Model
**Authors**: Yizhu Jiao, Jiaqi Zeng, Julien Veron Vialard, Oleksii Kuchaiev, Jiawei Han, Olivier Delalleau

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:57:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1 performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise, evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting all-at-once scoring into focused, second-look reasoning, BR-RM reduces judgment diffusion and improves sensitivity to subtle yet consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains.

### Reasoning While Asking: Transforming Reasoning Large Language Models from Passive Solvers to Proactive Inquirers
**Authors**: Xin Chen, Feng Jiang, Yiqian Zhang, Hardy Chen, Shuo Yan, Wenya Xie, Min Yang, Shujian Huang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:56:12Z

**Summary**: Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, yet they remain fundamentally limited by a \emph{blind self-thinking} paradigm: performing extensive internal reasoning even when critical information is missing or ambiguous. We propose Proactive Interactive Reasoning (PIR), a new reasoning paradigm that transforms LLMs from passive solvers into proactive inquirers that interleave reasoning with clarification. Unlike existing search- or tool-based frameworks that primarily address knowledge uncertainty by querying external environments, PIR targets premise- and intent-level uncertainty through direct interaction with the user. PIR is implemented via two core components: (1) an uncertainty-aware supervised fine-tuning procedure that equips models with interactive reasoning capability, and (2) a user-simulator-based policy optimization framework driven by a composite reward that aligns model behavior with user intent. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and document editing demonstrate that PIR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 32.70\% higher accuracy, 22.90\% higher pass rate, and 41.36 BLEU improvement, while reducing nearly half of the reasoning computation and unnecessary interaction turns. Further reliability evaluations on factual knowledge, question answering, and missing-premise scenarios confirm the strong generalization and robustness of PIR.

### "Not in My Backyard": LLMs Uncover Online and Offline Social Biases Against Homelessness
**Authors**: Jonathan A. Karr, Benjamin F. Herbst, Matthew L. Sisk, Xueyun Li, Ting Hua, Matthew Hauenstein, Georgina Curto, Nitesh V. Chawla

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:55:57Z

**Summary**: Homelessness is a persistent social challenge, impacting millions worldwide. Over 876,000 people experienced homelessness (PEH) in the U.S. in 2025. Social bias is a significant barrier to alleviation, shaping public perception and influencing policymaking. Given that online textual media and offline city council discourse reflect and influence part of public opinion, it provides valuable insights to identify and track social biases against PEH. We present a new, manually-annotated multi-domain dataset compiled from Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes across ten U.S. cities. Our 16-category multi-label taxonomy creates a challenging long-tail classification problem: some categories appear in less than 1% of samples, while others exceed 70%. We find that small human-annotated datasets (1,702 samples) are insufficient for training effective classifiers, whether used to fine-tune encoder models or as few-shot examples for LLMs. To address this, we use GPT-4.1 to generate pseudo-labels on a larger unlabeled corpus. Training on this expanded dataset enables even small encoder models (ModernBERT, 150M parameters) to achieve 35.23 macro-F1, approaching GPT-4.1's 41.57. This demonstrates that \textbf{data quantity matters more than model size}, enabling low-cost, privacy-preserving deployment without relying on commercial APIs. Our results reveal that negative bias against PEH is prevalent both offline and online (especially on Reddit), with "not in my backyard" narratives showing the highest engagement. These findings uncover a type of ostracism that directly impacts poverty-reduction policymaking and provide actionable insights for practitioners addressing homelessness.

### StepShield: When, Not Whether to Intervene on Rogue Agents
**Authors**: Gloria Felicia, Michael Eniolade, Jinfeng He, Zitha Sasindran, Hemant Kumar, Milan Hussain Angati, Sandeep Bandarupalli

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:55:46Z

**Summary**: Existing agent safety benchmarks report binary accuracy, conflating early intervention with post-mortem analysis. A detector that flags a violation at step 8 enables intervention; one that reports it at step 48 provides only forensic value. This distinction is critical, yet current benchmarks cannot measure it. We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics. We further show that early detection has direct economic benefits: our cascaded HybridGuard detector reduces monitoring costs by 75% and projects to $108M in cumulative savings over five years at enterprise scale. By shifting the focus of evaluation from whether to when, StepShield provides a new foundation for building safer and more economically viable AI agents. The code and data are released under an Apache 2.0 license.

### Pay for Hints, Not Answers: LLM Shepherding for Cost-Efficient Inference
**Authors**: Ziming Dong, Hardik Sharma, Evan O'Toole, Jaya Prakash Champati, Kui Wu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:52:54Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art performance on complex reasoning tasks, but their inference costs limit deployment at scale. Small Language Models (SLMs) offer dramatic cost savings yet lag substantially in accuracy. Existing approaches - routing and cascading - treat the LLM as an all-or-nothing resource: either the query bypasses the LLM entirely, or the LLM generates a complete response at full cost. We introduce LLM Shepherding, a framework that requests only a short prefix (a hint) from the LLM and provides it to SLM. This simple mechanism is surprisingly effective for math and coding tasks: even hints comprising 10-30% of the full LLM response improve SLM accuracy significantly. Shepherding generalizes both routing and cascading, and it achieves lower cost under oracle decision-making. We develop a two-stage predictor that jointly determines whether a hint is needed and how many tokens to request. On the widely-used mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, CNK12) and code generation (HumanEval, MBPP) benchmarks, Shepherding reduces costs by 42-94% relative to LLM-only inference. Compared to state-of-the-art routing and cascading baselines, shepherding delivers up to 2.8x cost reduction while matching accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to exploit token-level budget control for SLM-LLM collaboration.

### World of Workflows: a Benchmark for Bringing World Models to Enterprise Systems
**Authors**: Lakshya Gupta, Litao Li, Yizhe Liu, Sriram Ganapathi Subramanian, Kaheer Suleman, Zichen Zhang, Haoye Lu, Sumit Pasupalak

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:51:54Z

**Summary**: Frontier large language models (LLMs) excel as autonomous agents in many domains, yet they remain untested in complex enterprise systems where hidden workflows create cascading effects across interconnected databases. Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.

### SWE-Replay: Efficient Test-Time Scaling for Software Engineering Agents
**Authors**: Yifeng Ding, Lingming Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:50:29Z

**Summary**: Test-time scaling has been widely adopted to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, the standard approach of repeatedly sampling trajectories from scratch is computationally expensive. While recent methods have attempted to mitigate costs using specialized value agents, they can suffer from model miscalibration and fail to generalize to modern agents that synthesize custom bash scripts as tools. In this paper, we introduce SWE-Replay, the first efficient and generalizable test-time scaling technique for modern agents without reliance on potentially noisy value estimates. SWE-Replay optimizes the scaling process by recycling trajectories from prior trials, dynamically choosing to either explore from scratch or exploit archived experience by branching at critical intermediate steps. This selection of intermediate steps is driven by the potential and reasoning significance of repository exploration, rather than external LLM-based quality estimates. Our evaluation shows that, on SWE-Bench Verified, SWE-Replay consistently outperforms naive scaling, reducing costs by up to 17.4% while maintaining or even improving performance by up to 3.8%. Further evaluation on SWE-Bench Pro and Multilingual validates the generalizability of SWE-Replay, establishing it as a robust foundation for efficient test-time scaling of software engineering agents.

### The Patient is not a Moving Document: A World Model Training Paradigm for Longitudinal EHR
**Authors**: Irsyad Adam, Zekai Chen, David Laprade, Shaun Porwal, David Laub, Erik Reinertsen, Arda Pekis, Kevin Brown

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:49:37Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) trained with next-word-prediction have achieved success as clinical foundation models. Representations from these language backbones yield strong linear probe performance across biomedical tasks, suggesting that patient semantics emerge from next-token prediction at scale. However, this paradigm treats patients as a document to be summarized rather than a dynamical system to be simulated; a patient's trajectory emerges from their state evolving under interventions and time, requiring models that simulate dynamics rather than predict tokens. To address this, we introduce SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR that grounds a joint-embedding prediction architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT). SFT grounds our model to reconstruct future patient states in token space, while JEPA predicts those futures in latent space from the initial patient representation alone, forcing trajectory dynamics to be encoded before the next state is observed. We validate across two large-scale cohorts: Memorial Sloan Kettering (23,319 oncology patients; 323,000+ patient-years) and INSPECT (19,402 pulmonary embolism patients). Using a linear probe evaluated at multiple points along the disease trajectory, we demonstrate that our training paradigm learns embeddings that capture disease dynamics not recoverable by autoregressive baselines, enabling SMB-Structure to achieve competitive performance on complex tasks characterized by high patient heterogeneity. Model weights are available at https://huggingface.co/standardmodelbio/SMB-v1-1.7B-Structure.

### A Federated and Parameter-Efficient Framework for Large Language Model Training in Medicine

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:48:21Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on medical benchmarks, including question answering and diagnosis. To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models. Evaluation settings included (1) in-domain training and testing, (2) external validation on independent cohorts, and (3) a low-resource new-site adaptation scenario using real-world clinical notes from the Yale New Haven Health System.

### Evaluating Text Creativity across Diverse Domains: A Dataset and Large Language Model Evaluator
**Authors**: Qian Cao, Xiting Wang, Yuzhuo Yuan, Yahui Liu, Fang Luo, Ruihua Song

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:38:43Z

**Summary**: Creativity evaluation remains a challenging frontier for large language models (LLMs). Current evaluations heavily rely on inefficient and costly human judgments, hindering progress in enhancing machine creativity. While automated methods exist, ranging from psychological testing to heuristic- or prompting-based approaches, they often lack generalizability or alignment with human judgment. To address these issues, we propose a novel pairwise-comparison framework for assessing textual creativity that leverages shared contextual instructions to improve evaluation consistency. We introduce CreataSet, a large-scale dataset with 100K+ human-level and 1M+ synthetic creative instruction-response pairs spanning diverse open-domain tasks. Through training on CreataSet, we develop an LLM-based evaluator named CrEval. CrEval demonstrates remarkable superiority over existing methods in alignment with human judgments. Experimental results underscore the indispensable significance of integrating both human and synthetic data to train highly robust evaluators, and showcase the practical utility of CrEval in boosting the creativity of LLMs.

### ECO: Quantized Training without Full-Precision Master Weights
**Authors**: Mahdi Nikdan, Amir Zandieh, Dan Alistarh, Vahab Mirrokni

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:35:01Z

**Summary**: Quantization has significantly improved the compute and memory efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) training. However, existing approaches still rely on accumulating their updates in high-precision: concretely, gradient updates must be applied to a high-precision weight buffer, known as $\textit{master weights}$. This buffer introduces substantial memory overhead, particularly for Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) models, where model parameters and optimizer states dominate memory usage. To address this, we introduce the Error-Compensating Optimizer (ECO), which eliminates master weights by applying updates directly to quantized parameters. ECO quantizes weights after each step and carefully injects the resulting quantization error into the optimizer momentum, forming an error-feedback loop with no additional memory. We prove that, under standard assumptions and a decaying learning rate, ECO converges to a constant-radius neighborhood of the optimum, while naive master-weight removal can incur an error that is inversely proportional to the learning rate. We show empirical results for pretraining small Transformers (30-800M), a Gemma-3 1B model, and a 2.1B parameter Sparse MoE model with FP8 quantization, and fine-tuning DeepSeek-MoE-16B in INT4 precision. Throughout, ECO matches baselines with master weights up to near-lossless accuracy, significantly shifting the static memory vs validation loss Pareto frontier.

### Investigating Associational Biases in Inter-Model Communication of Large Generative Models
**Authors**: Fethiye Irmak Dogan, Yuval Weiss, Kajal Patel, Jiaee Cheong, Hatice Gunes

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:29:55Z

**Summary**: Social bias in generative AI can manifest not only as performance disparities but also as associational bias, whereby models learn and reproduce stereotypical associations between concepts and demographic groups, even in the absence of explicit demographic information (e.g., associating doctors with men). These associations can persist, propagate, and potentially amplify across repeated exchanges in inter-model communication pipelines, where one generative model's output becomes another's input. This is especially salient for human-centred perception tasks, such as human activity recognition and affect prediction, where inferences about behaviour and internal states can lead to errors or stereotypical associations that propagate into unequal treatment. In this work, focusing on human activity and affective expression, we study how such associations evolve within an inter-model communication pipeline that alternates between image generation and image description. Using the RAF-DB and PHASE datasets, we quantify demographic distribution drift induced by model-to-model information exchange and assess whether these drifts are systematic using an explainability pipeline. Our results reveal demographic drifts toward younger representations for both actions and emotions, as well as toward more female-presenting representations, primarily for emotions. We further find evidence that some predictions are supported by spurious visual regions (e.g., background or hair) rather than concept-relevant cues (e.g., body or face). We also examine whether these demographic drifts translate into measurable differences in downstream behaviour, i.e., while predicting activity and emotion labels. Finally, we outline mitigation strategies spanning data-centric, training and deployment interventions, and emphasise the need for careful safeguards when deploying interconnected models in human-centred AI systems.

### NeuroFaith: Evaluating LLM Self-Explanation Faithfulness via Internal Representation Alignment
**Authors**: Milan Bhan, Jean-Noel Vittaut, Nicolas Chesneau, Sarath Chandar, Marie-Jeanne Lesot

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:24:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate plausible free text self-explanations to justify their answers. However, these natural language explanations may not accurately reflect the model's actual reasoning process, pinpointing a lack of faithfulness. Existing faithfulness evaluation methods rely primarily on behavioral tests or computational block analysis without examining the semantic content of internal neural representations. This paper proposes NeuroFaith, a flexible framework that measures the faithfulness of LLM free text self-explanation by identifying key concepts within explanations and mechanistically testing whether these concepts actually influence the model's predictions. We show the versatility of NeuroFaith across 2-hop reasoning and classification tasks. Additionally, we develop a linear faithfulness probe based on NeuroFaith to detect unfaithful self-explanations from representation space and improve faithfulness through steering. NeuroFaith provides a principled approach to evaluating and enhancing the faithfulness of LLM free text self-explanations, addressing critical needs for trustworthy AI systems.

### Think Locally, Explain Globally: Graph-Guided LLM Investigations via Local Reasoning and Belief Propagation
**Authors**: Saurabh Jha, Rohan Arora, Bhavya, Noah Zheutlin, Paulina Toro Isaza, Laura Shwartz, Yu Deng, Daby Sow, Ruchi Mahindru, Ruchir Puri

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:18:39Z

**Summary**: LLM agents excel when environments are mostly static and the needed information fits in a model's context window, but they often fail in open-ended investigations where explanations must be constructed by iteratively mining evidence from massive, heterogeneous operational data. These investigations exhibit hidden dependency structure: entities interact, signals co-vary, and the importance of a fact may only become clear after other evidence is discovered. Because the context window is bounded, agents must summarize intermediate findings before their significance is known, increasing the risk of discarding key evidence. ReAct-style agents are especially brittle in this regime. Their retrieve-summarize-reason loop makes conclusions sensitive to exploration order and introduces run-to-run non-determinism, producing a reliability gap where Pass-at-k may be high but Majority-at-k remains low. Simply sampling more rollouts or generating longer reasoning traces does not reliably stabilize results, since hypotheses cannot be autonomously checked as new evidence arrives and there is no explicit mechanism for belief bookkeeping and revision. In addition, ReAct entangles semantic reasoning with controller duties such as tool orchestration and state tracking, so execution errors and plan drift degrade reasoning while consuming scarce context.   We address these issues by formulating investigation as abductive reasoning over a dependency graph and proposing EoG (Explanations over Graphs), a disaggregated framework in which an LLM performs bounded local evidence mining and labeling (cause vs symptom) while a deterministic controller manages traversal, state, and belief propagation to compute a minimal explanatory frontier. On a representative ITBench diagnostics task, EoG improves both accuracy and run-to-run consistency over ReAct baselines, including a 7x average gain in Majority-at-k entity F1.

### Where Do the Joules Go? Diagnosing Inference Energy Consumption
**Authors**: Jae-Won Chung, Ruofan Wu, Jeff J. Ma, Mosharaf Chowdhury

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:16:45Z

**Summary**: Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.

### VTC-R1: Vision-Text Compression for Efficient Long-Context Reasoning
**Authors**: Yibo Wang, Yongcheng Jing, Shunyu Liu, Hao Guan, Rong-cheng Tu, Chengyu Wang, Jun Huang, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T18:07:39Z

**Summary**: Long-context reasoning has significantly empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks, yet it introduces severe efficiency bottlenecks due to the computational complexity. Existing efficient approaches often rely on complex additional training or external models for compression, which limits scalability and discards critical fine-grained information. In this paper, we propose VTC-R1, a new efficient reasoning paradigm that integrates vision-text compression into the reasoning process. Instead of processing lengthy textual traces, VTC-R1 renders intermediate reasoning segments into compact images, which are iteratively fed back into vision-language models as "optical memory." We construct a training dataset based on OpenR1-Math-220K achieving 3.4x token compression and fine-tune representative VLMs-Glyph and Qwen3-VL. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME25, AMC23 and GPQA-D demonstrate that VTC-R1 consistently outperforms standard long-context reasoning. Furthermore, our approach significantly improves inference efficiency, achieving 2.7x speedup in end-to-end latency, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for reasoning-intensive applications.

### BLO-Inst: Bi-Level Optimization Based Alignment of YOLO and SAM for Robust Instance Segmentation
**Authors**: Li Zhang, Pengtao Xie

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:58:55Z

**Summary**: The Segment Anything Model has revolutionized image segmentation with its zero-shot capabilities, yet its reliance on manual prompts hinders fully automated deployment. While integrating object detectors as prompt generators offers a pathway to automation, existing pipelines suffer from two fundamental limitations: objective mismatch, where detectors optimized for geometric localization do not correspond to the optimal prompting context required by SAM, and alignment overfitting in standard joint training, where the detector simply memorizes specific prompt adjustments for training samples rather than learning a generalizable policy. To bridge this gap, we introduce BLO-Inst, a unified framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives by bi-level optimization. We formulate the alignment as a nested optimization problem over disjoint data splits. In the lower level, the SAM is fine-tuned to maximize segmentation fidelity given the current detection proposals on a subset ($D_1$). In the upper level, the detector is updated to generate bounding boxes that explicitly minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM on a separate subset ($D_2$). This effectively transforms the detector into a segmentation-aware prompt generator, optimizing the bounding boxes not just for localization accuracy, but for downstream mask quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BLO-Inst achieves superior performance, outperforming standard baselines on tasks in general and biomedical domains.

### AIRPET: Virtual Positron Emission Tomography
**Authors**: J. Renner, J. J. Gómez-Cadenas, R. Soleti

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:58:27Z

**Summary**: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a powerful medical imaging technique, but the design and evaluation of new PET scanner technologies present significant challenges. The process is typically divided into three major stages: 1. detector design and simulation, 2. image reconstruction, and 3. image interpretation. Each of these stages requires significant expertise, making it difficult for individuals or small teams to manage all three at once. AIRPET (AI-driven Revolution in Positron Emission Tomography) is a web-based platform designed to address this challenge by integrating all phases of PET design into a single, accessible, and AI-assisted workflow. AIRPET provides an interface to large language models (LLMs) for assisted geometry creation and an interface for basic PET image reconstruction with the potential for further expansion. Here we introduce AIRPET and outline its current functionality and proposed additions.

### MasalBench: A Benchmark for Contextual and Cross-Cultural Understanding of Persian Proverbs in LLMs
**Authors**: Ghazal Kalhor, Behnam Bahrak

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:49:44Z

**Summary**: In recent years, multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an inseparable part of daily life, making it crucial for them to master the rules of conversational language in order to communicate effectively with users. While previous work has evaluated LLMs' understanding of figurative language in high-resource languages, their performance in low-resource languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MasalBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' contextual and cross-cultural understanding of Persian proverbs, which are a key component of conversation in this low-resource language. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs on MasalBench and find that they perform well in identifying Persian proverbs in context, achieving accuracies above 0.90. However, their performance drops considerably when tasked with identifying equivalent English proverbs, with the best model achieving 0.79 accuracy. Our findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in cultural knowledge and analogical reasoning, and they provide a framework for assessing cross-cultural understanding in other low-resource languages. MasalBench is available at https://github.com/kalhorghazal/MasalBench.

### On the Paradoxical Interference between Instruction-Following and Task Solving
**Authors**: Yunjia Qi, Hao Peng, Xintong Shi, Amy Xin, Xiaozhi Wang, Bin Xu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:48:56Z

**Summary**: Instruction following aims to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent by specifying explicit constraints on how tasks should be performed. However, we reveal a counterintuitive phenomenon: instruction following can paradoxically interfere with LLMs' task-solving capability. We propose a metric, SUSTAINSCORE, to quantify the interference of instruction following with task solving. It measures task performance drop after inserting into the instruction a self-evident constraint, which is naturally met by the original successful model output and extracted from it. Experiments on current LLMs in mathematics, multi-hop QA, and code generation show that adding the self-evident constraints leads to substantial performance drops, even for advanced models such as Claude-Sonnet-4.5. We validate the generality of the interference across constraint types and scales. Furthermore, we identify common failure patterns, and by investigating the mechanisms of interference, we observe that failed cases allocate significantly more attention to constraints compared to successful ones. Finally, we use SUSTAINSCORE to conduct an initial investigation into how distinct post-training paradigms affect the interference, presenting empirical observations on current alignment strategies. We will release our code and data to facilitate further research

### Optimizing Agentic Workflows using Meta-tools
**Authors**: Sami Abuzakuk, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Rishi Sharma, Rasmus Moorits Veski, Martijn de Vos

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:43:08Z

**Summary**: Agentic AI enables LLM to dynamically reason, plan, and interact with tools to solve complex tasks. However, agentic workflows often require many iterative reasoning steps and tool invocations, leading to significant operational expense, end-to-end latency and failures due to hallucinations. This work introduces Agent Workflow Optimization (AWO), a framework that identifies and optimizes redundant tool execution patterns to improve the efficiency and robustness of agentic workflows. AWO analyzes existing workflow traces to discover recurring sequences of tool calls and transforms them into meta-tools, which are deterministic, composite tools that bundle multiple agent actions into a single invocation. Meta-tools bypass unnecessary intermediate LLM reasoning steps and reduce operational cost while also shortening execution paths, leading to fewer failures. Experiments on two agentic AI benchmarks show that AWO reduces the number of LLM calls up to 11.9% while also increasing the task success rate by up to 4.2 percent points.

### Causal Autoregressive Diffusion Language Model
**Authors**: Junhao Ruan, Bei Li, Yongjing Yin, Pengcheng Huang, Xin Chen, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai, Tong Xiao, JingBo Zhu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:38:29Z

**Summary**: In this work, we propose Causal Autoregressive Diffusion (CARD), a novel framework that unifies the training efficiency of ARMs with the high-throughput inference of diffusion models. CARD reformulates the diffusion process within a strictly causal attention mask, enabling dense, per-token supervision in a single forward pass. To address the optimization instability of causal diffusion, we introduce a soft-tailed masking schema to preserve local context and a context-aware reweighting mechanism derived from signal-to-noise principles. This design enables dynamic parallel decoding, where the model leverages KV-caching to adaptively generate variable-length token sequences based on confidence. Empirically, CARD outperforms existing discrete diffusion baselines while reducing training latency by 3 $\times$ compared to block diffusion methods. Our results demonstrate that CARD achieves ARM-level data efficiency while unlocking the latency benefits of parallel generation, establishing a robust paradigm for next-generation efficient LLMs.

### OD-Stega: LLM-Based Relatively Secure Steganography via Optimized Distributions
**Authors**: Yu-Shin Huang, Peter Just, Hanyun Yin, Krishna Narayanan, Ruihong Huang, Chao Tian

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:37:33Z

**Summary**: We consider coverless steganography where a Large Language Model (LLM) is used to generate stego-texts in combination with arithmetic coding. An efficient method should embed secret bits in as few language tokens as possible while keeping the stego-text as natural as possible. We show that this problem is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of a replacement probability distribution of the next token generation, subject to a constraint on the divergence between the new distribution and the original one produced by the LLM. A closed-form solution is provided under either the KL divergence or the total variation constraint. Several important practical issues are also tackled: 1) An often-overlooked tokenization mismatch issue is resolved with a simple prompt selection approach, 2) The combination of the optimized distribution and the vocabulary truncation technique is considered, and 3) The incorporation of the proposed approach with existing (potentially non arithmetic coding based) techniques, e.g., the Discop technique.

### Per-parameter Task Arithmetic for Unlearning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chengyi Cai, Zesheng Ye, Jiangchao Yao, Jianzhong Qi, Bo Han, Xiaolu Zhang, Feng Liu, Jun Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:35:32Z

**Summary**: In large language model (LLM) unlearning, private information is required to be removed. Task arithmetic unlearns by subtracting a specific task vector (TV)--defined as the parameter difference between a privacy-information-tuned model and the original model. While efficient, it can cause over-forgetting by disrupting parameters essential for retaining other information. Motivated by the observation that each parameter exhibits different importance for forgetting versus retention, we propose a per-parameter task arithmetic (PerTA) mechanism to rescale the TV, allowing per-parameter adjustment. These weights quantify the relative importance of each parameter for forgetting versus retention, estimated via gradients (i.e., PerTA-grad) or the diagonal Fisher information approximation (i.e., PerTA-fisher). Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of PerTA, extend it to a more general form, and provide further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PerTA consistently improves upon standard TV, and in many cases surpasses widely used training-based unlearning methods in both forgetting effectiveness and overall model utility. By retaining the efficiency of task arithmetic while mitigating over-forgetting, PerTA offers a principled and practical framework for LLM unlearning.

### From Logits to Latents: Contrastive Representation Shaping for LLM Unlearning
**Authors**: Haoran Tang, Rajiv Khanna

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:34:37Z

**Summary**: Most LLM unlearning methods aim to approximate retrain-from-scratch behaviors with minimal distribution shift, often via alignment-style objectives defined in the prediction space. While effective at reducing forgotten content generation, such approaches may act as suppression: forgotten concepts can persist in representations and remain entangled with retained knowledge. We introduce CLReg, a contrastive representation regularizer that identifies forget features while pushing them away from retain features, explicitly reducing forget-retain interference with minimal shifts on retain features. We provide first theoretical insights that relate representation shaping to entanglement reduction. Across unlearning benchmarks and LLMs of different sizes, CLReg decreases forget-retain representation entanglement that facilitates mainstream unlearning methods without positing extra privacy risks, inspiring future work that reshapes the representation space to remove forget concepts.

### CAR-bench: Evaluating the Consistency and Limit-Awareness of LLM Agents under Real-World Uncertainty
**Authors**: Johannes Kirmayr, Lukas Stappen, Elisabeth André

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:33:42Z

**Summary**: Existing benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents focus on task completion under idealistic settings but overlook reliability in real-world, user-facing applications. In domains, such as in-car voice assistants, users often issue incomplete or ambiguous requests, creating intrinsic uncertainty that agents must manage through dialogue, tool use, and policy adherence. We introduce CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant domain. The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Beyond standard task completion, CAR-bench introduces Hallucination tasks that test agents' limit-awareness under missing tools or information, and Disambiguation tasks that require resolving uncertainty through clarification or internal information gathering. Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types. Even frontier reasoning LLMs achieve less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information to satisfy user requests in Hallucination tasks, underscoring the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings.

### When "Better" Prompts Hurt: Evaluation-Driven Iteration for LLM Applications
**Authors**: Daniel Commey

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:32:34Z

**Summary**: Evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) applications differs from traditional software testing because outputs are stochastic, high-dimensional, and sensitive to prompt and model changes. We present an evaluation-driven workflow - Define, Test, Diagnose, Fix - that turns these challenges into a repeatable engineering loop.   We introduce the Minimum Viable Evaluation Suite (MVES), a tiered set of recommended evaluation components for (i) general LLM applications, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and (iii) agentic tool-use workflows. We also synthesize common evaluation methods (automated checks, human rubrics, and LLM-as-judge) and discuss known judge failure modes.   In reproducible local experiments (Ollama; Llama 3 8B Instruct and Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct), we observe that a generic "improved" prompt template can trade off behaviors: on our small structured suites, extraction pass rate decreased from 100% to 90% and RAG compliance from 93.3% to 80% for Llama 3 when replacing task-specific prompts with generic rules, while instruction-following improved. These findings motivate evaluation-driven prompt iteration and careful claim calibration rather than universal prompt recipes.   All test suites, harnesses, and results are included for reproducibility.

### RobustExplain: Evaluating Robustness of LLM-Based Explanation Agents for Recommendation
**Authors**: Guilin Zhang, Kai Zhao, Jeffrey Friedman, Xu Chu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:28:56Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate natural-language explanations in recommender systems, acting as explanation agents that reason over user behavior histories. While prior work has focused on explanation fluency and relevance under fixed inputs, the robustness of LLM-generated explanations to realistic user behavior noise remains largely unexplored. In real-world web platforms, interaction histories are inherently noisy due to accidental clicks, temporal inconsistencies, missing values, and evolving preferences, raising concerns about explanation stability and user trust. We present RobustExplain, the first systematic evaluation framework for measuring the robustness of LLM-generated recommendation explanations. RobustExplain introduces five realistic user behavior perturbations evaluated across multiple severity levels and a multi-dimensional robustness metric capturing semantic, keyword, structural, and length consistency. Our goal is to establish a principled, task-level evaluation framework and initial robustness baselines, rather than to provide a comprehensive leaderboard across all available LLMs. Experiments on four representative LLMs (7B--70B) show that current models exhibit only moderate robustness, with larger models achieving up to 8% higher stability. Our results establish the first robustness benchmarks for explanation agents and highlight robustness as a critical dimension for trustworthy, agent-driven recommender systems at web scale.

### Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization for Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning
**Authors**: Chengyi Cai, Zesheng Ye, Peike Li, Bo Han, Jianzhong Qi, Feng Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:26:54Z

**Summary**: Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the model from revealing private information when queried about target images. Existing MLLM unlearning methods largely adopt approaches developed for LLMs. They treat all answer tokens uniformly, disregarding their varying importance in the unlearning process. Moreover, these methods focus exclusively on the language modality, disregarding visual cues that indicate key tokens in answers. In this paper, after formulating the problem of unlearning in multimodal question answering for MLLMs, we propose Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization (ViKeR). We leverage irrelevant visual inputs to predict ideal post-unlearning token-level distributions and use these distributions to regularize the unlearning process, thereby prioritizing key tokens. Further, we define key tokens in unlearning via information entropy and discuss ViKeR's effectiveness through token-level gradient reweighting, which amplifies updates on key tokens. Experiments on MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that our method effectively performs unlearning while mitigating forgetting and maintaining response coherence.

### PocketDP3: Efficient Pocket-Scale 3D Visuomotor Policy
**Authors**: Jinhao Zhang, Zhexuan Zhou, Huizhe Li, Yichen Lai, Wenlong Xia, Haoming Song, Youmin Gong, Jie Me

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:23:25Z

**Summary**: Recently, 3D vision-based diffusion policies have shown strong capability in learning complex robotic manipulation skills. However, a common architectural mismatch exists in these models: a tiny yet efficient point-cloud encoder is often paired with a massive decoder. Given a compact scene representation, we argue that this may lead to substantial parameter waste in the decoder. Motivated by this observation, we propose PocketDP3, a pocket-scale 3D diffusion policy that replaces the heavy conditional U-Net decoder used in prior methods with a lightweight Diffusion Mixer (DiM) built on MLP-Mixer blocks. This architecture enables efficient fusion across temporal and channel dimensions, significantly reducing model size. Notably, without any additional consistency distillation techniques, our method supports two-step inference without sacrificing performance, improving practicality for real-time deployment. Across three simulation benchmarks--RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld--PocketDP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer than 1% of the parameters of prior methods, while also accelerating inference. Real-world experiments further demonstrate the practicality and transferability of our method in real-world settings. Code will be released.

### TBDFiltering: Sample-Efficient Tree-Based Data Filtering
**Authors**: Robert Istvan Busa-Fekete, Julian Zimmert, Anne Xiangyi Zheng, Claudio Gentile, Andras Gyorgy

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:22:06Z

**Summary**: The quality of machine learning models depends heavily on their training data. Selecting high-quality, diverse training sets for large language models (LLMs) is a difficult task, due to the lack of cheap and reliable quality metrics. While querying existing LLMs for document quality is common, this is not scalable to the large number (billions) of documents used in training. Instead, practitioners often use classifiers trained on sparse quality signals. In this paper, we propose a text-embedding-based hierarchical clustering approach that adaptively selects the documents to be evaluated by the LLM to estimate cluster quality. We prove that our method is query efficient: under the assumption that the hierarchical clustering contains a subtree such that each leaf cluster in the tree is pure enough (i.e., it mostly contains either only good or only bad documents), with high probability, the method can correctly predict the quality of each document after querying a small number of documents. The number of such documents is proportional to the size of the smallest subtree with (almost) pure leaves, without the algorithm knowing this subtree in advance. Furthermore, in a comprehensive experimental study, we demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm compared to other classifier-based filtering methods.

### LANCER: LLM Reranking for Nugget Coverage
**Authors**: Jia-Huei Ju, François G. Landry, Eugene Yang, Suzan Verberne, Andrew Yates

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:16:17Z

**Summary**: Unlike short-form retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), such as factoid question answering, long-form RAG requires retrieval to provide documents covering a wide range of relevant information. Automated report generation exemplifies this setting: it requires not only relevant information but also a more elaborate response with comprehensive information. Yet, existing retrieval methods are primarily optimized for relevance ranking rather than information coverage. To address this limitation, we propose LANCER, an LLM-based reranking method for nugget coverage. LANCER predicts what sub-questions should be answered to satisfy an information need, predicts which documents answer these sub-questions, and reranks documents in order to provide a ranked list covering as many information nuggets as possible. Our empirical results show that LANCER enhances the quality of retrieval as measured by nugget coverage metrics, achieving higher $α$-nDCG and information coverage than other LLM-based reranking methods. Our oracle analysis further reveals that sub-question generation plays an essential role.

### Machine learning with minimal use of quantum computers: Provable advantages in Learning Under Quantum Privileged Information (LUQPI)
**Authors**: Vasily Bokov, Lisa Kohl, Sebastian Schmitt, Vedran Dunjko

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:14:58Z

**Summary**: Quantum machine learning (QML) is often listed as a promising candidate for useful applications of quantum computers, in part due to numerous proofs of possible quantum advantages. A central question is how small a role quantum computers can play while still enabling provable learning advantages over classical methods. We study an especially restricted setting in which a quantum computer is used only as a feature extractor: it acts independently on individual data points, without access to labels or global dataset information, is available only to augment the training set, and is not available at deployment. Training and deployment are therefore carried out by fully classical learners on a dataset augmented with quantum-generated features. We formalize this model by adapting the classical framework of Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI) to the quantum case, which we call Learning Under Quantum Privileged Information (LUQPI). Within this framework, we show that even such minimally involved quantum feature extraction, available only during training, can yield exponential quantum-classical separations for suitable concept classes and data distributions under reasonable computational assumptions. We further situate LUQPI within a taxonomy of related quantum and classical learning settings and show how standard classical machinery, most notably the SVM+ algorithm, can exploit quantum-augmented data. Finally, we present numerical experiments in a physically motivated many-body setting, where privileged quantum features are expectation values of observables on ground states, and observe consistent performance gains for LUQPI-style models over strong classical baselines.

### LLMs as Orchestrators: Constraint-Compliant Multi-Agent Optimization for Recommendation Systems
**Authors**: Guilin Zhang, Kai Zhao, Jeffrey Friedman, Xu Chu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:11:09Z

**Summary**: Recommendation systems must optimize multiple objectives while satisfying hard business constraints such as fairness and coverage. For example, an e-commerce platform may require every recommendation list to include items from multiple sellers and at least one newly listed product; violating such constraints--even once--is unacceptable in production. Prior work on multi-objective recommendation and recent LLM-based recommender agents largely treat constraints as soft penalties or focus on item scoring and interaction, leading to frequent violations in real-world deployments. How to leverage LLMs for coordinating constrained optimization in recommendation systems remains underexplored. We propose DualAgent-Rec, an LLM-coordinated dual-agent framework for constrained multi-objective e-commerce recommendation. The framework separates optimization into an Exploitation Agent that prioritizes accuracy under hard constraints and an Exploration Agent that promotes diversity through unconstrained Pareto search. An LLM-based coordinator adaptively allocates resources between agents based on optimization progress and constraint satisfaction, while an adaptive epsilon-relaxation mechanism guarantees feasibility of final solutions. Experiments on the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset demonstrate that DualAgent-Rec achieves 100% constraint satisfaction and improves Pareto hypervolume by 4-6% over strong baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy-diversity trade-offs. These results indicate that LLMs can act as effective orchestration agents for deployable and constraint-compliant recommendation systems.

### Mechanistic Data Attribution: Tracing the Training Origins of Interpretable LLM Units
**Authors**: Jianhui Chen, Yuzhang Luo, Liangming Pan

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:06:54Z

**Summary**: While Mechanistic Interpretability has identified interpretable circuits in LLMs, their causal origins in training data remain elusive. We introduce Mechanistic Data Attribution (MDA), a scalable framework that employs Influence Functions to trace interpretable units back to specific training samples. Through extensive experiments on the Pythia family, we causally validate that targeted intervention--removing or augmenting a small fraction of high-influence samples--significantly modulates the emergence of interpretable heads, whereas random interventions show no effect. Our analysis reveals that repetitive structural data (e.g., LaTeX, XML) acts as a mechanistic catalyst. Furthermore, we observe that interventions targeting induction head formation induce a concurrent change in the model's in-context learning (ICL) capability. This provides direct causal evidence for the long-standing hypothesis regarding the functional link between induction heads and ICL. Finally, we propose a mechanistic data augmentation pipeline that consistently accelerates circuit convergence across model scales, providing a principled methodology for steering the developmental trajectories of LLMs.

### SpecTran: Spectral-Aware Transformer-based Adapter for LLM-Enhanced Sequential Recommendation
**Authors**: Yu Cui, Feng Liu, Zhaoxiang Wang, Changwang Zhang, Jun Wang, Can Wang, Jiawei Chen

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T17:00:27Z

**Summary**: Traditional sequential recommendation (SR) models learn low-dimensional item ID embeddings from user-item interactions, often overlooking textual information such as item titles or descriptions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have inspired a surge of research that encodes item textual information with high-dimensional semantic embeddings, and designs transformation methods to inject such embeddings into SR models. These embedding transformation strategies can be categorized into two types, both of which exhibits notable drawbacks: 1) adapter-based methods suffer from pronounced dimension collapse, concentrating information into a few dominant dimensions; 2) SVD-based methods are rigid and manual, considering only a few principal spectral components while discarding rich information in the remaining spectrum.   To address these limitations, we propose SpecTran, a spectral-aware transformer-based adapter that operates in the spectral domain, attending to the full spectrum to select and aggregates informative components. A learnable spectral-position encoding injects singular-value cues as an inductive bias, guiding attention toward salient spectral components and promoting diversity across embedding dimensions. Across four real-world datasets and three SR backbones, it consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving an average improvement of 9.17%.

### Bridging Graph Structure and Knowledge-Guided Editing for Interpretable Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning
**Authors**: Shiqi Fan, Quanming Yao, Hongyi Nie, Wentao Ma, Zhen Wang, Wen Hua

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:55:13Z

**Summary**: Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) aims to predict future events by inferring missing entities with dynamic knowledge structures. Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs. This limits structural information understanding, leading to unstructured, hallucination-prone inferences especially with temporal inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets. Additionally, we execute ablation studies and additional analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component.

However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenMLRL/CoMLRL/releases/tag/v1.3.2.

### MoE-ACT: Improving Surgical Imitation Learning Policies through Supervised Mixture-of-Experts
**Authors**: Lorenzo Mazza, Ariel Rodriguez, Rayan Younis, Martin Lelis, Ortrun Hellig, Chenpan Li, Sebastian Bodenstedt, Martin Wagner, Stefanie Speidel

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:50:14Z

**Summary**: Imitation learning has achieved remarkable success in robotic manipulation, yet its application to surgical robotics remains challenging due to data scarcity, constrained workspaces, and the need for an exceptional level of safety and predictability. We present a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed for phase-structured surgical manipulation tasks, which can be added on top of any autonomous policy. Unlike prior surgical robot learning approaches that rely on multi-camera setups or thousands of demonstrations, we show that a lightweight action decoder policy like Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) can learn complex, long-horizon manipulation from less than 150 demonstrations using solely stereo endoscopic images, when equipped with our architecture. We evaluate our approach on the collaborative surgical task of bowel grasping and retraction, where a robot assistant interprets visual cues from a human surgeon, executes targeted grasping on deformable tissue, and performs sustained retraction. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and the standard ACT baseline. Our results show that generalist VLAs fail to acquire the task entirely, even under standard in-distribution conditions. Furthermore, while standard ACT achieves moderate success in-distribution, adopting a supervised MoE architecture significantly boosts its performance, yielding higher success rates in-distribution and demonstrating superior robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, including novel grasp locations, reduced illumination, and partial occlusions. Notably, it generalizes to unseen testing viewpoints and also transfers zero-shot to ex vivo porcine tissue without additional training, offering a promising pathway toward in vivo deployment. To support this, we present qualitative preliminary results of policy roll-outs during in vivo porcine surgery.

### Token-Guard: Towards Token-Level Hallucination Control via Self-Checking Decoding
**Authors**: Yifan Zhu, Huiqiang Rong, Haoran Luo

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:48:47Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate, generating content inconsistent with the input. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can mitigate hallucinations but require resource-intensive retrieval or large-scale fine-tuning. Decoding-based methods are lighter yet lack explicit hallucination control. To address this, we present Token-Guard, a token-level hallucination control method based on self-checking decoding. Token-Guard performs internal verification at each reasoning step to detect hallucinated tokens before they propagate. Candidate fragments are further evaluated in a latent space with explicit hallucination risk scoring, while iterative pruning and regeneration dynamically correct detected errors. Experiments on HALU datasets show Token-Guard substantially reduces hallucinations and improves generation accuracy, offering a scalable, modular solution for reliable LLM outputs. Our code is publicly available.

### "In my defense, only three hours on Instagram": Designing Toward Digital Self-Awareness and Wellbeing
**Authors**: Karthik S. Bhat, Jiayue Melissa Shi, Wenxuan Song, Dong Whi Yoo, Koustuv Saha

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:44:27Z

**Summary**: Screen use pervades daily life, shaping work, leisure, and social connections while raising concerns for digital wellbeing. Yet, reducing screen time alone risks oversimplifying technology's role and neglecting its potential for meaningful engagement. We posit self-awareness -- reflecting on one's digital behavior -- as a critical pathway to digital wellbeing. We developed WellScreen, a lightweight probe that scaffolds daily reflection by asking people to estimate and report smartphone use. In a two-week deployment with college students (N=25) focused on generating formative insights, we examined how discrepancies between estimated and actual usage shaped digital awareness and wellbeing. Participants often underestimated productivity and social media while overestimating entertainment app use. They showed a 10% improvement in positive affect, rating WellScreen as moderately useful. Interviews revealed that structured reflection supported recognition of patterns, adjustment of expectations, and more intentional engagement with technology. Our findings highlight the promise of lightweight reflective interventions for supporting self-awareness and intentional digital engagement, offering implications for designing digital wellbeing tools.

### Industrialized Deception: The Collateral Effects of LLM-Generated Misinformation on Digital Ecosystems
**Authors**: Alexander Loth, Martin Kappes, Marc-Oliver Pahl

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:42:22Z

**Summary**: Generative AI and misinformation research has evolved since our 2024 survey. This paper presents an updated perspective, transitioning from literature review to practical countermeasures. We report on changes in the threat landscape, including improved AI-generated content through Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal systems. Central to this work are our practical contributions: JudgeGPT, a platform for evaluating human perception of AI-generated news, and RogueGPT, a controlled stimulus generation engine for research. Together, these tools form an experimental pipeline for studying how humans perceive and detect AI-generated misinformation. Our findings show that detection capabilities have improved, but the competition between generation and detection continues. We discuss mitigation strategies including LLM-based detection, inoculation approaches, and the dual-use nature of generative AI. This work contributes to research addressing the adverse impacts of AI on information quality.

### SAC-GLAM: Improving Online RL for LLM agents with Soft Actor-Critic and Hindsight Relabeling
**Authors**: Loris Gaven, Clement Romac, Thomas Carta, Sylvain Lamprier, Olivier Sigaud, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:31:07Z

**Summary**: The past years have seen Large Language Models (LLMs) strive not only as generative models but also as agents solving textual sequential decision-making tasks. When facing complex environments where their zero-shot abilities are insufficient, recent work showed online Reinforcement Learning (RL) could be used for the LLM agent to discover and learn efficient strategies interactively. However, most prior work sticks to on-policy algorithms, which greatly reduces the scope of methods such agents could use for both exploration and exploitation, such as experience replay and hindsight relabeling. Yet, such methods may be key for LLM learning agents, and in particular when designing autonomous intrinsically motivated agents sampling and pursuing their own goals (i.e. autotelic agents). This paper presents and studies an adaptation of Soft Actor-Critic and hindsight relabeling to LLM agents. Our method not only paves the path towards autotelic LLM agents that learn online but can also outperform on-policy methods in more classic multi-goal RL environments.

**Authors**: Armina Fani, Mike Doan, Isabelle Le, Alex Fedorov, Malte Hoffmann, Chris Rorden, Sergey Plis

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:30:42Z

**Summary**: Deployment complexity and specialized hardware requirements hinder the adoption of deep learning models in neuroimaging. We present MindGrab, a lightweight, fully convolutional model for volumetric skull stripping across all imaging modalities. MindGrab's architecture is designed from first principles using a spectral interpretation of dilated convolutions, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance (mean Dice score across datasets and modalities: 95.9 with SD 1.6), with up to 40-fold speedups and substantially lower memory demands compared to established methods. Its minimal footprint allows for fast, full-volume processing in resource-constrained environments, including direct in-browser execution. MindGrab is delivered via the BrainChop platform as both a simple command-line tool (pip install brainchop) and a zero-installation web application (brainchop.org). By removing traditional deployment barriers without sacrificing accuracy, MindGrab makes state-of-the-art neuroimaging analysis broadly accessible.

### ToolWeaver: Weaving Collaborative Semantics for Scalable Tool Use in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Bowen Fang, Wen Ye, Yunyue Su, Jinghao Zhang, Qiang Liu, Yesheng Liu, Xin Sun, Shu Wu, Jiabing Yang, Baole Wei, Liang Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:29:53Z

**Summary**: Prevalent retrieval-based tool-use pipelines struggle with a dual semantic challenge: their retrievers often employ encoders that fail to capture complex semantics, while the Large Language Model (LLM) itself lacks intrinsic tool knowledge from its natural language pretraining. Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.

### AgenticSimLaw: A Juvenile Courtroom Multi-Agent Debate Simulation for Explainable High-Stakes Tabular Decision Making
**Authors**: Jon Chun, Kathrine Elkins, Yong Suk Lee

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:26:10Z

**Summary**: We introduce AgenticSimLaw, a role-structured, multi-agent debate framework that provides transparent and controllable test-time reasoning for high-stakes tabular decision-making tasks. Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight. This work addresses key LLM-based multi-agent system challenges: organization through structured roles, observability through logged interactions, and responsibility through explicit non-deployment constraints for sensitive domains. Data, results, and code will be available on github.com under the MIT license.

### WorldLLM: Improving LLMs' world modeling using curiosity-driven theory-making
**Authors**: Guillaume Levy, Cedric Colas, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, Thomas Carta, Clement Romac

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:25:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess general world knowledge but often struggle to generate precise predictions in structured, domain-specific contexts such as simulations. These limitations arise from their inability to ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment dynamics.

### Optimizing Multi-Hop Document Retrieval Through Intermediate Representations
**Authors**: Jiaen Lin, Jingyu Liu, Yingbo Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:19:47Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) encounters challenges when addressing complex queries, particularly multi-hop questions. While several methods tackle multi-hop queries by iteratively generating internal queries and retrieving external documents, these approaches are computationally expensive. In this paper, we identify a three-stage information processing pattern in LLMs during layer-by-layer reasoning, consisting of extraction, processing, and subsequent extraction steps. This observation suggests that the representations in intermediate layers contain richer information compared to those in other layers. Building on this insight, we propose Layer-wise RAG (L-RAG). Unlike prior methods that focus on generating new internal queries, L-RAG leverages intermediate representations from the middle layers, which capture next-hop information, to retrieve external knowledge. L-RAG achieves performance comparable to multi-step approaches while maintaining inference overhead similar to that of standard RAG. Experimental results show that L-RAG outperforms existing RAG methods on open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets, including MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA. The code is available in https://github.com/Olive-2019/L-RAG

### SONIC: Segmented Optimized Nexus for Information Compression in Key-Value Caching
**Authors**: Hong Chen, Xiang Liu, Bo Wang, Yuxuan Fan, Yuanlin Chu, Zongluo Li, Xiaowen Chu, Xuming Hu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:18:08Z

**Summary**: The linear growth of Key-Value (KV) cache remains a bottleneck for multi-turn LLM deployment. Existing KV cache compression methods often fail to account for the structural properties of multi-turn dialogues, relying on heuristic eviction that risks losing critical context. We propose \textbf{SONIC}, a learning-based framework that compresses historical segments into compact and semantically rich \textbf{Nexus} tokens. By integrating dynamic budget training, SONIC allows flexible adaptation to varying memory constraints without retraining. Experiments show that at compression ratios of 80\% and 50\%, SONIC consistently outperforms baselines such as H2O and StreamingLLM on four diverse multi-turn benchmarks. Specifically, on the widely used MTBench101 benchmark, SONIC achieves an average score improvement of 35.55\% over state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness in sustaining coherent multi-turn dialogues. Furthermore, SONIC enhances deployment efficiency, accelerating the overall inference process by 50.1\% compared to full-context generation.

### Information Filtering via Variational Regularization for Robot Manipulation
**Authors**: Jinhao Zhang, Wenlong Xia, Yaojia Wang, Zhexuan Zhou, Huizhe Li, Yichen Lai, Haoming Song, Youmin Gong, Jie Me

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:17:42Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based visuomotor policies built on 3D visual representations have achieved strong performance in learning complex robotic skills. However, most existing methods employ an oversized denoising decoder. While increasing model capacity can improve denoising, empirical evidence suggests that it also introduces redundancy and noise in intermediate feature blocks. Crucially, we find that randomly masking backbone features at inference time (without changing training) can improve performance, confirming the presence of task-irrelevant noise in intermediate features. To this end, we propose Variational Regularization (VR), a lightweight module that imposes a timestep-conditioned Gaussian over backbone features and applies a KL-divergence regularizer, forming an adaptive information bottleneck. Extensive experiments on three simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld) show that, compared to the baseline DP3, our approach improves the success rate by 6.1% on RoboTwin2.0 and by 4.1% on Adroit and MetaWorld, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Real-world experiments further demonstrate that our method performs well in practical deployments. Code will released.

### Self-Compression of Chain-of-Thought via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Yiqun Chen, Jinyuan Feng, Wei Yang, Meizhi Zhong, Zhengliang Shi, Rui Li, Xiaochi Wei, Yan Gao, Yi Wu, Yao Hu, Zhiqiang Pu, Jiaxin Mao

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:13:10Z

**Summary**: The inference overhead induced by redundant reasoning undermines the interactive experience and severely bottlenecks the deployment of Large Reasoning Models. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based solutions tackle this problem by coupling a length penalty with outcome-based rewards. This simplistic reward weighting struggles to reconcile brevity with accuracy, as enforcing brevity may compromise critical reasoning logic. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a multi-agent RL framework that selectively penalizes redundant chunks, while preserving essential reasoning logic. Our framework, Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA), instantiates redundancy detection and evaluation through two specialized agents: \textbf{a Segmentation Agent} for decomposing the reasoning process into logical chunks, and \textbf{a Scoring Agent} for quantifying the significance of each chunk. The Segmentation and Scoring agents collaboratively define an importance-weighted length penalty during training, incentivizing \textbf{a Reasoning Agent} to prioritize essential logic without introducing inference overhead during deployment. Empirical evaluations across model scales demonstrate that SCMA reduces response length by 11.1\% to 39.0\% while boosting accuracy by 4.33\% to 10.02\%. Furthermore, ablation studies and qualitative analysis validate that the synergistic optimization within the MARL framework fosters emergent behaviors, yielding more powerful LRMs compared to vanilla RL paradigms.

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:05:40Z

**Summary**: This technical report introduces Uni-Parser, an industrial-grade document parsing engine tailored for scientific literature and patents, delivering high throughput, robust accuracy, and cost efficiency. Unlike pipeline-based document parsing methods, Uni-Parser employs a modular, loosely coupled multi-expert architecture that preserves fine-grained cross-modal alignments across text, equations, tables, figures, and chemical structures, while remaining easily extensible to emerging modalities. The system incorporates adaptive GPU load balancing, distributed inference, dynamic module orchestration, and configurable modes that support either holistic or modality-specific parsing. Optimized for large-scale cloud deployment, Uni-Parser achieves a processing rate of up to 20 PDF pages per second on 8 x NVIDIA RTX 4090D GPUs, enabling cost-efficient inference across billions of pages. This level of scalability facilitates a broad spectrum of downstream applications, ranging from literature retrieval and summarization to the extraction of chemical structures, reaction schemes, and bioactivity data, as well as the curation of large-scale corpora for training next-generation large language models and AI4Science models.

### Near-Optimal Online Deployment and Routing for Streaming LLMs
**Authors**: Shaoang Li, Jian Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:04:59Z

**Summary**: The rapid pace at which new large language models (LLMs) appear, and older ones become obsolete, forces providers to manage a streaming inventory under a strict concurrency cap and per-query cost budgets. We cast this as an online decision problem that couples stage-wise deployment (at fixed maintenance windows) with per-query routing among live models. We introduce StageRoute, a hierarchical algorithm that (i) optimistically selects up to $M_{\max}$ models for the next stage using reward upper-confidence and cost lower-confidence bounds, and (ii) routes each incoming query by solving a budget- and throughput-constrained bandit subproblem over the deployed set. We prove a regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ with a matching lower bound, establishing near-optimality, and validate the theory empirically: StageRoute tracks a strong oracle under tight budgets across diverse workloads.

### Health Facility Location in Ethiopia: Leveraging LLMs to Integrate Expert Knowledge into Algorithmic Planning
**Authors**: Yohai Trabelsi, Guojun Xiong, Fentabil Getnet, Stéphane Verguet, Milind Tambe

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:03:50Z

**Summary**: Ethiopia's Ministry of Health is upgrading health posts to improve access to essential services, particularly in rural areas. Limited resources, however, require careful prioritization of which facilities to upgrade to maximize population coverage while accounting for diverse expert and stakeholder preferences. In collaboration with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we propose a hybrid framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge with optimization techniques. Classical optimization methods provide theoretical guarantees but require explicit, quantitative objectives, whereas stakeholder criteria are often articulated in natural language and difficult to formalize. To bridge these domains, we develop the Large language model and Extended Greedy (LEG) framework. Our framework combines a provable approximation algorithm for population coverage optimization with LLM-driven iterative refinement that incorporates human-AI alignment to ensure solutions reflect expert qualitative guidance while preserving coverage guarantees. Experiments on real-world data from three Ethiopian regions demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and its potential to inform equitable, data-driven health system planning.

### A Framework for Creating Non-Regressive Test Cases via Branch Consistency Analysis Driven by Descriptions
**Authors**: Pengyu Xue, Yuxiang Zhang, Zhen Yang, Xiaoxue Ren, Xiang Li, Pengfei Hu, Linhao Wu, Kainan Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:01:15Z

**Summary**: Automated test-generation research overwhelmingly assumes the correctness of focal methods, yet practitioners routinely face non-regression scenarios where the focal method may be defective. A baseline evaluation of EvoSuite and two leading Large Language Model (LLM)-based generators, namely ChatTester and ChatUniTest, on defective focal methods reveals that despite achieving up to 83% of branch coverage, none of the generated tests expose defects.   To resolve this problem, we first construct two new benchmarks, namely Defects4J-Desc and QuixBugs-Desc, for experiments. In particular, each focal method is equipped with an extra Natural Language Description (NLD) for code functionality understanding.   Subsequently, we propose DISTINCT, a Description-guided, branch-consistency analysis framework that transforms LLMs into fault-aware test generators. DISTINCT carries three iterative components: (1) a Generator that derives initial tests based on the NLDs and the focal method, (2) a Validator that iteratively fixes uncompilable tests using compiler diagnostics, and (3) an Analyzer that iteratively aligns test behavior with NLD semantics via branch-level analysis.   Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, DISTINCT achieves an average improvement of 14.64% in Compilation Success Rate (CSR) and 6.66% in Passing Rate (PR) across both benchmarks. It notably enhances Defect Detection Rate (DDR) on both benchmarks, with a particularly significant gain of 149.26% observed on Defects4J-Desc. In terms of code coverage, DISTINCT improves Statement Coverage (SC) by an average of 3.77% and Branch Coverage (BC) by 5.36%. These results set a new baseline for non-regressive test generation and highlight how description-driven reasoning enables LLMs to move beyond coverage chasing toward effective defect detection.

### From Meta-Thought to Execution: Cognitively Aligned Post-Training for Generalizable and Reliable LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Shaojie Wang, Liang Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:00:48Z

**Summary**: Current LLM post-training methods optimize complete reasoning trajectories through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability. Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19\% and 4.63\% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution respectively over standard methods, while reducing training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%, demonstrating that aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields not only superior generalization but also enhanced training efficiency.

### GenOM: Ontology Matching with Description Generation and Large Language Model
**Authors**: Yiping Song, Jiaoyan Chen, Renate A. Schmidt

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T16:00:15Z

**Summary**: Ontology matching (OM) plays an essential role in enabling semantic interoperability and integration across heterogeneous knowledge sources, particularly in the biomedical domain which contains numerous complex concepts related to diseases and pharmaceuticals. This paper introduces GenOM, a large language model (LLM)-based ontology alignment framework, which enriches the semantic representations of ontology concepts via generating textual definitions, retrieves alignment candidates with an embedding model, and incorporates exact matching-based tools to improve precision. Extensive experiments conducted on the OAEI Bio-ML track demonstrate that GenOM can often achieve competitive performance, surpassing many baselines including traditional OM systems and recent LLM-based methods. Further ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting, highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability.

### A Low-Complexity Plug-and-Play Deep Learning Model for Generalizable Massive MIMO Precoding
**Authors**: Ali Hasanzadeh Karkan, Ahmed Ibrahim, Jean-François Frigon, François Leduc-Primeau

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:56:07Z

**Summary**: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) downlink precoding offers high spectral efficiency but remains challenging to deploy in practice because near-optimal algorithms such as the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) are computationally expensive, and sensitive to SNR and channel-estimation quality, while existing deep learning (DL)-based solutions often lack robustness and require retraining for each deployment site. This paper proposes a plug-and-play precoder (PaPP), a DL framework with a backbone that can be trained for either fully digital (FDP) or hybrid beamforming (HBF) precoding and reused across sites, transmit-power levels, and with varying amounts of channel estimation error, avoiding the need to train a new model from scratch at each deployment. PaPP combines a high-capacity teacher and a compact student with a self-supervised loss that balances teacher imitation and normalized sum-rate, trained using meta-learning domain-generalization and transmit-power-aware input normalization. Numerical results on ray-tracing data from three unseen sites show that the PaPP FDP and HBF models both outperform conventional and deep learning baselines, after fine-tuning with a small set of local unlabeled samples. Across both architectures, PaPP achieves more than 21$\times$ reduction in modeled computation energy and maintains good performance under channel-estimation errors, making it a practical solution for energy-efficient mMIMO precoding.

### Learn-to-Distance: Distance Learning for Detecting LLM-Generated Text
**Authors**: Hongyi Zhou, Jin Zhu, Erhan Xu, Kai Ye, Ying Yang, Chengchun Shi

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:55:15Z

**Summary**: Modern large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, and Gemini have transformed the way we learn, work, and communicate. Yet, their ability to produce highly human-like text raises serious concerns about misinformation and academic integrity, making it an urgent need for reliable algorithms to detect LLM-generated content. In this paper, we start by presenting a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms, revealing their underlying rationale and demonstrating their generalization ability. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text. Theoretically, we demonstrate that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with over 100 settings, and find that our approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in the majority of scenarios. In particular, it achieves relative improvements from 57.8\% to 80.6\% over the strongest baseline across different target LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, and Gemini).

### Not All Code Is Equal: A Data-Centric Study of Code Complexity and LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Lukas Twist, Shu Yang, Hanqi Yan, Jingzhi Gong, Di Wang, Helen Yannakoudakis, Jie M. Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:54:40Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit strong reasoning abilities, often attributed to their capacity to generate chain-of-thought-style intermediate reasoning. Recent work suggests that exposure to code can further enhance these skills, but existing studies largely treat code as a generic training signal, leaving open the question of which properties of code actually contribute to improved reasoning. To address this gap, we study the structural complexity of code, which captures control flow and compositional structure that may shape how models internalise multi-step reasoning during fine-tuning. We examine two complementary settings: solution-driven complexity, where complexity varies across multiple solutions to the same problem, and problem-driven complexity, where complexity reflects variation in the underlying tasks. Using cyclomatic complexity and logical lines of code to construct controlled fine-tuning datasets, we evaluate a range of open-weight LLMs on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that although code can improve reasoning, structural properties strongly determine its usefulness. In 83% of experiments, restricting fine-tuning data to a specific structural complexity range outperforms training on structurally diverse code, pointing to a data-centric path for improving reasoning beyond scaling.

**Authors**: Rem Collier, Katharine Beaumont, Andrei Ciortea

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:46:13Z

**Summary**: Given the emergence of Generative AI over the last two years and the increasing focus on Agentic AI as a form of Multi-Agent System it is important to explore both how such technologies can impact the use of traditional Agent Toolkits and how the wealth of experience encapsulated in those toolkits can influence the design of the new agentic platforms. This paper presents an overview of our experience developing a prototype large language model (LLM) integration for the ASTRA programming language. It presents a brief overview of the toolkit, followed by three example implementations, concluding with a discussion of the experiences garnered through the examples.

### SimpleMem: Efficient Lifelong Memory for LLM Agents
**Authors**: Jiaqi Liu, Yaofeng Su, Peng Xia, Siwei Han, Zeyu Zheng, Cihang Xie, Mingyu Ding, Huaxiu Yao

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:45:24Z

**Summary**: To support long-term interaction in complex environments, LLM agents require memory systems that manage historical experiences. Existing approaches either retain full interaction histories via passive context extension, leading to substantial redundancy, or rely on iterative reasoning to filter noise, incurring high token costs. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleMem, an efficient memory framework based on semantic lossless compression. We propose a three-stage pipeline designed to maximize information density and token utilization: (1) Semantic Structured Compression, which distills unstructured interactions into compact, multi-view indexed memory units; (2) Online Semantic Synthesis, an intra-session process that instantly integrates related context into unified abstract representations to eliminate redundancy; and (3) Intent-Aware Retrieval Planning, which infers search intent to dynamically determine retrieval scope and construct precise context efficiently. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost, achieving an average F1 improvement of 26.4% in LoCoMo while reducing inference-time token consumption by up to 30-fold, demonstrating a superior balance between performance and efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/SimpleMem.

### d3LLM: Ultra-Fast Diffusion LLM using Pseudo-Trajectory Distillation
**Authors**: Yu-Yang Qian, Junda Su, Lanxiang Hu, Peiyuan Zhang, Zhijie Deng, Peng Zhao, Hao Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:45:13Z

**Summary**: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer capabilities beyond those of autoregressive (AR) LLMs, such as parallel decoding and random-order generation. However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/d3LLM.

### Evolution of Benchmark: Black-Box Optimization Benchmark Design through Large Language Model
**Authors**: Chen Wang, Sijie Ma, Zeyuan Ma, Yue-Jiao Gong

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:45:11Z

**Summary**: Benchmark Design in Black-Box Optimization (BBO) is a fundamental yet open-ended topic. Early BBO benchmarks are predominantly human-crafted, introducing expert bias and constraining diversity. Automating this design process can relieve the human-in-the-loop burden while enhancing diversity and objectivity. We propose Evolution of Benchmark (EoB), an automated BBO benchmark designer empowered by the large language model (LLM) and its program evolution capability. Specifically, we formulate benchmark design as a bi-objective optimization problem towards maximizing (i) landscape diversity and (ii) algorithm-differentiation ability across a portfolio of BBO solvers. Under this paradigm, EoB iteratively prompts LLM to evolve a population of benchmark programs and employs a reflection-based scheme to co-evolve the landscape and its corresponding program. Comprehensive experiments validate our EoB is a competitive candidate in multi-dimensional usages: 1) Benchmarking BBO algorithms; 2) Training and testing learning-assisted BBO algorithms; 3) Extending proxy for expensive real-world problems.

### LLM-Driven Scenario-Aware Planning for Autonomous Driving
**Authors**: He Li, Zhaowei Chen, Rui Gao, Guoliang Li, Qi Hao, Shuai Wang, Chengzhong Xu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:42:13Z

**Summary**: Hybrid planner switching framework (HPSF) for autonomous driving needs to reconcile high-speed driving efficiency with safe maneuvering in dense traffic. Existing HPSF methods often fail to make reliable mode transitions or sustain efficient driving in congested environments, owing to heuristic scene recognition and low-frequency control updates. To address the limitation, this paper proposes LAP, a large language model (LLM) driven, adaptive planning method, which switches between high-speed driving in low-complexity scenes and precise driving in high-complexity scenes, enabling high qualities of trajectory generation through confined gaps. This is achieved by leveraging LLM for scene understanding and integrating its inference into the joint optimization of mode configuration and motion planning. The joint optimization is solved using tree-search model predictive control and alternating minimization. We implement LAP by Python in Robot Operating System (ROS). High-fidelity simulation results show that the proposed LAP outperforms other benchmarks in terms of both driving time and success rate.

### KnowBias: Mitigating Social Bias in LLMs via Know-Bias Neuron Enhancement
**Authors**: Jinhao Pan, Chahat Raj, Anjishnu Mukherjee, Sina Mansouri, Bowen Wei, Shloka Yada, Ziwei Zhu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:32:38Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases that reinforce harmful stereotypes, limiting their safe deployment. Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining. Experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art debiasing performance with minimal utility degradation. Data and code are available at https://github.com/JP-25/KnowBias.

### Reputation as a Solution to Cooperation Collapse in LLM-based MASs
**Authors**: Siyue Ren, Wanli Fu, Xinkun Zou, Chen Shen, Yi Cai, Chen Chu, Zhen Wang, Shuyue Hu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:30:02Z

**Summary**: Cooperation has long been a fundamental topic in both human society and AI systems. However, recent studies indicate that the collapse of cooperation may emerge in multi-agent systems (MASs) driven by large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we explore reputation systems as a remedy. We propose RepuNet, a dynamic, dual-level reputation framework that models both agent-level reputation dynamics and system-level network evolution. Specifically, driven by direct interactions and indirect gossip, agents form reputations for both themselves and their peers, and decide whether to connect or disconnect other agents for future interactions. Through three distinct scenarios, we show that RepuNet effectively avoids cooperation collapse, promoting and sustaining cooperation in LLM-based MASs. Moreover, we find that reputation systems can give rise to rich emergent behaviors in LLM-based MASs, such as the formation of cooperative clusters, the social isolation of exploitative agents, and the preference for sharing positive gossip rather than negative ones. The GitHub repository for our project can be accessed via the following link: https://github.com/RGB-0000FF/RepuNet.

### DRIFT: Detecting Representational Inconsistencies for Factual Truthfulness
**Authors**: Rohan Bhatnagar, Youran Sun, Chi Andrew Zhang, Yixin Wen, Haizhao Yang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:25:01Z

**Summary**: LLMs often produce fluent but incorrect answers, yet detecting such hallucinations typically requires multiple sampling passes or post-hoc verification, adding significant latency and cost. We hypothesize that intermediate layers encode confidence signals that are lost in the final output layer, and propose a lightweight probe to read these signals directly from hidden states. The probe adds less than 0.1\% computational overhead and can run fully in parallel with generation, enabling hallucination detection before the answer is produced. Building on this, we develop an LLM router that answers confident queries immediately while delegating uncertain ones to stronger models. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves SOTA AUROC on 10 out of 12 settings across four QA benchmarks and three LLM families, with gains of up to 13 points over prior methods, and generalizes across dataset shifts without retraining.

### READY: Reward Discovery for Meta-Black-Box Optimization
**Authors**: Zechuan Huang, Zhiguang Cao, Hongshu Guo, Yue-Jiao Gong, Zeyuan Ma

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:23:18Z

**Summary**: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) is an emerging avenue within Optimization community, where algorithm design policy could be meta-learned by reinforcement learning to enhance optimization performance. So far, the reward functions in existing MetaBBO works are designed by human experts, introducing certain design bias and risks of reward hacking. In this paper, we use Large Language Model~(LLM) as an automated reward discovery tool for MetaBBO. Specifically, we consider both effectiveness and efficiency sides. On effectiveness side, we borrow the idea of evolution of heuristics, introducing tailored evolution paradigm in the iterative LLM-based program search process, which ensures continuous improvement. On efficiency side, we additionally introduce multi-task evolution architecture to support parallel reward discovery for diverse MetaBBO approaches. Such parallel process also benefits from knowledge sharing across tasks to accelerate convergence. Empirical results demonstrate that the reward functions discovered by our approach could be helpful for boosting existing MetaBBO works, underscoring the importance of reward design in MetaBBO. We provide READY's project at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ICML_READY-747F.

### OAEI-LLM: A Benchmark Dataset for Understanding Large Language Model Hallucinations in Ontology Matching
**Authors**: Zhangcheng Qiang, Kerry Taylor, Weiqing Wang, Jing Jiang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:22:06Z

**Summary**: Hallucinations of large language models (LLMs) commonly occur in domain-specific downstream tasks, with no exception in ontology matching (OM). The prevalence of using LLMs for OM raises the need for benchmarks to better understand LLM hallucinations. The OAEI-LLM dataset is an extended version of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) datasets that evaluate LLM-specific hallucinations in OM tasks. We outline the methodology used in dataset construction and schema extension, and provide examples of potential use cases.

### Embodied Task Planning via Graph-Informed Action Generation with Large Lanaguage Model
**Authors**: Xiang Li, Ning Yan, Masood Mortazavi

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:18:58Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot reasoning capabilities, their deployment as embodied agents still faces fundamental challenges in long-horizon planning. Unlike open-ended text generation, embodied agents must decompose high-level intent into actionable sub-goals while strictly adhering to the logic of a dynamic, observed environment. Standard LLM planners frequently fail to maintain strategy coherence over extended horizons due to context window limitation or hallucinate transitions that violate constraints. We propose GiG, a novel planning framework that structures embodied agents' memory using a Graph-in-Graph architecture. Our approach employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode environmental states into embeddings, organizing these embeddings into action-connected execution trace graphs within an experience memory bank. By clustering these graph embeddings, the framework enables retrieval of structure-aware priors, allowing agents to ground current decisions in relevant past structural patterns. Furthermore, we introduce a novel bounded lookahead module that leverages symbolic transition logic to enhance the agents' planning capabilities through the grounded action projection. We evaluate our framework on three embodied planning benchmarks-Robotouille Synchronous, Robotouille Asynchronous, and ALFWorld. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving Pass@1 performance gains of up to 22% on Robotouille Synchronous, 37% on Asynchronous, and 15% on ALFWorld with comparable or lower computational cost.

### Test-Time Compute Games
**Authors**: Ander Artola Velasco, Dimitrios Rontogiannis, Stratis Tsirtsis, Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:18:01Z

**Summary**: Test-time compute has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, this strategy has in turn increased how much users pay cloud-based providers offering LLM-as-a-service, since providers charge users for the amount of test-time compute they use to generate an output. In our work, we show that the market of LLM-as-a-service is socially inefficient: providers have a financial incentive to increase the amount of test-time compute, even if this increase contributes little to the quality of the outputs. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a reverse second-price auction mechanism where providers bid their offered price and (expected) quality for the opportunity to serve a user, and users pay proportionally to the marginal value generated by the winning provider relative to the second-highest bidder. To illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with multiple instruct models from the $\texttt{Llama}$ and $\texttt{Qwen}$ families, as well as reasoning models distilled from $\texttt{DeepSeek-R1}$, on math and science benchmark datasets.

### Mil-SCORE: Benchmarking Long-Context Geospatial Reasoning and Planning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Aadi Palnitkar, Mingyang Mao, Nicholas Waytowich, Vinicius G. Goecks, Tinoosh Mohsenin, Xiaomin Lin

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:11:31Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) are applied to increasingly longer and more complex tasks, there is a growing need for realistic long-context benchmarks that require selective reading and integration of heterogeneous, multi-modal information sources. This need is especially acute for geospatial planning problems, such as those found in planning for large-scale military operations, which demand fast and accurate reasoning over maps, orders, intelligence reports, and other distributed data. To address this gap, we present MilSCORE (Military Scenario Contextual Reasoning), to our knowledge the first scenario-level dataset of expert-authored, multi-hop questions grounded in a complex, simulated military planning scenario used for training. MilSCORE is designed to evaluate high-stakes decision-making and planning, probing LLMs' ability to combine tactical and spatial reasoning across multiple sources and to reason over long-horizon, geospatially rich context. The benchmark includes a diverse set of question types across seven categories targeting both factual recall and multi-step reasoning about constraints, strategy, and spatial analysis. We provide an evaluation protocol and report baseline results for a range of contemporary vision-language models. Our findings highlight substantial headroom on MilSCORE, indicating that current systems struggle with realistic, scenario-level long-context planning, and positioning MilSCORE as a challenging testbed for future work.

### DASH: Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-throughput Reproducible LLM Training
**Authors**: Xinwei Qiang, Hongmin Chen, Shixuan Sun, Jingwen Leng, Xin Liu, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:10:13Z

**Summary**: Determinism is indispensable for reproducibility in large language model (LLM) training, yet it often exacts a steep performance cost. In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.   To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.   Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention. The proposed strategies improve the throughput of the attention backward pass by up to 1.28$\times$ compared to the baseline, significantly advancing the efficiency of reproducible LLM training.   Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/SJTU-Liquid/deterministic-FA3.

### CORE:Toward Ubiquitous 6G Intelligence Through Collaborative Orchestration of Large Language Model Agents Over Hierarchical Edge
**Authors**: Zitong Yu, Boquan Sun, Yang Li, Zheyan Qu, Xing Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:08:19Z

**Summary**: Rapid advancements in sixth-generation (6G) networks and large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for ubiquitous intelligence, wherein seamless connectivity and distributed artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized various aspects of our lives.However, realizing this vision faces significant challenges owing to the fragmented and heterogeneous computing resources across hierarchical networks, which are insufficient for individual LLM agents to perform complex reasoning tasks.To address this issue, we propose Collaborative Orchestration Role at Edge (CORE), an innovative framework that employs a collaborative learning system in which multiple LLMs, each assigned a distinct functional role, are distributed across mobile devices and tiered edge servers. The system integrates three optimization modules, encompassing real-time perception,dynamic role orchestration, and pipeline-parallel execution, to facilitate efficient and rapid collaboration among distributed agents. Furthermore, we introduce a novel role affinity scheduling algorithm for dynamically orchestrating LLM role assignments across the hierarchical edge infrastructure, intelligently matching computational demands with available dispersed resources.Finally, comprehensive case studies and performance evaluations across various 6G application scenarios demonstrated the efficacy of CORE, revealing significant enhancements in the system efficiency and task completion rates. Building on these promising outcomes, we further validated the practical applicability of CORE by deploying it on a real-world edge-computing platform,that exhibits robust performance in operational environments.

### A Judge-Aware Ranking Framework for Evaluating Large Language Models without Ground Truth
**Authors**: Mingyuan Xu, Xinzi Tan, Jiawei Wu, Doudou Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:01:28Z

**Summary**: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on open-ended tasks without ground-truth labels is increasingly done via the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. A critical but under-modeled issue is that judge LLMs differ substantially in reliability; treating all judges equally can yield biased leaderboards and misleading uncertainty estimates. More data can make evaluation more confidently wrong under misspecified aggregation. We propose a judge-aware ranking framework that extends the Bradley-Terry-Luce model by introducing judge-specific discrimination parameters, jointly estimating latent model quality and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons without reference labels. We establish identifiability up to natural normalizations and prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator, enabling confidence intervals for score differences and rank comparisons. Across multiple public benchmarks and a newly collected dataset, our method improves agreement with human preferences, achieves higher data efficiency than unweighted baselines, and produces calibrated uncertainty quantification for LLM rankings.

### LLM-based Few-Shot Early Rumor Detection with Imitation Agent
**Authors**: Fengzhu Zeng, Qian Shao, Ling Cheng, Wei Gao, Shih-Fen Cheng, Jing Ma, Cheng Niu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:01:08Z

**Summary**: Early Rumor Detection (EARD) aims to identify the earliest point at which a claim can be accurately classified based on a sequence of social media posts. This is especially challenging in data-scarce settings. While Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in few-shot NLP tasks, they are not well-suited for time-series data and are computationally expensive for both training and inference. In this work, we propose a novel EARD framework that combines an autonomous agent and an LLM-based detection model, where the agent acts as a reliable decision-maker for \textit{early time point determination}, while the LLM serves as a powerful \textit{rumor detector}. This approach offers the first solution for few-shot EARD, necessitating only the training of a lightweight agent and allowing the LLM to remain training-free. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show our approach boosts performance across LLMs and surpasses existing EARD methods in accuracy and earliness.

### Nonparametric LLM Evaluation from Preference Data
**Authors**: Dennis Frauen, Athiya Deviyani, Mihaela van der Schaar, Stefan Feuerriegel

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T15:00:07Z

**Summary**: Evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) from human preference data is crucial for obtaining LLM leaderboards. However, many existing approaches either rely on restrictive parametric assumptions or lack valid uncertainty quantification when flexible machine learning methods are used. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric statistical framework, DMLEval, for comparing and ranking LLMs from preference data using debiased machine learning (DML). For this, we introduce generalized average ranking scores (GARS), which generalize commonly used ranking models, including the Bradley-Terry model or PageRank/ Rank centrality, with complex human responses such as ties. DMLEval comes with the following advantages: (i) It produces statistically efficient estimates of GARS ranking scores. (ii) It naturally allows the incorporation of black-box machine learning methods for estimation. (iii) It can be combined with pre-trained LLM evaluators (e.g., using LLM-as-a-judge). (iv) It suggests optimal policies for collecting preference data under budget constraints. We demonstrate these advantages both theoretically and empirically using both synthetic and real-world preference datasets. In summary, our framework provides practitioners with powerful, state-of-the-art methods for comparing or ranking LLMs.

### Wikontic: Constructing Wikidata-Aligned, Ontology-Aware Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Alla Chepurova, Aydar Bulatov, Mikhail Burtsev, Yuri Kuratov

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:52:01Z

**Summary**: Knowledge graphs (KGs) provide structured, verifiable grounding for large language models (LLMs), but current LLM-based systems commonly use KGs as auxiliary structures for text retrieval, leaving their intrinsic quality underexplored. In this work, we propose Wikontic, a multi-stage pipeline that constructs KGs from open-domain text by extracting candidate triplets with qualifiers, enforcing Wikidata-based type and relation constraints, and normalizing entities to reduce duplication. The resulting KGs are compact, ontology-consistent, and well-connected; on MuSiQue, the correct answer entity appears in 96% of generated triplets. On HotpotQA, our triplets-only setup achieves 76.0 F1, and on MuSiQue 59.8 F1, matching or surpassing several retrieval-augmented generation baselines that still require textual context. In addition, Wikontic attains state-of-the-art information-retention performance on the MINE-1 benchmark (86%), outperforming prior KG construction methods. Wikontic is also efficient at build time: KG construction uses less than 1,000 output tokens, about 3$\times$ fewer than AriGraph and $<$1/20 of GraphRAG. The proposed pipeline enhances the quality of the generated KG and offers a scalable solution for leveraging structured knowledge in LLMs.

### Distribution-Aware Reward Estimation for Test-Time Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Bodong Du, Xuanqi Huang, Xiaomeng Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:48:02Z

**Summary**: Test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) enables large language models (LLMs) to self-improve on unlabeled inputs, but its effectiveness critically depends on how reward signals are estimated without ground-truth supervision. Most existing TTRL methods rely on majority voting (MV) over rollouts to produce deterministic rewards, implicitly assuming that the majority rollout provides a reliable learning signal. We show that this assumption is fragile: MV reduces the rollout distribution into a single outcome, discarding information about non-majority but correct actions candidates, and yields systematically biased reward estimates. To address this, we propose Distribution-AwareReward Estimation (DARE), which shifts reward estimation from a single majority outcome to the full empirical rollout distribution. DARE further augments this distribution-based reward with an exploration bonus and a distribution pruning mechanism for non-majority rollout exploration and reward denoise, yielding a more informative and robust reward estimation. Extensive experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that DARE improves optimization stability and final performance over recent baselines, achieving relative improvements of 25.3% on challenging AIME 2024 and 5.3% on AMC.

### RAG-E: Quantifying Retriever-Generator Alignment and Failure Modes
**Authors**: Korbinian Randl, Guido Rocchietti, Aron Henriksson, Ziawasch Abedjan, Tony Lindgren, John Pavlopoulos

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:47:00Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine dense retrievers and language models to ground LLM outputs in retrieved documents. However, the opacity of how these components interact creates challenges for deployment in high-stakes domains. We present RAG-E, an end-to-end explainability framework that quantifies retriever-generator alignment through mathematically grounded attribution methods. Our approach adapts Integrated Gradients for retriever analysis, introduces PMCSHAP, a Monte Carlo-stabilized Shapley Value approximation, for generator attribution, and introduces the Weighted Attribution-Relevance Gap (WARG) metric to measure how well a generator's document usage aligns with a retriever's ranking. Empirical analysis on TREC CAsT and FoodSafeSum reveals critical misalignments: for 47.4% to 66.7% of queries, generators ignore the retriever's top-ranked documents, while 48.1% to 65.9% rely on documents ranked as less relevant. These failure modes demonstrate that RAG output quality depends not solely on individual component performance but on their interplay, which can be audited via RAG-E.

### A Unified XAI-LLM Approach for EndotrachealSuctioning Activity Recognition
**Authors**: Hoang Khang Phan, Quang Vinh Dang, Noriyo Colley, Christina Garcia, Nhat Tan Le

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:46:48Z

**Summary**: Endotracheal suctioning (ES) is an invasive yet essential clinical procedure that requires a high degree of skill to minimize patient risk - particularly in home care and educational settings, where consistent supervision may be limited. Despite its critical importance, automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements. Collectively, these contributions establish a scalable, interpretable, and data-driven foundation for advancing nursing education, enhancing training efficiency, and ultimately improving patient safety.

### Rethinking LLM Inference Bottlenecks: Insights from Latent Attention and Mixture-of-Experts
**Authors**: Sungmin Yun, Seonyong Park, Hwayong Nam, Younjoo Lee, Gunjun Lee, Kwanhee Kyung, Sangpyo Kim, Nam Sung Kim, Jongmin Kim, Hyungyo Kim, Juhwan Cho, Seungmin Baek, Jung Ho Ahn

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:44:36Z

**Summary**: Computational workloads composing traditional transformer models are starkly bifurcated. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Grouped-Query Attention are memory-bound due to low arithmetic intensity, while FeedForward Networks are compute-bound. This dichotomy has long motivated research into specialized hardware to mitigate the attention bottleneck.   This paper argues that recent architectural advances in transformer models -- Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) -- introduce new dominant bottlenecks, shifting the challenge away from memory-intensive attention. We make two key observations. First, the arithmetic intensity of MLA is over two orders of magnitude higher than that of MHA, moving it toward a compute-bound regime well-matched to modern accelerators such as GPUs. Second, distributing MoE experts across a pool of accelerators allows batching to tune their arithmetic intensity to that of dense layers, producing a more balanced computational profile. Consequently, the focus of hardware and system optimization should shift from attention acceleration to high-bandwidth interconnects and balancing expert workloads across accelerators.

### BioAgent Bench: An AI Agent Evaluation Suite for Bioinformatics
**Authors**: Dionizije Fa, Marko Čuljak, Bruno Pandža, Mateo Čupić

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:44:03Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces BioAgent Bench, a benchmark dataset and an evaluation suite designed for measuring the performance and robustness of AI agents in common bioinformatics tasks. The benchmark contains curated end-to-end tasks (e.g., RNA-seq, variant calling, metagenomics) with prompts that specify concrete output artifacts to support automated assessment, including stress testing under controlled perturbations. We evaluate frontier closed-source and open-weight models across multiple agent harnesses, and use an LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity. We find that frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines without elaborate custom scaffolding, often producing the requested final artifacts reliably. However, robustness tests reveal failure modes under controlled perturbations (corrupted inputs, decoy files, and prompt bloat), indicating that correct high-level pipeline construction does not guarantee reliable step-level reasoning. Finally, because bioinformatics workflows may involve sensitive patient data, proprietary references, or unpublished IP, closed-source models can be unsuitable under strict privacy constraints; in such settings, open-weight models may be preferable despite lower completion rates. We release the dataset and evaluation suite publicly.

### CG-MLLM: Captioning and Generating 3D content via Multi-modal Large Language Models
**Authors**: Junming Huang, Weiwei Xu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:42:46Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models(LLMs) have revolutionized text generation and multimodal perception, but their capabilities in 3D content generation remain underexplored. Existing methods compromise by producing either low-resolution meshes or coarse structural proxies, failing to capture fine-grained geometry natively. In this paper, we propose CG-MLLM, a novel Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) capable of 3D captioning and high-resolution 3D generation in a single framework. Leveraging the Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, CG-MLLM decouples disparate modeling needs, where the Token-level Autoregressive (TokenAR) Transformer handles token-level content, and the Block-level Autoregressive (BlockAR) Transformer handles block-level content. By integrating a pre-trained vision-language backbone with a specialized 3D VAE latent space, CG-MLLM facilitates long-context interactions between standard tokens and spatial blocks within a single integrated architecture. Experimental results show that CG-MLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs in generating high-fidelity 3D objects, effectively bringing high-resolution 3D content creation into the mainstream LLM paradigm.

### Effective LoRA Adapter Routing using Task Representations
**Authors**: Akash Dhasade, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Igor Pavlovic, Diana Petrescu, Rafael Pires, Mathis Randl, Martijn de Vos

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:41:24Z

**Summary**: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enables parameter efficient specialization of large language models (LLMs) through modular adapters, resulting in rapidly growing public adapter pools spanning diverse tasks. Effectively using these adapters requires routing: selecting and composing the appropriate adapters for a query. We introduce LORAUTER, a novel routing framework that selects and composes LoRA adapters using task representations rather than adapter characteristics. Unlike existing approaches that map queries directly to adapters, LORAUTER routes queries via task embeddings derived from small validation sets and does not require adapter training data. By operating at the task level, LORAUTER achieves efficient routing that scales with the number of tasks rather than the number of adapters. Experiments across multiple tasks show that LORAUTER consistently outperforms baseline routing approaches, matching Oracle performance (101.2%) when task-aligned adapters exist and achieving state-of-the-art results on unseen tasks (+5.2 points). We further demonstrate the robustness of LORAUTER to very large, noisy adapter pools by scaling it to over 1500 adapters.

### Pushing the Limits of Distillation-Based Class-Incremental Learning via Lightweight Plugins
**Authors**: Zhiming Xu, Baile Xu, Jian Zhao, Furao Shen, Suorong Yang

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:39:17Z

**Summary**: Existing replay and distillation-based class-incremental learning (CIL) methods are effective at retaining past knowledge but are still constrained by the stability-plasticity dilemma. Since their resulting models are learned over a sequence of incremental tasks, they encode rich representations and can be regarded as pre-trained bases. Building on this view, we propose a plug-in extension paradigm termed Deployment of LoRA Components (DLC) to enhance them. For each task, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to inject task-specific residuals into the base model's deep layers. During inference, representations with task-specific residuals are aggregated to produce classification predictions. To mitigate interference from non-target LoRA plugins, we introduce a lightweight weighting unit. This unit learns to assign importance scores to different LoRA-tuned representations. Like downloadable content in software, DLC serves as a plug-and-play enhancement that efficiently extends the base methods. Remarkably, on the large-scale ImageNet-100, with merely 4\% of the parameters of a standard ResNet-18, our DLC model achieves a significant 8\% improvement in accuracy, demonstrating exceptional efficiency. Under a fixed memory budget, methods equipped with DLC surpass state-of-the-art expansion-based methods.

### Assessing the Business Process Modeling Competences of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chantale Lauer, Peter Pfeiffer, Alexander Rombach, Nijat Mehdiyev

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:34:20Z

**Summary**: The creation of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) models is a complex and time-consuming task requiring both domain knowledge and proficiency in modeling conventions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly expanded the possibilities for generating BPMN models directly from natural language, building upon earlier text-to-process methods with enhanced capabilities in handling complex descriptions. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluations of LLM-generated process models. Current efforts either use LLM-as-a-judge approaches or do not consider established dimensions of model quality. To this end, we introduce BEF4LLM, a novel LLM evaluation framework comprising four perspectives: syntactic quality, pragmatic quality, semantic quality, and validity. Using BEF4LLM, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of open-source LLMs and benchmark their performance against human modeling experts. Results indicate that LLMs excel in syntactic and pragmatic quality, while humans outperform in semantic aspects; however, the differences in scores are relatively modest, highlighting LLMs' competitive potential despite challenges in validity and semantic quality. The insights highlight current strengths and limitations of using LLMs for BPMN modeling and guide future model development and fine-tuning. Addressing these areas is essential for advancing the practical deployment of LLMs in business process modeling.

### Synthetic-to-Real Domain Bridging for Single-View 3D Reconstruction of Ships for Maritime Monitoring
**Authors**: Borja Carrillo-Perez, Felix Sattler, Angel Bueno Rodriguez, Maurice Stephan, Sarah Barnes

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:34:01Z

**Summary**: Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of ships is an important part of maritime monitoring, allowing improved visualization, inspection, and decision-making in real-world monitoring environments. However, most state-ofthe-art 3D reconstruction methods require multi-view supervision, annotated 3D ground truth, or are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time maritime deployment. In this work, we present an efficient pipeline for single-view 3D reconstruction of real ships by training entirely on synthetic data and requiring only a single view at inference. Our approach uses the Splatter Image network, which represents objects as sparse sets of 3D Gaussians for rapid and accurate reconstruction from single images. The model is first fine-tuned on synthetic ShapeNet vessels and further refined with a diverse custom dataset of 3D ships, bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery. We integrate a state-of-the-art segmentation module based on YOLOv8 and custom preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the reconstruction network. Postprocessing steps include real-world scaling, centering, and orientation alignment, followed by georeferenced placement on an interactive web map using AIS metadata and homography-based mapping. Quantitative evaluation on synthetic validation data demonstrates strong reconstruction fidelity, while qualitative results on real maritime images from the ShipSG dataset confirm the potential for transfer to operational maritime settings. The final system provides interactive 3D inspection of real ships without requiring real-world 3D annotations. This pipeline provides an efficient, scalable solution for maritime monitoring and highlights a path toward real-time 3D ship visualization in practical applications.

### FreqKV: Key-Value Compression in Frequency Domain for Context Window Extension
**Authors**: Jushi Kai, Yixuan Wang, Boyi Zeng, Haoli Bai, Bo Jiang, Ziwei He, Zhouhan Lin

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:31:34Z

**Summary**: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods for large language models (LLMs) often rely on token eviction, which risks losing critical local information in both long prefilling and decoding scenarios. When extrapolating beyond the pretrained context length, their performance degrades sharply on long-context benchmarks. Motivated by the observation in the frequency domain that the context information is concentrated in the low-frequency components, we propose FreqKV, a parameter-free and architecture-agnostic approach. It iteratively compresses the increasing KV cache in the frequency domain, allowing models to process lengthy contexts efficiently. With minimal training at 8K length, FreqKV extends the context window of LLaMA-2-7B up to 256K tokens while maintaining stable perplexity. Extensive experiments across prefilling and decoding demonstrate that FreqKV enables robust context window extension and consistently outperforms existing KV cache compression methods on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3, highlighting its effectiveness for both understanding and generation in long contexts.

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:22:39Z

**Summary**: In the wave of generative recommendation, we present OneMall, an end-to-end generative recommendation framework tailored for e-commerce services at Kuaishou. Our OneMall systematically unifies the e-commerce's multiple item distribution scenarios, such as Product-card, short-video and live-streaming. Specifically, it comprises three key components, aligning the entire model training pipeline to the LLM's pre-training/post-training: (1) E-commerce Semantic Tokenizer: we provide a tokenizer solution that captures both real-world semantics and business-specific item relations across different scenarios; (2) Transformer-based Architecture: we largely utilize Transformer as our model backbone, e.g., employing Query-Former for long sequence compression, Cross-Attention for multi-behavior sequence fusion, and Sparse MoE for scalable auto-regressive generation; (3) Reinforcement Learning Pipeline: we further connect retrieval and ranking models via RL, enabling the ranking model to serve as a reward signal for end-to-end policy retrieval model optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OneMall achieves consistent improvements across all e-commerce scenarios: +13.01\% GMV in product-card, +15.32\% Orders in Short-Video, and +2.78\% Orders in Live-Streaming. OneMall has been deployed, serving over 400 million daily active users at Kuaishou.

### Zonkey: A Hierarchical Diffusion Language Model with Differentiable Tokenization and Probabilistic Attention
**Authors**: Alon Rozental

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:17:37Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet they remain constrained by fixed, non-differentiable tokenizers like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which hinder end-to-end optimization and adaptability to noisy or domain-specific data. We introduce Zonkey, a hierarchical diffusion model that addresses these limitations through a fully trainable pipeline from raw characters to document-level representations. At its core is a differentiable tokenizer (Segment Splitter) that learns probabilistic beginning-of-sequence (BOS) decisions, enabling adaptive splits that emerge as linguistically meaningful (e.g., word boundaries at spaces, sentence starts at periods) without explicit supervision. This differentiability is enabled by our novel Probabilistic Attention mechanism, which incorporates position-specific existence probabilities to simulate soft masking over theoretically infinite sequences while preserving gradients. Sequences decay probabilistically rather than relying on end-of-sequence tokens, supporting variable-length outputs. Hierarchical levels compress sequences into higher abstractions (e.g., character n-grams to word-like vectors, then sentence-like), with reconstruction via our Denoising Diffusion Mixed Model (DDMM) for stable and efficient denoising in latent space. A Stitcher ensures overlap invariance across segments. Trained end-to-end on Wikipedia, Zonkey generates coherent, variable-length text from noise, demonstrating emergent hierarchies and promising qualitative alignment to data distributions compared to entropy-based learnable tokenizers. Our approach advances toward fully gradient-based LLMs, with potential for better domain adaptation and scalable generation. We release the source code for training and reproducing our experiments.

### Evaluating ChatGPT on Medical Information Extraction Tasks: Performance, Explainability and Beyond
**Authors**: Wei Zhu

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:16:51Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have demonstrated amazing capabilities in comprehending user intents and generate reasonable and useful responses. Beside their ability to chat, their capabilities in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks are of interest to the research community. In this paper, we focus on assessing the overall ability of ChatGPT in 4 different medical information extraction (MedIE) tasks across 6 benchmark datasets. We present the systematically analysis by measuring ChatGPT's performance, explainability, confidence, faithfulness, and uncertainty. Our experiments reveal that: (a) ChatGPT's performance scores on MedIE tasks fall behind those of the fine-tuned baseline models. (b) ChatGPT can provide high-quality explanations for its decisions, however, ChatGPT is over-confident in its predcitions. (c) ChatGPT demonstrates a high level of faithfulness to the original text in the majority of cases. (d) The uncertainty in generation causes uncertainty in information extraction results, thus may hinder its applications in MedIE tasks.

### SINQ: Sinkhorn-Normalized Quantization for Calibration-Free Low-Precision LLM Weights
**Authors**: Lorenz K. Müller, Philippe Bich, Jiawei Zhuang, Ahmet Çelik, Luca Benfenati, Lukas Cavigelli

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:15:45Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization has emerged as the most widely used strategy for deploying large language models at low precision. Still, current methods show perplexity degradation at bit-widths less than or equal to 4, partly because representing outliers causes precision issues in parameters that share the same scales as these outliers. This problem is especially pronounced for calibration-free, uniform quantization methods. We introduce SINQ to augment existing post-training quantizers with an additional second-axis scale factor and a fast Sinkhorn-Knopp-style algorithm that finds scales to normalize per-row and per-column variances. We show that this approximates activation-aware quantization by recovering column scales from the weight matrix structure that are predictive of the typical activation magnitudes the matrix received during training. Our method has no interactions between layers and can be trivially applied to new architectures to quantize any linear layer. We evaluate our method on the Qwen3 model family, among others. SINQ reduces the perplexity gap on WikiText2 and C4 by over 50% against uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines, incurs zero to negligible compute overhead, and can be further enhanced by combining it with calibration and non-uniform quantization levels. Code is available at https://github.com/huawei-csl/SINQ.

### EWSJF: An Adaptive Scheduler with Hybrid Partitioning for Mixed-Workload LLM Inference
**Authors**: Bronislav Sidik, Chaya Levi, Joseph Kampeas

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:14:16Z

**Summary**: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) under mixed workloads--short, latency-sensitive interactive queries alongside long, throughput-oriented batch requests--poses a fundamental scheduling challenge. Standard First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) policies suffer from severe head-of-line blocking, leading to high tail latency and underutilized hardware. We introduce EWSJF (Effective Workload-based Shortest Job First), an adaptive request-level scheduler that learns workload structure in real time to jointly improve fairness and throughput. EWSJF operates upstream of execution-level schedulers and integrates four components: (1) Refine-and-Prune, an unsupervised partitioning algorithm that discovers performance-homogeneous request groups; (2) Dynamic Queue Routing for assigning requests to these groups; (3) Density-Weighted Scoring, a context-aware prioritization function balancing urgency and fairness; and (4) Bayesian Meta-Optimization, which continuously tunes scoring and partitioning parameters based on live performance feedback. Implemented in vLLM, EWSJF improves end-to-end throughput by over 30% and reduces average Time-To-First-Token for short requests by up to 4x compared to FCFS. These results demonstrate that adaptive, learning-based request scheduling is a critical missing layer for efficient and responsive LLM serving.

### Agent-OM: Leveraging LLM Agents for Ontology Matching
**Authors**: Zhangcheng Qiang, Weiqing Wang, Kerry Taylor

**Updated**: 2026-01-29T14:13:49Z

**Summary**: Ontology matching (OM) enables semantic interoperability between different ontologies and resolves their conceptual heterogeneity by aligning related entities. OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems. While large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents have revolutionised data engineering and have been applied creatively in many domains, their potential for OM remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With consideration of several specific challenges in leveraging LLM agents for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM (Agent for Ontology Matching), consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve results very close to the long-standing best performance on simple OM tasks and can significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks.
