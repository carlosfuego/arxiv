 ### Test-Time Training with KV Binding Is Secretly Linear Attention
**Authors**: Junchen Liu, Sven Elflein, Or Litany, Zan Gojcic, Ruilong Li

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:59:30Z

**Summary**: Test-time training (TTT) with KV binding as sequence modeling layer is commonly interpreted as a form of online meta-learning that memorizes a key-value mapping at test time. However, our analysis reveals multiple phenomena that contradict this memorization-based interpretation. Motivated by these findings, we revisit the formulation of TTT and show that a broad class of TTT architectures can be expressed as a form of learned linear attention operator. Beyond explaining previously puzzling model behaviors, this perspective yields multiple practical benefits: it enables principled architectural simplifications, admits fully parallel formulations that preserve performance while improving efficiency, and provides a systematic reduction of diverse TTT variants to a standard linear attention form. Overall, our results reframe TTT not as test-time memorization, but as learned linear attention with enhanced representational capacity.

### Scaling State-Space Models on Multiple GPUs with Tensor Parallelism
**Authors**: Anurag Dutt, Nimit Shah, Hazem Masarani, Anshul Gandhi

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:47:54Z

**Summary**: Selective state space models (SSMs) have rapidly become a compelling backbone for large language models, especially for long-context workloads. Yet in deployment, their inference performance is often bounded by the memory capacity, bandwidth, and latency limits of a single GPU, making multi-GPU execution increasingly necessary. Although tensor parallelism (TP) is widely used to scale Transformer inference, applying it to selective SSM blocks is non-trivial because the SSM mixer couples large projections with a sequence-wise recurrent state update and local mixing whose efficiency depends on preserving locality and avoiding synchronization in the critical path.   This paper presents a communication-efficient TP design for selective SSM inference that addresses three practical engineering challenges: enabling TTFT improvements via an SSM state cache across prefill and decode, partitioning the mixer's packed parameter tensor so that recurrent updates remain local while minimizing communication, and reducing TP aggregation overhead with quantized AllReduce. We evaluate on three representative SSM-based LLMs spanning pure-SSM and hybrid architectures - Mamba, Falcon-Mamba, and Zamba - on NVIDIA A6000 and A100 clusters. Our experiments show substantial throughput gains from tensor-parallel SSM inference, improving batch-request throughput by ~1.6-2.1x on 2 GPUs and ~2.6-4.0x on 4 GPUs for Mamba, with the largest benefits at long context lengths, and achieving a further ~10-18% throughput improvement from quantized all-reduce by lowering synchronization bandwidth overhead.

### FGFRFT: Fast Graph Fractional FourierTransform via Fourier Series Approximation
**Authors**: Ziqi Yan, Sen Shi, Feiyue Zhao, Manjun Cui, Yangfan He, Zhichao Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:14:25Z

**Summary**: The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) generalizes the graph Fourier transform (GFT) but suffers from a significant computational bottleneck: determining the optimal transform order requires expensive eigendecomposition and matrix multiplication, leading to $O(N^3)$ complexity. To address this issue, we propose a fast GFRFT (FGFRFT) algorithm for unitary GFT matrices based on Fourier series approximation and an efficient caching strategy. FGFRFT reduces the complexity of generating transform matrices to $O(2LN^2)$ while preserving differentiability, thereby enabling adaptive order learning. We validate the algorithm through theoretical analysis, approximation accuracy tests, and order learning experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate its practical efficacy for image and point cloud denoising and present the fractional specformer, which integrates the FGFRFT into the specformer architecture. This integration enables the model to overcome the limitations of a fixed GFT basis and learn optimal fractional orders for complex data. Experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm significantly accelerates computation and achieves superior performance compared with the GFRFT.

### Towards Efficient Agents: A Co-Design of Inference Architecture and System
**Authors**: Weizhe Lin, Hui-Ling Zhen, Shuai Yang, Xian Wang, Renxi Liu, Hanting Chen, Wangze Zhang, Chuansai Zhou, Yiming Li, Chen Chen, Xing Li, Zhiyuan Yang, Xiaosong Li, Xianzhi Yu, Zhenhua Dong, Mingxuan Yuan, Yunhe Wang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T12:33:49Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of large language model (LLM)-based agents has unlocked new possibilities for autonomous multi-turn reasoning and tool-augmented decision-making. However, their real-world deployment is hindered by severe inefficiencies that arise not from isolated model inference, but from the systemic latency accumulated across reasoning loops, context growth, and heterogeneous tool interactions. This paper presents AgentInfer, a unified framework for end-to-end agent acceleration that bridges inference optimization and architectural design. We decompose the problem into four synergistic components: AgentCollab, a hierarchical dual-model reasoning framework that balances large- and small-model usage through dynamic role assignment; AgentSched, a cache-aware hybrid scheduler that minimizes latency under heterogeneous request patterns; AgentSAM, a suffix-automaton-based speculative decoding method that reuses multi-session semantic memory to achieve low-overhead inference acceleration; and AgentCompress, a semantic compression mechanism that asynchronously distills and reorganizes agent memory without disrupting ongoing reasoning. Together, these modules form a Self-Evolution Engine capable of sustaining efficiency and cognitive stability throughout long-horizon reasoning tasks. Experiments on the BrowseComp-zh and DeepDiver benchmarks demonstrate that through the synergistic collaboration of these methods, AgentInfer reduces ineffective token consumption by over 50%, achieving an overall 1.8-2.5 times speedup with preserved accuracy. These results underscore that optimizing for agentic task completion-rather than merely per-token throughput-is the key to building scalable, efficient, and self-improving intelligent systems.

### Nacrith: Neural Lossless Compression via Ensemble Context Modeling and High-Precision CDF Coding
**Authors**: Roberto Tacconelli

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T11:10:17Z

**Summary**: We present Nacrith, a lossless compression system that combines a 135M-parameter transformer language model (SmolLM2-135M) with an ensemble of lightweight online predictors and a 32-bit arithmetic coder, achieving the best compression results among the systems evaluated in this study on natural language text. Beyond the base LLM-plus-arithmetic-coding paradigm, Nacrith introduces several contributions: (1) a CDF precision upgrade from 2^16 to 2^24 that eliminates ~75% of quantization overhead caused by minimum-probability floors in large vocabularies; (2) a token-level N-gram model for fast local predictions; (3) an adaptive log-space bias head correcting per-document LLM errors via online gradient descent; (4) confidence-based LLM skip for accelerating highly predictable tokens; (5) a hybrid binary format (NC06) extending neural compression to arbitrary binary files--to our knowledge a first among LLM-based compressors; (6) a llama cpp inference backend achieving ~7x faster single-token decode than PyTorch; (7) parallel multi-GPU compression across up to 8 workers; and (8) native KV cache sliding window reducing per-slide cost by ~37x. The system requires only ~500 MB of GGUF weights and ~1.2 GB VRAM per worker, running on consumer GPUs.   On alice29 (Canterbury Corpus, 152 KB), Nacrith achieves 0.918 bits per byte (bpb)--outperforming gzip by 3.1x, bzip2 by 2.5x, CMIX v21 by 44%, and ts_zip by 20%, while compressing below the 0th-, 1st-, and 2nd-order byte-level Shannon entropy bounds. On enwik8 (100 MB), Nacrith achieves 0.9389 bpb (11.74%), surpassing ts_zip (~1.11 bpb) by 15% and FineZip (1.024 bpb) by 8% despite using a 60x smaller model with no fine-tuning. An out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation on a document published after the model's training cutoff confirms these gains are not memorization artifacts, achieving 0.723 bpb on unseen text.

### CHESS: Context-aware Hierarchical Efficient Semantic Selection for Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Chao Fei, Guozhong Li, Chenxi Liu, Panos Kalnis

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T09:54:59Z

**Summary**: Long-context LLMs demand accurate inference at low latency, yet decoding becomes primarily constrained by KV cache as context grows. Prior pruning methods are largely context-agnostic: their token selection ignores step-wise relevance and local semantics, which undermines quality. Moreover, their irregular accesses and selection overheads yield only limited wall-clock speedups. To address this, we propose \textbf{CHESS}, an \textit{algorithm-system co-design} KV-cache management system. Algorithmically, CHESS introduces a context-aware, hierarchical selection policy that dynamically reconstructs a coherent context for the current decoding. System-wise, coarse granularity selection eliminates expensive data movement, fully realizing practical acceleration from theoretical sparsity. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CHESS surpasses Full-KV quality using only \textbf{1\%} of the KV cache, delivers low-latency stable inference with up to \textbf{4.56$\times$} higher throughput, and consistently outperforms other strong baselines. Code is available at \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CHESS-9958/}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CHESS/}.

### PackMonitor: Enabling Zero Package Hallucinations Through Decoding-Time Monitoring
**Authors**: Xiting Liu, Yuetong Liu, Yitong Zhang, Jia Li, Shi-Min Hu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T09:26:11Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, their trustworthiness has become a critical concern. However, in dependency recommendation scenarios, the reliability of LLMs is undermined by widespread package hallucinations, where models often recommend hallucinated packages. Recent studies have proposed a range of approaches to mitigate this issue. Nevertheless, existing approaches typically merely reduce hallucination rates rather than eliminate them, leaving persistent software security risks.   In this work, we argue that package hallucinations are theoretically preventable based on the key insight that package validity is decidable through finite and enumerable authoritative package lists. Building on this, we propose PackMonitor, the first approach capable of fundamentally eliminating package hallucinations by continuously monitoring the model's decoding process and intervening when necessary. To implement this in practice, PackMonitor addresses three key challenges: (1) determining when to trigger intervention via a Context-Aware Parser that continuously monitors model outputs and selectively activates intervening only during installation command generation; (2) resolving how to intervene by employing a Package-Name Intervenor that strictly limits the decoding space to an authoritative package list; and (3) ensuring monitoring efficiency through a DFA-Caching Mechanism that enables scalability to millions of packages with negligible overhead. Extensive experiments on five widely used LLMs demonstrate that PackMonitor is a training-free, plug-and-play solution that consistently reduces package hallucination rates to zero while maintaining low-latency inference and preserving original model capabilities.

### Online Algorithms with Unreliable Guidance
**Authors**: Julien Dallot, Yuval Emek, Yuval Gil, Maciej Pacut, Stefan Schmid

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T09:11:56Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a new model for ML-augmented online decision making, called online algorithms with unreliable guidance (OAG). This model completely separates between the predictive and algorithmic components, thus offering a single well-defined analysis framework that relies solely on the considered problem. Formulated through the lens of request-answer games, an OAG algorithm receives, with each incoming request, a piece of guidance which is taken from the problem's answer space; ideally, this guidance is the optimal answer for the current request, however with probability $β$, the guidance is adversarially corrupted. The goal is to develop OAG algorithms that admit good competitiveness when $β= 0$ (a.k.a. consistency) as well as when $β= 1$ (a.k.a. robustness); the appealing notion of smoothness, that in most prior work required a dedicated loss function, now arises naturally as $β$ shifts from $0$ to $1$.   We then describe a systematic method, called the drop or trust blindly (DTB) compiler, which transforms any online algorithm into a learning-augmented online algorithm in the OAG model. Given a prediction-oblivious online algorithm, its learning-augmented counterpart produced by applying the DTB compiler either follows the incoming guidance blindly or ignores it altogether and proceeds as the initial algorithm would have; the choice between these two alternatives is based on the outcome of a (biased) coin toss. As our main technical contribution, we prove (rigorously) that although remarkably simple, the class of algorithms produced via the DTB compiler includes algorithms with attractive consistency-robustness guarantees for three classic online problems: for caching and uniform metrical task systems our algorithms are optimal, whereas for bipartite matching (with adversarial arrival order), our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art.

### The Careless Coupon Collector's Problem
**Authors**: Emilio Cruciani, Aditi Dudeja

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T09:11:05Z

**Summary**: We initiate the study of the Careless Coupon Collector's Problem (CCCP), a novel variation of the classical coupon collector, that we envision as a model for information systems such as web crawlers, dynamic caches, and fault-resilient networks. In CCCP, a collector attempts to gather $n$ distinct coupon types by obtaining one coupon type uniformly at random in each discrete round, however the collector is \textit{careless}: at the end of each round, each collected coupon type is independently lost with probability $p$. We analyze the number of rounds required to complete the collection as a function of $n$ and $p$. In particular, we show that it transitions from $Θ(n \ln n)$ when $p = o\big(\frac{\ln n}{n^2}\big)$ up to $Θ\big((\frac{np}{1-p})^n\big)$ when $p=ω\big(\frac{1}{n}\big)$ in multiple distinct phases. Interestingly, when $p=\frac{c}{n}$, the process remains in a metastable phase, where the fraction of collected coupon types is concentrated around $\frac{1}{1+c}$ with probability $1-o(1)$, for a time window of length $e^{Θ(n)}$. Finally, we give an algorithm that computes the expected completion time of CCCP in $O(n^2)$ time.

**Authors**: Nguyen Duc Ton, Nguyen Thanh Luan, Faizan Anjum, D. Joseph Daniel, Sunghwan Kim, Suchart Kothan, Jakrapong Kaewkhao, Hong Joo Kim

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T08:16:12Z

**Summary**: This study reports the development and characterization of a cost-effective X-ray imaging device built from Raspberry Pi components, including a high-quality 12.3-megapixel camera configured for indirect detection with a Gd2O2S: Tb scintillation screen. The device was evaluated under both ambient light and X-ray exposure conditions. Initial characterization under ambient light ensured proper optical focusing; subsequently, camera settings (ISO and exposure time) were evaluated and optimized for X-ray imaging performance. Spatial resolution of the developed device was quantified using the Slanted-Edge method to derive the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF). The device achieves MTF20 values of 68 lp/mm under ambient light and 25 lp/mm under X-ray irradiation (50 and 70 kV) with Gd2O2S:Tb screen. Besides, the modularity of the developed device was confirmed by conducting the tests with LYSO:Ce and GAGG:Ce screens. Results demonstrate that this compact, cost-effective platform delivers spatial resolution comparable to clinical radiography systems, with potential applications in scientific, educational, and medical contexts where cost and portability are critical factors.

### OptiLeak: Efficient Prompt Reconstruction via Reinforcement Learning in Multi-tenant LLM Services
**Authors**: Longxiang Wang, Xiang Zheng, Xuhao Zhang, Yao Zhang, Ye Wu, Cong Wang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T06:35:22Z

**Summary**: Multi-tenant LLM serving frameworks widely adopt shared Key-Value caches to enhance efficiency. However, this creates side-channel vulnerabilities enabling prompt leakage attacks. Prior studies identified these attack surfaces yet focused on expanding attack vectors rather than optimizing attack performance, reporting impractically high attack costs that underestimate the true privacy risk. We propose OptiLeak, a reinforcement learning-enhanced framework that maximizes prompt reconstruction efficiency through two-stage fine-tuning. Our key insight is that domain-specific ``hard tokens'' -- terms difficult to predict yet carrying sensitive information -- can be automatically identified via likelihood ranking and used to construct preference pairs for Direct Preference Optimization, eliminating manual annotation. This enables effective preference alignment while avoiding the overfitting issues of extended supervised fine-tuning. Evaluated on three benchmarks spanning medical and financial domains, OptiLeak achieves up to $12.48\times$ reduction in average requests per token compared to baseline approaches, with consistent improvements across model scales from 3B to 14B parameters. Our findings demonstrate that cache-based prompt leakage poses a more severe threat than previously reported, underscoring the need for robust cache isolation in production deployments.

### FAST-Prefill: FPGA Accelerated Sparse Attention for Long Context LLM Prefill
**Authors**: Rakshith Jayanth, Viktor Prasanna

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T03:36:25Z

**Summary**: In long-context large language model (LLM) inference, the prefill stage dominates computation due to self-attention over the complete input context. Sparse attention significantly reduces self-attention computation by limiting each token's interactions to a subset of tokens. The attention sparsity pattern varies across input prompts, and within a prompt, each attention head can follow a distinct pattern. This makes attention sparsity dynamic. The requirement of generating the sparsity pattern, combined with limited data reuse in attention, shifts the prefill compute to being memory-bound. This, in addition to the huge energy requirements for long-context inference on GPU, motivates FPGAs as good candidates for accelerating dynamic long-context inference.   To tackle these challenges, we propose FAST-Prefill, the first FPGA accelerator for long-context prefill-stage inference with dynamic sparse attention. To efficiently generate sparse indices, we propose a \textit{fused pipeline unit with a memory-aware execution order} to reduce large tensors and irregular memory accesses. To reduce off-chip memory traffic for accessing the KV cache, we utilize the memory hierarchy to design a \textit{liveness-driven, dual-tier cache}. For high-throughput matrix multiplication, we design a \textit{hybrid Matrix Processing Unit (MPU)} with DSPs and bit-plane decomposition using LUTs. We implement FAST-Prefill on Alveo U280 and evaluate it on the Llama and Qwen models (batch size = 1) for context lengths ranging from 4K to 128K tokens. We demonstrate an average speedup of up to 2.5$\times$ in TTFT and 4.5$\times$ improvement in energy efficiency over GPU implementation on Nvidia A5000 GPU.

### LESA: Learnable Stage-Aware Predictors for Diffusion Model Acceleration
**Authors**: Peiliang Cai, Jiacheng Liu, Haowen Xu, Xinyu Wang, Chang Zou, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T02:53:28Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation tasks. However, the high computational demands of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) pose a significant challenge to their practical deployment. While feature caching is a promising acceleration strategy, existing methods based on simple reusing or training-free forecasting struggle to adapt to the complex, stage-dependent dynamics of the diffusion process, often resulting in quality degradation and failing to maintain consistency with the standard denoising process. To address this, we propose a LEarnable Stage-Aware (LESA) predictor framework based on two-stage training. Our approach leverages a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to accurately learn temporal feature mappings from data. We further introduce a multi-stage, multi-expert architecture that assigns specialized predictors to different noise-level stages, enabling more precise and robust feature forecasting. Extensive experiments show our method achieves significant acceleration while maintaining high-fidelity generation. Experiments demonstrate 5.00x acceleration on FLUX.1-dev with minimal quality degradation (1.0% drop), 6.25x speedup on Qwen-Image with a 20.2% quality improvement over the previous SOTA (TaylorSeer), and 5.00x acceleration on HunyuanVideo with a 24.7% PSNR improvement over TaylorSeer. State-of-the-art performance on both text-to-image and text-to-video synthesis validates the effectiveness and generalization capability of our training-based framework across different models. Our code is included in the supplementary materials and will be released on GitHub.

### ContextPilot: Fast Long-Context Inference via Context Reuse
**Authors**: Yinsicheng Jiang, Yeqi Huang, Liang Cheng, Cheng Deng, Xuan Sun, Luo Mai

**Updated**: 2026-02-23T20:26:15Z

**Summary**: AI applications increasingly depend on long-context inference, where LLMs consume substantial context to support stronger reasoning. Common examples include retrieval-augmented generation, agent memory layers, and multi-agent orchestration. As input contexts get longer, prefill latency becomes the main bottleneck. Yet today's prefill acceleration techniques face a trade-off: they either preserve reasoning quality but deliver little KV-cache reuse, or improve reuse at the cost of degraded reasoning quality.   We present ContextPilot, a system that accelerates prefill by introducing context reuse as a new mechanism for faster long-context inference. ContextPilot introduces a context index to identify overlapping context blocks across LLM interactions (e.g., across users and turns). It further proposes context ordering and de-duplication techniques to maximize KV-cache reuse. To preserve reasoning quality under reuse, it introduces succinct context annotations that prevent quality degradation. Finally, ContextPilot is built around a modular architecture with a clean interface that integrates with existing inference engines. Extensive evaluation shows that ContextPilot reduces LLM prefill latency by up to $3\times{}$ compared to state-of-the-art methods while preserving reasoning quality. At longer context lengths, it can even improve reasoning quality. ContextPilot is open-sourced at: https://github.com/EfficientContext/ContextPilot.

### Depth-Structured Music Recurrence: Budgeted Recurrent Attention for Full-Piece Symbolic Music Modeling
**Authors**: Yungang Yi

**Updated**: 2026-02-23T13:13:41Z

**Summary**: Long-context modeling is essential for symbolic music generation, since motif repetition and developmental variation can span thousands of musical events. However, practical composition and performance workflows frequently rely on resource-limited devices (e.g., electronic instruments and portable computers), making heavy memory and attention computation difficult to deploy. We introduce Depth-Structured Music Recurrence (DSMR), a recurrent long-context Transformer for full-piece symbolic music modeling that extends context beyond fixed-length excerpts via segment-level recurrence with detached cross-segment states, featuring a layer-wise memory-horizon schedule that budgets recurrent KV states across depth. DSMR is trained in a single left-to-right pass over each complete composition, akin to how a musician experiences it from beginning to end, while carrying recurrent cross-segment states forward. Within this recurrent framework, we systematically study how depth-wise horizon allocations affect optimization, best-checkpoint perplexity, and efficiency. By allocating different history-window lengths across layers while keeping the total recurrent-state budget fixed, DSMR creates depth-dependent temporal receptive fields within a recurrent attention stack without reducing compute depth. Our main instantiation is a two-scale DSMR schedule that allocates long history windows to lower layers and a uniform short window to the remaining layers. Experiments on the piano performance dataset MAESTRO demonstrate that two-scale DSMR provides a practical quality--efficiency recipe for full-length long-context symbolic music modeling with recurrent attention under limited computational resources.

### Semantic Caching for OLAP via LLM-Based Query Canonicalization (Extended Version)
**Authors**: Laurent Bindschaedler

**Updated**: 2026-02-23T13:12:05Z

**Summary**: Analytical workloads exhibit substantial semantic repetition, yet most production caches key entries by SQL surface form (text or AST), fragmenting reuse across BI tools, notebooks, and NL interfaces. We introduce a safety-first middleware cache for dashboard-style OLAP over star schemas that canonicalizes both SQL and NL into a unified key space -- the OLAP Intent Signature -- capturing measures, grouping levels, filters, and time windows. Reuse requires exact intent matches under strict schema validation and confidence-gated NL acceptance; two correctness-preserving derivations (roll-up, filter-down) extend coverage without approximate matching. Across TPC-DS, SSB, and NYC TLC (1,395 queries), we achieve 82% hit rate versus 28% (text) and 56% (AST) with zero false hits; derivations double hit rate on hierarchical queries.

### High-Altitude Platforms in the Low-Altitude Economy: Bridging Communication, Computing, and Regulation
**Authors**: Bang Huang, Eddine Youcef Belmekki, Mohamed-Slim Alouini

**Updated**: 2026-02-23T12:40:05Z

**Summary**: The Low-Altitude Economy (LAE) is rapidly emerging as a new technological and industrial frontier, with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, and aerial swarms increasingly deployed in logistics, infrastructure inspection, security, and emergency response. However, the large-scale development of the LAE demands a reliable aerial foundation that ensures not only real-time connectivity and computational support, but also navigation integrity and safe airspace management for safety-critical operations. High-Altitude Platforms (HAPs), positioned at around 20 km, provide a unique balance between wide-area coverage and low-latency responsiveness. Compared with low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, HAPs are closer to end users and thus capable of delivering millisecond-level connectivity, fine-grained regulatory oversight, and powerful onboard computing and caching resources. Beyond connectivity and computation, HAPs-assisted sensing and regulation further enable navigation integrity and airspace trust, which are essential for safety-critical UAV and eVTOL operations in the LAE. This article proposes a five-stage evolutionary roadmap for HAPs in the LAE: from serving as aerial infrastructure bases, to becoming super back-ends for UAV, to acting as frontline support for ground users, further enabling swarm-scale UAV coordination, and ultimately advancing toward edge-air-cloud closed-loop autonomy. In parallel, HAPs complement LEO satellites and cloud infrastructures to form a global-regional-local three-tier architecture. Looking forward, HAPs are expected to evolve from simple platforms into intelligent hubs, emerging as pivotal nodes for air traffic management, intelligent logistics, and emergency response. By doing so, they will accelerate the transition of the LAE toward large-scale deployment, autonomy, and sustainable growth.

### Activation-Space Uncertainty Quantification for Pretrained Networks
**Authors**: Richard Bergna, Stefan Depeweg, Sergio Calvo-Ordoñez, Jonathan Plenk, Alvaro Cartea, Jose Miguel Hernández-Lobato

**Updated**: 2026-02-23T10:54:32Z

**Summary**: Reliable uncertainty estimates are crucial for deploying pretrained models; yet, many strong methods for quantifying uncertainty require retraining, Monte Carlo sampling, or expensive second-order computations and may alter a frozen backbone's predictions. To address this, we introduce Gaussian Process Activations (GAPA), a post-hoc method that shifts Bayesian modeling from weights to activations. GAPA replaces standard nonlinearities with Gaussian-process activations whose posterior mean exactly matches the original activation, preserving the backbone's point predictions by construction while providing closed-form epistemic variances in activation space. To scale to modern architectures, we use a sparse variational inducing-point approximation over cached training activations, combined with local k-nearest-neighbor subset conditioning, enabling deterministic single-pass uncertainty propagation without sampling, backpropagation, or second-order information. Across regression, classification, image segmentation, and language modeling, GAPA matches or outperforms strong post-hoc baselines in calibration and out-of-distribution detection while remaining efficient at test time.

**Updated**: 2026-02-23T08:13:48Z

**Summary**: Efficient and high-fidelity 3D scene modeling is a long-standing pursuit in computer graphics. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods achieve impressive real-time modeling performance, they rely on resource-unconstrained training assumptions that fail on mobile devices, which are limited by minute-scale training budgets and hardware-available peak-memory. We present PocketGS, a mobile scene modeling paradigm that enables on-device 3DGS training under these tightly coupled constraints while preserving high perceptual fidelity. Our method resolves the fundamental contradictions of standard 3DGS through three co-designed operators: G builds geometry-faithful point-cloud priors; I injects local surface statistics to seed anisotropic Gaussians, thereby reducing early conditioning gaps; and T unrolls alpha compositing with cached intermediates and index-mapped gradient scattering for stable mobile backpropagation. Collectively, these operators satisfy the competing requirements of training efficiency, memory compactness, and modeling fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PocketGS is able to outperform the powerful mainstream workstation 3DGS baseline to deliver high-quality reconstructions, enabling a fully on-device, practical capture-to-rendering workflow.

**Authors**: Tommaso Bonato, Ales Kubicek, Abdul Kabbani, Ahmad Ghalayini, Maciej Besta, Torsten Hoefler

**Updated**: 2026-02-23T07:33:25Z

**Summary**: Low-diameter topologies such as Dragonfly and Slim Fly are increasingly adopted in HPC and datacenter networks, yet existing load balancing techniques either rely on proprietary in-network mechanisms or fail to utilize the full path diversity of these topologies. We introduce Spritz, a flexible sender-based load balancing framework that shifts adaptive topology-aware routing to the endpoints using only standard Ethernet features. We propose two algorithms, Spritz-Scout and Spritz-Spray that, respectively, explore and adaptively cache efficient paths using ECN, packet trimming, and timeout feedback. Through simulation on Dragonfly and Slim Fly topologies with over 1000 endpoints, Spritz outperforms ECMP, UGAL-L, and prior sender-based approaches by up to 1.8x in flow completion time under AI training and datacenter workloads, while offering robust failover with performance improvements of up to 25.4x under link failures, all without additional hardware support. Spritz enables datacenter-scale, commodity Ethernet networks to efficiently leverage low-diameter topologies, offering unified routing and load balancing for the Ultra Ethernet era.

### Relational Feature Caching for Accelerating Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Byunggwan Son, Jeimin Jeon, Jeongwoo Choi, Bumsub Ham

**Updated**: 2026-02-23T04:45:38Z

**Summary**: Feature caching approaches accelerate diffusion transformers (DiTs) by storing the output features of computationally expensive modules at certain timesteps, and exploiting them for subsequent steps to reduce redundant computations. Recent forecasting-based caching approaches employ temporal extrapolation techniques to approximate the output features with cached ones. Although effective, relying exclusively on temporal extrapolation still suffers from significant prediction errors, leading to performance degradation. Through a detailed analysis, we find that 1) these errors stem from the irregular magnitude of changes in the output features, and 2) an input feature of a module is strongly correlated with the corresponding output. Based on this, we propose relational feature caching (RFC), a novel framework that leverages the input-output relationship to enhance the accuracy of the feature prediction. Specifically, we introduce relational feature estimation (RFE) to estimate the magnitude of changes in the output features from the inputs, enabling more accurate feature predictions. We also present relational cache scheduling (RCS), which estimates the prediction errors using the input features and performs full computations only when the errors are expected to be substantial. Extensive experiments across various DiT models demonstrate that RFC consistently outperforms prior approaches significantly. Project page is available at https://cvlab.yonsei.ac.kr/projects/RFC

### KVComm: Enabling Efficient LLM Communication through Selective KV Sharing
**Authors**: Xiangyu Shi, Marco Chiesa, Gerald Q. Maguire, Dejan Kostic

**Updated**: 2026-02-22T15:15:44Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems, where effective inter-model communication is crucial. Existing communication protocols either rely on natural language, incurring high inference costs and information loss, or on hidden states, which suffer from information concentration bias and inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose KVComm, a novel communication framework that enables efficient communication between LLMs through selective sharing of KV pairs. KVComm leverages the rich information encoded in the KV pairs while avoiding the pitfalls of hidden states. We introduce a KV layer-wise selection strategy based on attention importance scores with a Gaussian prior to identify the most informative KV pairs for communication. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and model pairs demonstrate that KVComm achieves comparable performance to the upper-bound method, which directly merges inputs to one model without any communication, while transmitting as few as 30\% of layers' KV pairs. Our study highlights the potential of KV pairs as an effective medium for inter-LLM communication, paving the way for scalable and efficient multi-agent systems.

### StreamDiffusionV2: A Streaming System for Dynamic and Interactive Video Generation
**Authors**: Tianrui Feng, Zhi Li, Shuo Yang, Haocheng Xi, Muyang Li, Xiuyu Li, Lvmin Zhang, Keting Yang, Kelly Peng, Song Han, Maneesh Agrawala, Kurt Keutzer, Akio Kodaira, Chenfeng Xu

**Updated**: 2026-02-22T13:10:27Z

**Summary**: Generative models are reshaping the live-streaming industry by redefining how content is created, styled, and delivered. Previous image-based streaming diffusion models have powered efficient and creative live streaming products but have hit limits on temporal consistency due to the foundation of image-based designs. Recent advances in video diffusion have markedly improved temporal consistency and sampling efficiency for offline generation. However, offline generation systems primarily optimize throughput by batching large workloads. In contrast, live online streaming operates under strict service-level objectives (SLOs): time-to-first-frame must be minimal, and every frame must meet a per-frame deadline with low jitter. Besides, scalable multi-GPU serving for real-time streams remains largely unresolved so far. To address this, we present StreamDiffusionV2, a training-free pipeline for interactive live streaming with video diffusion models. StreamDiffusionV2 integrates an SLO-aware batching scheduler and a block scheduler, together with a sink-token--guided rolling KV cache, a motion-aware noise controller, and other system-level optimizations. Moreover, we introduce a scalable pipeline orchestration that parallelizes the diffusion process across denoising steps and network layers, achieving near-linear FPS scaling without violating latency guarantees. The system scales seamlessly across heterogeneous GPU environments and supports flexible denoising steps (e.g., 1--4), enabling both ultra-low-latency and higher-quality modes. Without TensorRT or quantization, StreamDiffusionV2 renders the first frame within 0.5s and attains 58.28 FPS with a 14B-parameter model and 64.52 FPS with a 1.3B-parameter model on four H100 GPUs, making state-of-the-art generative live streaming practical and accessible--from individual creators to enterprise-scale platforms.

### Derivation Depth as an Information Metric: Axioms, Coding Theorems, and Storage--Computation Tradeoffs
**Authors**: Jianfeng Xu

**Updated**: 2026-02-22T11:44:34Z

**Summary**: We introduce derivation depth-a computable metric of the reasoning effort needed to answer a query based on a given set of premises. We model information as a two-layered structure linking abstract knowledge with physical carriers, and separate essential core facts from operational shortcuts. For any finite premise base, we define and prove the computability of derivation depth. By encoding reasoning traces and applying information-theoretic incompressibility arguments, we establish fundamental bounds linking depth to the descriptive complexity of queries. For frequently asked, information-rich queries, the minimal description length grows proportionally to depth times the logarithm of the knowledge base size. This leads to a practical storage-computation tradeoff: queries accessed beyond a critical threshold become cheaper to cache than recompute. We formulate optimal cache allocation as a mathematical optimization problem solvable with approximation guarantees and extend the framework to handle noisy or incomplete knowledge bases.

### Nightjar: Dynamic Adaptive Speculative Decoding for Large Language Models Serving
**Authors**: Rui Li, Zhaoning Zhang, Libo Zhang, Huaimin Wang, Xiang Fu, Zhiquan Lai

**Updated**: 2026-02-22T03:46:24Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates LLM inference by verifying draft tokens in parallel. However, this method presents a critical trade-off: it improves throughput in low-load, memory-bound systems but degrades performance in high-load, compute-bound environments due to verification overhead. Existing Speculative Decoding strategies typically rely on static speculative lengths, failing to adapt to fluctuating request loads or identify the optimal moment to halt speculation. The cost of restarting speculative inference also remains unquantified. During traffic surges, the marginal utility of speculation diminishes; yet, the draft model's persistent memory footprint competes for available KV cache. This resource contention limits the maximum batch size, thereby degrading overall system throughput. To overcome this, we propose Nightjar, a resource-aware adaptive speculative framework. It first adjusts to the request load by dynamically selecting the optimal speculative length for different batch sizes. Crucially, upon detecting significant request queuing or KV cache shortages, it disables speculative decoding and offloads the draft model to the CPU. This reclaims memory for the KV cache, thereby facilitating larger batch sizes and maximizing overall system throughput. Experiments show that Nightjar achieves up to 27.29% higher throughput and 12.90% lower latency compared to standard speculative decoding under dynamic request arrival rates in real-time LLM serving scenarios.

### Harmonia: Algorithm-Hardware Co-Design for Memory- and Compute-Efficient BFP-based LLM Inference
**Authors**: Xinyu Wang, Jieyu Li, Yanan Sun, Weifeng He

**Updated**: 2026-02-22T03:10:11Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but incur high memory and computation costs. Quantization is an effective solution, with INT weights and FP activations being widely adopted to preserve accuracy. Prior works further reduce FP overhead by using block floating point (BFP) activations in linear layers, but fail to extend BFP to attention layers due to severe accuracy degradation, limiting overall efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose Harmonia, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that enables all-layer BFP activations with a configurable hardware architecture. First, we systematically explore BFP configurations to achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and activation compression across all layers. Second, to reduce KV-cache storage and computation in attention layers, we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy and computations in attention layers,we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy combined with a hybrid offline-online outlier smoothing technique. This allow aggressive KV-cache compression from FP16 to 4-bit-mantissa BFP with only 0.3% average accuracy loss. Third, to fully exploit all-layer BFP activations, we design dedicated hardware components, including a reconfigurable PE supporting mixed data formats (BFP-INT and BPF-BFP), a real-time FP16-to-BFP converter, and a tiling-aware dataflow to reduce memory traffic. We evaluate Harmonia on GEMM operations in both linear and attention layers across eight widely used LLMs. Compared with prior works, Harmonia achieves 3.84x (up to 5.05x) higher area efficiency, 2.03x (up to 3.90x) better energy efficiency, and 3.08x (up to 4.62x) speedup on average.

### SeaCache: Spectral-Evolution-Aware Cache for Accelerating Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Jiwoo Chung, Sangeek Hyun, MinKyu Lee, Byeongju Han, Geonho Cha, Dongyoon Wee, Youngjun Hong, Jae-Pil Heo

**Updated**: 2026-02-22T00:48:03Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models are a strong backbone for visual generation, but their inherently sequential denoising process leads to slow inference. Previous methods accelerate sampling by caching and reusing intermediate outputs based on feature distances between adjacent timesteps. However, existing caching strategies typically rely on raw feature differences that entangle content and noise. This design overlooks spectral evolution, where low-frequency structure appears early and high-frequency detail is refined later. We introduce Spectral-Evolution-Aware Cache (SeaCache), a training-free cache schedule that bases reuse decisions on a spectrally aligned representation. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we derive a Spectral-Evolution-Aware (SEA) filter that preserves content-relevant components while suppressing noise. Employing SEA-filtered input features to estimate redundancy leads to dynamic schedules that adapt to content while respecting the spectral priors underlying the diffusion model. Extensive experiments on diverse visual generative models and the baselines show that SeaCache achieves state-of-the-art latency-quality trade-offs.

### Incremental Transformer Neural Processes
**Authors**: Philip Mortimer, Cristiana Diaconu, Tommy Rochussen, Bruno Mlodozeniec, Richard E. Turner

**Updated**: 2026-02-21T20:30:04Z

**Summary**: Neural Processes (NPs), and specifically Transformer Neural Processes (TNPs), have demonstrated remarkable performance across tasks ranging from spatiotemporal forecasting to tabular data modelling. However, many of these applications are inherently sequential, involving continuous data streams such as real-time sensor readings or database updates. In such settings, models should support cheap, incremental updates rather than recomputing internal representations from scratch for every new observation -- a capability existing TNP variants lack. Drawing inspiration from Large Language Models, we introduce the Incremental TNP (incTNP). By leveraging causal masking, Key-Value (KV) caching, and a data-efficient autoregressive training strategy, incTNP matches the predictive performance of standard TNPs while reducing the computational cost of updates from quadratic to linear time complexity. We empirically evaluate our model on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including tabular regression and temperature prediction. Our results show that, surprisingly, incTNP delivers performance comparable to -- or better than -- non-causal TNPs while unlocking orders-of-magnitude speedups for sequential inference. Finally, we assess the consistency of the model's updates -- by adapting a metric of ``implicit Bayesianness", we show that incTNP retains a prediction rule as implicitly Bayesian as standard non-causal TNPs, demonstrating that incTNP achieves the computational benefits of causal masking without sacrificing the consistency required for streaming inference.

### Why Agent Caching Fails and How to Fix It: Structured Intent Canonicalization with Few-Shot Learning
**Authors**: Abhinaba Basu

**Updated**: 2026-02-21T18:25:18Z

**Summary**: Personal AI agents incur substantial cost via repeated LLM calls. We show existing caching methods fail: GPTCache achieves 37.9% accuracy on real benchmarks; APC achieves 0-12%. The root cause is optimizing for the wrong property -- cache effectiveness requires key consistency and precision,   not classification accuracy. We observe cache-key evaluation reduces to clustering evaluation and apply V-measure decomposition to separate these on n=8,682 points across MASSIVE, BANKING77, CLINC150, and NyayaBench v2, our new 8,514-entry multilingual agentic dataset (528 intents, 20 W5H2 classes, 63 languages). We introduce W5H2, a structured intent decomposition framework. Using SetFit with 8 examples per class, W5H2 achieves 91.1%+/-1.7% on MASSIVE in ~2ms -- vs 37.9% for   GPTCache and 68.8% for a 20B-parameter LLM at 3,447ms. On NyayaBench v2 (20 classes), SetFit achieves 55.3%, with cross-lingual transfer across 30 languages. Our five-tier cascade handles 85% of interactions locally, projecting 97.5% cost reduction. We provide risk-controlled selective prediction guarantees via RCPS with nine bound families.

### Esoteric Language Models: Bridging Autoregressive and Masked Diffusion LLMs
**Authors**: Subham Sekhar Sahoo, Zhihan Yang, Yash Akhauri, Johnna Liu, Deepansha Singh, Zhoujun Cheng, Zhengzhong Liu, Eric Xing, John Thickstun, Arash Vahdat

**Updated**: 2026-02-21T18:05:37Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based language models offer a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) models by enabling parallel and controllable generation. Within this family, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) currently perform best but still underperform AR models in perplexity and lack key inference-time efficiency features, most notably KV caching. We introduce Eso-LMs, a new family of models that fuses AR and MDM paradigms, smoothly interpolating between their perplexities while overcoming their respective limitations. Unlike prior work, which uses transformers with bidirectional attention as MDM denoisers, we exploit the connection between MDMs and Any-Order autoregressive models and adopt causal attention. This design lets us compute the exact likelihood of MDMs for the first time and, crucially, enables us \to introduce KV caching for MDMs while preserving parallel generation for the first time, significantly improving inference efficiency. Combined with an optimized sampling schedule, Eso-LMs achieves a new state of the art on the speed-quality Pareto frontier for unconditional generation. On long contexts, it yields $\mathbf{14 - 65{}\times}$ faster inference than standard MDMs and $\mathbf{3 - 4{}\times}$ faster inference than prior semi-autoregressive approaches. We provide code, model checkpoints, and a video tutorial on the project page: https://s-sahoo.com/Eso-LMs.

### HillInfer: Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference on the Edge with Hierarchical KV Eviction using SmartSSD
**Authors**: He Sun, Li Li, Mingjun Xiao

**Updated**: 2026-02-21T08:19:59Z

**Summary**: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices such as PCs enables low-latency inference with strong privacy guarantees, but long-context inference is fundamentally constrained by limited memory and compute resources. Beyond model parameters, the KV cache becomes the dominant bottleneck due to its linear growth with context length. Although prior work exploits contextual sparsity to evict unimportant KV data, these approaches are largely designed for memory-rich platforms and incur prohibitive data transfer overhead when applied to resource-constrained edge devices with external storage. In this paper, we propose HillInfer, an importance-aware long-context LLM inference framework on the edge that leverages SmartSSD-assisted hierarchical KV cache management. HillInfer jointly manages KV cache pools across the CPU and SmartSSD, and performs in-storage importance evaluation to reduce unnecessary data movement. Furthermore, we design an adaptive, prefetch-based pipeline that overlaps computation and KV data transfer across GPU, CPU, and SmartSSD, minimizing end-to-end inference latency without sacrificing accuracy. We implement HillInfer on a PC with a commodity GPU, and experiments across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate up to 8.56 $\times$ speedup over baselines while preserving model accuracy.

### Follow-Your-Shape: Shape-Aware Image Editing via Trajectory-Guided Region Control
**Authors**: Zeqian Long, Mingzhe Zheng, Kunyu Feng, Xinhua Zhang, Hongyu Liu, Harry Yang, Linfeng Zhang, Qifeng Chen, Yue Ma

**Updated**: 2026-02-21T06:41:00Z

**Summary**: While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.

### vCache: Verified Semantic Prompt Caching
**Authors**: Luis Gaspar Schroeder, Aditya Desai, Alejandro Cuadron, Kyle Chu, Shu Liu, Mark Zhao, Stephan Krusche, Alfons Kemper, Matei Zaharia, Joseph E. Gonzalez

**Updated**: 2026-02-21T02:29:11Z

**Summary**: Semantic caches return cached responses for semantically similar prompts to reduce LLM inference latency and cost. They embed cached prompts and store them alongside their response in a vector database. Embedding similarity metrics assign a numerical score to quantify the similarity between a request and its nearest neighbor prompt from the cache. Existing systems use the same static similarity threshold across all requests to determine whether two prompts can share similar responses. However, we observe that static thresholds do not give formal correctness guarantees, result in unexpected error rates, and lead to suboptimal cache hit rates. This paper proposes vCache, the first verified semantic cache with user-defined error rate guarantees for predictable performance. It employs an online learning algorithm to estimate an optimal threshold for each cached prompt, enabling reliable cache responses without additional training. Our experiments show that vCache consistently meets the specified error bounds while outperforming state-of-the-art static-threshold and fine-tuned embedding baselines with up to 12.5$\times$ higher cache hit and 26$\times$ lower error rates. We release the vCache implementation and four benchmarks to support future research.

### Going Down Memory Lane: Scaling Tokens for Video Stream Understanding with Dynamic KV-Cache Memory
**Authors**: Vatsal Agarwal, Saksham Suri, Matthew Gwilliam, Pulkit Kumar, Abhinav Shrivastava

**Updated**: 2026-02-20T18:59:50Z

**Summary**: Streaming video understanding requires models to robustly encode, store, and retrieve information from a continuous video stream to support accurate video question answering (VQA). Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on key-value caching to accumulate frame-level information over time, but use a limited number of tokens per frame, leading to the loss of fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose scaling the token budget to enable more granular spatiotemporal understanding and reasoning. First, we find that current methods are ill-equipped to handle dense streams: their feature encoding causes query-frame similarity scores to increase over time, biasing retrieval toward later frames. To address this, we introduce an adaptive selection strategy that reduces token redundancy while preserving local spatiotemporal information. We further propose a training-free retrieval mixture-of-experts that leverages external models to better identify relevant frames. Our method, MemStream, achieves +8.0% on CG-Bench, +8.5% on LVBench, and +2.4% on VideoMME (Long) over ReKV with Qwen2.5-VL-7B.

### FeatureBleed: Inferring Private Enriched Attributes From Sparsity-Optimized AI Accelerators
**Authors**: Darsh Asher, Farshad Dizani, Joshua Kalyanapu, Rosario Cammarota, Aydin Aysu, Samira Mirbagher Ajorpaz

**Updated**: 2026-02-20T16:01:16Z

**Summary**: Backend enrichment is now widely deployed in sensitive domains such as product recommendation pipelines, healthcare, and finance, where models are trained on confidential data and retrieve private features whose values influence inference behavior while remaining hidden from the API caller. This paper presents the first hardware-level backend retrieval data-stealing attack, showing that accelerator optimizations designed for performance can directly undermine data confidentiality and bypass state-of-the-art privacy defenses.   Our attack, FEATUREBLEED, exploits zero-skipping in AI accelerators to infer private backend-retrieved features solely through end-to-end timing, without relying on power analysis, DVFS manipulation, or shared-cache side channels. We evaluate FEATUREBLEED on three datasets spanning medical and non-medical domains: Texas-100X (clinical records), OrganAMNIST (medical imaging), and Census-19 (socioeconomic data). We further evaluate FEATUREBLEED across three hardware backends (Intel AVX, Intel AMX, and NVIDIA A100) and three model architectures (DNNs, CNNs, and hybrid CNN-MLP pipelines), demonstrating that the leakage generalizes across CPU and GPU accelerators, data modalities, and application domains, with an adversarial advantage of up to 98.87 percentage points.   Finally, we identify the root cause of the leakage as sparsity-driven zero-skipping in modern hardware. We quantify the privacy-performance-power trade-off: disabling zero-skipping increases Intel AMX per-operation energy by up to 25 percent and incurs 100 percent performance overhead. We propose a padding-based defense that masks timing leakage by equalizing responses to the worst-case execution time, achieving protection with only 7.24 percent average performance overhead and no additional power cost.

### Thinking by Subtraction: Confidence-Driven Contrastive Decoding for LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Lexiang Tang, Weihao Gao, Bingchen Zhao, Lu Ma, Qiao jin, Bang Yang, Yuexian Zou

**Updated**: 2026-02-20T14:13:22Z

**Summary**: Recent work on test-time scaling for large language model (LLM) reasoning typically assumes that allocating more inference-time computation uniformly improves correctness. However, prior studies show that reasoning uncertainty is highly localized: a small subset of low-confidence tokens disproportionately contributes to reasoning errors and unnecessary output expansion. Motivated by this observation, we propose Thinking by Subtraction, a confidence-driven contrastive decoding approach that improves reasoning reliability through targeted token-level intervention. Our method, Confidence-Driven Contrastive Decoding, detects low-confidence tokens during decoding and intervenes selectively at these positions. It constructs a contrastive reference by replacing high-confidence tokens with minimal placeholders, and refines predictions by subtracting this reference distribution at low-confidence locations. Experiments show that CCD significantly improves accuracy across mathematical reasoning benchmarks while substantially reducing output length, with minimal KV-cache overhead. As a training-free method, CCD enhances reasoning reliability through targeted low-confidence intervention without computational redundancy. Our code will be made available at: https://github.com/bolo-web/CCD.

### RAT+: Train Dense, Infer Sparse -- Recurrence Augmented Attention for Dilated Inference
**Authors**: Xiuying Wei, Caglar Gulcehre

**Updated**: 2026-02-20T13:09:49Z

**Summary**: Structured dilated attention has an appealing inference-time efficiency knob: it reduces the FLOPs of the attention and the KV cache size by a factor of the dilation size D, while preserving long-range connectivity. However, we find a persistent failure mode of them -- sparsifying a pretrained attention model to a dilated pattern leads to severe accuracy degradation. We introduce RAT+, a dense-pretraining architecture that augments attention with full-sequence recurrence and active recurrence learning. A single RAT+ model is pretrained densely once, then flexibly switched at inference time to dilated attention (optionally with local windows) or hybrid layer/head compositions, requiring only a short 1B-token resolution adaptation rather than retraining separate sparse models. At 1.5B parameters trained on 100B tokens, RAT+ closely matches dense accuracy at 16 and drops by about 2-3 points at 64 on commonsense reasoning and LongBench tasks, respectively. Moreover, RAT+ outperforms attention when sparsifying to the top-k block attention. We further scale to 2.6B parameters and 200B tokens and observe the same trend.

### Cluster Workload Allocation: Semantic Soft Affinity Using Natural Language Processing
**Authors**: Leszek Sliwko, Jolanta Mizeria-Pietraszko

**Updated**: 2026-02-20T11:40:54Z

**Summary**: Cluster workload allocation often requires complex configurations, creating a usability gap. This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration and presents a proof-of-concept design.

### Predict to Skip: Linear Multistep Feature Forecasting for Efficient Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Hanshuai Cui, Zhiqing Tang, Qianli Ma, Zhi Yao, Weijia Jia

**Updated**: 2026-02-20T09:33:59Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a widely adopted backbone for high-fidelity image and video generation, yet their iterative denoising process incurs high computational costs. Existing training-free acceleration methods rely on feature caching and reuse under the assumption of temporal stability. However, reusing features for multiple steps may lead to latent drift and visual degradation. We observe that model outputs evolve smoothly along much of the diffusion trajectory, enabling principled predictions rather than naive reuse. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{PrediT}, a training-free acceleration framework that formulates feature prediction as a linear multistep problem. We employ classical linear multistep methods to forecast future model outputs from historical information, combined with a corrector that activates in high-dynamics regions to prevent error accumulation. A dynamic step modulation mechanism adaptively adjusts the prediction horizon by monitoring the feature change rate. Together, these components enable substantial acceleration while preserving generation fidelity. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves up to $5.54\times$ latency reduction across various DiT-based image and video generation models, while incurring negligible quality degradation.

### CDLM: Consistency Diffusion Language Models For Faster Sampling
**Authors**: Minseo Kim, Chenfeng Xu, Coleman Hooper, Harman Singh, Ben Athiwaratkun, Ce Zhang, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2026-02-20T02:50:33Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising parallel generation paradigm but suffer from slow inference due to numerous refinement steps and the inability to use standard KV caching. We introduce CDLM (Consistency Diffusion Language Models), a training-based acceleration method that simultaneously tackles both bottlenecks. CDLM integrates consistency modeling to drastically reduce the number of required sampling steps by enabling multi-token finalization. Furthermore, we enforce a block-wise causal attention mask during fine-tuning, making the model fully compatible with KV caching. Experiments show CDLM achieves 3.6x-14.5x lower latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on math and coding tasks. The full training and evaluation code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/CDLM.

### Share Your Attention: Transformer Weight Sharing via Matrix-based Dictionary Learning
**Authors**: Magauiya Zhussip, Dmitriy Shopkhoev, Ammar Ali, Stamatios Lefkimmiatis

**Updated**: 2026-02-19T19:17:31Z

**Summary**: Large language models have revolutionized AI applications, yet their high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment. Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g., low-rank approximation or attention pruning), while the repetitive layered structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by dictionary learning in convolutional networks, we propose a framework for structured weight sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection matrices (Q, K, V, O) into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's parameters by 66.7\% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement-trained with standard optimizers - and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than GQA, low-rank baselines and recent Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT), MASA matches performance metrics on image classification tasks with 66.7\% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we investigate the possibility of employing MASA on large pretrained models to reduce their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their performance.

### A Picture of Agentic Search
**Authors**: Francesca Pezzuti, Ophir Frieder, Fabrizio Silvestri, Sean MacAvaney, Nicola Tonellotto

**Updated**: 2026-02-19T16:32:34Z

**Summary**: With automated systems increasingly issuing search queries alongside humans, Information Retrieval (IR) faces a major shift. Yet IR remains human-centred, with systems, evaluation metrics, user models, and datasets designed around human queries and behaviours. Consequently, IR operates under assumptions that no longer hold in practice, with changes to workload volumes, predictability, and querying behaviours. This misalignment affects system performance and optimisation: caching may lose effectiveness, query pre-processing may add overhead without improving results, and standard metrics may mismeasure satisfaction. Without adaptation, retrieval models risk satisfying neither humans, nor the emerging user segment of agents. However, datasets capturing agent search behaviour are lacking, which is a critical gap given IR's historical reliance on data-driven evaluation and optimisation. We develop a methodology for collecting all the data produced and consumed by agentic retrieval-augmented systems when answering queries, and we release the Agentic Search Queryset (ASQ) dataset. ASQ contains reasoning-induced queries, retrieved documents, and thoughts for queries in HotpotQA, Researchy Questions, and MS MARCO, for 3 diverse agents and 2 retrieval pipelines. The accompanying toolkit enables ASQ to be extended to new agents, retrievers, and datasets.

### Nested Sampling with Slice-within-Gibbs: Efficient Evidence Calculation for Hierarchical Bayesian Models
**Authors**: David Yallup

**Updated**: 2026-02-19T14:43:59Z

**Summary**: We present Nested Sampling with Slice-within-Gibbs (NS-SwiG), an algorithm for Bayesian inference and evidence estimation in high-dimensional models whose likelihood admits a factorization, such as hierarchical Bayesian models. We construct a procedure to sample from the likelihood-constrained prior using a Slice-within-Gibbs kernel: an outer update of hyperparameters followed by inner block updates over local parameters. A likelihood-budget decomposition caches per-block contributions so that each local update checks feasibility in constant time rather than recomputing the global constraint at linearly growing cost. This reduces the per-replacement cost from quadratic to linear in the number of groups, and the overall algorithmic complexity from cubic to quadratic under standard assumptions. The decomposition extends naturally beyond independent observations, and we demonstrate this on Markov-structured latent variables. We evaluate NS-SwiG on challenging benchmarks, demonstrating scalability to thousands of dimensions and accurate evidence estimates even on posterior geometries where state-of-the-art gradient-based samplers can struggle.

### DRetHTR: Linear-Time Decoder-Only Retentive Network for Handwritten Text Recognition
**Authors**: Changhun Kim, Martin Mayr, Thomas Gorges, Fei Wu, Mathias Seuret, Andreas Maier, Vincent Christlein

**Updated**: 2026-02-19T14:12:07Z

**Summary**: State-of-the-art handwritten text recognition (HTR) systems commonly use Transformers, whose growing key-value (KV) cache makes decoding slow and memory-intensive. We introduce DRetHTR, a decoder-only model built on Retentive Networks (RetNet). Compared to an equally sized decoder-only Transformer baseline, DRetHTR delivers 1.6-1.9x faster inference with 38-42% less memory usage, without loss of accuracy. By replacing softmax attention with softmax-free retention and injecting multi-scale sequential priors, DRetHTR avoids a growing KV cache: decoding is linear in output length in both time and memory. To recover the local-to-global inductive bias of attention, we propose layer-wise gamma scaling, which progressively enlarges the effective retention horizon in deeper layers. This encourages early layers to model short-range dependencies and later layers to capture broader context, mitigating the flexibility gap introduced by removing softmax. Consequently, DRetHTR achieves best reported test character error rates of 2.26% (IAM-A, en), 1.81% (RIMES, fr), and 3.46% (Bentham, en), and is competitive on READ-2016 (de) with 4.21%. This demonstrates that decoder-only RetNet enables Transformer-level HTR accuracy with substantially improved decoding speed and memory efficiency.

### Reconstructing KV Caches with Cross-layer Fusion For Enhanced Transformers
**Authors**: Hongzhan Lin, Zhiqi Bai, Xinmiao Zhang, Sen Yang, Xiang Li, Siran Yang, Yunlong Xu, Jiaheng Liu, Yongchi Zhao, Jiamang Wang, Yuchi Xu, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng

**Updated**: 2026-02-19T05:41:27Z

**Summary**: Transformer decoders have achieved strong results across tasks, but the memory required for the KV cache becomes prohibitive at long sequence lengths. Although Cross-layer KV Cache sharing (e.g., YOCO, CLA) offers a path to mitigate KV Cache bottleneck, it typically underperforms within-layer methods like GQA. To understand the root cause, we investigate the information flow of keys and values of the top-layers. Our preliminary reveals a clear distribution: values are predominantly derived from the bottom layer, while keys draw more information from both bottom and middle layers. Building upon this, we propose FusedKV, whose top-layer KV caches are a learnable fusion of the most informative ones from the bottom and middle layers. This fusion operates directly on post-RoPE keys, preserving relative positional information without the computational cost of re-applying rotary embeddings. To further improve efficiency, we propose FusedKV-Lite, an cross-layer sharing approach, where top-layer KV caches are directly derived from the bottom-layer values and the middle-layer keys. Compared to FusedKV, FusedKV-Lite reduces I/O overhead at the cost of a slight increase in perplexity. In experiments on LLMs ranging from 332M to 4B parameters, our proposed method reduce 50\% cache memory while achieving lower validation perplexity than the standard Transformer decoder, establishing it as a memory-efficient, high-performance architectural alternative.

### Revealing Rotational Symmetry Breaking Charge-density Wave Order in Kagome Superconductor (Rb, K)V$_3$Sb$_5$ by Ultrafast Pump-probe Experiments
**Authors**: Qinwen Deng, Hengxin Tan, Brenden R. Ortiz, Stephen D. Wilson, Binghai Yan, Liang Wu

**Updated**: 2026-02-18T21:45:28Z

**Summary**: The recently discovered Kagome superconductor AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (where A refers to K, Rb, Cs) has stimulated widespread research interest due to its interplay of non-trivial topology and unconventional correlated physics including charge-density waves (CDW) and superconductivity. The essential prerequisite to understanding the microscopic mechanisms of this complex electronic landscape is to unveil the configuration and symmetry of the charge-density wave order. As to now, little consensus has been made on what symmetry is broken. Herein, we clarify the microscopic structure and symmetry breaking of the CDW phase in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity. Our approach is based on extracting coherent phonon spectra induced by three-dimensional CDW and comparing them to calculated phonon frequencies via density-functional theory. The combination of these experimental results and calculations provides compelling evidence that the CDW structure of both compounds prevailing up to T$_{\text{CDW}}$ is the 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 staggered inverse Star-of-David pattern with interlayer $π$ phase shift, in which the six-fold rotational symmetry is broken. These observations thus corroborate six-fold rotational symmetry breaking throughout the CDW phase of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$.

### Training Large Reasoning Models Efficiently via Progressive Thought Encoding
**Authors**: Zeliang Zhang, Xiaodong Liu, Hao Cheng, Hao Sun, Chenliang Xu, Jianfeng Gao

**Updated**: 2026-02-18T20:03:38Z

**Summary**: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel on complex problems but face a critical barrier to efficiency: reinforcement learning (RL) training requires long rollouts for outcome-based rewards, where autoregressive decoding dominates time and memory usage. While sliding-window cache strategies can bound memory, they disrupt long-context reasoning and degrade performance. We introduce Progressive Thought Encoding, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that enables LRMs to reason effectively under fixed-size caches. By progressively encoding intermediate reasoning into fixed-size vector representations, our approach eliminates the need to backpropagate through full-cache rollouts, thereby reducing memory usage, while maintaining constant memory during inference. Experiments on three models, including Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, on six widely used challenging mathematical benchmarks show consistent gains: our method achieves +19.3% improvement over LoRA-based fine-tuning and +29.9% over LRMs without fine-tuning on average, with up to +23.4 accuracy improvement on AIME2024/2025 under the same tight cache budgets. These results demonstrate that Progressive Thought Encoding not only improves reasoning accuracy but also makes RL training of LRMs substantially more efficient and scalable under real-world memory constraints.

### A Scalable Approach to Solving Simulation-Based Network Security Games
**Authors**: Michael Lanier, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik

**Updated**: 2026-02-18T16:07:01Z

**Summary**: We introduce MetaDOAR, a lightweight meta-controller that augments the Double Oracle / PSRO paradigm with a learned, partition-aware filtering layer and Q-value caching to enable scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning on very large cyber-network environments. MetaDOAR learns a compact state projection from per node structural embeddings to rapidly score and select a small subset of devices (a top-k partition) on which a conventional low-level actor performs focused beam search utilizing a critic agent. Selected candidate actions are evaluated with batched critic forwards and stored in an LRU cache keyed by a quantized state projection and local action identifiers, dramatically reducing redundant critic computation while preserving decision quality via conservative k-hop cache invalidation. Empirically, MetaDOAR attains higher player payoffs than SOTA baselines on large network topologies, without significant scaling issues in terms of memory usage or training time. This contribution provide a practical, theoretically motivated path to efficient hierarchical policy learning for large-scale networked decision problems.

### Framework of Thoughts: A Foundation Framework for Dynamic and Optimized Reasoning based on Chains, Trees, and Graphs
**Authors**: Felix Fricke, Simon Malberg, Georg Groh

**Updated**: 2026-02-18T14:58:25Z

**Summary**: Prompting schemes such as Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, and Graph of Thoughts can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, most existing schemes require users to define static, problem-specific reasoning structures that lack adaptability to dynamic or unseen problem types. Additionally, these schemes are often under-optimized in terms of hyperparameters, prompts, runtime, and prompting cost. To address these limitations, we introduce Framework of Thoughts (FoT)--a general-purpose foundation framework for building and optimizing dynamic reasoning schemes. FoT comes with built-in features for hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and intelligent caching, unlocking the latent performance potential of reasoning schemes. We demonstrate FoT's capabilities by implementing three popular schemes--Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, and ProbTree--within FoT. We empirically show that FoT enables significantly faster execution, reduces costs, and achieves better task scores through optimization. We release our codebase to facilitate the development of future dynamic and efficient reasoning schemes.

### Fast KV Compaction via Attention Matching
**Authors**: Adam Zweiger, Xinghong Fu, Han Guo, Yoon Kim

**Updated**: 2026-02-18T09:06:53Z

**Summary**: Scaling language models to long contexts is often bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache. In deployed settings, long contexts are typically managed through compaction in token space via summarization. However, summarization can be highly lossy, substantially harming downstream performance. Recent work on Cartridges has shown that it is possible to train highly compact KV caches in latent space that closely match full-context performance, but at the cost of slow and expensive end-to-end optimization. This work describes an approach for fast context compaction in latent space through Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at a per-KV-head level. We show that this formulation naturally decomposes into simple subproblems, some of which admit efficient closed-form solutions. Within this framework, we develop a family of methods that significantly push the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality, achieving up to 50x compaction in seconds on some datasets with little quality loss.

### Magnetizing altermagnets by ultrafast asymmetric spin dynamics
**Authors**: Zhaobo Zhou, Sangeeta Sharma, John Kay Dewhurst, Junjie He

**Updated**: 2026-02-18T07:41:23Z

**Summary**: Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization: equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescales. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we show that linearly polarized laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization between otherwise identical sublattices in the $d$-wave compensated altermagnet (AM) RuO$_2$, resulting in a \textit{photo-induced ferrimagnetic state} with a strong net magnetization of $\sim$0.2 $μ_B$ per unit cell. The sign and magnitude of this metastable magnetization are highly controllable by laser polarization. We identify polarization-selective asymmetric optical intersite spin transfer (a-OISTR) as the primary mechanism generating the net moment, followed by asymmetric spin flips (a-SF) that further amplifies it. Both effects originate from the characteristic nodal spin band topology of \textit{d}-wave AMs. Moreover, we demonstrate that this laser-induced magnetization is universal across various $d$-wave AMs, including experimentally confirmed KV$_2$Se$_2$O and RbV$_2$Te$_2$O. We uncover a robust route to light-controlled magnetization in AMs on ultrafast timescales.

### Closing Africa's Early Warning Gap: AI Weather Forecasting for Disaster Prevention
**Authors**: Qness Ndlovu

**Updated**: 2026-02-18T06:33:03Z

**Summary**: In January 2026, torrential rains killed 200-300 people across Southern Africa, exposing a critical reality: 60% of the continent lacks effective early warning systems due to infrastructure costs. Traditional radar stations exceed USD 1 million each, leaving Africa with an 18x coverage deficit compared to the US and EU. We present a production-grade architecture for deploying NVIDIA Earth-2 AI weather models at USD 1,430-1,730/month for national-scale deployment - enabling coverage at 2,000-4,545x lower cost than radar. The system generates 15-day global atmospheric forecasts, cached in PostgreSQL to enable user queries under 200 milliseconds without real-time inference.   Deployed in South Africa in February 2026, our system demonstrates three technical contributions: (1) a ProcessPoolExecutor-based event loop isolation pattern that resolves aiobotocore session lifecycle conflicts in async Python applications; (2) a database-backed serving architecture where the GPU writes global forecasts directly to PostgreSQL, eliminating HTTP transfer bottlenecks for high-resolution tensors; and (3) an automated coordinate management pattern for multi-step inference across 61 timesteps. Forecasts are delivered via WhatsApp, leveraging 80%+ market penetration. This architecture makes continent-scale early warning systems economically viable, supporting UNDRR findings that such systems reduce disaster death rates by 6x. All architectural details are documented inline for full reproducibility.

### Software Testing at the Network Layer: Automated HTTP API Quality Assessment and Security Analysis of Production Web Applications
**Authors**: Ali Hassaan Mughal, Muhammad Bilal, Noor Fatima

**Updated**: 2026-02-18T04:00:37Z

**Summary**: Modern web applications rely heavily on client-side API calls to fetch data, render content, and communicate with backend services. However, the quality of these network interactions (redundant requests, missing cache headers, oversized payloads, and excessive third-party dependencies) is rarely tested in a systematic way. Moreover, many of these quality deficiencies carry security implications: missing cache headers enable cache poisoning, excessive third-party dependencies expand the supply-chain attack surface, and error responses risk leaking server internals. In this study, we present an automated software testing framework that captures and analyzes the complete HTTP traffic of 18 production websites spanning 11 categories (e-commerce, news, government, developer tools, travel, and more). Using automated browser instrumentation via Playwright, we record 108 HAR (HTTP Archive) files across 3 independent runs per page, then apply 8 heuristic-based anti-pattern detectors to produce a composite quality score (0-100) for each site. Our results reveal a wide quality spectrum: minimalist server-rendered sites achieve perfect scores of 100, while content-heavy commercial sites score as low as 56.8. We identify redundant API calls and missing cache headers as the two most pervasive anti-patterns, each affecting 67% of sites, while third-party overhead exceeds 20% on 72% of sites. One utility site makes 2,684 requests per page load, which is 447x more than the most minimal site. To protect site reputations, all identities are anonymized using category-based pseudonyms. We provide all analysis scripts, anonymized results, and reproducibility instructions as an open artifact. This work establishes an empirical baseline for HTTP API call quality across the modern web and offers a reproducible testing framework that researchers and practitioners can apply to their own applications.

### High-Voltage Performance Testing in LAr of the PMMA Cathode Connection for the DarkSide-20k Experiment
**Authors**: Ludovico Luzzi

**Updated**: 2026-02-18T02:02:11Z

**Summary**: DarkSide-20k (DS-20k) is a next-generation dual-phase liquid argon (LAr) time projection chamber (TPC) devoted to the direct-detection of dark matter. The detector is currently under construction in Hall-C at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy, at a depth of approximately 3500 m water equivalent. The detector will instrument 49.7 t of low-radioactivity underground LAr contained within an acrylic TPC and is designed to reach a WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross-section sensitivity down to $10^{-48}\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ for a WIMP mass of $0.1\,\mathrm{TeV}/c^{2}$ in a 200 tonne-year run. In DS-20k a uniform electric drift field is established in the active volume to transport ionization electrons toward the electroluminescence region, with the required high voltage delivered to the TPC cathode through a custom cable and stress-cone assembly. At the University of California, Davis, a dedicated test setup was developed to reproduce the DS-20k cathode high-voltage connection in LAr, matching the local electric-field conditions. This work summarizes the results of a comprehensive test campaign validating the operation of the DS-20k cathode HV system in LAr up to $-100$ kV.

### CHAI: CacHe Attention Inference for text2video
**Authors**: Joel Mathew Cherian, Ashutosh Muralidhara Bharadwaj, Vima Gupta, Anand Padmanabha Iyer

**Updated**: 2026-02-18T01:53:29Z

**Summary**: Text-to-video diffusion models deliver impressive results but remain slow because of the sequential denoising of 3D latents. Existing approaches to speed up inference either require expensive model retraining or use heuristic-based step skipping, which struggles to maintain video quality as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our work, CHAI, aims to use cross-inference caching to reduce latency while maintaining video quality. We introduce Cache Attention as an effective method for attending to shared objects/scenes across cross-inference latents. This selective attention mechanism enables effective reuse of cached latents across semantically related prompts, yielding high cache hit rates. We show that it is possible to generate high-quality videos using Cache Attention with as few as 8 denoising steps. When integrated into the overall system, CHAI is 1.65x - 3.35x faster than baseline OpenSora 1.2 while maintaining video quality.

### Quant VideoGen: Auto-Regressive Long Video Generation via 2-Bit KV-Cache Quantization

**Updated**: 2026-02-17T23:49:23Z

**Summary**: Despite rapid progress in autoregressive video diffusion, an emerging system algorithm bottleneck limits both deployability and generation capability: KV cache memory. In autoregressive video generation models, the KV cache grows with generation history and quickly dominates GPU memory, often exceeding 30 GB, preventing deployment on widely available hardware. More critically, constrained KV cache budgets restrict the effective working memory, directly degrading long horizon consistency in identity, layout, and motion. To address this challenge, we present Quant VideoGen (QVG), a training free KV cache quantization framework for autoregressive video diffusion models. QVG leverages video spatiotemporal redundancy through Semantic Aware Smoothing, producing low magnitude, quantization friendly residuals. It further introduces Progressive Residual Quantization, a coarse to fine multi stage scheme that reduces quantization error while enabling a smooth quality memory trade off. Across LongCat Video, HY WorldPlay, and Self Forcing benchmarks, QVG establishes a new Pareto frontier between quality and memory efficiency, reducing KV cache memory by up to 7.0 times with less than 4% end to end latency overhead while consistently outperforming existing baselines in generation quality.

### Why Any-Order Autoregressive Models Need Two-Stream Attention: A Structural-Semantic Tradeoff
**Authors**: Patrick Pynadath, Ruqi Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-02-17T23:39:39Z

**Summary**: Any-order autoregressive models (AO-ARMs) offer a promising path toward efficient masked diffusion by enabling native key-value caching, but competitive performance has so far required two-stream attention, typically motivated as a means of decoupling token content from position. In this work, we argue that two-stream attention may be serving a more subtle role. We identify a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation: the hidden representation at each step must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization, objectives that compete for attention capacity in a single stream but can specialize across two streams. To isolate this tradeoff from position-content separation, we propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths--where semantic and structural proximity coincide--but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. These results suggest that the success of two-stream attention stems not merely from separating position from content, but from circumventing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation.

### CLAA: Cross-Layer Attention Aggregation for Accelerating LLM Prefill
**Authors**: Bradley McDanel, Steven Li, Harshit Khaitan

**Updated**: 2026-02-17T22:08:16Z

**Summary**: The prefill stage in long-context LLM inference remains a computational bottleneck. Recent token-ranking heuristics accelerate inference by selectively processing a subset of semantically relevant tokens. However, existing methods suffer from unstable token importance estimation, often varying between layers. Evaluating token-ranking quality independently from heuristic-specific architectures is challenging. To address this, we introduce an Answer-Informed Oracle, which defines ground-truth token importance by measuring attention from generated answers back to the prompt. This oracle reveals that existing heuristics exhibit high variance across layers: rankings can degrade sharply at specific layers, a failure mode invisible to end-to-end benchmarks. The diagnosis suggests a simple fix: aggregate scores across layers rather than relying on any single one. We implement this as Cross-Layer Attention Aggregation (CLAA), which closes the gap to the oracle upper bound and reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 39\% compared to the Full KV Cache baseline.

### Mobility-Aware Cache Framework for Scalable LLM-Based Human Mobility Simulation
**Authors**: Hua Yan, Heng Tan, Yingxue Zhang, Yu Yang

**Updated**: 2026-02-17T15:39:51Z

**Summary**: Large-scale human mobility simulation is critical for applications such as urban planning, epidemiology, and transportation analysis. Recent works treat large language models (LLMs) as human agents to simulate realistic mobility behaviors using structured reasoning, but their high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we design a mobility-aware cache framework named MobCache that leverages reconstructible caches to enable efficient large-scale human mobility simulations. It consists of: (1) a reasoning component that encodes each reasoning step as a latent-space embedding and uses a latent-space evaluator to enable the reuse and recombination of reasoning steps; and (2) a decoding component that employs a lightweight decoder trained with mobility law-constrained distillation to translate latent-space reasoning chains into natural language, thereby improving simulation efficiency while maintaining fidelity. Experiments show that MobCache significantly improves efficiency across multiple dimensions while maintaining performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based methods.

### Aeon: High-Performance Neuro-Symbolic Memory Management for Long-Horizon LLM Agents
**Authors**: Mustafa Arslan

**Updated**: 2026-02-17T15:21:45Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are fundamentally constrained by the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the "Lost in the Middle" phenomenon, where reasoning capabilities degrade as context windows expand. Existing solutions, primarily "Flat RAG" architectures relying on vector databases, treat memory as an unstructured bag of embeddings, failing to capture the hierarchical and temporal structure of long-horizon interactions. This paper presents Aeon, a Neuro-Symbolic Cognitive Operating System that redefines memory as a managed OS resource. Aeon structures memory into a Memory Palace (a spatial index implemented via Atlas, a SIMD-accelerated Page-Clustered Vector Index) and a Trace (a neuro-symbolic episodic graph). This architecture introduces three advances: (1) Symmetric INT8 Scalar Quantization, achieving 3.1x spatial compression and 5.6x math acceleration via NEON SDOT intrinsics; (2) a decoupled Write-Ahead Log (WAL) ensuring crash-recoverability with statistically negligible overhead (<1%); and (3) a Sidecar Blob Arena eliminating the prior 440-character text ceiling via an append-only mmap-backed blob file with generational garbage collection. The Semantic Lookaside Buffer (SLB) exploits conversational locality to achieve sub-5us retrieval latencies, with INT8 vectors dequantized to FP32 on cache insertion to preserve L1-resident lookup performance. Benchmarks on Apple M4 Max demonstrate that the combined architecture achieves 4.70ns INT8 dot product latency, 3.09us tree traversal at 100K nodes (3.4x over FP32), and P99 read latency of 750ns under hostile 16-thread contention via epoch-based reclamation.

### Intermittent Semi-Working Mask: A New Masking Paradigm for LLMs
**Authors**: HaoYuan Hu, Mingcong Lu, Di Luo, XinYa Wu, Jiangcai Zhu, Taoye Yin, Zheng Li, Hao Wang, Shusheng Zhang, KeZun Zhang, KaiLai Shao, Chao Chen, Feng Wang

**Updated**: 2026-02-17T13:11:05Z

**Summary**: Multi-turn dialogues and context-intensive tasks challenge Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate long histories without sacrificing generation quality. Although prefix LLMs can better exploit historical context via bidirectional attention on prefix tokens, they are rarely used in practice because multi-turn training requires many duplicated triplets, and its bidirectional prefix prevents KV-cache reuse at inference time, driving up high cost and latency. To retain the contextual understanding of prefix mask while preserving the inference-time efficiency of causal mask, we introduce Intermittent Semi-working Mask (ISM), a masking scheme that injects sparse bidirectional attention into the causal backbone. ISM alternates bidirectional attention over query segments with unidirectional attention over answer segments, enabling the synthesis of in-context while preserving global causality. This design eliminates triplet expansion during training and maintains KV-cache reuse during inference, yielding latency comparable to standard causal LLMs. ISM is architecture-agnostic and parameter-free, adding only minimal latency. Across extensive evaluations, ISM outperforms causal baselines not only on multi-turn dialogue, but also on context-intensive tasks like mathematical reasoning.

### A LoD of Gaussians: Unified Training and Rendering for Ultra-Large Scale Reconstruction with External Memory
**Authors**: Felix Windisch, Thomas Köhler, Lukas Radl, Mattia D'Urso, Michael Steiner, Dieter Schmalstieg, Markus Steinberger

**Updated**: 2026-02-17T12:40:07Z

**Summary**: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a high-performance technique for novel view synthesis, enabling real-time rendering and high-quality reconstruction of small scenes. However, scaling to larger environments has so far relied on partitioning the scene into chunks -- a strategy that introduces artifacts at chunk boundaries, complicates training across varying scales, and is poorly suited to unstructured scenarios such as city-scale flyovers combined with street-level views. Moreover, rendering remains fundamentally limited by GPU memory, as all visible chunks must reside in VRAM simultaneously. We introduce A LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale Gaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU -- without partitioning. Our method stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a Level-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the relevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with Sequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a lightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to support real-time streaming and rendering. Together, these innovations enable seamless multi-scale reconstruction and interactive visualization of complex scenes -- from broad aerial views to fine-grained ground-level details.

### Out of the Memory Barrier: A Highly Memory Efficient Training System for LLMs with Million-Token Contexts
**Authors**: Wenhao Li, Daohai Yu, Gen Luo, Yuxin Zhang, Fei Chao, Rongrong Ji, Yifan Wu, Jiaxin Liu, Ziyang Gong, Zimu Liao

**Updated**: 2026-02-17T11:41:00Z

**Summary**: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) on long contexts is severely constrained by prohibitive GPU memory overhead, not training time. The primary culprits are the activations, whose memory footprints scale linearly with sequence length. We introduce OOMB, a highly memory-efficient training system that directly confronts this barrier. Our approach employs a chunk-recurrent training framework with on-the-fly activation recomputation, which maintains a constant activation memory footprint (O(1)) and shifts the primary bottleneck to the growing KV cache. To manage the KV cache, OOMB integrates a suite of synergistic optimizations: a paged memory manager for both the KV cache and its gradients to eliminate fragmentation, asynchronous CPU offloading to hide data transfer latency, and page-level sparse attention to reduce both computational complexity and communication overhead. The synergy of these techniques yields exceptional efficiency. Our empirical results show that for every additional 10K tokens of context, the end-to-end training memory overhead increases by a mere 10MB for Qwen2.5-7B. This allows training Qwen2.5-7B with a 4M-token context on a single H200 GPU, a feat that would otherwise require a large cluster using context parallelism. This work represents a substantial advance in resource efficiency for long-context LLM training. The source code is available at https://github.com/wenhaoli-xmu/OOMB.

### Qronos: Correcting the Past by Shaping the Future... in Post-Training Quantization
**Authors**: Shihao Zhang, Haoyu Zhang, Ian Colbert, Rayan Saab

**Updated**: 2026-02-17T05:04:13Z

**Summary**: We introduce Qronos -- a new state-of-the-art post-training quantization algorithm that sequentially rounds and updates neural network weights. Qronos not only explicitly corrects errors due to both weight and activation quantization, but also errors resulting from quantizing previous layers. Our iterative algorithm is based on an interpretable and disciplined optimization framework that subsumes and surpasses existing data-driven approaches. At each step, Qronos alternates between error correction and diffusion via optimal update rules. Importantly, we prove that Qronos admits an efficient implementation that uses the Cholesky decomposition for solving least-squares problems. We also demonstrate that Qronos is compatible with existing transformation techniques such as Hadamard-based incoherence processing and weight-activation scaling equalization, among others. We evaluate Qronos using recent autoregressive language generation models in the Llama3 family; Qronos consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art adaptive rounding methods when quantizing the weights, activations, and/or KV caches.

### Sparrow: Text-Anchored Window Attention with Visual-Semantic Glimpsing for Speculative Decoding in Video LLMs
**Authors**: Libo Zhang, Zhaoning Zhang, Wangyang Hong, Peng Qiao, Dongsheng Li

**Updated**: 2026-02-17T02:51:36Z

**Summary**: Although speculative decoding is widely used to accelerate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) inference, it faces severe performance collapse when applied to Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs). The draft model typically falls into the trap of attention dilution and negative visual gain due to key-value cache explosion and context window mismatches. We observe a visual semantic internalization phenomenon in Vid-LLMs, indicating that critical visual semantics are implicitly encoded into text hidden states during deep-layer interactions, which renders raw visual inputs structurally redundant during deep inference. To address this, we propose the Sparrow framework, which first utilizes visually-aware text-anchored window attention via hidden state reuse to fully offload visual computation to the target model, and leverages intermediate-layer visual state bridging to train the draft model with semantic-rich intermediate states, thereby filtering out low-level visual noise. Additionally, a multi-token prediction strategy is introduced to bridge the training-inference distribution shift. Experiments show that Sparrow achieves an average speedup of 2.82x even with 25k visual tokens, effectively resolving the performance degradation in long sequences and offering a practical solution for real-time long video tasks.

### Query as Anchor: Scenario-Adaptive User Representation via Large Language Model
**Authors**: Jiahao Yuan, Yike Xu, Jinyong Wen, Baokun Wang, Ziyi Gao, Xiaotong Lin, Yun Liu, Xing Fu, Yu Cheng, Yongchao Liu, Weiqiang Wang, Zhongle Xie

**Updated**: 2026-02-17T02:44:08Z

**Summary**: Industrial-scale user representation learning requires balancing robust universality with acute task-sensitivity. However, existing paradigms primarily yield static, task-agnostic embeddings that struggle to reconcile the divergent requirements of downstream scenarios within unified vector spaces. Furthermore, heterogeneous multi-source data introduces inherent noise and modality conflicts, degrading representation. We propose Query-as-Anchor, a framework shifting user modeling from static encoding to dynamic, query-aware synthesis. To empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with deep user understanding, we first construct UserU, an industrial-scale pre-training dataset that aligns multi-modal behavioral sequences with user understanding semantics, and our Q-Anchor Embedding architecture integrates hierarchical coarse-to-fine encoders into dual-tower LLMs via joint contrastive-autoregressive optimization for query-aware user representation. To bridge the gap between general pre-training and specialized business logic, we further introduce Cluster-based Soft Prompt Tuning to enforce discriminative latent structures, effectively aligning model attention with scenario-specific modalities. For deployment, anchoring queries at sequence termini enables KV-cache-accelerated inference with negligible incremental latency. Evaluations on 10 Alipay industrial benchmarks show consistent SOTA performance, strong scalability, and efficient deployment. Large-scale online A/B testing in Alipay's production system across two real-world scenarios further validates its practical effectiveness. Our code is prepared for public release and will be available at: https://github.com/JhCircle/Q-Anchor.

### Grappa: Gradient-Only Communication for Scalable Graph Neural Network Training
**Authors**: Chongyang Xu, Christoph Siebenbrunner, Laurent Bindschaedler

**Updated**: 2026-02-16T21:24:43Z

**Summary**: Cross-partition edges dominate the cost of distributed GNN training: fetching remote features and activations per iteration overwhelms the network as graphs deepen and partition counts grow. Grappa is a distributed GNN training framework that enforces gradient-only communication: during each iteration, partitions train in isolation and exchange only gradients for the global update. To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We present an asymptotically unbiased estimator for gradient correction, which we use to develop a minimum-distance batch-level variant that is compatible with common deep-learning packages. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4x faster on average (up to 13x) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware. Grappa is model-agnostic, supports full-graph and mini-batch training, and does not rely on high-bandwidth interconnects or caching.

### Joint Majorization-Minimization for Nonnegative CP and Tucker Decompositions under $β$-Divergences: Unfolding-Free Updates
**Authors**: Valentin Leplat

**Updated**: 2026-02-16T12:16:01Z

**Summary**: We study majorization-minimization methods for nonnegative tensor decompositions under the $β$-divergence family, focusing on nonnegative CP and Tucker models. Our aim is to avoid explicit mode unfoldings and large auxiliary matrices by deriving separable surrogates whose multiplicative updates can be implemented using only tensor contractions (einsum-style operations). We present both classical block-MM updates in contraction-only form and a joint majorization strategy, inspired by joint MM for matrix $β$-NMF, that reuses cached reference quantities across inexpensive inner updates. We prove tightness of the proposed majorizers, establish monotonic decrease of the objective, and show convergence of the sequence of objective values; we also discuss how BSUM theory applies to the block-MM scheme for analyzing limit points. Finally, experiments on synthetic tensors and the Uber spatiotemporal count tensor demonstrate substantial speedups over unfolding-based baselines and a recent einsum-factorization framework.

### EmoLoom-2B: Fast Base-Model Screening for Emotion Classification and VAD with Lexicon-Weak Supervision and KV-Off Evaluation
**Authors**: Zilin Li, Weiwei Xu, Xuanbo Lu, Zheda Liu

**Updated**: 2026-02-16T10:23:22Z

**Summary**: We introduce EmoLoom-2B, a lightweight and reproducible pipeline that turns small language models under 2B parameters into fast screening candidates for joint emotion classification and Valence-Arousal-Dominance prediction. To ensure protocol-faithful and fair evaluation, we unify data loading, training, and inference under a single JSON input-output contract and remove avoidable variance by adopting KV-off decoding as the default setting. We incorporate two orthogonal semantic regularizers: a VAD-preserving constraint that aligns generated text with target VAD triples, and a lightweight external appraisal classifier that provides training-time guidance on goal attainment, controllability, certainty, and fairness without injecting long rationales. To improve polarity sensitivity, we introduce Valence Flip augmentation based on mirrored emotional pairs. During supervised fine-tuning, we apply A/B mixture sampling with entropy-aware temperature scheduling to balance coverage and convergence. Using Qwen-1.8B-Chat as the base model, EmoLoom-2B achieves strong performance on GoEmotions and EmpatheticDialogues, and demonstrates robust cross-corpus generalization on DailyDialog. The proposed recipe is budget-aware, auditable, and re-entrant, serving as a dependable screening pass before heavier training or multimodal fusion.

### Understanding GPU Resource Interference One Level Deeper
**Authors**: Paul Elvinger, Foteini Strati, Natalie Enright Jerger, Ana Klimovic

**Updated**: 2026-02-16T09:26:53Z

**Summary**: GPUs are vastly underutilized, even when running resource-intensive AI applications, as GPU kernels within each job have diverse resource profiles that may saturate some parts of a device while often leaving other parts idle. Colocating applications is known to improve GPU utilization, but is not common practice as it becomes difficult to provide predictable performance due to workload interference. Providing predictable performance guarantees requires a deep understanding of how applications contend for shared GPU resources such as block schedulers, compute units, L1/L2 caches, and memory bandwidth. We study the key types of GPU resource interference and develop a methodology to quantify the sensitivity of a workload to each type. We discuss how this methodology can serve as the foundation for GPU schedulers that enforce strict performance guarantees and how application developers can design GPU kernels with colocation in mind to improve efficiency.

### d$^2$Cache: Accelerating Diffusion-Based LLMs via Dual Adaptive Caching
**Authors**: Yuchu Jiang, Yue Cai, Xiangzhong Luo, Jiale Fu, Jiarui Wang, Chonghan Liu, Xu Yang

**Updated**: 2026-02-16T06:46:00Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), despite their promising performance, still suffer from inferior inference efficiency. This is because dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention and cannot directly benefit from the standard key-value (KV) cache as autoregressive models (ARMs) do. To tackle this issue, we introduce \textit{Dual aDaptive Cache} (d$^2$Cache), which is a training-free approximate KV cache framework for accelerating dLLM inference. d$^2$Cache features a two-stage fine-grained selection strategy to identify tokens and adaptively update their KV states at each decoding step, while caching the KV states of the remaining tokens for reuse. Furthermore, d$^2$Cache naturally offers a more reliable decoding alternative, which can enable quasi left-to-right generation and mitigate premature overconfidence in tokens at the end of the sequence. Extensive experimental results on two representative dLLMs (\ie, LLaDA and Dream) demonstrate that d$^2$Cache not only achieves substantial inference speedups, but also yields consistent improvements in generation quality. The code is available at https://github.com/Kamichanw/d2Cache.

### FastKV: Decoupling of Context Reduction and KV Cache Compression for Prefill-Decoding Acceleration
**Authors**: Dongwon Jo, Jiwon Song, Yulhwa Kim, Jae-Joon Kim

**Updated**: 2026-02-16T06:37:44Z

**Summary**: While large language models (LLMs) excel at handling long-context sequences, they require substantial prefill computation and key-value (KV) cache, which can heavily burden computational efficiency and memory usage in both prefill and decoding stages. Recent works that compress KV caches with prefill acceleration reduce this cost but inadvertently tie the prefill compute reduction to the decoding KV budget. This coupling arises from overlooking the layer-dependent variation of critical context, often leading to accuracy degradation. To address this issue, we introduce FastKV, a KV cache compression framework designed to reduce latency in both prefill and decoding by leveraging the stabilization of token importance in later layers. FastKV performs full-context computation until a Token-Selective Propagation (TSP) layer, which forwards only the most informative tokens to subsequent layers. From these propagated tokens, FastKV independently selects salient KV entries for caching, thereby decoupling KV budget from the prefill compute reduction based on the TSP decision. This independent control of the TSP rate and KV retention rate enables flexible optimization of efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results show that FastKV achieves speedups of up to 1.82$\times$ in prefill and 2.87$\times$ in decoding compared to the full-context baseline, while matching the accuracy of the baselines that only accelerate the decoding stage. Our code is available at https://github.com/dongwonjo/FastKV.

### Adapting VACE for Real-Time Autoregressive Video Diffusion
**Authors**: Ryan Fosdick

**Updated**: 2026-02-16T01:13:33Z

**Summary**: We describe an adaptation of VACE (Video All-in-one Creation and Editing) for real-time autoregressive video generation. VACE provides unified video control (reference guidance, structural conditioning, inpainting, and temporal extension) but assumes bidirectional attention over full sequences, making it incompatible with streaming pipelines that require fixed chunk sizes and causal attention. The key modification moves reference frames from the diffusion latent space into a parallel conditioning pathway, preserving the fixed chunk sizes and KV caching that autoregressive models require. This adaptation reuses existing pretrained VACE weights without additional training. Across 1.3B and 14B model scales, VACE adds 20-30% latency overhead for structural control and inpainting, with negligible VRAM cost relative to the base model. Reference-to-video fidelity is severely degraded compared to batch VACE due to causal attention constraints. A reference implementation is available at https://github.com/daydreamlive/scope.

### Batch Speculative Decoding Done Right
**Authors**: Ranran Haoran Zhang, Soumik Dey, Ashirbad Mishra, Hansi Wu, Binbin Li, Rui Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-02-15T22:53:25Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding must produce outputs distribution identical to standard autoregressive generation-this output equivalence is not an optimization target but the defining criterion of valid speculative decoding. We demonstrate that all existing batch speculative decoding implementations violate this fundamental requirement, producing corrupted outputs ranging from repetitive tokens to gibberish. These failures stem from the ragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of draft tokens, desynchronizing position IDs, attention masks, and KV-cache state. We present the first authentic batch speculative decoding framework. We (1) formalize the synchronization invariants that valid batch speculative decoding must satisfy, (2) present EQSPEC, the first algorithm that guarantees output equivalence, and analyze its cost structure to show that alignment overhead grows superlinearly and consumes up to 40\% of computation, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which reduces this overhead through cross-batch scheduling that dynamically groups same-length sequences. On SpecBench across Vicuna-7B/68M, Qwen3-8B/0.6B, and GLM-4-9B/0.6B pairs, our methods achieve up to 3x throughput improvement at batch size 8 while maintaining algorithmic correctness. Our methods achieve 95\% decoding-equivalence, with residual divergence attributable to floating-point non-determinism in GPU inference, not the synchronization failures that cause near-zero equivalence of prior methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/eBay/spec_dec.

### Dual-Signal Adaptive KV-Cache Optimization for Long-Form Video Understanding in Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Vishnu Sai, Dheeraj Sai, Srinath B, Girish Varma, Priyesh Shukla

**Updated**: 2026-02-15T17:06:02Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a critical memory bottleneck when processing long-form video content due to the linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache with sequence length. Existing solutions predominantly employ reactive eviction strategies that compute full attention matrices before discarding tokens, resulting in substantial computational waste. We propose Sali-Cache, a novel a priori optimization framework that implements dual-signal adaptive caching through proactive memory management. By integrating a temporal filter based on optical flow analysis for detecting inter-frame redundancy and a spatial filter leveraging saliency detection for identifying visually significant regions, Sali-Cache intelligently manages memory allocation before entering computationally expensive attention operations. Experimental evaluation on the LLaVA 1.6 architecture demonstrates that our method achieves a 2.20x compression ratio in effective memory usage while maintaining 100% accuracy across BLEU, ROUGE-L, and Exact Match metrics. Furthermore, under identical memory budget constraints, Sali-Cache preserves context-rich features over extended temporal durations without degrading model performance, enabling efficient processing of long-form video content on consumer-grade hardware.

### MAGE: All-[MASK] Block Already Knows Where to Look in Diffusion LLM
**Authors**: Omin Kwon, Yeonjae Kim, Doyeon Kim, Minseo Kim, Yeonhong Park, Jae W. Lee

**Updated**: 2026-02-15T16:07:51Z

**Summary**: Block diffusion LLMs are emerging as a promising next paradigm for language generation, but their use of KV caching makes memory access a dominant bottleneck in long-context settings. While dynamic sparse attention has been actively explored, existing methods designed for autoregressive LLMs rely on approximate importance estimation and perform poorly when adapted to block diffusion. This work identifies a key opportunity unique to block diffusion: attention at the first All-[MASK] denoising step reliably predicts important KV entries and budget requirements, enabling MAGE to perform a single exact attention pass per block and reuse it for training-free sparse denoising. Across long-context benchmarks including LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack, MAGE achieves near-lossless accuracy with a fraction of the KV budget while delivering up to 3-4x end-to-end speedup, consistently outperforming AR-oriented sparse attention baselines. A lightweight fine-tuning strategy further strengthens [MASK]-guided patterns with minimal cost, requiring only a few hours of training on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU for both 1.5B and 7B models.

### Index Light, Reason Deep: Deferred Visual Ingestion for Visual-Dense Document Question Answering
**Authors**: Tao Xu

**Updated**: 2026-02-15T14:23:50Z

**Summary**: Existing multimodal document question answering methods universally adopt a supply-side ingestion strategy: running a Vision-Language Model (VLM) on every page during indexing to generate comprehensive descriptions, then answering questions through text retrieval. However, this "pre-ingestion" approach is costly (a 113-page engineering drawing package requires approximately 80,000 VLM tokens), end-to-end unreliable (VLM outputs may fail to be correctly retrieved due to format mismatches in the retrieval infrastructure), and irrecoverable once it fails. This paper proposes the Deferred Visual Ingestion (DVI) framework, adopting a demand-side ingestion strategy: the indexing phase performs only lightweight metadata extraction, deferring visual understanding to the moment users pose specific questions. DVI's core principle is "Index for locating, not understanding"--achieving page localization through structured metadata indexes and BM25 full-text search, then sending original images along with specific questions to a VLM for targeted analysis. Experiments on two real industrial engineering drawings (113 pages + 7 pages) demonstrate that DVI achieves comparable overall accuracy at zero ingestion VLM cost (46.7% vs. 48.9%), an effectiveness rate of 50% on visually necessary queries (vs. 0% for pre-ingestion), and 100% page localization (98% search space compression). DVI also supports interactive refinement and progressive caching, transforming the "QA accuracy" problem into a "page localization" problem--once the correct drawing page is found, obtaining the answer becomes a matter of interaction rounds.

### Elastic Diffusion Transformer
**Authors**: Jiangshan Wang, Zeqiang Lai, Jiarui Chen, Jiayi Guo, Hang Guo, Xiu Li, Xiangyu Yue, Chunchao Guo

**Updated**: 2026-02-15T05:19:17Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities but remain highly computationally expensive. Previous acceleration methods, such as pruning and distillation, typically rely on a fixed computational capacity, leading to insufficient acceleration and degraded generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{Elastic Diffusion Transformer (E-DiT)}, an adaptive acceleration framework for DiT that effectively improves efficiency while maintaining generation quality. Specifically, we observe that the generative process of DiT exhibits substantial sparsity (i.e., some computations can be skipped with minimal impact on quality), and this sparsity varies significantly across samples. Motivated by this observation, E-DiT equips each DiT block with a lightweight router that dynamically identifies sample-dependent sparsity from the input latent. Each router adaptively determines whether the corresponding block can be skipped. If the block is not skipped, the router then predicts the optimal MLP width reduction ratio within the block. During inference, we further introduce a block-level feature caching mechanism that leverages router predictions to eliminate redundant computations in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments across 2D image (Qwen-Image and FLUX) and 3D asset (Hunyuan3D-3.0) demonstrate the effectiveness of E-DiT, achieving up to $\sim$2$\times$ speedup with negligible loss in generation quality. Code will be available at https://github.com/wangjiangshan0725/Elastic-DiT.

**Authors**: Hao Kang, Ziyang Li, Xinyu Yang, Weili Xu, Yinfang Chen, Junxiong Wang, Beidi Chen, Tushar Krishna, Chenfeng Xu, Simran Arora

**Updated**: 2026-02-14T09:26:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models(LLMs) are now used to power complex multi-turn agentic workflows. Existing systems run agentic inference by loosely assembling isolated components: an LLM inference engine (e.g., vLLM) and a tool orchestrator (e.g., Kubernetes). Although agentic workflows involve multiple LLM and tool requests, these systems schedule and allocate resources separately on a per-request basis, without end-to-end knowledge of the workflow. This leads to sub-optimal management of KV cache and tool execution environments. To address the challenges, we propose ThunderAgent, a fast, simple, and program-aware agentic inference system. We first abstract agentic workflows as LLM Programs, enabling a unified view of heterogeneous resources, including KV caches, system states, and external tool assets such as disk memory and network ports. Built upon this abstraction, ThunderAgent introduces a program-aware scheduler and a tool resource manager designed to maximize KV cache hit rates, mitigate memory imbalances, and enable asynchronous environment preparation. Evaluations across coding, routing, and scientific discovery agents demonstrate that ThunderAgent achieves 1.5-3.6x throughput improvements in serving, 1.8-3.9x in RL rollout, and up to 4.2x disk memory savings compared to state-of-the-art inference systems. To facilitate reproducibility and support future development, we open-source the system implementations of the whole ThunderAgent at: https://github.com/Agentic-Kinetics/ThunderAgent.

### Resource-Efficient Personal Large Language Models Fine-Tuning with Collaborative Edge Computing
**Authors**: Shengyuan Ye, Bei Ouyang, Tianyi Qian, Liekang Zeng, Jingyi Li, Jiangsu Du, Xiaowen Chu, Guoliang Xing, Xu Chen

**Updated**: 2026-02-14T07:14:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a plethora of powerful applications at the network edge, such as intelligent personal assistants. Data privacy and security concerns have prompted a shift towards edge-based fine-tuning of personal LLMs, away from cloud reliance. However, this raises issues of computational intensity and resource scarcity, hindering training efficiency and feasibility. While current studies investigate parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to mitigate resource constraints, our analysis indicates that these techniques are not sufficiently resource-efficient for edge devices. To tackle these challenges, we propose Pluto and Charon (PAC), a time and memory efficient collaborative edge AI framework for personal LLMs fine-tuning. PAC breaks the resource wall of personal LLMs fine-tuning with a sophisticated algorithm-system co-design. (1) Algorithmically, PAC implements a personal LLMs fine-tuning technique that is efficient in terms of parameters, time, and memory. It utilizes Parallel Adapters to circumvent the need for a full backward pass through the LLM backbone. Additionally, an activation cache mechanism further streamlining the process by negating the necessity for repeated forward passes across multiple epochs. (2) Systematically, PAC leverages edge devices in close proximity, pooling them as a collective resource for in-situ personal LLMs fine-tuning, utilizing a hybrid data and pipeline parallelism to orchestrate distributed training. The use of the activation cache eliminates the need for forward pass through the LLM backbone,enabling exclusive fine-tuning of the Parallel Adapters using data parallelism. Extensive evaluation based on prototype implementation demonstrates that PAC remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 8.64x end-to-end speedup and up to 88.16% reduction in memory footprint.

### KVCache Cache in the Wild: Characterizing and Optimizing KVCache Cache at a Large Cloud Provider
**Authors**: Jiahao Wang, Jinbo Han, Xingda Wei, Sijie Shen, Dingyan Zhang, Chenguang Fang, Rong Chen, Wenyuan Yu, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2026-02-14T05:32:46Z

**Summary**: Serving large language models (LLMs) is important for cloud providers, and caching intermediate results (KV\$) after processing each request substantially improves serving throughput and latency. However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV\$ caching, where system design decisions like cache eviction policies are highly workload-dependent. In this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV\$ workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic workloads, including: KV\$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

### Efficient Long-Horizon Vision-Language-Action Models via Static-Dynamic Disentanglement
**Authors**: Weikang Qiu, Tinglin Huang, Rex Ying

**Updated**: 2026-02-14T03:09:51Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for generalist robotic control. Built upon vision-language model (VLM) architectures, VLAs predict actions conditioned on visual observations and language instructions, achieving strong performance and generalization across tasks. However, VLAs face two major challenges: limited long-horizon context and inefficient inference due to the quadratic attention complexity and large parameter counts. Our work is motivated by the observation that much of the visual information in a trajectory remains static across timesteps (e.g., the background). Leveraging this property, we propose SD-VLA, a framework that disentangles visual inputs into multi-level static and dynamic tokens, which enables (1) retaining a single copy of static tokens across frames to significantly reduce context length, and (2) reusing the key-value (KV) cache of static tokens through a lightweight recache gate that updates only when necessary. This design enables efficient multi-frame integration and efficient inference. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark that more effectively evaluates the long-horizon temporal dependency modeling ability of VLAs. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms baselines on this benchmark by 39.8% absolute improvement in success rate, and achieves a 3.9% gain on the SimplerEnv benchmark. Moreover, SD-VLA delivers a 2.26x inference speedup over the base VLA model on the same benchmark, enabling faster and more practical real-world deployment.

### Autoregressive Image Generation with Randomized Parallel Decoding
**Authors**: Haopeng Li, Jinyue Yang, Guoqi Li, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2026-02-14T02:23:24Z

**Summary**: We introduce ARPG, a novel visual autoregressive model that enables randomized parallel generation, addressing the inherent limitations of conventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and zero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation order. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates explicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To this end, we propose a novel decoupled decoding framework that decouples positional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as queries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the causal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training and generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently, ARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot inference tasks such as image inpainting, outpainting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel inference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache. On the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.83 with only 32 sampling steps, achieving over a 30 times speedup in inference and a 75 percent reduction in memory consumption compared to representative recent autoregressive models at a similar scale.

### ORAP: Optimized Row Access Prefetching for Rowhammer-mitigated Memory
**Authors**: Maccoy Merrell, Daniel Puckett, Gino Chacon, Jeffrey Stuecheli, Stavros Kalafatis, Paul V. Gratz

**Updated**: 2026-02-13T20:22:44Z

**Summary**: Rowhammer is a well-studied DRAM phenomenon wherein multiple activations to a given row can cause bit flips in adjacent rows. Many mitigation techniques have been introduced to address Rowhammer, with some support being incorporated into the JEDEC DDR5 standard for per-row-activation-counter (PRAC) and refresh-management (RFM) systems. Mitigation schemes built on these mechanisms claim to have various levels of area, power, and performance overheads. To date the evaluation of existing mitigation schemes typically neglects the impact of other memory system components such as hardware prefetchers. Nearly all modern systems incorporate hardware prefetching and these can significantly improve processor performance through speculative cache population. These prefetchers induce higher numbers of downstream memory requests and increase DRAM activation rates. The performance overhead of Rowhammer mitigations are tied directly to memory access patterns, exposing both hardware prefetchers and Rowhammer mitigations to cross-interaction. We find that the performance improvement provided by prior-work hardware prefetchers is often severely impacted by Rowhammer mitigations. In effect, much of the benefit of speculative memory references from prefetching lies in accelerating and reordering DRAM references in ways that trigger mitigations, significantly reducing the benefits of prefetching. This work proposes the Optimized Row Access Prefetcher (ORAP), leveraging last-level-cache (LLC) space to cache large portions of DRAM rowbuffer contents to reduce the need for future activations. Working with the state-of-the-art Berti prefetcher, ORAP reduces DRAM activation rates by 51.3% and achieves a 4.6% speedup over the prefetcher configuration of Berti and SPP-PPF when prefetching in an RFM-mitigated memory system. Under PRAC mitigations, ORAP reduces energy overheads by 11.8%.

### LongStream: Long-Sequence Streaming Autoregressive Visual Geometry
**Authors**: Chong Cheng, Xianda Chen, Tao Xie, Wei Yin, Weiqiang Ren, Qian Zhang, Xiaoyuang Guo, Hao Wang

**Updated**: 2026-02-13T18:30:51Z

**Summary**: Long-sequence streaming 3D reconstruction remains a significant open challenge. Existing autoregressive models often fail when processing long sequences. They typically anchor poses to the first frame, which leads to attention decay, scale drift, and extrapolation errors. We introduce LongStream, a novel gauge-decoupled streaming visual geometry model for metric-scale scene reconstruction across thousands of frames. Our approach is threefold. First, we discard the first-frame anchor and predict keyframe-relative poses. This reformulates long-range extrapolation into a constant-difficulty local task. Second, we introduce orthogonal scale learning. This method fully disentangles geometry from scale estimation to suppress drift. Finally, we solve Transformer cache issues such as attention-sink reliance and long-term KV-cache contamination. We propose cache-consistent training combined with periodic cache refresh. This approach suppresses attention degradation over ultra-long sequences and reduces the gap between training and inference. Experiments show LongStream achieves state-of-the-art performance. It delivers stable, metric-scale reconstruction over kilometer-scale sequences at 18 FPS. Project Page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/longstream/

### Asynchronous Verified Semantic Caching for Tiered LLM Architectures
**Authors**: Asmit Kumar Singh, Haozhe Wang, Laxmi Naga Santosh Attaluri, Tak Chiam, Weihua Zhu

**Updated**: 2026-02-13T18:25:00Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) now sit in the critical path of search, assistance, and agentic workflows, making semantic caching essential for reducing inference cost and latency. Production deployments typically use a tiered static-dynamic design: a static cache of curated, offline vetted responses mined from logs, backed by a dynamic cache populated online. In practice, both tiers are commonly governed by a single embedding similarity threshold, which induces a hard tradeoff: conservative thresholds miss safe reuse opportunities, while aggressive thresholds risk serving semantically incorrect responses. We introduce \textbf{Krites}, an asynchronous, LLM-judged caching policy that expands static coverage without changing serving decisions. On the critical path, Krites behaves exactly like a standard static threshold policy. When the nearest static neighbor of the prompt falls just below the static threshold, Krites asynchronously invokes an LLM judge to verify whether the static response is acceptable for the new prompt. Approved matches are promoted into the dynamic cache, allowing future repeats and paraphrases to reuse curated static answers and expanding static reach over time. In trace-driven simulations on conversational and search workloads, Krites increases the fraction of requests served with curated static answers (direct static hits plus verified promotions) by up to $\textbf{3.9}$ times for conversational traffic and search-style queries relative to tuned baselines, with unchanged critical path latency.

### Semantic Caching for Low-Cost LLM Serving: From Offline Learning to Online Adaptation
**Authors**: Xutong Liu, Baran Atalar, Xiangxiang Dai, Jinhang Zuo, Siwei Wang, John C. S. Lui, Wei Chen, Carlee Joe-Wong

**Updated**: 2026-02-13T17:03:20Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing how users interact with information systems, yet their high inference cost poses serious scalability and sustainability challenges. Caching inference responses, allowing them to be retrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one possible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the semantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation. Semantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic similarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem: one must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached responses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities and serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing semantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations and unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a principled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown query and cost distributions. We formulate both offline optimization and online learning variants of the problem, and develop provably efficient algorithms with state-of-the-art guarantees. We also evaluate our framework on a synthetic dataset, showing that our proposed algorithms perform matching or superior performance compared with baselines.

### MeCo: Enhancing LLM-Empowered Multi-Robot Collaboration via Similar Task Memoization
**Authors**: Baiqing Wang, Helei Cui, Bo Zhang, Xiaolong Zheng, Bin Guo, Zhiwen Yu

**Updated**: 2026-02-13T09:56:37Z

**Summary**: Multi-robot systems have been widely deployed in real-world applications, providing significant improvements in efficiency and reductions in labor costs. However, most existing multi-robot collaboration methods rely on extensive task-specific training, which limits their adaptability to new or diverse scenarios. Recent research leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enable more flexible collaboration without specialized training. Yet, current LLM-empowered approaches remain inefficient: when confronted with identical or similar tasks, they must replan from scratch because they omit task-level similarities. To address this limitation, we propose MeCo, a similarity-aware multi-robot collaboration framework that applies the principle of ``cache and reuse'' (a.k.a., memoization) to reduce redundant computation. Unlike simple task repetition, identifying and reusing solutions for similar but not identical tasks is far more challenging, particularly in multi-robot settings. To this end, MeCo introduces a new similarity testing method that retrieves previously solved tasks with high relevance, enabling effective plan reuse without re-invoking LLMs. Furthermore, we present MeCoBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate performance on similar-task collaboration scenarios. Experimental results show that MeCo substantially reduces planning costs and improves success rates compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

### Recurrent Preference Memory for Efficient Long-Sequence Generative Recommendation
**Authors**: Yixiao Chen, Yuan Wang, Yue Liu, Qiyao Wang, Ke Cheng, Xin Xu, Juntong Yan, Shuojin Yang, Menghao Guo, Jun Zhang, Huan Yu, Jie Jiang

**Updated**: 2026-02-13T09:30:22Z

**Summary**: Generative recommendation (GenRec) models typically model user behavior via full attention, but scaling to lifelong sequences is hindered by prohibitive computational costs and noise accumulation from stochastic interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce Rec2PM, a framework that compresses long user interaction histories into compact Preference Memory tokens. Unlike traditional recurrent methods that suffer from serial training, Rec2PM employs a novel self-referential teacher-forcing strategy: it leverages a global view of the history to generate reference memories, which serve as supervision targets for parallelized recurrent updates. This allows for fully parallel training while maintaining the capability for iterative updates during inference. Additionally, by representing memory as token embeddings rather than extensive KV caches, Rec2PM achieves extreme storage efficiency. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks show that Rec2PM significantly reduces inference latency and memory footprint while achieving superior accuracy compared to full-sequence models. Analysis reveals that the Preference Memory functions as a denoising Information Bottleneck, effectively filtering interaction noise to capture robust long-term interests.

### AdaCorrection: Adaptive Offset Cache Correction for Accurate Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Dong Liu, Yanxuan Yu, Ben Lengerich, Ying Nian Wu

**Updated**: 2026-02-13T08:11:54Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity image and video generation but suffer from expensive inference due to their iterative denoising structure. While prior methods accelerate sampling by caching intermediate features, they rely on static reuse schedules or coarse-grained heuristics, which often lead to temporal drift and cache misalignment that significantly degrade generation quality. We introduce \textbf{AdaCorrection}, an adaptive offset cache correction framework that maintains high generation fidelity while enabling efficient cache reuse across Transformer layers during diffusion inference. At each timestep, AdaCorrection estimates cache validity with lightweight spatio-temporal signals and adaptively blends cached and fresh activations. This correction is computed on-the-fly without additional supervision or retraining. Our approach achieves strong generation quality with minimal computational overhead, maintaining near-original FID while providing moderate acceleration. Experiments on image and video diffusion benchmarks show that AdaCorrection consistently improves generation performance.

### Doc-to-LoRA: Learning to Instantly Internalize Contexts
**Authors**: Rujikorn Charakorn, Edoardo Cetin, Shinnosuke Uesaka, Robert Tjarko Lange

**Updated**: 2026-02-13T06:54:20Z

**Summary**: Long input sequences are central to in-context learning, document understanding, and multi-step reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the quadratic attention cost of Transformers makes inference memory-intensive and slow. While context distillation (CD) can transfer information into model parameters, per-prompt distillation is impractical due to training costs and latency. To address these limitations, we propose Doc-to-LoRA (D2L), a lightweight hypernetwork that meta-learns to perform approximate CD within a single forward pass. Given an unseen prompt, D2L generates a LoRA adapter for a target LLM, enabling subsequent queries to be answered without re-consuming the original context, reducing latency and KV-cache memory consumption during inference of the target LLM. On a long-context needle-in-a-haystack task, D2L successfully learns to map contexts into adapters that store the needle information, achieving near-perfect zero-shot accuracy at sequence lengths exceeding the target LLM's native context window by more than 4x. On real-world QA datasets with limited compute, D2L outperforms standard CD while significantly reducing peak memory consumption and update latency. We envision that D2L can facilitate rapid adaptation of LLMs, opening up the possibility of frequent knowledge updates and personalized chat behavior.

**Updated**: 2026-02-13T05:41:31Z

**Summary**: As LLMs scale, low-bit floating-point formats like MXFP and NVFP4 offer new opportunities for precision and efficiency. In this work, we evaluate HiFloat (HiF8 and HiF4), a family of formats tailored for Ascend NPUs. Through rigorous comparison across weight-activation and KV-cache tasks, we provide three key insights: (1) INT8 suits narrow-range data, while floating-point formats excel with high-variance data; (2) in 4-bit regimes, HiF4's hierarchical scaling prevents the accuracy collapse seen in integer formats; and (3) HiFloat is fully compatible with state-of-the-art post-training quantization frameworks. Overall, HiFloat provides a solution for high-efficiency LLM inference on NPUs.

### Vision Token Reduction via Attention-Driven Self-Compression for Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models
**Authors**: Omer Faruk Deniz, Ruiyu Mao, Ruochen Li, Yapeng Tian, Latifur Khan

**Updated**: 2026-02-13T04:49:27Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) incur significant computational cost from processing numerous vision tokens through all LLM layers. Prior pruning methods operate either before the LLM, limiting generality due to diverse encoder-projector designs or within the LLM using heuristics that are incompatible with FlashAttention. We take a different approach: rather than identifying unimportant tokens, we treat the LLM itself as the optimal guide for compression. Observing that deeper layers naturally transmit vision-to-text information, we introduce Attention-Driven Self-Compression (ADSC), a simple, broadly applicable method that progressively reduces vision tokens using only the LLM's attention mechanism. Our method applies uniform token downsampling at selected layers, forming bottlenecks that encourage the model to reorganize and compress information into the remaining tokens. It requires no score computation, auxiliary modules, or attention modification, and remains fully compatible with FlashAttention. Applied to LLaVA-1.5, ADSC reduces FLOPs by 53.7% and peak KV-cache memory by 56.7%, while preserving 98.2% of the original model performance. Across multiple benchmarks, it outperforms prior pruning approaches in both efficiency and accuracy. Crucially, under high compression ratios, our method remains robust while heuristic-based techniques degrade sharply.

### Arcalis: Accelerating Remote Procedure Calls Using a Lightweight Near-Cache Solution
**Authors**: Johnson Umeike, Pongstorn Maidee, Bahar Asgari

**Updated**: 2026-02-13T04:14:42Z

**Summary**: Modern microservices increasingly depend on high-performance remote procedure calls (RPCs) to coordinate fine-grained, distributed computation. As network bandwidths continue to scale, the CPU overhead associated with RPC processing, particularly serialization, deserialization, and protocol handling, has become a critical bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated by fast user-space networking stacks such as DPDK, which expose RPC processing as the dominant performance limiter. While prior work has explored software optimizations and FPGA-based offload engines, these approaches remain physically distant from the CPU's memory hierarchy, incurring unnecessary data movement and cache pollution. We present Arcalis, a near-cache RPC accelerator that positions a lightweight hardware engine adjacent to the last-level cache (LLC). Arcalis offloads RPC processing to dedicated microengines on receive and transmit paths that operate with cache-line latency while preserving programmability. By decoupling RPC processing logic, enabling microservice-specific execution, and positioning itself near the LLC to immediately consume data injected by network cards, Arcalis achieves 1.79-4.16$\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to the CPU baseline, while significantly reducing microarchitectural overhead by up to 88%, and achieves up to a 1.62$\times$ higher throughput than prior solutions. These results highlight the potential of near-cache RPC acceleration as a practical solution for high-performance microservice deployment.

### ProCache: Constraint-Aware Feature Caching with Selective Computation for Diffusion Transformer Acceleration
**Authors**: Fanpu Cao, Yaofo Chen, Zeng You, Wei Luo

**Updated**: 2026-02-13T01:46:03Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling, yet their high computational cost hinders real-time deployment. While feature caching offers a promising training-free acceleration solution by exploiting temporal redundancy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) uniform caching intervals fail to align with the non-uniform temporal dynamics of DiT, and (2) naive feature reuse with excessively large caching intervals can lead to severe error accumulation. In this work, we analyze the evolution of DiT features during denoising and reveal that both feature changes and error propagation are highly time- and depth-varying. Motivated by this, we propose ProCache, a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that addresses these issues via two core components: (i) a constraint-aware caching pattern search module that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling, tailored to the model's temporal characteristics; and (ii) a selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on PixArt-alpha and DiT demonstrate that ProCache achieves up to 1.96x and 2.90x acceleration with negligible quality degradation, significantly outperforming prior caching-based methods.

### Impact of Data-Oriented and Object-Oriented Design on Performance and Cache Utilization with Artificial Intelligence Algorithms in Multi-Threaded CPUs
**Authors**: Gabriel M. Arantes, Giancarlo Lucca, Eduardo N. Borges, Richard F. Pinto, Bruno L. Dalmazo, Rafael A. Berri

**Updated**: 2026-02-13T00:12:14Z

**Summary**: The growing performance gap between multi-core CPUs and main memory necessitates hardware-aware software design paradigms. This study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of Data Oriented Design (DOD) versus the traditional Object-Oriented Design (OOD), focusing on cache utilization and efficiency in multi-threaded environments. We developed and compared four distinct versions of the A* search algorithm: single-threaded OOD (ST-OOD), single-threaded DOD (ST-DOD), multi-threaded OOD (MT-OOD), and multi-threaded DOD (MT-DOD). The evaluation was based on metrics including execution time, memory usage, and CPU cache misses. In multi-threaded tests, the DOD implementation demonstrated considerable performance gains, with faster execution times and a lower number of raw system calls and cache misses. While OOD occasionally showed marginal advantages in memory usage or percentage-based cache miss rates, DOD's efficiency in data-intensive operations was more evident. Furthermore, our findings reveal that for a fine-grained task like the A* algorithm, the overhead associated with thread management led to single-threaded versions significantly outperforming their multi-threaded counterparts in both paradigms. We conclude that even when performance differences appear subtle in simple algorithms, the consistent advantages of DOD in critical metrics highlight its foundational architectural superiority, suggesting it is a more effective approach for maximizing hardware efficiency in complex, large-scale AI and parallel computing tasks.

### CacheMind: From Miss Rates to Why -- Natural-Language, Trace-Grounded Reasoning for Cache Replacement
**Authors**: Kaushal Mhapsekar, Azam Ghanbari, Bita Aslrousta, Samira Mirbagher-Ajorpaz

**Updated**: 2026-02-12T21:28:23Z

**Summary**: Cache replacement remains a challenging problem in CPU microarchitecture, often addressed using hand-crafted heuristics, limiting cache performance. Cache data analysis requires parsing millions of trace entries with manual filtering, making the process slow and non-interactive. To address this, we introduce CacheMind, a conversational tool that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable semantic reasoning over cache traces. Architects can now ask natural language questions like, "Why is the memory access associated with PC X causing more evictions?", and receive trace-grounded, human-readable answers linked to program semantics for the first time. To evaluate CacheMind, we present CacheMindBench, the first verified benchmark suite for LLM-based reasoning for the cache replacement problem. Using the SIEVE retriever, CacheMind achieves 66.67% on 75 unseen trace-grounded questions and 84.80% on 25 unseen policy-specific reasoning tasks; with RANGER, it achieves 89.33% and 64.80% on the same evaluations. Additionally, with RANGER, CacheMind achieves 100% accuracy on 4 out of 6 categories in the trace-grounded tier of CacheMindBench. Compared to LlamaIndex (10% retrieval success), SIEVE achieves 60% and RANGER achieves 90%, demonstrating that existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs) are insufficient for precise, trace-grounded microarchitectural reasoning. We provided four concrete actionable insights derived using CacheMind, wherein bypassing use case improved cache hit rate by 7.66% and speedup by 2.04%, software fix use case gives speedup of 76%, and Mockingjay replacement policy use case gives speedup of 0.7%; showing the utility of CacheMind on non-trivial queries that require a natural-language interface.

### CryptoGen: Secure Transformer Generation with Encrypted KV-Cache Reuse
**Authors**: Hedong Zhang, Neusha Javidnia, Shweta Pardeshi, Qian Lou, Farinaz Koushanfar

**Updated**: 2026-02-12T20:32:18Z

**Summary**: The widespread deployment of cloud-hosted generative models raises a fundamental challenge: enabling efficient autoregressive generation while preserving the privacy of both user prompts and model parameters in untrusted environments. We address this challenge in a client-server setting where an untrusted server hosts an autoregressive Transformer and the client requires cryptographic protection for both inputs and inference. We present CryptoGen, the first system to enable scalable privacy-preserving neural generation with persistent encrypted key-value (KV) cache reuse. Discriminative-task secure inference systems incur quadratic latency and memory growth when adapted to autoregressive decoding due to the lack of native encrypted KV-cache support. In contrast, CryptoGen achieves near-linear scaling by securely reusing and updating encrypted KV caches throughout generation. CryptoGen integrates homomorphic encryption and secret sharing to support both prefilling and generation. Key techniques include a unified encrypted KV-cache framework, heterogeneous SIMD encodings for different phases, optimized cipher-cipher matrix-matrix and matrix-vector operations, and efficient noise refresh and ciphertext concatenation mechanisms. Evaluation on generative Transformer models trained on WikiText-2, PTB, and LAMBADA shows that for input lengths of 128-512 tokens, CryptoGen achieves 4.4x-7.6x lower per-token latency than state-of-the-art discriminative secure inference systems, while maintaining near-linear latency and memory scaling, with advantages increasing for longer sequences. CryptoGen is released as an open-source library.

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:58:30Z

**Summary**: Test-time scaling methods improve the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by increasing the amount of compute used during inference to make a prediction. Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next iteration. Empirically, RSA delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA with Gemini 3 Flash attains performance near the top of the ARC-AGI-2 public leaderboard. RSA also enables Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), outperforming purely parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA. We further propose a novel aggregation-aware reinforcement learning approach that yields significant performance gains by training the model to combine solutions.

### A Time-Varying and Covariate-Dependent Correlation Model for Multivariate Longitudinal Studies
**Authors**: Qingzhi Liu, Gen Li, Anastasia K. Yocum, Melvin McInnis, Brian D. Athey, Veerabhadran Baladandayuthapani

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:55:40Z

**Summary**: In multivariate longitudinal studies, associations between outcomes often exhibit time-varying and individual level heterogeneity, motivating the modeling of correlations as an explicit function of time and covariates. However, most existing methods for correlation analysis fail to simultaneously capture the time-varying and covariate-dependent effects. We propose a Time-Varying and Covariate-Dependent (TiVAC) correlation model that jointly allows covariate effects on correlation to change flexibly and smoothly across time. TiVAC employs a bivariate Gaussian model where the covariate-dependent correlations are modeled semiparametrically using penalized splines. We develop a penalized maximum likelihood-based Newton-Raphson algorithm, and inference on time-varying effects is provided through simultaneous confidence bands. Simulation studies show that TiVAC consistently outperforms existing methods in accurately estimating correlations across a wide range of settings, including binary and continuous covariates, sparse to dense observation schedules, and across diverse correlation trajectory patterns. We apply TiVAC to a psychiatric case study of 291 bipolar I patients, modeling the time-varying correlation between depression and anxiety scores as a function of their clinical variables. Our analyses reveal significant heterogeneity associated with gender and nervous-system medication use, which varies with age, revealing the complex dynamic relationship between depression and anxiety in bipolar disorders.

### Learning from Trials and Errors: Reflective Test-Time Planning for Embodied LLMs
**Authors**: Yining Hong, Huang Huang, Manling Li, Li Fei-Fei, Jiajun Wu, Yejin Choi

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:55:18Z

**Summary**: Embodied LLMs endow robots with high-level task reasoning, but they cannot reflect on what went wrong or why, turning deployment into a sequence of independent trials where mistakes repeat rather than accumulate into experience. Drawing upon human reflective practitioners, we introduce Reflective Test-Time Planning, which integrates two modes of reflection: \textit{reflection-in-action}, where the agent uses test-time scaling to generate and score multiple candidate actions using internal reflections before execution; and \textit{reflection-on-action}, which uses test-time training to update both its internal reflection model and its action policy based on external reflections after execution. We also include retrospective reflection, allowing the agent to re-evaluate earlier decisions and perform model updates with hindsight for proper long-horizon credit assignment. Experiments on our newly-designed Long-Horizon Household benchmark and MuJoCo Cupboard Fitting benchmark show significant gains over baseline models, with ablative studies validating the complementary roles of reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action. Qualitative analyses, including real-robot trials, highlight behavioral correction through reflection.

### On Data Engineering for Scaling LLM Terminal Capabilities
**Authors**: Renjie Pi, Grace Lam, Mohammad Shoeybi, Pooya Jannaty, Bryan Catanzaro, Wei Ping

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:51:04Z

**Summary**: Despite rapid recent progress in the terminal capabilities of large language models, the training data strategies behind state-of-the-art terminal agents remain largely undisclosed. We address this gap through a systematic study of data engineering practices for terminal agents, making two key contributions: (1) Terminal-Task-Gen, a lightweight synthetic task generation pipeline that supports seed-based and skill-based task construction, and (2) a comprehensive analysis of data and training strategies, including filtering, curriculum learning, long context training, and scaling behavior. Our pipeline yields Terminal-Corpus, a large-scale open-source dataset for terminal tasks. Using this dataset, we train Nemotron-Terminal, a family of models initialized from Qwen3(8B, 14B, 32B) that achieve substantial gains on Terminal-Bench 2.0: Nemotron-Terminal-8B improves from 2.5% to 13.0% Nemotron-Terminal-14B improves from 4.0% to 20.2%, and Nemotron-Terminal-32B improves from 3.4% to 27.4%, matching the performance of significantly larger models. To accelerate research in this domain, we open-source our model checkpoints and most of our synthetic datasets at https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-terminal.

### Why Pass@k Optimization Can Degrade Pass@1: Prompt Interference in LLM Post-training
**Authors**: Anas Barakat, Souradip Chakraborty, Khushbu Pahwa, Amrit Singh Bedi

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:43:08Z

**Summary**: Pass@k is a widely used performance metric for verifiable large language model tasks, including mathematical reasoning, code generation, and short-answer reasoning. It defines success if any of $k$ independently sampled solutions passes a verifier. This multi-sample inference metric has motivated inference-aware fine-tuning methods that directly optimize pass@$k$. However, prior work reports a recurring trade-off: pass@k improves while pass@1 degrades under such methods. This trade-off is practically important because pass@1 often remains a hard operational constraint due to latency and cost budgets, imperfect verifier coverage, and the need for a reliable single-shot fallback. We study the origin of this trade-off and provide a theoretical characterization of when pass@k policy optimization can reduce pass@1 through gradient conflict induced by prompt interference. We show that pass@$k$ policy gradients can conflict with pass@1 gradients because pass@$k$ optimization implicitly reweights prompts toward low-success prompts; when these prompts are what we term negatively interfering, their upweighting can rotate the pass@k update direction away from the pass@1 direction. We illustrate our theoretical findings with large language model experiments on verifiable mathematical reasoning tasks.

### Human Video Generation from a Single Image with 3D Pose and View Control
**Authors**: Tiantian Wang, Chun-Han Yao, Tao Hu, Mallikarjun Byrasandra Ramalinga Reddy, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Varun Jampani

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:42:20Z

**Summary**: Recent diffusion methods have made significant progress in generating videos from single images due to their powerful visual generation capabilities. However, challenges persist in image-to-video synthesis, particularly in human video generation, where inferring view-consistent, motion-dependent clothing wrinkles from a single image remains a formidable problem. In this paper, we present Human Video Generation in 4D (HVG), a latent video diffusion model capable of generating high-quality, multi-view, spatiotemporally coherent human videos from a single image with 3D pose and view control. HVG achieves this through three key designs: (i) Articulated Pose Modulation, which captures the anatomical relationships of 3D joints via a novel dual-dimensional bone map and resolves self-occlusions across views by introducing 3D information; (ii) View and Temporal Alignment, which ensures multi-view consistency and alignment between a reference image and pose sequences for frame-to-frame stability; and (iii) Progressive Spatio-Temporal Sampling with temporal alignment to maintain smooth transitions in long multi-view animations. Extensive experiments on image-to-video tasks demonstrate that HVG outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality 4D human videos from diverse human images and pose inputs.

### KUDA: Knowledge Unlearning by Deviating Representation for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ce Fang, Zhikun Zhang, Min Chen, Qing Liu, Lu Zhou, Zhe Liu, Yunjun Gao

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:28:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) acquire a large amount of knowledge through pre-training on vast and diverse corpora. While this endows LLMs with strong capabilities in generation and reasoning, it amplifies risks associated with sensitive, copyrighted, or harmful content in training data. LLM unlearning, which aims to remove specific knowledge encoded within models, is a promising technique to reduce these risks. However, existing LLM unlearning methods often force LLMs to generate random or incoherent answers due to their inability to alter the encoded knowledge precisely. To achieve effective unlearning at the knowledge level of LLMs, we propose Knowledge Unlearning by Deviating representAtion (KUDA). We first utilize causal tracing to locate specific layers for target knowledge storage. We then design a new unlearning objective that induces the model's representations to deviate from its original position in the phase of knowledge removal, thus disrupting the ability to associate with the target knowledge. To resolve the optimization conflicts between forgetting and retention, we employ a relaxation null-space projection mechanism to mitigate the disruption to the representation space of retaining knowledge. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks, WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that KUDA outperforms most existing baselines by effectively balancing knowledge removal and model utility retention.

### XMorph: Explainable Brain Tumor Analysis Via LLM-Assisted Hybrid Deep Intelligence
**Authors**: Sepehr Salem Ghahfarokhi, M. Moein Esfahani, Raj Sunderraman, Vince Calhoun, Mohammed Alser

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:28:08Z

**Summary**: Deep learning has significantly advanced automated brain tumor diagnosis, yet clinical adoption remains limited by interpretability and computational constraints. Conventional models often act as opaque ''black boxes'' and fail to quantify the complex, irregular tumor boundaries that characterize malignant growth. To address these challenges, we present XMorph, an explainable and computationally efficient framework for fine-grained classification of three prominent brain tumor types: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors. We propose an Information-Weighted Boundary Normalization (IWBN) mechanism that emphasizes diagnostically relevant boundary regions alongside nonlinear chaotic and clinically validated features, enabling a richer morphological representation of tumor growth. A dual-channel explainable AI module combines GradCAM++ visual cues with LLM-generated textual rationales, translating model reasoning into clinically interpretable insights. The proposed framework achieves a classification accuracy of 96.0%, demonstrating that explainability and high performance can co-exist in AI-based medical imaging systems. The source code and materials for XMorph are all publicly available at: https://github.com/ALSER-Lab/XMorph.

### How much does context affect the accuracy of AI health advice?
**Authors**: Prashant Garg, Thiemo Fetzer

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:23:32Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to provide health advice, yet evidence on how their accuracy varies across languages, topics and information sources remains limited. We assess how linguistic and contextual factors affect the accuracy of AI-based health-claim verification. We evaluated seven widely used LLMs on two datasets: (i) 1,975 legally authorised nutrition and health claims from UK and EU regulatory registers translated into 21 languages; and (ii) 9,088 journalist-vetted public-health claims from the PUBHEALTH corpus spanning COVID-19, abortion, politics and general health, drawn from government advisories, scientific abstracts and media sources. Models classified each claim as supported or unsupported using majority voting across repeated runs. Accuracy was analysed by language, topic, source and model. Accuracy on authorised claims was highest in English and closely related European languages and declined in several widely spoken non-European languages, decreasing with syntactic distance from English. On real-world public-health claims, accuracy was substantially lower and varied systematically by topic and source. Models performed best on COVID-19 and government-attributed claims and worst on general health and scientific abstracts. High performance on English, canonical health claims masks substantial context-dependent gaps. Differences in training data exposure, editorial framing and topic-specific tuning likely contribute to these disparities, which are comparable in magnitude to cross-language differences. LLM accuracy in health-claim verification depends strongly on language, topic and information source. English-language performance does not reliably generalise across contexts, underscoring the need for multilingual, domain-specific evaluation before deployment in public-health communication.

### Simulation-Based Inference for Direction Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays with Radio Arrays
**Authors**: Oscar Macias, Zachary Mason, Matthew Ho, Arsène Ferrière, Aurélien Benoit-Lévy, Matías Tueros

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:21:58Z

**Summary**: Ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) observatories require unbiased direction reconstruction to enable multi-messenger astronomy with sparse, nanosecond-scale radio pulses. Explicit likelihood methods often rely on simplified models, which may bias results and understate uncertainties. We introduce a simulation-based inference pipeline that couples a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) to a normalizing-flow posterior within the Learning the Universe Implicit Likelihood Inference framework. Each event is seeded by an analytic plane-wavefront fit; the GNN refines this estimate by learning spatiotemporal correlations among antenna signals, and its frozen embedding conditions an eight-block autoregressive flow that returns the full Bayesian posterior. Trained on about $8,000$ realistic UHECR air-shower simulations generated with the ZHAireS code, the posteriors are temperature-calibrated to meet empirical coverage targets. We demonstrate a sub-degree median angular resolution on test UHECR events, and find that the nominal 68% highest-posterior-density contours capture $71\% \pm 2\%$ of true arrival directions, indicating a mildly conservative uncertainty calibration. This approach provides physically interpretable reconstructions, well-calibrated uncertainties, and rapid inference, making it ideally suited for upcoming experiments targeting highly inclined events, such as GRAND, AugerPrime Radio, and BEACON.

### NoRD: A Data-Efficient Vision-Language-Action Model that Drives without Reasoning
**Authors**: Ishaan Rawal, Shubh Gupta, Yihan Hu, Wei Zhan

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:17:21Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are advancing autonomous driving by replacing modular pipelines with unified end-to-end architectures. However, current VLAs face two expensive requirements: (1) massive dataset collection, and (2) dense reasoning annotations. In this work, we address both challenges with \modelname (\textbf{No} \textbf{R}easoning for \textbf{D}riving). Compared to existing VLAs, \modelname achieves competitive performance while being fine-tuned on $<$60\% of the data and no reasoning annotations, resulting in 3$\times$ fewer tokens. We identify that standard Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fails to yield significant improvements when applied to policies trained on such small, reasoning-free datasets. We show that this limitation stems from difficulty bias, which disproportionately penalizes reward signals from scenarios that produce high-variance rollouts within GRPO. \modelname overcomes this by incorporating Dr.~GRPO, a recent algorithm designed to mitigate difficulty bias in LLMs. As a result, \modelname achieves competitive performance on Waymo and NAVSIM with a fraction of the training data and no reasoning overhead, enabling more efficient autonomous systems.

### Causal Claims in Economics
**Authors**: Prashant Garg, Thiemo Fetzer

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:15:44Z

**Summary**: As economics scales, a key bottleneck is representing what papers claim in a comparable, aggregable form. We introduce evidence-annotated claim graphs that map each paper into a directed network of standardized economic concepts (nodes) and stated relationships (edges), with each edge labeled by evidentiary basis, including whether it is supported by causal inference designs or by non-causal evidence. Using a structured multi-stage AI workflow, we construct claim graphs for 44,852 economics papers from 1980-2023. The share of causal edges rises from 7.7% in 1990 to 31.7% in 2020. Measures of causal narrative structure and causal novelty are positively associated with top-five publication and long-run citations, whereas non-causal counterparts are weakly related or negative.

### Multi-Round Human-AI Collaboration with User-Specified Requirements
**Authors**: Sima Noorani, Shayan Kiyani, Hamed Hassani, George Pappas

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:15:39Z

**Summary**: As humans increasingly rely on multiround conversational AI for high stakes decisions, principled frameworks are needed to ensure such interactions reliably improve decision quality. We adopt a human centric view governed by two principles: counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not undermine human strengths, and complementarity, ensuring it adds value where the human is prone to err. We formalize these concepts via user defined rules, allowing users to specify exactly what harm and complementarity mean for their specific task. We then introduce an online, distribution free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces the user-specified constraints over the collaboration dynamics. We evaluate our framework across two interactive settings: LLM simulated collaboration on a medical diagnostic task and a human crowdsourcing study on a pictorial reasoning task. We show that our online procedure maintains prescribed counterfactual harm and complementarity violation rates even under nonstationary interaction dynamics. Moreover, tightening or loosening these constraints produces predictable shifts in downstream human accuracy, confirming that the two principles serve as practical levers for steering multi-round collaboration toward better decision quality without the need to model or constrain human behavior.

### Revisiting CPL with sign-switching density: to cross or not to cross the NECB
**Authors**: Mine Gökçen, Özgür Akarsu, Eleonora Di Valentino

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:12:16Z

**Summary**: Recent DESI DR2 BAO measurements, when combined with CMB and SNeIa data, exhibit a $3.2σ$-$3.4σ$ preference for dynamical dark energy (DE) described by the CPL-parametrized equation of state. A particularly striking feature of these reconstructions is an apparent transition from an early-time phantom-like regime to a late-time quintessence-like behavior. For positive-definite DE densities, this transition is often phrased as a crossing of the phantom divide line (PDL) at $w(a)=-1$. Allowing the DE density to become negative, however, renders the PDL (in the sense of $w(a)=-1$) non-diagnostic as a global separator: the physically meaningful criterion is instead the null energy condition boundary (NECB), $ρ_{\rm DE}+p_{\rm DE}=0$. We therefore test whether the data-driven preference for NECB-crossing in CPL reconstructions persists once alternative realizations of phantom behavior are admitted, specifically through sign-switching DE densities. To this end, we introduce and constrain two controlled phenomenological extensions of the CPL framework featuring a negative DE phase in the past. In the CPL$\to-Λ$ model, the switching epoch is tied to the CPL-inferred NECB-crossing scale factor, yielding an early-time negative cosmological-constant phase, while the post-switch evolution follows the CPL branch. In the sCPL model, the CPL equation of state is maintained at all times, while the sign switch in the energy density occurs at an independent transition redshift. We find that late-time BAO and SNeIa data drive the negative-density phase beyond their effective redshift coverage, and that this requirement is the primary driver of the inferred parameter behavior. While both models are statistically disfavored relative to the baseline CPL, admitting a negative DE phase generally reduces the significance of deviations from a cosmological constant.

### Sequential Counterfactual Inference for Temporal Clinical Data: Addressing the Time Traveler Dilemma
**Authors**: Jingya Cheng, Alaleh Azhir, Jiazi Tian, Hossein Estiri

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:11:23Z

**Summary**: Counterfactual inference enables clinicians to ask "what if" questions about patient outcomes, but standard methods assume feature independence and simultaneous modifiability -- assumptions violated by longitudinal clinical data. We introduce the Sequential Counterfactual Framework, which respects temporal dependencies in electronic health records by distinguishing immutable features (chronic diagnoses) from controllable features (lab values) and modeling how interventions propagate through time. Applied to 2,723 COVID-19 patients (383 Long COVID heart failure cases, 2,340 matched controls), we demonstrate that 38-67% of patients with chronic conditions would require biologically impossible counterfactuals under naive methods. We identify a cardiorenal cascade (CKD -> AKI -> HF) with relative risks of 2.27 and 1.19 at each step, illustrating temporal propagation that sequential -- but not naive -- counterfactuals can capture. Our framework transforms counterfactual explanation from "what if this feature were different?" to "what if we had intervened earlier, and how would that propagate forward?" --  yielding clinically actionable insights grounded in biological plausibility.

### PVminer: A Domain-Specific Tool to Detect the Patient Voice in Patient Generated Data
**Authors**: Samah Fodeh, Linhai Ma, Yan Wang, Srivani Talakokkul, Ganesh Puthiaraju, Afshan Khan, Ashley Hagaman, Sarah Lowe, Aimee Roundtree

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:10:00Z

**Summary**: Patient-generated text such as secure messages, surveys, and interviews contains rich expressions of the patient voice (PV), reflecting communicative behaviors and social determinants of health (SDoH). Traditional qualitative coding frameworks are labor intensive and do not scale to large volumes of patient-authored messages across health systems. Existing machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) approaches provide partial solutions but often treat patient-centered communication (PCC) and SDoH as separate tasks or rely on models not well suited to patient-facing language. We introduce PVminer, a domain-adapted NLP framework for structuring patient voice in secure patient-provider communication. PVminer formulates PV detection as a multi-label, multi-class prediction task integrating patient-specific BERT encoders (PV-BERT-base and PV-BERT-large), unsupervised topic modeling for thematic augmentation (PV-Topic-BERT), and fine-tuned classifiers for Code, Subcode, and Combo-level labels. Topic representations are incorporated during fine-tuning and inference to enrich semantic inputs. PVminer achieves strong performance across hierarchical tasks and outperforms biomedical and clinical pre-trained baselines, achieving F1 scores of 82.25% (Code), 80.14% (Subcode), and up to 77.87% (Combo). An ablation study further shows that author identity and topic-based augmentation each contribute meaningful gains. Pre-trained models, source code, and documentation will be publicly released, with annotated datasets available upon request for research use.

### ActionReasoning: Robot Action Reasoning in 3D Space with LLM for Robotic Brick Stacking
**Authors**: Guangming Wang, Qizhen Ying, Yixiong Jing, Olaf Wysocki, Brian Sheil

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:07:06Z

**Summary**: Classical robotic systems typically rely on custom planners designed for constrained environments. While effective in restricted settings, these systems lack generalization capabilities, limiting the scalability of embodied AI and general-purpose robots. Recent data-driven Vision-Language-Action (VLA) approaches aim to learn policies from large-scale simulation and real-world data. However, the continuous action space of the physical world significantly exceeds the representational capacity of linguistic tokens, making it unclear if scaling data alone can yield general robotic intelligence. To address this gap, we propose ActionReasoning, an LLM-driven framework that performs explicit action reasoning to produce physics-consistent, prior-guided decisions for robotic manipulation. ActionReasoning leverages the physical priors and real-world knowledge already encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) and structures them within a multi-agent architecture. We instantiate this framework on a tractable case study of brick stacking, where the environment states are assumed to be already accurately measured. The environmental states are then serialized and passed to a multi-agent LLM framework that generates physics-aware action plans. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent LLM framework enables stable brick placement while shifting effort from low-level domain-specific coding to high-level tool invocation and prompting, highlighting its potential for broader generalization. This work introduces a promising approach to bridging perception and execution in robotic manipulation by integrating physical reasoning with LLMs.

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as multi-step decision-making agents, where effective reward design is essential for guiding learning. Although recent work explores various forms of reward shaping and step-level credit assignment, a key signal remains largely overlooked: the intrinsic uncertainty of LLMs. Uncertainty reflects model confidence, reveals where exploration is needed, and offers valuable learning cues even in failed trajectories. We introduce SELAUR: Self Evolving LLM Agent via Uncertainty-aware Rewards, a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates uncertainty directly into the reward design. SELAUR integrates entropy-, least-confidence-, and margin-based metrics into a combined token-level uncertainty estimate, providing dense confidence-aligned supervision, and employs a failure-aware reward reshaping mechanism that injects these uncertainty signals into step- and trajectory-level rewards to improve exploration efficiency and learning stability. Experiments on two benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, show that our method consistently improves success rates over strong baselines. Ablation studies further demonstrate how uncertainty signals enhance exploration and robustness.

### Skill-Inject: Measuring Agent Vulnerability to Skill File Attacks
**Authors**: David Schmotz, Luca Beurer-Kellner, Sahar Abdelnabi, Maksym Andriushchenko

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:03:02Z

**Summary**: LLM agents are evolving rapidly, powered by code execution, tools, and the recently introduced agent skills feature. Skills allow users to extend LLM applications with specialized third-party code, knowledge, and instructions. Although this can extend agent capabilities to new domains, it creates an increasingly complex agent supply chain, offering new surfaces for prompt injection attacks. We identify skill-based prompt injection as a significant threat and introduce SkillInject, a benchmark evaluating the susceptibility of widely-used LLM agents to injections through skill files. SkillInject contains 202 injection-task pairs with attacks ranging from obviously malicious injections to subtle, context-dependent attacks hidden in otherwise legitimate instructions. We evaluate frontier LLMs on SkillInject, measuring both security in terms of harmful instruction avoidance and utility in terms of legitimate instruction compliance. Our results show that today's agents are highly vulnerable with up to 80% attack success rate with frontier models, often executing extremely harmful instructions including data exfiltration, destructive action, and ransomware-like behavior. They furthermore suggest that this problem will not be solved through model scaling or simple input filtering, but that robust agent security will require context-aware authorization frameworks. Our benchmark is available at https://www.skill-inject.com/.

### From Moderation to Mediation: Can LLMs Serve as Mediators in Online Flame Wars?
**Authors**: Dawei Li, Abdullah Alnaibari, Arslan Bisharat, Manny Sandoval, Deborah Hall, Yasin Silva, Huan Liu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:01:52Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for AI for good applications. As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, their potential to foster empathy and constructive dialogue becomes an important frontier for responsible AI research. This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation.

### Complexity-aware fine-tuning
**Authors**: Andrey Goncharov, Daniil Vyazhev, Petr Sychev, Edvard Khalafyan, Alexey Zaytsev

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:50:18Z

**Summary**: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across three small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.58$ vs $0.45$ average accuracy) and outperforms the distillation approach ($0.58$ vs $0.56$ average accuracy) while using $81\%$ less data.

### Scaling State-Space Models on Multiple GPUs with Tensor Parallelism
**Authors**: Anurag Dutt, Nimit Shah, Hazem Masarani, Anshul Gandhi

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:47:54Z

**Summary**: Selective state space models (SSMs) have rapidly become a compelling backbone for large language models, especially for long-context workloads. Yet in deployment, their inference performance is often bounded by the memory capacity, bandwidth, and latency limits of a single GPU, making multi-GPU execution increasingly necessary. Although tensor parallelism (TP) is widely used to scale Transformer inference, applying it to selective SSM blocks is non-trivial because the SSM mixer couples large projections with a sequence-wise recurrent state update and local mixing whose efficiency depends on preserving locality and avoiding synchronization in the critical path.   This paper presents a communication-efficient TP design for selective SSM inference that addresses three practical engineering challenges: enabling TTFT improvements via an SSM state cache across prefill and decode, partitioning the mixer's packed parameter tensor so that recurrent updates remain local while minimizing communication, and reducing TP aggregation overhead with quantized AllReduce. We evaluate on three representative SSM-based LLMs spanning pure-SSM and hybrid architectures - Mamba, Falcon-Mamba, and Zamba - on NVIDIA A6000 and A100 clusters. Our experiments show substantial throughput gains from tensor-parallel SSM inference, improving batch-request throughput by ~1.6-2.1x on 2 GPUs and ~2.6-4.0x on 4 GPUs for Mamba, with the largest benefits at long context lengths, and achieving a further ~10-18% throughput improvement from quantized all-reduce by lowering synchronization bandwidth overhead.

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:43:32Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used to solve complex tasks involving tool use, such as web browsing, code execution, and data analysis. However, current evaluation benchmarks do not adequately assess their ability to solve real-world tasks that require synthesizing information from multiple sources and inferring insights beyond simple fact retrieval. To address this, we introduce DEEPSYNTH, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate agents on realistic, time-consuming problems that combine information gathering, synthesis, and structured reasoning to produce insights. DEEPSYNTH contains 120 tasks collected across 7 domains and data sources covering 67 countries. DEEPSYNTH is constructed using a multi-stage data collection pipeline that requires annotators to collect official data sources, create hypotheses, perform manual analysis, and design tasks with verifiable answers. When evaluated on DEEPSYNTH, 11 state-of-the-art LLMs and deep research agents achieve a maximum F1 score of 8.97 and 17.5 on the LLM-judge metric, underscoring the difficulty of the benchmark. Our analysis reveals that current agents struggle with hallucinations and reasoning over large information spaces, highlighting DEEPSYNTH as a crucial benchmark for guiding future research.

### ReviveMoE: Fast Recovery for Hardware Failures in Large-Scale MoE LLM Inference Deployments
**Authors**: Haley Li, Xinglu Wang, Cong Feng, Chunxu Zuo, Yanan Wang, Hei Lo, Yufei Cui, Bingji Wang, Duo Cui, Shuming Jing, Yizhou Shan, Ying Xiong, Jiannan Wang, Yong Zhang, Zhenan Fan

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:39:41Z

**Summary**: As LLM deployments scale over more hardware, the probability of a single failure in a system increases significantly, and cloud operators must consider robust countermeasures to handle these inevitable failures. A common recovery approach is to simply restart the LLM serving instance; however, this is costly in model-as-a-service (MaaS) inference settings, where reloading model weights and recompiling computation graphs can introduce significant delays to incoming requests. We propose ReviveMoE, a method for rapid failure recovery in large-scale LLM deployments without restarting the serving instance. ReviveMoE is designed to support both the traditional LLM architecture, which collocates MoE and attention on the same hardware, and the disaggregated architectures, which separate MoE from attention. Integrated into Huawei Cloud's MaaS, ReviveMoE is built on top of Huawei's xDeepServe serving platform and the XCCL communications library.

### egoEMOTION: Egocentric Vision and Physiological Signals for Emotion and Personality Recognition in Real-World Tasks
**Authors**: Matthias Jammot, Björn Braun, Paul Streli, Rafael Wampfler, Christian Holz

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:38:14Z

**Summary**: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling - assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses. Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence, arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of behavior, intent, and interaction.

### UDVideoQA: A Traffic Video Question Answering Dataset for Multi-Object Spatio-Temporal Reasoning in Urban Dynamics
**Authors**: Joseph Raj Vishal, Nagasiri Poluri, Katha Naik, Rutuja Patil, Kashyap Hegde Kota, Krishna Vinod, Prithvi Jai Ramesh, Mohammad Farhadi, Yezhou Yang, Bharatesh Chakravarthi

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:33:12Z

**Summary**: Understanding the complex, multi-agent dynamics of urban traffic remains a fundamental challenge for video language models. This paper introduces Urban Dynamics VideoQA, a benchmark dataset that captures the unscripted real-world behavior of dynamic urban scenes. UDVideoQA is curated from 16 hours of traffic footage recorded at multiple city intersections under diverse traffic, weather, and lighting conditions. It employs an event-driven dynamic blur technique to ensure privacy preservation without compromising scene fidelity. Using a unified annotation pipeline, the dataset contains 28K question-answer pairs generated across 8 hours of densely annotated video, averaging one question per second. Its taxonomy follows a hierarchical reasoning level, spanning basic understanding and attribution to event reasoning, reverse reasoning, and counterfactual inference, enabling systematic evaluation of both visual grounding and causal reasoning. Comprehensive experiments benchmark 10 SOTA VideoLMs on UDVideoQA and 8 models on a complementary video question generation benchmark. Results reveal a persistent perception-reasoning gap, showing models that excel in abstract inference often fail with fundamental visual grounding. While models like Gemini Pro achieve the highest zero-shot accuracy, fine-tuning the smaller Qwen2.5-VL 7B model on UDVideoQA bridges this gap, achieving performance comparable to proprietary systems. In VideoQGen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Qwen3 Max generate the most relevant and complex questions, though all models exhibit limited linguistic diversity, underscoring the need for human-centric evaluation. The UDVideoQA suite, including the dataset, annotation tools, and benchmarks for both VideoQA and VideoQGen, provides a foundation for advancing robust, privacy-aware, and real-world multimodal reasoning. UDVideoQA is available at https://ud-videoqa.github.io/UD-VideoQA/UD-VideoQA/.

### SparkMe: Adaptive Semi-Structured Interviewing for Qualitative Insight Discovery
**Authors**: David Anugraha, Vishakh Padmakumar, Diyi Yang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:33:02Z

**Summary**: Qualitative insights from user experiences are critical for informing product and policy decisions, but collecting such data at scale is constrained by the time and availability of experts to conduct semi-structured interviews. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) to automate interviewing, yet existing systems lack a principled mechanism for balancing systematic coverage of predefined topics with adaptive exploration, or the ability to pursue follow-ups, deep dives, and emergent themes that arise organically during conversation. In this work, we formulate adaptive semi-structured interviewing as an optimization problem over the interviewer's behavior. We define interview utility as a trade-off between coverage of a predefined interview topic guide, discovery of relevant emergent themes, and interview cost measured by length. Based on this formulation, we introduce SparkMe, a multi-agent LLM interviewer that performs deliberative planning via simulated conversation rollouts to select questions with high expected utility. We evaluate SparkMe through controlled experiments with LLM-based interviewees, showing that it achieves higher interview utility, improving topic guide coverage (+4.7% over the best baseline) and eliciting richer emergent insights while using fewer conversational turns than prior LLM interviewing approaches. We further validate SparkMe in a user study with 70 participants across 7 professions on the impact of AI on their workflows. Domain experts rate SparkMe as producing high-quality adaptive interviews that surface helpful profession-specific insights not captured by prior approaches. The code, datasets, and evaluation protocols for SparkMe are available as open-source at https://github.com/SALT-NLP/SparkMe.

### "Are You Sure?": An Empirical Study of Human Perception Vulnerability in LLM-Driven Agentic Systems
**Authors**: Xinfeng Li, Shenyu Dai, Kelong Zheng, Yue Xiao, Gelei Deng, Wei Dong, Xiaofeng Wang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:23:11Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) agents are rapidly becoming trusted copilots in high-stakes domains like software development and healthcare. However, this deepening trust introduces a novel attack surface: Agent-Mediated Deception (AMD), where compromised agents are weaponized against their human users. While extensive research focuses on agent-centric threats, human susceptibility to deception by a compromised agent remains unexplored. We present the first large-scale empirical study with 303 participants to measure human susceptibility to AMD. This is based on HAT-Lab (Human-Agent Trust Laboratory), a high-fidelity research platform we develop, featuring nine carefully crafted scenarios spanning everyday and professional domains (e.g., healthcare, software development, human resources). Our 10 key findings reveal significant vulnerabilities and provide future defense perspectives. Specifically, only 8.6% of participants perceive AMD attacks, while domain experts show increased susceptibility in certain scenarios. We identify six cognitive failure modes in users and find that their risk awareness often fails to translate to protective behavior. The defense analysis reveals that effective warnings should interrupt workflows with low verification costs. With experiential learning based on HAT-Lab, over 90% of users who perceive risks report increased caution against AMD. This work provides empirical evidence and a platform for human-centric agent security research.

### AceGRPO: Adaptive Curriculum Enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization for Autonomous Machine Learning Engineering
**Authors**: Yuzhu Cai, Zexi Liu, Xinyu Zhu, Cheng Wang, Siheng Chen

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:14:22Z

**Summary**: Autonomous Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) requires agents to perform sustained, iterative optimization over long horizons. While recent LLM-based agents show promise, current prompt-based agents for MLE suffer from behavioral stagnation due to frozen parameters. Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a remedy, applying it to MLE is hindered by prohibitive execution latency and inefficient data selection. Recognizing these challenges, we propose AceGRPO with two core components: (1) Evolving Data Buffer that continuously repurposes execution traces into reusable training tasks, and (2) Adaptive Sampling guided by a Learnability Potential function, which dynamically prioritizes tasks at the agent's learning frontier to maximize learning efficiency. Leveraging AceGRPO, our trained Ace-30B model achieves a 100% valid submission rate on MLE-Bench-Lite, approaches the performance of proprietary frontier models, and outperforms larger open-source baselines (e.g., DeepSeek-V3.2), demonstrating robust capability for sustained iterative optimization. Code is available at https://github.com/yuzhu-cai/AceGRPO.

### SWE-Master: Unleashing the Potential of Software Engineering Agents via Post-Training
**Authors**: Huatong Song, Lisheng Huang, Shuang Sun, Jinhao Jiang, Ran Le, Daixuan Cheng, Guoxin Chen, Yiwen Hu, Zongchao Chen, Yiming Jia, Wayne Xin Zhao, Yang Song, Tao Zhang, Ji-Rong Wen

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:13:02Z

**Summary**: In this technical report, we present SWE-Master, an open-source and fully reproducible post-training framework for building effective software engineering agents. SWE-Master systematically explores the complete agent development pipeline, including teacher-trajectory synthesis and data curation, long-horizon SFT, RL with real execution feedback, and inference framework design. Starting from an open-source base model with limited initial SWE capability, SWE-Master demonstrates how systematical optimization method can elicit strong long-horizon SWE task solving abilities. We evaluate SWE-Master on SWE-bench Verified, a standard benchmark for realistic software engineering tasks. Under identical experimental settings, our approach achieves a resolve rate of 61.4\% with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, substantially outperforming existing open-source baselines. By further incorporating test-time scaling~(TTS) with LLM-based environment feedback, SWE-Master reaches 70.8\% at TTS@8, demonstrating a strong performance potential. SWE-Master provides a practical and transparent foundation for advancing reproducible research on software engineering agents. The code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/SWE-Master.

### Prompt-Level Distillation: A Non-Parametric Alternative to Model Fine-Tuning for Efficient Reasoning
**Authors**: Sanket Badhe, Deep Shah

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:03:21Z

**Summary**: Advanced reasoning typically requires Chain-of-Thought prompting, which is accurate but incurs prohibitive latency and substantial test-time inference costs. The standard alternative, fine-tuning smaller models, often sacrifices interpretability while introducing significant resource and operational overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce Prompt-Level Distillation (PLD). We extract explicit reasoning patterns from a Teacher model and organize them into a structured list of expressive instructions for the Student model's System Prompt. Evaluated on the StereoSet and Contract-NLI datasets using Gemma-3 4B, PLD improved Macro F1 scores from 57\% to 90.0\% and 67\% to 83\% respectively, enabling this compact model to match frontier performance with negligible latency overhead. These expressive instructions render the decision-making process transparent, allowing for full human verification of logic, making this approach ideal for regulated industries such as law, finance, and content moderation, as well as high-volume use cases and edge devices.

### Turning Semantics into Topology: LLM-Driven Attribute Augmentation for Collaborative Filtering
**Authors**: Junjie Meng, Ranxu zhang, Wei Wu, Rui Zhang, Chuan Qin, Qi Zhang, Qi Liu, Hui Xiong, Chao Wang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:01:47Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential for enhancing recommender systems through their extensive world knowledge and reasoning capabilities. However, effectively translating these semantic signals into traditional collaborative embeddings remains an open challenge. Existing approaches typically fall into two extremes: direct inference methods are computationally prohibitive for large-scale retrieval, while embedding-based methods primarily focus on unilateral feature augmentation rather than holistic collaborative signal enhancement. To bridge this gap, we propose Topology-Augmented Graph Collaborative Filtering (TAGCF), a novel framework that transforms semantic knowledge into topological connectivity. Unlike existing approaches that depend on textual features or direct interaction synthesis, TAGCF employs LLMs to infer interaction intents and underlying causal relationships from user-item pairs, representing these insights as intermediate attribute nodes within an enriched User-Attribute-Item (U-A-I) graph. Furthermore, to effectively model the heterogeneous relations in this augmented structure, we propose Adaptive Relation-weighted Graph Convolution (ARGC), which employs relation-specific prediction networks to dynamically estimate the importance of each relation type. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets and CF backbones demonstrate consistent improvements, with comprehensive evaluations including cold-start scenarios validating the effectiveness and robustness of our framework. All code will be made publicly available. For anonymous review, our code is available at the following anonymous link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AGCF-2441353190/.

### Can Interest-Bearing Positions Solve the Long-Horizon Problem in Prediction Markets?
**Authors**: Caleb Maresca

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:52:15Z

**Summary**: Prediction markets suffer from reduced liquidity and price accuracy for long-horizon events due to the opportunity cost of committed capital. Recently, major platforms have introduced interest-bearing positions to mitigate this "long-horizon problem." I evaluate this policy using agent-based simulations with large language model (LLM) traders in a 2 x 2 factorial design, varying time horizon (4 days vs. 2 years) and the presence of interest. While long horizons degrade accuracy, the observed pricing bias (0.72 percentage points) is significantly smaller than theoretical and prior empirical estimates. Paying interest eliminates approximately 83% of the horizon effect on accuracy and more than triples market participation (from 17% to 62% of wealth). These findings suggest the long-horizon problem may be overstated in existing literature and that interest-bearing positions are a highly effective intervention, primarily by incentivizing participation rather than correcting bias.

### Beyond the Star Rating: A Scalable Framework for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Using LLMs and Text Classification
**Authors**: Vishal Patil, Shree Vaishnavi Bacha, Revanth Yamani, Yidan Sun, Mayank Kejriwal

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:45:17Z

**Summary**: Customer-provided reviews have become an important source of information for business owners and other customers alike. However, effectively analyzing millions of unstructured reviews remains challenging. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for natural language understanding, their application to large-scale review analysis has been limited by computational costs and scalability concerns. This study proposes a hybrid approach that uses LLMs for aspect identification while employing classic machine-learning methods for sentiment classification at scale. Using ChatGPT to analyze sampled restaurant reviews, we identified key aspects of dining experiences and developed sentiment classifiers using human-labeled reviews, which we subsequently applied to 4.7 million reviews collected over 17 years from a major online platform. Regression analysis reveals that our machine-labeled aspects significantly explain variance in overall restaurant ratings across different aspects of dining experiences, cuisines, and geographical regions. Our findings demonstrate that combining LLMs with traditional machine learning approaches can effectively automate aspect-based sentiment analysis of large-scale customer feedback, suggesting a practical framework for both researchers and practitioners in the hospitality industry and potentially, other service sectors.

### Automata Learning with an Incomplete but Inductive Teacher
**Authors**: Daniel Stan, Adrien Pommellet, Juliette Jacquot

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:35:16Z

**Summary**: Active automata learning (AAL) under a Minimally Adequate Teacher (MAT) has been successfully used to infer a regular language through membership and equivalence queries. This language might not be fully characterized: we are then interested in finding any solution in a target class of possibly many regular languages. Some problems such as regular language separation or inductive invariant synthesis in the context of regular model checking (RMC) may indeed admit more than one answer. We therefore introduce IdMAT: a new teacher formalism answering queries with respect to any language in the target class, all at once. Such a teacher tailored towards invariant synthesis might provide incomplete "don't know" answers, but also inductive facts of the form "if w1 is accepted, so is w2". We pair IdMAT with a novel AAL algorithm LIndA that 1. encodes all uncertainties as a unique SAT instance and does not fork, 2. leverages incremental SAT solving and UNSAT core analysis, and 3. handles counterexamples of the simple or inductive type in a frugal manner inspired by the Rivest-Schapire refinement technique. We finally evaluate a prototype implementation in the context of regular language separation and RMC.

### PhysE-Inv: A Physics-Encoded Inverse Modeling approach for Arctic Snow Depth Prediction
**Authors**: Akila Sampath, Vandana Janeja, Jianwu Wang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:26:41Z

**Summary**: The accurate estimation of Arctic snow depth remains a critical time-varying inverse problem due to the scarcity in associated sea ice parameters. Existing process-based and data-driven models are either highly sensitive to sparse data or lack the physical interpretability required for climate-critical applications. To address this gap, we introduce PhysE-Inv, a novel framework that integrates a sophisticated sequential architecture, namely an LSTM Encoder-Decoder with Multi-head Attention and contrastive learning, with physics-guided inference. Our core innovation lies in a physics-constrained inversion methodology. This methodology first leverages the hydrostatic balance forward model as a target-formulation proxy, enabling effective learning in the absence of direct ground truth; second, it uses reconstruction physics regularization over a latent space to dynamically discover hidden physical parameters from noisy, incomplete time-series input. Evaluated against state-of-the-art baselines, PhysE-Inv significantly improves prediction performance, reducing error by 20% while demonstrating superior physical consistency and resilience to data sparsity compared to empirical methods. Beyond Arctic snow depth, PhysE-Inv can be applied broadly to other noisy, data-scarce problems in Earth and climate science.

### Tool Building as a Path to "Superintelligence"
**Authors**: David Koplow, Tomer Galanti, Tomaso Poggio

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:22:10Z

**Summary**: The Diligent Learner framework suggests LLMs can achieve superintelligence via test-time search, provided a sufficient step-success probability $γ$. In this work, we design a benchmark to measure $γ$ on logical out-of-distribution inference. We construct a class of tasks involving GF(2) circuit reconstruction that grow more difficult with each reasoning step, and that are, from an information-theoretic standpoint, impossible to reliably solve unless the LLM carefully integrates all of the information provided. Our analysis demonstrates that while the $γ$ value for small LLMs declines superlinearly as depth increases, frontier models exhibit partial robustness on this task. Furthermore, we find that successful reasoning at scale is contingent upon precise tool calls, identifying tool design as a critical capability for LLMs to achieve general superintelligence through the Diligent Learner framework.

### Mapping Gemma3 onto an Edge Dataflow Architecture
**Authors**: Shouyu Du, Miaoxiang Yu, Zhenyu Xu, Zhiheng Ni, Jillian Cai, Qing Yang, Tao Wei

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:20:32Z

**Summary**: We present the first end-to-end deployment of the Gemma3 family of large language and vision models on a tiled edge dataflow architecture (AMD Ryzen AI NPU). Our work introduces a set of hardware-aware techniques. For prefill, we introduce an efficient dequantization engine, optimize tiled matrix multiplication kernels, and propose FlowQKV, a chunked, pipelined attention mechanism. For decoding, we introduce FusedDQP, which fuses dequantization and projection into a single kernel, and FlowKV, which re-structures attention to sustain high memory bandwidth utilization. Together with a compact Q4NX 4-bit quantization format, these methods yield up to $5.2\times$ faster prefill and $4.8\times$ faster decoding versus the iGPU, and $33.5\times$ and $2.2\times$ over the CPU, respectively. Power efficiency improves by as much as $67.2\times$ and $222.9\times$ compared to the iGPU and CPU. The proposed approach demonstrates that modern NPUs can deliver practical, low-power LLM and VLM inference at the edge, and provides a generalizable blueprint for mapping transformer-based models onto tiled dataflow accelerators.

### Dispu$τ$able: the high cost of a low optical depth
**Authors**: Noah Sailer, Gerrit S. Farren, Simone Ferraro, Martin White

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:19:20Z

**Summary**: Recent baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) are mildly discrepant ($2.2σ$) with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) when interpreted within $Λ$CDM. When analyzing these data with extended cosmologies this inconsistency manifests as a $\simeq3σ$ preference for sub-minimal neutrino mass or evolving dark energy. It is known that the preference for sub-minimal neutrino mass from the suppression of structure growth could be alleviated by increasing the optical depth to reionization $τ$. We show that, because the CMB-inferred $τ$ is negatively correlated with the matter fraction, a larger optical depth resolves a similar preference from geometric constraints. Optical depths large enough to resolve the neutrino mass tension ($τ\sim0.09)$ reduce the preference for evolving dark energy from $\simeq3σ$ to $\simeq1.5σ$ and increase the CMB-inferred values of $n_s$ and $H_0$ to $0.968\pm0.004$ and $67.94\pm0.44$ km/s/Mpc, respectively. Conversely, within $Λ$CDM the combination of DESI BAO, high-$\ell$ CMB and CMB lensing yields $τ= 0.090 \pm 0.012$, which is in $\simeq3-5σ$ tension with Planck low-$\ell$ polarization data when taken at face value. Essentially all current CMB analyses $-$ including recent results from WMAP+ACT and SPT $-$ adopt the Planck measurement of $τ$: thus a systematic in large-scale Planck polarization would serve as a "single-point failure" for most modern cosmological analyses that include CMB data. While there is no evidence for systematics in the large-scale Planck data, $τ$ remains the least well-constrained $Λ$CDM parameter and is far from its cosmic variance limit. This strengthens the case for future large-scale CMB experiments as well as direct probes of the epoch of reionization.

### An Expert Schema for Evaluating Large Language Model Errors in Scholarly Question-Answering Systems
**Authors**: Anna Martin-Boyle, William Humphreys, Martha Brown, Cara Leckey, Harmanpreet Kaur

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:16:44Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming scholarly tasks like search and summarization, but their reliability remains uncertain. Current evaluation metrics for testing LLM reliability are primarily automated approaches that prioritize efficiency and scalability, but lack contextual nuance and fail to reflect how scientific domain experts assess LLM outputs in practice. We developed and validated a schema for evaluating LLM errors in scholarly question-answering systems that reflects the assessment strategies of practicing scientists. In collaboration with domain experts, we identified 20 error patterns across seven categories through thematic analysis of 68 question-answer pairs. We validated this schema through contextual inquiries with 10 additional scientists, which showed not only which errors experts naturally identify but also how structured evaluation schemas can help them detect previously overlooked issues. Domain experts use systematic assessment strategies, including technical precision testing, value-based evaluation, and meta-evaluation of their own practices. We discuss implications for supporting expert evaluation of LLM outputs, including opportunities for personalized, schema-driven tools that adapt to individual evaluation patterns and expertise levels.

### Latent Thinking Optimization: Your Latent Reasoning Language Model Secretly Encodes Reward Signals in Its Latent Thoughts
**Authors**: Hanwen Du, Yuxin Dong, Xia Ning

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:11:47Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at problem solving by generating chain of thoughts in natural language, but such verbal thinking is computationally costly and prone to overthinking. A recent work instead proposes a latent thinking architecture, Huginn-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning steps as a sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack interpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the correctness and reliability of the model's latent thinking processes. In this paper, we provide a systematic study of how Huginn-3.5B thinks in the latent space and how external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We show that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit highly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably predict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these insights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic algorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to optimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect latent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking processes. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains, and LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking processes. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward modeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed directly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general, efficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of LLMs.

### VAUQ: Vision-Aware Uncertainty Quantification for LVLM Self-Evaluation
**Authors**: Seongheon Park, Changdae Oh, Hyeong Kyu Choi, Xuefeng Du, Sharon Li

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:11:14Z

**Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) frequently hallucinate, limiting their safe deployment in real-world applications. Existing LLM self-evaluation methods rely on a model's ability to estimate the correctness of its own outputs, which can improve deployment reliability; however, they depend heavily on language priors and are therefore ill-suited for evaluating vision-conditioned predictions. We propose VAUQ, a vision-aware uncertainty quantification framework for LVLM self-evaluation that explicitly measures how strongly a model's output depends on visual evidence. VAUQ introduces the Image-Information Score (IS), which captures the reduction in predictive uncertainty attributable to visual input, and an unsupervised core-region masking strategy that amplifies the influence of salient regions. Combining predictive entropy with this core-masked IS yields a training-free scoring function that reliably reflects answer correctness. Comprehensive experiments show that VAUQ consistently outperforms existing self-evaluation methods across multiple datasets.

### PaperTrail: A Claim-Evidence Interface for Grounding Provenance in LLM-based Scholarly Q&A
**Authors**: Anna Martin-Boyle, Cara A. C. Leckey, Martha C. Brown, Harmanpreet Kaur

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:04:50Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in scholarly question-answering (QA) systems to help researchers synthesize vast amounts of literature. However, these systems often produce subtle errors (e.g., unsupported claims, errors of omission), and current provenance mechanisms like source citations are not granular enough for the rigorous verification that scholarly domain requires. To address this, we introduce PaperTrail, a novel interface that decomposes both LLM answers and source documents into discrete claims and evidence, mapping them to reveal supported assertions, unsupported claims, and information omitted from the source texts. We evaluated PaperTrail in a within-subjects study with 26 researchers who performed two scholarly editing tasks using PaperTrail and a baseline interface. Our results show that PaperTrail significantly lowered participants' trust compared to the baseline. However, this increased caution did not translate to behavioral changes, as people continued to rely on LLM-generated scholarly edits to avoid a cognitively burdensome task. We discuss the value of claim-evidence matching for understanding LLM trustworthiness in scholarly settings, and present design implications for cognition-friendly communication of provenance information.

### LogicGraph : Benchmarking Multi-Path Logical Reasoning via Neuro-Symbolic Generation and Verification
**Authors**: Yanrui Wu, Lingling Zhang, Xinyu Zhang, Jiayu Chang, Pengyu Li, Xu Jiang, Jingtao Hu, Jun Liu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:04:26Z

**Summary**: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) primarily emphasize convergent logical reasoning, where success is defined by producing a single correct proof. However, many real-world reasoning problems admit multiple valid derivations, requiring models to explore diverse logical paths rather than committing to one route. To address this limitation, we introduce LogicGraph, the first benchmark aimed to systematically evaluate multi-path logical reasoning, constructed via a neuro-symbolic framework that leverages backward logic generation and semantic instantiation. This pipeline yields solver-verified reasoning problems formalized by high-depth multi-path reasoning and inherent logical distractions, where each instance is associated with an exhaustive set of minimal proofs. We further propose a reference-free evaluation framework to rigorously assess model performance in both convergent and divergent regimes. Experiments on state-of-the-art language models reveal a common limitation: models tend to commit early to a single route and fail to explore alternatives, and the coverage gap grows substantially with reasoning depth. LogicGraph exposes this divergence gap and provides actionable insights to motivate future improvements. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/kkkkarry/LogicGraph.

### OVSegDT: Segmenting Transformer for Open-Vocabulary Object Goal Navigation
**Authors**: Tatiana Zemskova, Aleksei Staroverov, Dmitry Yudin, Aleksandr Panov

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:04:11Z

**Summary**: Open-vocabulary Object Goal Navigation requires an embodied agent to reach objects described by free-form language, including categories never seen during training. Existing end-to-end policies overfit small simulator datasets, achieving high success on training scenes but failing to generalize and exhibiting unsafe behaviour (frequent collisions). We introduce OVSegDT, a lightweight transformer policy that tackles these issues with two synergistic components. The first component is the semantic branch, which includes an encoder for the target binary mask and an auxiliary segmentation loss function, grounding the textual goal and providing precise spatial cues. The second component consists of a proposed Entropy-Adaptive Loss Modulation, a per-sample scheduler that continuously balances imitation and reinforcement signals according to the policy entropy, eliminating brittle manual phase switches. These additions cut the sample complexity of training by 33%, and reduce collision count in two times while keeping inference cost low (130M parameters, RGB-only input). On HM3D-OVON, our model matches the performance on unseen categories to that on seen ones and establishes state-of-the-art results (40.1% SR, 20.9% SPL on val unseen) without depth, odometry, or large vision-language models. Code is available at https://github.com/CognitiveAISystems/OVSegDT.

### OmniOCR: Generalist OCR for Ethnic Minority Languages
**Authors**: Bonan Liu, Zeyu Zhang, Bingbing Meng, Han Wang, Hanshuo Zhang, Chengping Wang, Daji Ergu, Ying Cai

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:02:49Z

**Summary**: Optical character recognition (OCR) has advanced rapidly with deep learning and multimodal models, yet most methods focus on well-resourced scripts such as Latin and Chinese. Ethnic minority languages remain underexplored due to complex writing systems, scarce annotations, and diverse historical and modern forms, making generalization in low-resource or zero-shot settings challenging. To address these challenges, we present OmniOCR, a universal framework for ethnic minority scripts. OmniOCR introduces Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation (Dynamic LoRA) to allocate model capacity across layers and scripts, enabling effective adaptation while preserving knowledge.A sparsity regularization prunes redundant updates, ensuring compact and efficient adaptation without extra inference cost. Evaluations on TibetanMNIST, Shui, ancient Yi, and Dongba show that OmniOCR outperforms zero-shot foundation models and standard post training, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with superior parameter efficiency, and compared with the state-of-the-art baseline models, it improves accuracy by 39%-66% on these four datasets.

### MIP Candy: A Modular PyTorch Framework for Medical Image Processing
**Authors**: Tianhao Fu, Yucheng Chen

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:55:04Z

**Summary**: Medical image processing demands specialized software that handles high-dimensional volumetric data, heterogeneous file formats, and domain-specific training procedures. Existing frameworks either provide low-level components that require substantial integration effort or impose rigid, monolithic pipelines that resist modification. We present MIP Candy (MIPCandy), a freely available, PyTorch-based framework designed specifically for medical image processing. MIPCandy provides a complete, modular pipeline spanning data loading, training, inference, and evaluation, allowing researchers to obtain a fully functional process workflow by implementing a single method, $\texttt{build_network}$, while retaining fine-grained control over every component. Central to the design is $\texttt{LayerT}$, a deferred configuration mechanism that enables runtime substitution of convolution, normalization, and activation modules without subclassing. The framework further offers built-in $k$-fold cross-validation, dataset inspection with automatic region-of-interest detection, deep supervision, exponential moving average, multi-frontend experiment tracking (Weights & Biases, Notion, MLflow), training state recovery, and validation score prediction via quotient regression. An extensible bundle ecosystem provides pre-built model implementations that follow a consistent trainer--predictor pattern and integrate with the core framework without modification. MIPCandy is open-source under the Apache-2.0 license and requires Python~3.12 or later. Source code and documentation are available at https://github.com/ProjectNeura/MIPCandy.

### Exchangeable Gaussian Processes for Staggered-Adoption Policy Evaluation
**Authors**: Hayk Gevorgyan, Konstantinos Kalogeropoulos, Angelos Alexopoulos

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:52:54Z

**Summary**: We study the use of exchangeable multi-task Gaussian processes (GPs) for causal inference in panel data, applying the framework to two settings: one with a single treated unit subject to a once-and-for-all treatment and another with multiple treated units and staggered treatment adoption. Our approach models the joint evolution of outcomes for treated and control units through a GP prior that ensures exchangeability across units while allowing for flexible nonlinear trends over time. The resulting posterior predictive distribution for the untreated potential outcomes of the treated unit provides a counterfactual path, from which we derive pointwise and cumulative treatment effects, along with credible intervals to quantify uncertainty. We implement several variations of the exchangeable GP model using different kernel functions. To assess prediction accuracy, we conduct a placebo-style validation within the pre-intervention window by selecting a ``fake'' intervention date. Ultimately, this study illustrates how exchangeable GPs serve as a flexible tool for policy evaluation in panel data settings and proposes a novel approach to staggered-adoption designs with a large number of treated and control units.

### Do We Need Adam? Surprisingly Strong and Sparse Reinforcement Learning with SGD in LLMs
**Authors**: Sagnik Mukherjee, Lifan Yuan, Pavan Jayasinha, Dilek Hakkani-Tür, Hao Peng

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:43:09Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly RL from verifiable reward (RLVR), has become a crucial phase of training large language models (LLMs) and a key focus of current scaling efforts. However, optimization practices in RL largely follow those of next-token prediction stages (e.g., pretraining and supervised fine-tuning), despite fundamental differences between RL and these stages highlighted by recent work. One such practice is the use of the AdamW optimizer, which is widely adopted for training large-scale transformers despite its high memory overhead. Our analysis shows that both momentum and adaptive learning rates in AdamW are less influential in RL than in SFT, leading us to hypothesize that RL benefits less from Adam-style per-parameter adaptive learning rates and momentum. Confirming this hypothesis, our experiments demonstrate that the substantially more memory-efficient SGD, which is known to perform poorly in supervised learning of large-scale transformers, matches or even outperforms AdamW in RL for LLMs. Remarkably, full fine-tuning with SGD updates fewer than 0.02% of model parameters without any sparsity-promoting regularization, more than 1000 times fewer than AdamW. Our analysis offers potential reasons for this update sparsity. These findings provide new insights into the optimization dynamics of RL in LLMs and show that RL can be substantially more parameter-efficient than previously recognized.

### Hierarchical Decision Mamba Meets Agentic AI: A Novel Approach for RAN Slicing in 6G
**Authors**: Md Arafat Habib, Medhat Elsayed, Majid Bavand, Pedro Enrique Iturria Rivera, Yigit Ozcan, Melike Erol-Kantarci

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:38:33Z

**Summary**: Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing enables multiple logical networks to exist on top of the same physical infrastructure by allocating resources to distinct service groups, where radio resource scheduling plays a key role in ensuring compliance with slice-specific Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). Existing configuration-based or intent-driven Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches usually rely on static mappings and SLA conversions. The current literature does not integrate natural language understanding with coordinated decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose an Agentic AI framework for 6G RAN slicing, driven by a super agent built using Hierarchical Decision Mamba (HDM) controllers and a Large Language Model (LLM). The super agent interprets operator intents and translates them into actionable goals using the LLM, which are used by HDM to coordinate inter-slice, intra-slice, and self-healing agents. Compared to transformer-based and reward-driven baselines, the proposed Agentic AI framework demonstrates consistent improvements across key performance indicators, including higher throughput, improved cell-edge performance, and reduced latency across different slices.

### A Survey on the Optimization of Large Language Model-based Agents
**Authors**: Shangheng Du, Jiabao Zhao, Jinxin Shi, Zhentao Xie, Xin Jiang, Yanhong Bai, Liang He

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:31:52Z

**Summary**: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have been widely adopted in various fields, becoming essential for autonomous decision-making and interactive tasks. However, current work typically relies on prompt design or fine-tuning strategies applied to vanilla LLMs, which often leads to limited effectiveness or suboptimal performance in complex agent-related environments. Although LLM optimization techniques can improve model performance across many general tasks, they lack specialized optimization towards critical agent functionalities such as long-term planning, dynamic environmental interaction, and complex decision-making. Although numerous recent studies have explored various strategies to optimize LLM-based agents for complex agent tasks, a systematic review summarizing and comparing these methods from a holistic perspective is still lacking. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of LLM-based agent optimization approaches, categorizing them into parameter-driven and parameter-free methods. We first focus on parameter-driven optimization, covering fine-tuning-based optimization, reinforcement learning-based optimization, and hybrid strategies, analyzing key aspects such as trajectory data construction, fine-tuning techniques, reward function design, and optimization algorithms. Additionally, we briefly discuss parameter-free strategies that optimize agent behavior through prompt engineering and external knowledge retrieval. Finally, we summarize the datasets and benchmarks used for evaluation and tuning, review key applications of LLM-based agents, and discuss major challenges and promising future directions. Our repository for related references is available at https://github.com/YoungDubbyDu/LLM-Agent-Optimization.

### Le-DETR: Revisiting Real-Time Detection Transformer with Efficient Encoder Design
**Authors**: Jiannan Huang, Aditya Kane, Fengzhe Zhou, Yunchao Wei, Humphrey Shi

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:29:55Z

**Summary**: Real-time object detection is crucial for real-world applications as it requires high accuracy with low latency. While Detection Transformers (DETR) have demonstrated significant performance improvements, current real-time DETR models are challenging to reproduce from scratch due to excessive pre-training overheads on the backbone, constraining research advancements by hindering the exploration of novel backbone architectures. In this paper, we want to show that by using general good design, it is possible to have \textbf{high performance} with \textbf{low pre-training cost}. After a thorough study of the backbone architecture, we propose EfficientNAT at various scales, which incorporates modern efficient convolution and local attention mechanisms. Moreover, we re-design the hybrid encoder with local attention, significantly enhancing both performance and inference speed. Based on these advancements, we present Le-DETR (\textbf{L}ow-cost and \textbf{E}fficient \textbf{DE}tection \textbf{TR}ansformer), which achieves a new \textbf{SOTA} in real-time detection using only ImageNet1K and COCO2017 training datasets, saving about 80\% images in pre-training stage compared with previous methods. We demonstrate that with well-designed, real-time DETR models can achieve strong performance without the need for complex and computationally expensive pretraining. Extensive experiments show that Le-DETR-M/L/X achieves \textbf{52.9/54.3/55.1 mAP} on COCO Val2017 with \textbf{4.45/5.01/6.68 ms} on an RTX4090. It surpasses YOLOv12-L/X by \textbf{+0.6/-0.1 mAP} while achieving similar speed and \textbf{+20\%} speedup. Compared with DEIM-D-FINE, Le-DETR-M achieves \textbf{+0.2 mAP} with slightly faster inference, and surpasses DEIM-D-FINE-L by \textbf{+0.4 mAP} with only \textbf{0.4 ms} additional latency. Code and weights will be open-sourced.

### When LLMs Imagine People: A Human-Centered Persona Brainstorm Audit for Bias and Fairness in Creative Applications
**Authors**: Hongliu Cao, Eoin Thomas, Rodrigo Acuna Agost

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:29:33Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) used in creative workflows can reinforce stereotypes and perpetuate inequities, making fairness auditing essential. Existing methods rely on constrained tasks and fixed benchmarks, leaving open-ended creative outputs unexamined. We introduce the Persona Brainstorm Audit (PBA), a scalable and easy to extend auditing method for bias detection across multiple intersecting identity and social roles in open-ended persona generation. PBA quantifies bias using degree-of-freedom-aware normalized Cramér's V, producing interpretable severity labels that enable fair comparison across models and dimensions. Applying PBA to 12 LLMs (120,000 personas, 16 bias dimensions), we find that bias evolves nonlinearly across model generations: larger and newer models are not consistently fairer, and biases that initially decrease can resurface in later releases. Intersectional analysis reveals disparities hidden by single-axis metrics, where dimensions appearing fair individually can exhibit high bias in combination. Robustness analyses show PBA remains stable under varying sample sizes, role-playing prompts, and debiasing prompts, establishing its reliability for fairness auditing in LLMs.

### A Neyman-Orthogonalization Approach to the Incidental Parameter Problem
**Authors**: Stéphane Bonhomme, Koen Jochmans, Martin Weidner

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:24:52Z

**Summary**: A popular approach to perform inference on a target parameter in the presence of nuisance parameters is to construct estimating equations that are orthogonal to the nuisance parameters, in the sense that their expected first derivative is zero. Such first-order orthogonalization allows the estimator of the nuisance parameters to converge at a slower-than-parametric rate. It may, however, not suffice when the nuisance parameters are very imprecisely estimated. Leading examples are models for panel and network data that feature fixed effects. In this paper, we show how, in the conditional-likelihood setting, estimating equations can be constructed that are orthogonal to any chosen order $q$, in that their leading $q$ expected derivatives are zero. This yields estimators of target parameters that are unaffected by the presence of nuisance parameters to order $q$. In an empirical illustration, we apply our method to a fixed-effect model of team production.

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:16:44Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has spurred the emergence of data agents, autonomous systems designed to orchestrate Data + AI ecosystems for tackling complex data-related tasks. However, the term "data agent" currently suffers from terminological ambiguity and inconsistent adoption, conflating simple query responders with sophisticated autonomous architectures. This terminological ambiguity fosters mismatched user expectations, accountability challenges, and barriers to industry growth. Inspired by the SAE J3016 standard for driving automation, this survey introduces the first systematic hierarchical taxonomy for data agents, comprising six levels that delineate and trace progressive shifts in autonomy, from manual operations (L0) to a vision of generative, fully autonomous data agents (L5), thereby clarifying capability boundaries and responsibility allocation. Through this lens, we offer a structured review of existing research arranged by increasing autonomy, encompassing specialized data agents for data management, preparation, and analysis, alongside emerging efforts toward versatile, comprehensive systems with enhanced autonomy. We further analyze critical evolutionary leaps and technical gaps for advancing data agents, especially the ongoing L2-to-L3 transition, where data agents evolve from procedural execution to autonomous orchestration. Finally, we conclude with a forward-looking roadmap, envisioning proactive, generative data agents.

### Characterization-free classification and identification of the environment between two quantum players
**Authors**: Masahito Hayashi, Longyang Cao, Baichu Yu, Yuan-Yuan Zhao

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:16:01Z

**Summary**: Classifying the causal structure of quantum channels is essential for verifying quantum networks and certifying quantum resources. We introduce a characterization-free protocol enabling two isolated players, Alice and Bob, to classify and identify the definite-order strategy adopted by an unknown environment mediating their channels. Without assuming knowledge of their devices or the environment, the players infer the causal order solely from input-output statistics by testing Markovian conditions that we prove are necessary and sufficient for each strategy class. Remarkably, we prove that even with a minimal random channel consisting of two-outcome POVMs and two-state preparations, the protocol retains full performance with probability one. We experimentally demonstrate the protocol on an optical platform, reliably distinguishing between several strategies. Our results provide a strong and robust tool for causal inference in quantum networks.

### Generative Pseudo-Labeling for Pre-Ranking with LLMs
**Authors**: Junyu Bi, Xinting Niu, Daixuan Cheng, Kun Yuan, Tao Wang, Binbin Cao, Jian Wu, Yuning Jiang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:14:49Z

**Summary**: Pre-ranking is a critical stage in industrial recommendation systems, tasked with efficiently scoring thousands of recalled items for downstream ranking. A key challenge is the train-serving discrepancy: pre-ranking models are trained only on exposed interactions, yet must score all recalled candidates -- including unexposed items -- during online serving. This mismatch not only induces severe sample selection bias but also degrades generalization, especially for long-tail content. Existing debiasing approaches typically rely on heuristics (e.g., negative sampling) or distillation from biased rankers, which either mislabel plausible unexposed items as negatives or propagate exposure bias into pseudo-labels. In this work, we propose Generative Pseudo-Labeling (GPL), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate unbiased, content-aware pseudo-labels for unexposed items, explicitly aligning the training distribution with the online serving space. By offline generating user-specific interest anchors and matching them with candidates in a frozen semantic space, GPL provides high-quality supervision without adding online latency. Deployed in a large-scale production system, GPL improves click-through rate by 3.07%, while significantly enhancing recommendation diversity and long-tail item discovery.

### Sparse VARs Do Not Imply Sparse Local Projections: Robust Inference for High-Dimensional Granger Causality
**Authors**: Eugene Dettaa, Endong Wang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:01:40Z

**Summary**: This paper studies multi-horizon Granger causality using high-dimensional local projections in sparse Vector Autoregressive (VAR) systems. Since local projection coefficients are nonlinear transformations of the underlying VAR parameters, existing approaches, such as de-biased least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and post-double-selection methods applied directly to local projections, lack a general justification, as sparsity of the VAR does not always propagate to higher horizons. We propose a two-step framework that avoids imposing sparsity at each horizon and delivers valid inference without relying on heteroskedasticityand autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) corrections. We establish large sample theory for the proposed estimators and develop feasible Wald tests. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate improved size control across horizons relative to existing methods. An application to large financial systems illustrates horizon-specific connectedness.

### CrystaL: Spontaneous Emergence of Visual Latents in MLLMs
**Authors**: Yang Zhang, Danyang Li, Yuxuan Li, Xin Zhang, Tianyu Xie, Mingming Cheng, Xiang Li

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:01:30Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance by integrating powerful language backbones with large-scale visual encoders. Among these, latent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods enable implicit reasoning in continuous hidden states, facilitating seamless vision-language integration and faster inference. However, existing heuristically predefined supervision signals in latent CoT provide limited guidance for preserving critical visual information in intermediate latent states. To address this limitation, we propose CrystaL (Crystallized Latent Reasoning), a single-stage framework with two paths to process intact and corrupted images, respectively. By explicitly aligning the attention patterns and prediction distributions across the two paths, CrystaL crystallizes latent representations into task-relevant visual semantics, without relying on auxiliary annotations or external modules. Extensive experiments on perception-intensive benchmarks demonstrate that CrystaL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving substantial gains in fine-grained visual understanding while maintaining robust reasoning capabilities.

### Evaluating Proactive Risk Awareness of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Xuan Luo, Yubin Chen, Zhiyu Hou, Linpu Yu, Geng Tu, Jing Li, Ruifeng Xu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:00:00Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in everyday decision-making, their safety responsibilities extend beyond reacting to explicit harmful intent toward anticipating unintended but consequential risks. In this work, we introduce a proactive risk awareness evaluation framework that measures whether LLMs can anticipate potential harms and provide warnings before damage occurs. We construct the Butterfly dataset to instantiate this framework in the environmental and ecological domain. It contains 1,094 queries that simulate ordinary solution-seeking activities whose responses may induce latent ecological impact. Through experiments across five widely used LLMs, we analyze the effects of response length, languages, and modality. Experimental results reveal consistent, significant declines in proactive awareness under length-restricted responses, cross-lingual similarities, and persistent blind spots in (multimodal) species protection. These findings highlight a critical gap between current safety alignment and the requirements of real-world ecological responsibility, underscoring the need for proactive safeguards in LLM deployment.

### Characterizing LLM Inference Energy-Performance Tradeoffs across Workloads and GPU Scaling
**Authors**: Paul Joe Maliakel, Shashikant Ilager, Ivona Brandic

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:57:10Z

**Summary**: LLM inference exhibits substantial variability across queries and execution phases, yet inference configurations are often applied uniformly. We present a measurement-driven characterization of workload heterogeneity and energy-performance behavior of LLM inference under GPU dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). We evaluate five decoder-only LLMs (1B-32B parameters) across four NLP benchmarks using a controlled offline setup. We show that lightweight semantic features predict inference difficulty better than input length, with 44.5% of queries achieving comparable quality across model sizes. At the hardware level, the decode phase dominates inference time (77-91%) and is largely insensitive to GPU frequency. Consequently, reducing GPU frequency from 2842 MHz to 180 MHz achieves an average of 42% energy savings with only a 1-6% latency increase. We further provide a use case with an upper-bound analysis of the potential benefits of combining workload-aware model selection with phase-aware DVFS, motivating future energy-efficient LLM inference systems.

### "Don't Do That!": Guiding Embodied Systems through Large Language Model-based Constraint Generation
**Authors**: Amin Seffo, Aladin Djuhera, Masataro Asai, Holger Boche

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:56:22Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

### Context-Aware Mapping of 2D Drawing Annotations to 3D CAD Features Using LLM-Assisted Reasoning for Manufacturing Automation
**Authors**: Muhammad Tayyab Khan, Lequn Chen, Wenhe Feng, Seung Ki Moon

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:55:20Z

**Summary**: Manufacturing automation in process planning, inspection planning, and digital-thread integration depends on a unified specification that binds the geometric features of a 3D CAD model to the geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) callouts, datum definitions, and surface requirements carried by the corresponding 2D engineering drawing. Although Model-Based Definition (MBD) allows such specifications to be embedded directly in 3D models, 2D drawings remain the primary carrier of manufacturing intent in automotive, aerospace, shipbuilding, and heavy-machinery industries. Correctly linking drawing annotations to the corresponding 3D features is difficult because of contextual ambiguity, repeated feature patterns, and the need for transparent and traceable decisions. This paper presents a deterministic-first, context-aware framework that maps 2D drawing entities to 3D CAD features to produce a unified manufacturing specification. Drawing callouts are first semantically enriched and then scored against candidate features using an interpretable metric that combines type compatibility, tolerance-aware dimensional agreement, and conservative context consistency, along with engineering-domain heuristics. When deterministic scoring cannot resolve an ambiguity, the system escalates to multimodal and constrained large-language-model reasoning, followed by a single human-in-the-loop (HITL) review step. Experiments on 20 real CAD-drawing pairs achieve a mean precision of 83.67%, recall of 90.46%, and F1 score of 86.29%. An ablation study shows that each pipeline component contributes to overall accuracy, with the full system outperforming all reduced variants. By prioritizing deterministic rules, clear decision tracking, and retaining unresolved cases for human review, the framework provides a practical foundation for downstream manufacturing automation in real-world industrial environments.

### Linear Reasoning vs. Proof by Cases: Obstacles for Large Language Models in FOL Problem Solving
**Authors**: Yuliang Ji, Fuchen Shen, Jian Wu, Qiujie Xie, Yue Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:53:34Z

**Summary**: To comprehensively evaluate the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have introduced abundant mathematical reasoning datasets. However, most existing datasets primarily focus on linear reasoning, neglecting other parts such as proof by contradiction and proof by cases, which are crucial for investigating LLMs' reasoning abilities. To address this limitation, we first introduce a novel first-order logic (FOL) dataset named PC-FOL, annotated by professional mathematicians, focusing on case-based reasoning problems. All instances in this dataset are equipped with a manually written natural language proof, clearly distinguishing it from conventional linear reasoning datasets. Our experimental results over leading LLMs demonstrate a substantial performance gap between linear reasoning and case-based reasoning problems. To further investigate this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis grounded in graphical model, which provides an explanation for the observed disparity between the two types of reasoning problems. We hope this work can reveal the core challenges in the field of automated natural language mathematical proof generation, paving the way for future research.

### Using the Path of Least Resistance to Explain Deep Networks
**Authors**: Sina Salek, Joseph Enguehard

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:53:26Z

**Summary**: Integrated Gradients (IG), a widely used axiomatic path-based attribution method, assigns importance scores to input features by integrating model gradients along a straight path from a baseline to the input. While effective in some cases, we show that straight paths can lead to flawed attributions. In this paper, we identify the cause of these misattributions and propose an alternative approach that equips the input space with a model-induced Riemannian metric (derived from the explained model's Jacobian) and computes attributions by integrating gradients along geodesics under this metric. We call this method Geodesic Integrated Gradients (GIG). To approximate geodesic paths, we introduce two techniques: a k-Nearest Neighbours-based approach for smaller models and a Stochastic Variational Inference-based method for larger ones. Additionally, we propose a new axiom, No-Cancellation Completeness (NCC), which strengthens completeness by ruling out feature-wise cancellation. We prove that, for path-based attributions under the model-induced metric, NCC holds if and only if the integration path is a geodesic. Through experiments on both synthetic and real-world image classification data, we provide empirical evidence supporting our theoretical analysis and showing that GIG produces more faithful attributions than existing methods, including IG, on the benchmarks considered.

### Programming by Backprop: An Instruction is Worth 100 Examples When Finetuning LLMs
**Authors**: Jonathan Cook, Silvia Sapora, Arash Ahmadian, Akbir Khan, Tim Rocktaschel, Jakob Foerster, Laura Ruis

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:51:33Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained to acquire behaviours from demonstrations or experience, yet much of their training data is declarative: instructions, rules, and descriptions that specify behaviours without showing how to execute them. We introduce Programming by Backprop (PBB): a training regime that enables LLMs to acquire procedural knowledge (i.e., reusable behaviours) from declarative instructions encountered during training. With PBB, instructions in training data provide an opportunity to `program' specific behaviours into model weights. The core principle underpinning PBB is the separation of learning how instructions map to behaviour from internalising new instructions. We devise two distinct PBB curricula that leverage this principle. Through controlled experiments across two domains (algorithmic execution from Python source code and text generation from context-free grammars), we demonstrate the benefit of these curricula over training on a homogeneous data mixture. Crucially, PBB is highly sample efficient, with a single instruction substituting for up to 100 execution examples. Though execution of instructions in training data remains less reliable than when instructions are given in-context, our results demonstrate that procedural knowledge can be noisily `programmed' into LLMs through PBB, with important implications for data curation and safety.

### Blackbird Language Matrices: A Framework to Investigate the Linguistic Competence of Language Models
**Authors**: Paola Merlo, Chunyang Jiang, Giuseppe Samo, Vivi Nastase

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:45:08Z

**Summary**: This article describes a novel language task, the Blackbird Language Matrices (BLM) task, inspired by intelligence tests, and illustrates the BLM datasets, their construction and benchmarking, and targeted experiments on chunking and systematicity. BLMs are multiple-choice problems, structured at multiple levels: within each sentence, across the input sequence, within each candidate answer. Because of their rich structure, these curated, but naturalistic datasets are key to answer some core questions about current large language models abilities: do LLMs detect linguistic objects and their properties? Do they detect and use systematic patterns across sentences? Are they more prone to linguistic or reasoning errors, and how do these interact?   We show that BLMs, while challenging, can be solved at good levels of performance, in more than one language, with simple baseline models or, at better performance levels, with more tailored models. We show that their representations contain the grammatical objects and attributes relevant to solve a linguistic task. We also show that these solutions are reached by detecting systematic patterns across sentences.   The paper supports the point of view that curated, structured datasets support multi-faceted investigations of properties of language and large language models. Because they present a curated, articulated structure, because they comprise both learning contexts and expected answers, and because they are partly built by hand, BLMs fall in the category of datasets that can support explainability investigations, and be useful to ask why large language models behave the way they do.

### TouchGuide: Inference-Time Steering of Visuomotor Policies via Touch Guidance

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:42:37Z

**Summary**: Fine-grained and contact-rich manipulation remain challenging for robots, largely due to the underutilization of tactile feedback. To address this, we introduce TouchGuide, a novel cross-policy visuo-tactile fusion paradigm that fuses modalities within a low-dimensional action space. Specifically, TouchGuide operates in two stages to guide a pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching visuomotor policy at inference time. First, the policy produces a coarse, visually-plausible action using only visual inputs during early sampling. Second, a task-specific Contact Physical Model (CPM) provides tactile guidance to steer and refine the action, ensuring it aligns with realistic physical contact conditions. Trained through contrastive learning on limited expert demonstrations, the CPM provides a tactile-informed feasibility score to steer the sampling process toward refined actions that satisfy physical contact constraints. Furthermore, to facilitate TouchGuide training with high-quality and cost-effective data, we introduce TacUMI, a data collection system. TacUMI achieves a favorable trade-off between precision and affordability; by leveraging rigid fingertips, it obtains direct tactile feedback, thereby enabling the collection of reliable tactile data. Extensive experiments on five challenging contact-rich tasks, such as shoe lacing and chip handover, show that TouchGuide consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art visuo-tactile policies.

### Sensory-Motor Control with Large Language Models via Iterative Policy Refinement
**Authors**: Jônata Tyska Carvalho, Stefano Nolfi

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:36:12Z

**Summary**: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control embodied agents through the generation of control policies that directly map continuous observation vectors to continuous action vectors. At the outset, the LLMs generate a control strategy based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation. The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. The approach proves effective with relatively compact models such as GPT-oss:120b and Qwen2.5:72b. In most cases, it successfully identifies optimal or near-optimal solutions by integrating symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

### KBVQ-MoE: KLT-guided SVD with Bias-Corrected Vector Quantization for MoE Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zukang Xu, Zhixiong Zhao, Xing Hu, Zhixuan Chen, Dawei Yang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:35:31Z

**Summary**: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have achieved great success by significantly improving performance while maintaining computational efficiency through sparse expert activation. However, their enormous parameter sizes and memory demands pose major challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Vector Quantization (VQ) offers a promising approach for ultra-low-bit compression in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging a codebook, where weight vectors are mapped to the most similar discrete codewords. Yet, directly applying VQ to MoEs often leads to substantial performance degradation due to two critical obstacles: (1) redundant representations among experts cause VQ to repeatedly quantize similar representations for each expert, resulting in inefficient use of limited codebook capacity; and (2) cumulative output bias is amplified by expert aggregation in MoE layers, leading to distributional shifts in the quantized outputs. To address these issues, we propose KBVQ-MoE, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit quantization for MoE-based LLMs. KBVQ-MoE integrates two techniques: (1) input-driven redundancy elimination, where a Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) guided singular value decomposition (SVD) extracts dominant weight components and shares them across experts; and (2) bias-corrected output stabilization, where vector quantization is applied only to expert-specific (non-redundant) representations and the quantized outputs are corrected via channel-wise affine compensation. Experiments on various MoE LLMs demonstrate that KBVQ-MoE preserves accuracy substantially better than existing quantization methods. For example, 3-bit quantization of Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B achieves an average accuracy of 67.99, nearly identical to the FP16 baseline of 68.07, underscoring KBVQ-MoE's potential for efficient deployment on edge devices and other resource-constrained platforms.

### A Simple and Efficient Jailbreak Method Exploiting LLMs' Helpfulness
**Authors**: Xuan Luo, Yue Wang, Zefeng He, Geng Tu, Jing Li, Ruifeng Xu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:28:30Z

**Summary**: This study reveals a critical safety blind spot in modern LLMs: learning-style queries, which closely resemble ordinary educational questions, can reliably elicit harmful responses. The learning-style queries are constructed by a novel reframing paradigm: HILL (Hiding Intention by Learning from LLMs). The deterministic, model-agnostic reframing framework is composed of 4 conceptual components: 1) key concept, 2) exploratory transformation, 3) detail-oriented inquiry, and optionally 4) hypotheticality. Further, new metrics are introduced to thoroughly evaluate the efficiency and harmfulness of jailbreak methods. Experiments on the AdvBench dataset across a wide range of models demonstrate HILL's strong generalizability. It achieves top attack success rates on the majority of models and across malicious categories while maintaining high efficiency with concise prompts. On the other hand, results of various defense methods show the robustness of HILL, with most defenses having mediocre effects or even increasing the attack success rates. In addition, the assessment of defenses on the constructed safe prompts reveals inherent limitations of LLMs' safety mechanisms and flaws in the defense methods. This work exposes significant vulnerabilities of safety measures against learning-style elicitation, highlighting a critical challenge of fulfilling both helpfulness and safety alignments.

### The Art of Efficient Reasoning: Data, Reward, and Optimization
**Authors**: Taiqiang Wu, Zenan Zu, Bo Zhou, Ngai Wong

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:28:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) consistently benefit from scaled Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but also suffer from heavy computational overhead. To address this issue, efficient reasoning aims to incentivize short yet accurate thinking trajectories, typically through reward shaping with Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we systematically investigate the mechanics of efficient reasoning for LLMs. For comprehensive evaluation, we advocate for more fine-grained metrics, including length distribution conditioned on correctness and performance across a wide spectrum of token budgets ranging from 2k to 32k. First, we reveal that the training process follows a two-stage paradigm: length adaptation and reasoning refinement. After that, we conduct extensive experiments (about 0.2 million GPU hours) in a unified protocol, deconstructing training prompts and rollouts, reward shaping, and optimization strategies. In particular, a key finding is to train on relatively easier prompts, ensuring the density of positive reward signals and thus avoiding the length collapse. Meanwhile, the learned length bias can be generalized across domains. We distill all findings into valuable insights and practical guidelines, and further validate them across the Qwen3 series, ranging from 0.6B to 30B, demonstrating the robustness and generalization.

### A Theoretical Framework for Modular Learning of Robust Generative Models
**Authors**: Corinna Cortes, Mehryar Mohri, Yutao Zhong

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:25:20Z

**Summary**: Training large-scale generative models is resource-intensive and relies heavily on heuristic dataset weighting. We address two fundamental questions: Can we train Large Language Models (LLMs) modularly-combining small, domain-specific experts to match monolithic performance-and can we do so robustly for any data mixture, eliminating heuristic tuning? We present a theoretical framework for modular generative modeling where a set of pre-trained experts are combined via a gating mechanism. We define the space of normalized gating functions, $G_{1}$, and formulate the problem as a minimax game to find a single robust gate that minimizes divergence to the worst-case data mixture. We prove the existence of such a robust gate using Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and show that modularity acts as a strong regularizer, with generalization bounds scaling with the lightweight gate's complexity. Furthermore, we prove that this modular approach can theoretically outperform models retrained on aggregate data, with the gap characterized by the Jensen-Shannon Divergence. Finally, we introduce a scalable Stochastic Primal-Dual algorithm and a Structural Distillation method for efficient inference. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm that our modular architecture effectively mitigates gradient conflict and can robustly outperform monolithic baselines.

### SEFL: A Framework for Generating Synthetic Educational Assignment Feedback with LLM Agents
**Authors**: Mike Zhang, Amalie Pernille Dilling, Léon Gondelman, Niels Erik Ruan Lyngdorf, Euan D. Lindsay, Johannes Bjerva

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:17:40Z

**Summary**: Providing high-quality feedback on student assignments is crucial for student success, but it is heavily limited by time and budgetary constraints. In this work, we introduce Synthetic Educational Feedback Loops (SEFL), a synthetic data framework designed to generate data that resembles immediate, on-demand feedback at scale without relying on extensive, real-world student assignments and teacher feedback. To obtain this type of data, two large language models (LLMs) operate in a teacher-student role to simulate assignment completion and formative feedback, generating 19.8K synthetic pairs of student work and corresponding critiques and actionable improvements from a teacher. With this data, we fine-tune smaller, more computationally efficient LLMs on these synthetic pairs, enabling them to replicate key features of high-quality, goal-oriented feedback. Through comprehensive evaluations with three LLM judges and three human experts, across a subset of 900 outputs, we demonstrate that SEFL-tuned models outperform both their untuned counterparts and an existing baseline in terms of feedback quality. The potential for societal impact is reinforced by extensive qualitative comments and ratings from human stakeholders -- both students and higher education instructors. SEFL has the potential to transform feedback processes for higher education and beyond.

### Empathy Modeling in Active Inference Agents for Perspective-Taking and Alignment
**Authors**: Albarracin Mahault, Mikeda Anna, Jimenez Rodriguez Alejandro, Namjoshi Sanjeev, Sakthivadivel Dalton, Pae Hongju, Shah Harshil, Wilson Philip

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:17:08Z

**Summary**: Artificial agents capable of understanding and aligning with others' intentions are essential for safe and socially robust artificial intelligence. We introduce a computational framework for empathy in active inference agents, grounded in explicit perspective-taking via self-other model transformation.   We instantiate this framework in a multi-agent Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma and show that empathic perspective-taking induces robust cooperation without explicit communication or reward shaping. Cooperation emerges only when empathy is reciprocated, while asymmetric empathy leads to systematic exploitation. Beyond equilibrium outcomes, empathic agents exhibit synchronized behavior, rapid recovery from stochastic defections, and joint intentional dynamics resembling apology-forgiveness cycles. Near empathy symmetry, interactions display long transients and elevated variance, consistent with critical dynamics near regime boundaries.   We further examine a learning-enabled variant in which agents infer opponent type via Bayesian updating. While opponent models converge rapidly, long-run cooperation remains primarily determined by the empathy parameter, indicating that cooperation is driven by empathic structure rather than learned reciprocity. Empathy functions as a structural prior over social interaction, shaping coordination stability, robustness, and temporal dynamics. The proposed framework highlights active inference as a principled foundation for socially aligned artificial agents that coordinate through internal simulation rather than behavioral mimicry.

### On the accuracy of posterior recovery with neural network emulators
**Authors**: H. T. J. Bevins, T. Gessey-Jones, W. J. Handley

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:17:00Z

**Summary**: Neural network emulators are widely used in astrophysics and cosmology to approximate complex simulations inside Bayesian inference loops. Ad hoc rules of thumb are often used to justify the emulator accuracy required for reliable posterior recovery. We provide a theoretically motivated limit on the maximum amount of incorrect information inferred by using an emulator with a given accuracy. Under assumptions of linearity in the model, uncorrelated noise in the data and a Gaussian likelihood function, we demonstrate that the difference between the true underlying posterior and the recovered posterior can be quantified via a Kullback-Leibler divergence. We demonstrate how this limit can be used in the field of 21-cm cosmology by comparing the posteriors recovered when fitting mock data sets generated with the 1D radiative transfer code ARES directly with the simulation code and separately with an emulator. This paper is partly in response to and builds upon recent discussions in the literature which call into question the use of emulators in Bayesian inference pipelines. Upon repeating some aspects of these analyses, we find these concerns quantitatively unjustified, with accurate posterior recovery possible even when the mean RMSE error for the emulator is approximately 20% of the magnitude of the noise in the data. For the purposes of community reproducibility, we make our analysis code public at this link https://github.com/htjb/validating_posteriors.

### Architecting AgentOS: From Token-Level Context to Emergent System-Level Intelligence
**Authors**: ChengYou Li, XiaoDong Liu, XiangBao Meng, XinYu Zhao

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:12:21Z

**Summary**: The paradigm of Large Language Models is undergoing a fundamental transition from static inference engines to dynamic autonomous cognitive systems.While current research primarily focuses on scaling context windows or optimizing prompt engineering the theoretical bridge between micro scale token processing and macro scale systemic intelligence remains fragmented.This paper proposes AgentOS,a holistic conceptual framework that redefines the LLM as a "Reasoning Kernel" governed by structured operating system logic.Central to this architecture is Deep Context Management which conceptualizes the context window as an Addressable Semantic Space rather than a passive buffer.We systematically deconstruct the transition from discrete sequences to coherent cognitive states introducing mechanisms for Semantic Slicing and Temporal Alignment to mitigate cognitive drift in multi-agent orchestration.By mapping classical OS abstractions such as memory paging interrupt handling and process scheduling onto LLM native constructs, this review provides a rigorous roadmap for architecting resilient scalable and self-evolving cognitive environments.Our analysis asserts that the next frontier of AGI development lies in the architectural efficiency of system-level coordination.

**Summary**: This study presents the Surrogate Engine for Crop Simulations (SECS) a group of deep-learning models that emulate the process-based ECroPS model using only daily maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation. In this study we emulate grain maize and spring barley. Trained on ERA5-forced ECroPS simulations, SECS reproduces crop growth dynamics and harvest timing with high fidelity. Critically, SECS extremely reduces computational costs enabling ensemble-scale inference suitable for operational pipelines. When driven by seasonal data, SECS captures the interannual and spatial patterns of crop stress across Europe and aligns with independent monitoring, supporting its use as a probabilistic Areas of Concern indicator for early warning. Under CMIP6 SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, SECS consistently identifies the Mediterranean basin as a persistent hotspot of yield risk through mid-century, with central-northern Europe showing mixed signals. These results demonstrate that a streamlined, data-efficient emulator can provide robust seasonal-to-climate risk assessments at continental scale.

### HELP: HyperNode Expansion and Logical Path-Guided Evidence Localization for Accurate and Efficient GraphRAG
**Authors**: Yuqi Huang, Ning Liao, Kai Yang, Anning Hu, Shengchao Hu, Xiaoxing Wang, Junchi Yan

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:05:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with inherent knowledge boundaries and hallucinations, limiting their reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues, it frequently overlooks structural interdependencies essential for multi-hop reasoning. Graph-based RAG approaches attempt to bridge this gap, yet they typically face trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency due to challenges such as costly graph traversals and semantic noise in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we propose HyperNode Expansion and Logical Path-Guided Evidence Localization strategies for GraphRAG (HELP), a novel framework designed to balance accuracy with practical efficiency through two core strategies: 1) HyperNode Expansion, which iteratively chains knowledge triplets into coherent reasoning paths abstracted as HyperNodes to capture complex structural dependencies and ensure retrieval accuracy; and 2) Logical Path-Guided Evidence Localization, which leverages precomputed graph-text correlations to map these paths directly to the corpus for superior efficiency. HELP avoids expensive random walks and semantic distortion, preserving knowledge integrity while drastically reducing retrieval latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HELP achieves competitive performance across multiple simple and multi-hop QA benchmarks and up to a 28.8$\times$ speedup over leading Graph-based RAG baselines.

### DVLA-RL: Dual-Level Vision-Language Alignment with Reinforcement Learning Gating for Few-Shot Learning
**Authors**: Wenhao Li, Xianjing Meng, Qiangchang Wang, Zhongyi Han, Zhibin Wu, Yilong Yin

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:56:22Z

**Summary**: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to generalize to novel categories with only a few samples. Recent approaches incorporate large language models (LLMs) to enrich visual representations with semantic embeddings derived from class names. However, they overlook progressive and adaptive alignment between vision and language from low-level to high-level semantics, resulting in limited semantic gains. To address these challenges, we propose Dual-level Vision-Language Alignment with Reinforcement Learning gating (DVLA-RL), which consists of Dual-level Semantic Construction (DSC) and RL-gated Attention (RLA). Specifically, DSC conditions LLMs on both class names and support samples to generate discriminative attributes, progressively selects the most relevant ones, and then synthesizes them into coherent class descriptions. This process provides complementary low-level attributes and high-level descriptions, enabling both fine-grained grounding and holistic class understanding. To dynamically integrate dual-level semantics along with the visual network layers, RLA formulates cross-modal fusion as a sequential decision process. A lightweight policy trained with episodic REINFORCE adaptively adjusts the contributions of self-attention and cross-attention to integrate textual and visual tokens. As a result, shallow layers refine local attributes and deep layers emphasize global semantics, enabling more precise cross-modal alignment. This achieves class-specific discrimination and generalized representations with merely a few support samples. DVLA-RL achieves new state-of-the-art performance across nine benchmarks in three diverse FSL scenarios.

### Predicting Sentence Acceptability Judgments in Multimodal Contexts
**Authors**: Hyewon Jang, Nikolai Ilinykh, Sharid Loáiciga, Jey Han Lau, Shalom Lappin

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:54:38Z

**Summary**: Previous work has examined the capacity of deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly transformers, to predict human sentence acceptability judgments, both independently of context, and in document contexts. We consider the effect of prior exposure to visual images (i.e., visual context) on these judgments for humans and large language models (LLMs). Our results suggest that, in contrast to textual context, visual images appear to have little if any impact on human acceptability ratings. However, LLMs display the compression effect seen in previous work on human judgments in document contexts. Different sorts of LLMs are able to predict human acceptability judgments to a high degree of accuracy, but in general, their performance is slightly better when visual contexts are removed. Moreover, the distribution of LLM judgments varies among models, with Qwen resembling human patterns, and others diverging from them. LLM-generated predictions on sentence acceptability are highly correlated with their normalised log probabilities in general. However, the correlations decrease when visual contexts are present, suggesting that a higher gap exists between the internal representations of LLMs and their generated predictions in the presence of visual contexts. Our experimental work suggests interesting points of similarity and of difference between human and LLM processing of sentences in multimodal contexts.

### Understanding the Ability of LLMs to Handle Character-Level Perturbation
**Authors**: Anyuan Zhuo, Xuefei Ning, Ningyuan Li, Jingyi Zhu, Yu Wang, Pinyan Lu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:53:32Z

**Summary**: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary large language models (LLMs) against frequent character-level perturbations. We examine three types of character-level perturbations including introducing numerous typos within words, shuffling the characters in each word, and inserting a large number of invisible characters into the text. Surprisingly, even under severe perturbation, such as shuffling nearly all words character-wise to produce text that is almost unreadable to humans, or inserting invisible characters which are several times more than the visible ones as noise, many LLMs still maintain notable performance. We explore the underlying causes of this robustness and find that LLMs exhibit remarkable resilience to chaotic segmentation and fragmented tokenization. Furthermore, we examine the mechanisms by which LLMs remove perturbations to correctly comprehend text, including both implicit and explicit mechanisms for character-level perturbation. We hope that our findings on the low-level robustness of LLMs will unveil their inherent architectural strengths, reveal the potential risks of their misuse, and inform the reliable deployment of LLMs across diverse application scenarios.

### LongVideo-R1: Smart Navigation for Low-cost Long Video Understanding
**Authors**: Jihao Qiu, Lingxi Xie, Xinyue Huo, Qi Tian, Qixiang Ye

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:49:47Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the critical and underexplored challenge of long video understanding with low computational budgets. We propose LongVideo-R1, an active, reasoning-equipped multimodal large language model (MLLM) agent designed for efficient video context navigation, avoiding the redundancy of exhaustive search. At the core of LongVideo-R1 lies a reasoning module that leverages high-level visual cues to infer the most informative video clip for subsequent processing. During inference, the agent initiates traversal from top-level visual summaries and iteratively refines its focus, immediately halting the exploration process upon acquiring sufficient knowledge to answer the query. To facilitate training, we first extract hierarchical video captions from CGBench, a video corpus with grounding annotations, and guide GPT-5 to generate 33K high-quality chain-of-thought-with-tool trajectories. The LongVideo-R1 agent is fine-tuned upon the Qwen-3-8B model through a two-stage paradigm: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL), where RL employs a specifically designed reward function to maximize selective and efficient clip navigation. Experiments on multiple long video benchmarks validate the effectiveness of name, which enjoys superior tradeoff between QA accuracy and efficiency. All curated data and source code are provided in the supplementary material and will be made publicly available. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/qiujihao19/LongVideo-R1

### From Isolation to Integration: Building an Adaptive Expert Forest for Pre-Trained Model-based Class-Incremental Learning
**Authors**: Ruiqi Liu, Boyu Diao, Hangda Liu, Zhulin An, Fei Wang, Yongjun Xu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:48:13Z

**Summary**: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to learn new classes without forgetting old ones. A common method is to freeze a pre-trained model and train a new, lightweight adapter for each task. While this prevents forgetting, it treats the learned knowledge as a simple, unstructured collection and fails to use the relationships between tasks. To this end, we propose the Semantic-guided Adaptive Expert Forest (SAEF), a new method that organizes adapters into a structured hierarchy for better knowledge sharing. SAEF first groups tasks into conceptual clusters based on their semantic relationships. Then, within each cluster, it builds a balanced expert tree by creating new adapters from merging the adapters of similar tasks. At inference time, SAEF finds and activates a set of relevant experts from the forest for any given input. The final prediction is made by combining the outputs of these activated experts, weighted by how confident each expert is. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that SAEF achieves SOTA performance.

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:44:33Z

**Summary**: An extensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up campaign of the Type IIb SN 2022ngb is presented in the article. Through detailed modeling of this dataset, we aim to constrain the key physical parameters of the explosion, infer the nature of the progenitor star and its environment, and probe the dynamical properties of the ejecta. We analyze photometric and spectroscopic data of SN 2022ngb. By constructing and modeling the bolometric light curve with semi-analytic models, we estimate the primary explosion parameters. The spectroscopic data are compared with those of well-studied SNe IIb and NLTE models to constrain the properties of the progenitor and the structure of the resulting ejecta. SN 2022ngb is a low-luminosity SN IIb with a peak bolometric luminosity of L_bol = 7.76 (+1.15/-1.00) x 10^41 erg/s and a V-band rising time of 24.32 +/- 0.50 days. Light curve modeling indicates an ejecta mass of ~2.9-3.2 M_sun, an explosion energy of ~1.4 x 10^51 erg, and a low synthesized 56Ni mass of ~0.045 M_sun. Nebular phase spectra exhibit asymmetric line profiles, pointing to a non-spherical explosion and an anisotropic distribution of radioactive material. Our analysis reveals a relatively compact stripped-envelope progenitor with a pre-SN mass of approximately 4.7 M_sun (corresponding to a 15-16 M_sun ZAMS star). Our analysis suggests that SN 2022ngb originated from the explosion of a moderate-mass relatively compact, stripped-envelope star in a binary system. The asymmetries inferred from the nebular phase spectral line features suggest a non-spherical explosion.

### Collective Phonon Mixing and Eigenvector Transport Under Isotope Substitution
**Authors**: Jeff Armstrong, Hamish Cavaye, Pankaj Sharma, Matthew E. Potter

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:43:28Z

**Summary**: Isotopic substitution modifies nuclear masses without altering the electronic potential energy surface to first order and is therefore often interpreted as a simple rescaling of vibrational frequencies. In solids with dense phonon manifolds, however, mass substitution acts as a parametric Hermitian deformation of the mass-weighted dynamical matrix, generating a continuous family of eigenproblems whose eigenvectors can undergo substantial rotation within coupled subspaces. Here we investigate protiated and deuterated ZIF-8 using inelastic neutron scattering and density functional theory lattice-dynamics calculations. While many vibrational modes exhibit near-ideal mass scaling and preserve their character across isotopic endpoints, modes embedded in spectrally congested regions display pronounced redistribution of vibrational character that cannot be inferred from frequency shifts alone. Because inelastic neutron scattering intensity is directly weighted by hydrogen displacement amplitude, spectral sparsity and congestion provide experimental indicators of predictable frequency renormalisation or susceptibility to qualitative eigenvector reorganisation under deuteration. To establish physically meaningful mode correspondence, we develop an adiabatic eigenvector-continuation framework with overlap-based tracking and explicit stability diagnostics. These results show that vibrational identity in complex framework materials is best understood as a continuous trajectory in eigenvector space and provide a general framework for analysing isotope-induced spectral flow in dense phonon systems.

### A Salpeter IMF and an NFW halo: Disentangling the dark and stellar mass through precise lens modelling of a double-source-plane system reinforces the canonical model of elliptical galaxies
**Authors**: Tian Li, Thomas E. Collett, Coleman M. Krawczyk, Giovanni Granata, Wolfgang J. R. Enzi, Daniel J. Ballard, Natalie E. P. Lines, Ana Sainz de Murieta, Luke Weisenbach, Dan Ryczanowski

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:27:37Z

**Summary**: We present a strong lensing analysis of the double source plane lens J0946+1006 (colloquially "Jackpot" lens) to measure the inner dark matter density profile, the stellar-to-halo mass ratio, and the stellar initial mass function normalisation using a two component stellar plus dark matter mass model. The stellar mass follows a multi-Gaussian expansion light model with a free global mass-to-light ratio and an allowed radial $M/L$ gradient, while the dark matter is described by an elliptical generalised NFW halo. The double-source-plane geometry provides additional leverage against the mass-sheet transformation and helps constrain the radial mass profile. Despite allowing both a radial stellar $M/L$ gradient and a generalised NFW halo, the data prefer the canonical picture: an approximately constant stellar mass-to-light ratio with a Salpeter-like IMF normalisation, and a dark matter halo consistent with NFW. We infer $M_{\star} = 4.4^{+0.25}_{-0.39}\times 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$ and an inner halo slope $γ_{\rm in}^{\rm halo} = 1.04^{+0.10}_{-0.14}$. The halo mass is $M_{200}^{\rm halo} = 1.11^{+0.37}_{-0.32}\times 10^{13}\,M_{\odot}$, implying $\log_{10}(M_{200}/M_{\star})=1.41^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$. At fixed halo mass, the inferred stellar mass lies $\sim0.1$ dex above typical literature stellar halo mass relations at similar redshift, which is comparable to the intrinsic scatter of these relations. We expect this approach to provide a practical template for future dark matter studies with the large double-source-plane lens samples from Euclid.

### Diagnosing Causal Reasoning in Vision-Language Models via Structured Relevance Graphs
**Authors**: Dhita Putri Pratama, Soyeon Caren Han, Yihao Ding

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:20:07Z

**Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on visual question answering benchmarks, yet often rely on spurious correlations rather than genuine causal reasoning. Existing evaluations primarily assess the correctness of the answers, making it unclear whether failures arise from limited reasoning capability or from misidentifying causally relevant information. We introduce Vision-Language Causal Graphs (VLCGs), a structured, query-conditioned representation that explicitly encodes causally relevant objects, attributes, relations, and scene-grounded assumptions. Building on this representation, we present ViLCaR, a diagnostic benchmark comprising tasks for Causal Attribution, Causal Inference, and Question Answering, along with graph-aligned evaluation metrics that assess relevance identification beyond final answer accuracy. Experiments in state-of-the-art LVLMs show that injecting structured relevance information significantly improves attribution and inference consistency compared to zero-shot and standard in-context learning. These findings suggest that current limitations in LVLM causal reasoning stem primarily from insufficient structural guidance rather than a lack of reasoning capacity.

### When LLMs Enter Everyday Feminism on Chinese Social Media: Opportunities and Risks for Women's Empowerment
**Authors**: Runhua Zhang, Ziqi Pan, Kangyu Yuan, Qiaoyi Chen, Yulin Tian, Huamin Qu, Xiaojuan Ma

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:19:26Z

**Summary**: Everyday digital feminism refers to the ordinary, often pragmatic ways women articulate lived experiences and cultivate solidarity in online spaces. In China, such practices flourish on RedNote through discussions under hashtags like ''women's growth''. Recently, DeepSeek-generated content has been taken up as a new voice in these conversations. Given widely recognized gender biases in LLMs, this raises critical concerns about how LLMs interact with everyday feminist practices. Through an analysis of 430 RedNote posts, 139 shared DeepSeek responses, and 3211 comments, we found that users predominantly welcomed DeepSeek's advice. Yet feminist critical discourse analysis revealed that these responses primarily encouraged women to self-optimize and pursue achievements within prevailing norms rather than challenge them. By interpreting this case, we discuss the opportunities and risks that LLMs introduce for everyday feminism as a pathway toward women's empowerment, and offer design implications for leveraging LLMs to better support such practices.

### Symbol-Aware Precoder Design for Physical-Layer Anonymous Communications
**Authors**: Yu Li, Milad Tatar Mamaghani, Xiangyun Zhou, Nan Yang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:18:47Z

**Summary**: Physical-layer characteristics, such as channel state information (CSI) and transmitter noise induced by hardware impairments, are often uniquely associated with a transmitter. This paper investigates transmitter anonymity at the physical layer from a signal design perspective. We consider an anonymous communication problem where the receiver should reliably decode the signal from the transmitter but should not make use of the signal to infer the transmitter's identity.Transmitter anonymity is quantified using a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD)-based metric, which enables the formulation of explicit anonymity constraints in the precoder design.We then propose an anonymous symbol-level precoding strategy that preserves reliable communication under spatial multiplexing while preventing transmitter identification. The proposed framework employs a partitioned equal-gain combining (P-EGC) scheme that leverages receiver diversity without requiring transmitter-specific CSI. Simulation results demonstrate anonymity-reliability tradeoffs across different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and numbers of data streams. Moreover, the results reveal opposite trends of anonymity with respect to transmitter-dependent noise variations in the low-SNR and high-SNR regimes.

### MUSE: Harnessing Precise and Diverse Semantics for Few-Shot Whole Slide Image Classification
**Authors**: Jiahao Xu, Sheng Huang, Xin Zhang, Zhixiong Nan, Jiajun Dong, Nankun Mu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:17:35Z

**Summary**: In computational pathology, few-shot whole slide image classification is primarily driven by the extreme scarcity of expert-labeled slides. Recent vision-language methods incorporate textual semantics generated by large language models, but treat these descriptions as static class-level priors that are shared across all samples and lack sample-wise refinement. This limits both the diversity and precision of visual-semantic alignment, hindering generalization under limited supervision. To overcome this, we propose the stochastic MUlti-view Semantic Enhancement (MUSE), a framework that first refines semantic precision via sample-wise adaptation and then enhances semantic richness through retrieval-augmented multi-view generation. Specifically, MUSE introduces Sample-wise Fine-grained Semantic Enhancement (SFSE), which yields a fine-grained semantic prior for each sample through MoE-based adaptive visual-semantic interaction. Guided by this prior, Stochastic Multi-view Model Optimization (SMMO) constructs an LLM-generated knowledge base of diverse pathological descriptions per class, then retrieves and stochastically integrates multiple matched textual views during training. These dynamically selected texts serve as enriched semantic supervisions to stochastically optimize the vision-language model, promoting robustness and mitigating overfitting. Experiments on three benchmark WSI datasets show that MUSE consistently outperforms existing vision-language baselines in few-shot settings, demonstrating that effective few-shot pathology learning requires not only richer semantic sources but also their active and sample-aware semantic optimization. Our code is available at: https://github.com/JiahaoXu-god/CVPR2026_MUSE.

### EAMET: Robust Massive Model Editing via Embedding Alignment Optimization
**Authors**: Yanbo Dai, Zhenlan Ji, Zongjie Li, Shuai Wang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:15:55Z

**Summary**: Model editing techniques are essential for efficiently updating knowledge in large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of existing approaches degrades in massive editing scenarios, particularly when evaluated with practical metrics. Their robustness is also limited in context-rich settings or when editing multiple facts of the same subject simultaneously. We attribute these failures to the embedding misalignment among knowledge items, which undermines editing reliability at scale. To address this, we propose EAMET (Embedding Alignment Model Editing in Transformers), which addresses this issue by aligning the space of key and residual embeddings. Extensive experiments across six LLMs and three datasets demonstrate that EAMET consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving about 90\% editing efficacy when editing 10k facts. Codes and datasets are publicly available at https://ybdai7.github.io/eamet-page/.

### SoK: Agentic Skills -- Beyond Tool Use in LLM Agents
**Authors**: Yanna Jiang, Delong Li, Haiyu Deng, Baihe Ma, Xu Wang, Qin Wang, Guangsheng Yu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:11:38Z

**Summary**: Agentic systems increasingly rely on reusable procedural capabilities, \textit{a.k.a., agentic skills}, to execute long-horizon workflows reliably. These capabilities are callable modules that package procedural knowledge with explicit applicability conditions, execution policies, termination criteria, and reusable interfaces. Unlike one-off plans or atomic tool calls, skills operate (and often do well) across tasks.   This paper maps the skill layer across the full lifecycle (discovery, practice, distillation, storage, composition, evaluation, and update) and introduces two complementary taxonomies. The first is a system-level set of \textbf{seven design patterns} capturing how skills are packaged and executed in practice, from metadata-driven progressive disclosure and executable code skills to self-evolving libraries and marketplace distribution. The second is an orthogonal \textbf{representation $\times$ scope} taxonomy describing what skills \emph{are} (natural language, code, policy, hybrid) and what environments they operate over (web, OS, software engineering, robotics).   We analyze the security and governance implications of skill-based agents, covering supply-chain risks, prompt injection via skill payloads, and trust-tiered execution, grounded by a case study of the ClawHavoc campaign in which nearly 1{,}200 malicious skills infiltrated a major agent marketplace, exfiltrating API keys, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser credentials at scale. We further survey deterministic evaluation approaches, anchored by recent benchmark evidence that curated skills can substantially improve agent success rates while self-generated skills may degrade them. We conclude with open challenges toward robust, verifiable, and certifiable skills for real-world autonomous agents.

### Oracular Programming: A Modular Foundation for Building LLM-Enabled Software
**Authors**: Jonathan Laurent, André Platzer

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:07:25Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models can solve a wide range of tasks from just a few examples, but they remain difficult to steer and lack a capability essential for building reliable software at scale: the modular composition of computations under enforceable contracts. As a result, they are typically embedded in larger software pipelines that use domain-specific knowledge to decompose tasks and improve reliability through validation and search. Yet the complexity of writing, tuning, and maintaining such pipelines has so far limited their sophistication. We propose oracular programming: a foundational paradigm for integrating traditional, explicit computations with inductive oracles such as LLMs. It rests on two directing principles: the full separation of core and search logic, and the treatment of few-shot examples as grounded and evolvable program components. Within this paradigm, experts express high-level problem-solving strategies as programs with unresolved choice points. These choice points are resolved at runtime by LLMs, which generalize from user-provided examples of correct and incorrect decisions. An oracular program is composed of three orthogonal components: a strategy that consists of a nondeterministic program with choice points that can be reified into a search tree, a policy that specifies how to navigate this tree with the help of LLM oracles, and a set of demonstrations that describe successful and unsuccessful tree navigation scenarios across diverse problem instances. Each component is expressed in a dedicated programming language and can be independently improved or substituted. We address the key programming language design challenges of modularly composing oracular programs and enforcing consistency between their components as they evolve.

### DA-Cal: Towards Cross-Domain Calibration in Semantic Segmentation
**Authors**: Wangkai Li, Rui Sun, Zhaoyang Li, Yujia Chen, Tianzhu Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:03:41Z

**Summary**: While existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods greatly enhance target domain performance in semantic segmentation, they often neglect network calibration quality, resulting in misalignment between prediction confidence and actual accuracy -- a significant risk in safety-critical applications. Our key insight emerges from observing that performance degrades substantially when soft pseudo-labels replace hard pseudo-labels in cross-domain scenarios due to poor calibration, despite the theoretical equivalence of perfectly calibrated soft pseudo-labels to hard pseudo-labels. Based on this finding, we propose DA-Cal, a dedicated cross-domain calibration framework that transforms target domain calibration into soft pseudo-label optimization. DA-Cal introduces a Meta Temperature Network to generate pixel-level calibration parameters and employs bi-level optimization to establish the relationship between soft pseudo-labels and UDA supervision, while utilizing complementary domain-mixing strategies to prevent overfitting and reduce domain discrepancies. Experiments demonstrate that DA-Cal seamlessly integrates with existing self-training frameworks across multiple UDA segmentation benchmarks, significantly improving target domain calibration while delivering performance gains without inference overhead. The code will be released.

### FinAnchor: Aligned Multi-Model Representations for Financial Prediction
**Authors**: Zirui He, Huopu Zhang, Yanguang Liu, Sirui Wu, Mengnan Du

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:02:09Z

**Summary**: Financial prediction from long documents involves significant challenges, as actionable signals are often sparse and obscured by noise, and the optimal LLM for generating embeddings varies across tasks and time periods. In this paper, we propose FinAnchor(Financial Anchored Representations), a lightweight framework that integrates embeddings from multiple LLMs without fine-tuning the underlying models. FinAnchor addresses the incompatibility of feature spaces by selecting an anchor embedding space and learning linear mappings to align representations from other models into this anchor. These aligned features are then aggregated to form a unified representation for downstream prediction. Across multiple financial NLP tasks, FinAnchor consistently outperforms strong single-model baselines and standard ensemble methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of anchoring heterogeneous representations for robust financial prediction.

### Stochastic Discount Factors with Cross-Asset Spillovers
**Authors**: Doron Avramov, Xin He

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T12:58:01Z

**Summary**: This paper develops a unified framework that links firm-level predictive signals, cross-asset spillovers, and the stochastic discount factor (SDF). Signals and spillovers are jointly estimated by maximizing the Sharpe ratio, yielding an interpretable SDF that both ranks characteristic relevance and uncovers the direction of predictive influence across assets. Out-of-sample, the SDF consistently outperforms self-predictive and expected-return benchmarks across investment universes and market states. The inferred information network highlights large, low-turnover firms as net transmitters. The framework offers a clear, economically grounded view of the informational architecture underlying cross-sectional return dynamics.

### Repurposing Synthetic Data for Fine-grained Search Agent Supervision
**Authors**: Yida Zhao, Kuan Li, Xixi Wu, Liwen Zhang, Dingchu Zhang, Baixuan Li, Maojia Song, Zhuo Chen, Chenxi Wang, Xinyu Wang, Kewei Tu, Pengjun Xie, Jingren Zhou, Yong Jiang

**Summary**: LLM-based search agents are increasingly trained on entity-centric synthetic data to solve complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, prevailing training methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) discard this rich entity information, relying instead on sparse, outcome-based rewards. This critical limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative "near-miss" samples-those with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final answer-from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals. We address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of ground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final answer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to effectively learn from these "near-misses". Experiments on diverse question-answering (QA) and deep research benchmarks show that E-GRPO consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that E-GRPO not only achieves superior accuracy but also induces more efficient reasoning policies that require fewer tool calls, demonstrating a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search agents.

### Statistical Inference for Temporal Difference Learning with Linear Function Approximation
**Authors**: Weichen Wu, Gen Li, Yuting Wei, Alessandro Rinaldo

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T12:51:18Z

**Summary**: We investigate the statistical properties of Temporal Difference (TD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert averaging, arguably one of the most widely used algorithms in reinforcement learning, for the task of estimating the parameters of the optimal linear approximation to the value function. Assuming independent samples, we make three theoretical contributions that improve upon the current state-of-the-art results: (i) we establish refined high-dimensional Berry-Esseen bounds over the class of convex sets, achieving faster rates than the best known results, and (ii) we propose and analyze a novel, computationally efficient online plug-in estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix; (iii) we derive sharper high probability convergence guarantees that depend explicitly on the asymptotic variance and hold under weaker conditions than those adopted in the literature. These results enable the construction of confidence regions and simultaneous confidence intervals for the linear parameters of the value function approximation, with guaranteed finite-sample coverage. We demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.

### Hybrid Fusion: One-Minute Efficient Training for Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Image Fusion
**Authors**: Ran Zhang, Xuanhua He, Liu Liu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T12:47:53Z

**Summary**: Image fusion seeks to integrate complementary information from multiple sources into a single, superior image. While traditional methods are fast, they lack adaptability and performance. Conversely, deep learning approaches achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results but suffer from critical inefficiencies: their reliance on slow, resource-intensive, patch-based training introduces a significant gap with full-resolution inference. We propose a novel hybrid framework that resolves this trade-off. Our method utilizes a learnable U-Net to generate a dynamic guidance map that directs a classic, fixed Laplacian pyramid fusion kernel. This decoupling of policy learning from pixel synthesis enables remarkably efficient full-resolution training, eliminating the train-inference gap. Consequently, our model achieves SOTA-comparable performance in about one minute on a RTX 4090 or two minutes on a consumer laptop GPU from scratch without any external model and demonstrates powerful zero-shot generalization across diverse tasks, from infrared-visible to medical imaging. By design, the fused output is linearly constructed solely from source information, ensuring high faithfulness for critical applications.

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:58:30Z

**Summary**: Test-time scaling methods improve the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by increasing the amount of compute used during inference to make a prediction. Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next iteration. Empirically, RSA delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA with Gemini 3 Flash attains performance near the top of the ARC-AGI-2 public leaderboard. RSA also enables Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), outperforming purely parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA. We further propose a novel aggregation-aware reinforcement learning approach that yields significant performance gains by training the model to combine solutions.

### Learning from Trials and Errors: Reflective Test-Time Planning for Embodied LLMs
**Authors**: Yining Hong, Huang Huang, Manling Li, Li Fei-Fei, Jiajun Wu, Yejin Choi

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:55:18Z

**Summary**: Embodied LLMs endow robots with high-level task reasoning, but they cannot reflect on what went wrong or why, turning deployment into a sequence of independent trials where mistakes repeat rather than accumulate into experience. Drawing upon human reflective practitioners, we introduce Reflective Test-Time Planning, which integrates two modes of reflection: \textit{reflection-in-action}, where the agent uses test-time scaling to generate and score multiple candidate actions using internal reflections before execution; and \textit{reflection-on-action}, which uses test-time training to update both its internal reflection model and its action policy based on external reflections after execution. We also include retrospective reflection, allowing the agent to re-evaluate earlier decisions and perform model updates with hindsight for proper long-horizon credit assignment. Experiments on our newly-designed Long-Horizon Household benchmark and MuJoCo Cupboard Fitting benchmark show significant gains over baseline models, with ablative studies validating the complementary roles of reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action. Qualitative analyses, including real-robot trials, highlight behavioral correction through reflection.

### On Data Engineering for Scaling LLM Terminal Capabilities
**Authors**: Renjie Pi, Grace Lam, Mohammad Shoeybi, Pooya Jannaty, Bryan Catanzaro, Wei Ping

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:51:04Z

**Summary**: Despite rapid recent progress in the terminal capabilities of large language models, the training data strategies behind state-of-the-art terminal agents remain largely undisclosed. We address this gap through a systematic study of data engineering practices for terminal agents, making two key contributions: (1) Terminal-Task-Gen, a lightweight synthetic task generation pipeline that supports seed-based and skill-based task construction, and (2) a comprehensive analysis of data and training strategies, including filtering, curriculum learning, long context training, and scaling behavior. Our pipeline yields Terminal-Corpus, a large-scale open-source dataset for terminal tasks. Using this dataset, we train Nemotron-Terminal, a family of models initialized from Qwen3(8B, 14B, 32B) that achieve substantial gains on Terminal-Bench 2.0: Nemotron-Terminal-8B improves from 2.5% to 13.0% Nemotron-Terminal-14B improves from 4.0% to 20.2%, and Nemotron-Terminal-32B improves from 3.4% to 27.4%, matching the performance of significantly larger models. To accelerate research in this domain, we open-source our model checkpoints and most of our synthetic datasets at https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-terminal.

### Why Pass@k Optimization Can Degrade Pass@1: Prompt Interference in LLM Post-training
**Authors**: Anas Barakat, Souradip Chakraborty, Khushbu Pahwa, Amrit Singh Bedi

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:43:08Z

**Summary**: Pass@k is a widely used performance metric for verifiable large language model tasks, including mathematical reasoning, code generation, and short-answer reasoning. It defines success if any of $k$ independently sampled solutions passes a verifier. This multi-sample inference metric has motivated inference-aware fine-tuning methods that directly optimize pass@$k$. However, prior work reports a recurring trade-off: pass@k improves while pass@1 degrades under such methods. This trade-off is practically important because pass@1 often remains a hard operational constraint due to latency and cost budgets, imperfect verifier coverage, and the need for a reliable single-shot fallback. We study the origin of this trade-off and provide a theoretical characterization of when pass@k policy optimization can reduce pass@1 through gradient conflict induced by prompt interference. We show that pass@$k$ policy gradients can conflict with pass@1 gradients because pass@$k$ optimization implicitly reweights prompts toward low-success prompts; when these prompts are what we term negatively interfering, their upweighting can rotate the pass@k update direction away from the pass@1 direction. We illustrate our theoretical findings with large language model experiments on verifiable mathematical reasoning tasks.

### KUDA: Knowledge Unlearning by Deviating Representation for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ce Fang, Zhikun Zhang, Min Chen, Qing Liu, Lu Zhou, Zhe Liu, Yunjun Gao

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:28:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) acquire a large amount of knowledge through pre-training on vast and diverse corpora. While this endows LLMs with strong capabilities in generation and reasoning, it amplifies risks associated with sensitive, copyrighted, or harmful content in training data. LLM unlearning, which aims to remove specific knowledge encoded within models, is a promising technique to reduce these risks. However, existing LLM unlearning methods often force LLMs to generate random or incoherent answers due to their inability to alter the encoded knowledge precisely. To achieve effective unlearning at the knowledge level of LLMs, we propose Knowledge Unlearning by Deviating representAtion (KUDA). We first utilize causal tracing to locate specific layers for target knowledge storage. We then design a new unlearning objective that induces the model's representations to deviate from its original position in the phase of knowledge removal, thus disrupting the ability to associate with the target knowledge. To resolve the optimization conflicts between forgetting and retention, we employ a relaxation null-space projection mechanism to mitigate the disruption to the representation space of retaining knowledge. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks, WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that KUDA outperforms most existing baselines by effectively balancing knowledge removal and model utility retention.

### XMorph: Explainable Brain Tumor Analysis Via LLM-Assisted Hybrid Deep Intelligence
**Authors**: Sepehr Salem Ghahfarokhi, M. Moein Esfahani, Raj Sunderraman, Vince Calhoun, Mohammed Alser

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:28:08Z

**Summary**: Deep learning has significantly advanced automated brain tumor diagnosis, yet clinical adoption remains limited by interpretability and computational constraints. Conventional models often act as opaque ''black boxes'' and fail to quantify the complex, irregular tumor boundaries that characterize malignant growth. To address these challenges, we present XMorph, an explainable and computationally efficient framework for fine-grained classification of three prominent brain tumor types: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors. We propose an Information-Weighted Boundary Normalization (IWBN) mechanism that emphasizes diagnostically relevant boundary regions alongside nonlinear chaotic and clinically validated features, enabling a richer morphological representation of tumor growth. A dual-channel explainable AI module combines GradCAM++ visual cues with LLM-generated textual rationales, translating model reasoning into clinically interpretable insights. The proposed framework achieves a classification accuracy of 96.0%, demonstrating that explainability and high performance can co-exist in AI-based medical imaging systems. The source code and materials for XMorph are all publicly available at: https://github.com/ALSER-Lab/XMorph.

### How much does context affect the accuracy of AI health advice?
**Authors**: Prashant Garg, Thiemo Fetzer

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:23:32Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to provide health advice, yet evidence on how their accuracy varies across languages, topics and information sources remains limited. We assess how linguistic and contextual factors affect the accuracy of AI-based health-claim verification. We evaluated seven widely used LLMs on two datasets: (i) 1,975 legally authorised nutrition and health claims from UK and EU regulatory registers translated into 21 languages; and (ii) 9,088 journalist-vetted public-health claims from the PUBHEALTH corpus spanning COVID-19, abortion, politics and general health, drawn from government advisories, scientific abstracts and media sources. Models classified each claim as supported or unsupported using majority voting across repeated runs. Accuracy was analysed by language, topic, source and model. Accuracy on authorised claims was highest in English and closely related European languages and declined in several widely spoken non-European languages, decreasing with syntactic distance from English. On real-world public-health claims, accuracy was substantially lower and varied systematically by topic and source. Models performed best on COVID-19 and government-attributed claims and worst on general health and scientific abstracts. High performance on English, canonical health claims masks substantial context-dependent gaps. Differences in training data exposure, editorial framing and topic-specific tuning likely contribute to these disparities, which are comparable in magnitude to cross-language differences. LLM accuracy in health-claim verification depends strongly on language, topic and information source. English-language performance does not reliably generalise across contexts, underscoring the need for multilingual, domain-specific evaluation before deployment in public-health communication.

### NoRD: A Data-Efficient Vision-Language-Action Model that Drives without Reasoning
**Authors**: Ishaan Rawal, Shubh Gupta, Yihan Hu, Wei Zhan

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:17:21Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are advancing autonomous driving by replacing modular pipelines with unified end-to-end architectures. However, current VLAs face two expensive requirements: (1) massive dataset collection, and (2) dense reasoning annotations. In this work, we address both challenges with \modelname (\textbf{No} \textbf{R}easoning for \textbf{D}riving). Compared to existing VLAs, \modelname achieves competitive performance while being fine-tuned on $<$60\% of the data and no reasoning annotations, resulting in 3$\times$ fewer tokens. We identify that standard Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fails to yield significant improvements when applied to policies trained on such small, reasoning-free datasets. We show that this limitation stems from difficulty bias, which disproportionately penalizes reward signals from scenarios that produce high-variance rollouts within GRPO. \modelname overcomes this by incorporating Dr.~GRPO, a recent algorithm designed to mitigate difficulty bias in LLMs. As a result, \modelname achieves competitive performance on Waymo and NAVSIM with a fraction of the training data and no reasoning overhead, enabling more efficient autonomous systems.

### Multi-Round Human-AI Collaboration with User-Specified Requirements
**Authors**: Sima Noorani, Shayan Kiyani, Hamed Hassani, George Pappas

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:15:39Z

**Summary**: As humans increasingly rely on multiround conversational AI for high stakes decisions, principled frameworks are needed to ensure such interactions reliably improve decision quality. We adopt a human centric view governed by two principles: counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not undermine human strengths, and complementarity, ensuring it adds value where the human is prone to err. We formalize these concepts via user defined rules, allowing users to specify exactly what harm and complementarity mean for their specific task. We then introduce an online, distribution free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces the user-specified constraints over the collaboration dynamics. We evaluate our framework across two interactive settings: LLM simulated collaboration on a medical diagnostic task and a human crowdsourcing study on a pictorial reasoning task. We show that our online procedure maintains prescribed counterfactual harm and complementarity violation rates even under nonstationary interaction dynamics. Moreover, tightening or loosening these constraints produces predictable shifts in downstream human accuracy, confirming that the two principles serve as practical levers for steering multi-round collaboration toward better decision quality without the need to model or constrain human behavior.

### Wireless-Fed Pinching-Antenna Systems with Horn Antennas
**Authors**: Hao Feng, Ming Zeng, Ebrahim Bedeer, Xingwang Li, Octavia A. Dobre, Zhiguo Ding

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:11:01Z

**Summary**: Pinching-antenna systems have recently emerged as a promising solution for enhancing coverage in high-frequency wireless communications by guiding signals through dielectric waveguides and radiating them via position-adjustable antennas. However, their practical deployment is fundamentally constrained by waveguide attenuation and line-installation requirements, which limit the achievable coverage range. To address this challenge, this paper investigates a wireless-fed pinching-antenna architecture that employs highly directional horn antennas to enable efficient coverage extension. Specifically, a full-duplex amplify-and-forward relay equipped with horn antennas is introduced between the base station and the waveguide input, which significantly improves the link budget in high-frequency bands while effectively eliminating self-interference. On this basis, we formulate a total power minimization problem subject to a quality-of-service constraint at the user equipment, involving the joint optimization of the pinching-antenna position, the relay amplification gain, and the base station transmit power. By exploiting the structure of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio, the optimal pinching-antenna position is first obtained in closed form by balancing waveguide attenuation and free-space path loss. Subsequently, closed-form expressions for the optimal relay gain and transmit power are derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms conventional systems without relaying and relay-assisted transmission with fixed antennas in terms of total power consumption.

### ActionReasoning: Robot Action Reasoning in 3D Space with LLM for Robotic Brick Stacking
**Authors**: Guangming Wang, Qizhen Ying, Yixiong Jing, Olaf Wysocki, Brian Sheil

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:07:06Z

**Summary**: Classical robotic systems typically rely on custom planners designed for constrained environments. While effective in restricted settings, these systems lack generalization capabilities, limiting the scalability of embodied AI and general-purpose robots. Recent data-driven Vision-Language-Action (VLA) approaches aim to learn policies from large-scale simulation and real-world data. However, the continuous action space of the physical world significantly exceeds the representational capacity of linguistic tokens, making it unclear if scaling data alone can yield general robotic intelligence. To address this gap, we propose ActionReasoning, an LLM-driven framework that performs explicit action reasoning to produce physics-consistent, prior-guided decisions for robotic manipulation. ActionReasoning leverages the physical priors and real-world knowledge already encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) and structures them within a multi-agent architecture. We instantiate this framework on a tractable case study of brick stacking, where the environment states are assumed to be already accurately measured. The environmental states are then serialized and passed to a multi-agent LLM framework that generates physics-aware action plans. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent LLM framework enables stable brick placement while shifting effort from low-level domain-specific coding to high-level tool invocation and prompting, highlighting its potential for broader generalization. This work introduces a promising approach to bridging perception and execution in robotic manipulation by integrating physical reasoning with LLMs.

### SELAUR: Self Evolving LLM Agent via Uncertainty-aware Rewards
**Authors**: Dengjia Zhang, Xiaoou Liu, Lu Cheng, Yaqing Wang, Kenton Murray, Hua Wei

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:04:54Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as multi-step decision-making agents, where effective reward design is essential for guiding learning. Although recent work explores various forms of reward shaping and step-level credit assignment, a key signal remains largely overlooked: the intrinsic uncertainty of LLMs. Uncertainty reflects model confidence, reveals where exploration is needed, and offers valuable learning cues even in failed trajectories. We introduce SELAUR: Self Evolving LLM Agent via Uncertainty-aware Rewards, a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates uncertainty directly into the reward design. SELAUR integrates entropy-, least-confidence-, and margin-based metrics into a combined token-level uncertainty estimate, providing dense confidence-aligned supervision, and employs a failure-aware reward reshaping mechanism that injects these uncertainty signals into step- and trajectory-level rewards to improve exploration efficiency and learning stability. Experiments on two benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, show that our method consistently improves success rates over strong baselines. Ablation studies further demonstrate how uncertainty signals enhance exploration and robustness.

### Skill-Inject: Measuring Agent Vulnerability to Skill File Attacks
**Authors**: David Schmotz, Luca Beurer-Kellner, Sahar Abdelnabi, Maksym Andriushchenko

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:03:02Z

**Summary**: LLM agents are evolving rapidly, powered by code execution, tools, and the recently introduced agent skills feature. Skills allow users to extend LLM applications with specialized third-party code, knowledge, and instructions. Although this can extend agent capabilities to new domains, it creates an increasingly complex agent supply chain, offering new surfaces for prompt injection attacks. We identify skill-based prompt injection as a significant threat and introduce SkillInject, a benchmark evaluating the susceptibility of widely-used LLM agents to injections through skill files. SkillInject contains 202 injection-task pairs with attacks ranging from obviously malicious injections to subtle, context-dependent attacks hidden in otherwise legitimate instructions. We evaluate frontier LLMs on SkillInject, measuring both security in terms of harmful instruction avoidance and utility in terms of legitimate instruction compliance. Our results show that today's agents are highly vulnerable with up to 80% attack success rate with frontier models, often executing extremely harmful instructions including data exfiltration, destructive action, and ransomware-like behavior. They furthermore suggest that this problem will not be solved through model scaling or simple input filtering, but that robust agent security will require context-aware authorization frameworks. Our benchmark is available at https://www.skill-inject.com/.

### From Moderation to Mediation: Can LLMs Serve as Mediators in Online Flame Wars?
**Authors**: Dawei Li, Abdullah Alnaibari, Arslan Bisharat, Manny Sandoval, Deborah Hall, Yasin Silva, Huan Liu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T18:01:52Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for AI for good applications. As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, their potential to foster empathy and constructive dialogue becomes an important frontier for responsible AI research. This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation.

### Complexity-aware fine-tuning
**Authors**: Andrey Goncharov, Daniil Vyazhev, Petr Sychev, Edvard Khalafyan, Alexey Zaytsev

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:50:18Z

**Summary**: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across three small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.58$ vs $0.45$ average accuracy) and outperforms the distillation approach ($0.58$ vs $0.56$ average accuracy) while using $81\%$ less data.

### Scaling State-Space Models on Multiple GPUs with Tensor Parallelism
**Authors**: Anurag Dutt, Nimit Shah, Hazem Masarani, Anshul Gandhi

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:47:54Z

**Summary**: Selective state space models (SSMs) have rapidly become a compelling backbone for large language models, especially for long-context workloads. Yet in deployment, their inference performance is often bounded by the memory capacity, bandwidth, and latency limits of a single GPU, making multi-GPU execution increasingly necessary. Although tensor parallelism (TP) is widely used to scale Transformer inference, applying it to selective SSM blocks is non-trivial because the SSM mixer couples large projections with a sequence-wise recurrent state update and local mixing whose efficiency depends on preserving locality and avoiding synchronization in the critical path.   This paper presents a communication-efficient TP design for selective SSM inference that addresses three practical engineering challenges: enabling TTFT improvements via an SSM state cache across prefill and decode, partitioning the mixer's packed parameter tensor so that recurrent updates remain local while minimizing communication, and reducing TP aggregation overhead with quantized AllReduce. We evaluate on three representative SSM-based LLMs spanning pure-SSM and hybrid architectures - Mamba, Falcon-Mamba, and Zamba - on NVIDIA A6000 and A100 clusters. Our experiments show substantial throughput gains from tensor-parallel SSM inference, improving batch-request throughput by ~1.6-2.1x on 2 GPUs and ~2.6-4.0x on 4 GPUs for Mamba, with the largest benefits at long context lengths, and achieving a further ~10-18% throughput improvement from quantized all-reduce by lowering synchronization bandwidth overhead.

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:43:32Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used to solve complex tasks involving tool use, such as web browsing, code execution, and data analysis. However, current evaluation benchmarks do not adequately assess their ability to solve real-world tasks that require synthesizing information from multiple sources and inferring insights beyond simple fact retrieval. To address this, we introduce DEEPSYNTH, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate agents on realistic, time-consuming problems that combine information gathering, synthesis, and structured reasoning to produce insights. DEEPSYNTH contains 120 tasks collected across 7 domains and data sources covering 67 countries. DEEPSYNTH is constructed using a multi-stage data collection pipeline that requires annotators to collect official data sources, create hypotheses, perform manual analysis, and design tasks with verifiable answers. When evaluated on DEEPSYNTH, 11 state-of-the-art LLMs and deep research agents achieve a maximum F1 score of 8.97 and 17.5 on the LLM-judge metric, underscoring the difficulty of the benchmark. Our analysis reveals that current agents struggle with hallucinations and reasoning over large information spaces, highlighting DEEPSYNTH as a crucial benchmark for guiding future research.

**Authors**: Jose Moises Araya-Martinez, Thushar Tom, Adrián Sanchis Reig, Pablo Rey Valiente, Jens Lambrecht, Jörg Krüger

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:42:34Z

**Summary**: Object perception is fundamental for tasks such as robotic material handling and quality inspection. However, modern supervised deep-learning perception models require large datasets for robust automation under semi-uncontrolled conditions. The cost of acquiring and annotating such data for proprietary parts is a major barrier for widespread deployment. In this context, we release SynthRender, an open source framework for synthetic image generation with Guided Domain Randomization capabilities. Furthermore, we benchmark recent Reality-to-Simulation techniques for 3D asset creation from 2D images of real parts. Combined with Domain Randomization, these synthetic assets provide low-overhead, transferable data even for parts lacking 3D files. We also introduce IRIS, the Industrial Real-Sim Imagery Set, containing 32 categories with diverse textures, intra-class variation, strong inter-class similarities and about 20,000 labels. Ablations on multiple benchmarks outline guidelines for efficient data generation with SynthRender. Our method surpasses existing approaches, achieving 99.1% mAP@50 on a public robotics dataset, 98.3% mAP@50 on an automotive benchmark, and 95.3% mAP@50 on IRIS.

### ReviveMoE: Fast Recovery for Hardware Failures in Large-Scale MoE LLM Inference Deployments
**Authors**: Haley Li, Xinglu Wang, Cong Feng, Chunxu Zuo, Yanan Wang, Hei Lo, Yufei Cui, Bingji Wang, Duo Cui, Shuming Jing, Yizhou Shan, Ying Xiong, Jiannan Wang, Yong Zhang, Zhenan Fan

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:39:41Z

**Summary**: As LLM deployments scale over more hardware, the probability of a single failure in a system increases significantly, and cloud operators must consider robust countermeasures to handle these inevitable failures. A common recovery approach is to simply restart the LLM serving instance; however, this is costly in model-as-a-service (MaaS) inference settings, where reloading model weights and recompiling computation graphs can introduce significant delays to incoming requests. We propose ReviveMoE, a method for rapid failure recovery in large-scale LLM deployments without restarting the serving instance. ReviveMoE is designed to support both the traditional LLM architecture, which collocates MoE and attention on the same hardware, and the disaggregated architectures, which separate MoE from attention. Integrated into Huawei Cloud's MaaS, ReviveMoE is built on top of Huawei's xDeepServe serving platform and the XCCL communications library.

### SparkMe: Adaptive Semi-Structured Interviewing for Qualitative Insight Discovery
**Authors**: David Anugraha, Vishakh Padmakumar, Diyi Yang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:33:02Z

**Summary**: Qualitative insights from user experiences are critical for informing product and policy decisions, but collecting such data at scale is constrained by the time and availability of experts to conduct semi-structured interviews. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) to automate interviewing, yet existing systems lack a principled mechanism for balancing systematic coverage of predefined topics with adaptive exploration, or the ability to pursue follow-ups, deep dives, and emergent themes that arise organically during conversation. In this work, we formulate adaptive semi-structured interviewing as an optimization problem over the interviewer's behavior. We define interview utility as a trade-off between coverage of a predefined interview topic guide, discovery of relevant emergent themes, and interview cost measured by length. Based on this formulation, we introduce SparkMe, a multi-agent LLM interviewer that performs deliberative planning via simulated conversation rollouts to select questions with high expected utility. We evaluate SparkMe through controlled experiments with LLM-based interviewees, showing that it achieves higher interview utility, improving topic guide coverage (+4.7% over the best baseline) and eliciting richer emergent insights while using fewer conversational turns than prior LLM interviewing approaches. We further validate SparkMe in a user study with 70 participants across 7 professions on the impact of AI on their workflows. Domain experts rate SparkMe as producing high-quality adaptive interviews that surface helpful profession-specific insights not captured by prior approaches. The code, datasets, and evaluation protocols for SparkMe are available as open-source at https://github.com/SALT-NLP/SparkMe.

### "Are You Sure?": An Empirical Study of Human Perception Vulnerability in LLM-Driven Agentic Systems
**Authors**: Xinfeng Li, Shenyu Dai, Kelong Zheng, Yue Xiao, Gelei Deng, Wei Dong, Xiaofeng Wang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:23:11Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) agents are rapidly becoming trusted copilots in high-stakes domains like software development and healthcare. However, this deepening trust introduces a novel attack surface: Agent-Mediated Deception (AMD), where compromised agents are weaponized against their human users. While extensive research focuses on agent-centric threats, human susceptibility to deception by a compromised agent remains unexplored. We present the first large-scale empirical study with 303 participants to measure human susceptibility to AMD. This is based on HAT-Lab (Human-Agent Trust Laboratory), a high-fidelity research platform we develop, featuring nine carefully crafted scenarios spanning everyday and professional domains (e.g., healthcare, software development, human resources). Our 10 key findings reveal significant vulnerabilities and provide future defense perspectives. Specifically, only 8.6% of participants perceive AMD attacks, while domain experts show increased susceptibility in certain scenarios. We identify six cognitive failure modes in users and find that their risk awareness often fails to translate to protective behavior. The defense analysis reveals that effective warnings should interrupt workflows with low verification costs. With experiential learning based on HAT-Lab, over 90% of users who perceive risks report increased caution against AMD. This work provides empirical evidence and a platform for human-centric agent security research.

### AceGRPO: Adaptive Curriculum Enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization for Autonomous Machine Learning Engineering
**Authors**: Yuzhu Cai, Zexi Liu, Xinyu Zhu, Cheng Wang, Siheng Chen

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:14:22Z

**Summary**: Autonomous Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) requires agents to perform sustained, iterative optimization over long horizons. While recent LLM-based agents show promise, current prompt-based agents for MLE suffer from behavioral stagnation due to frozen parameters. Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a remedy, applying it to MLE is hindered by prohibitive execution latency and inefficient data selection. Recognizing these challenges, we propose AceGRPO with two core components: (1) Evolving Data Buffer that continuously repurposes execution traces into reusable training tasks, and (2) Adaptive Sampling guided by a Learnability Potential function, which dynamically prioritizes tasks at the agent's learning frontier to maximize learning efficiency. Leveraging AceGRPO, our trained Ace-30B model achieves a 100% valid submission rate on MLE-Bench-Lite, approaches the performance of proprietary frontier models, and outperforms larger open-source baselines (e.g., DeepSeek-V3.2), demonstrating robust capability for sustained iterative optimization. Code is available at https://github.com/yuzhu-cai/AceGRPO.

**Authors**: Huatong Song, Lisheng Huang, Shuang Sun, Jinhao Jiang, Ran Le, Daixuan Cheng, Guoxin Chen, Yiwen Hu, Zongchao Chen, Yiming Jia, Wayne Xin Zhao, Yang Song, Tao Zhang, Ji-Rong Wen

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:13:02Z

**Summary**: In this technical report, we present SWE-Master, an open-source and fully reproducible post-training framework for building effective software engineering agents. SWE-Master systematically explores the complete agent development pipeline, including teacher-trajectory synthesis and data curation, long-horizon SFT, RL with real execution feedback, and inference framework design. Starting from an open-source base model with limited initial SWE capability, SWE-Master demonstrates how systematical optimization method can elicit strong long-horizon SWE task solving abilities. We evaluate SWE-Master on SWE-bench Verified, a standard benchmark for realistic software engineering tasks. Under identical experimental settings, our approach achieves a resolve rate of 61.4\% with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, substantially outperforming existing open-source baselines. By further incorporating test-time scaling~(TTS) with LLM-based environment feedback, SWE-Master reaches 70.8\% at TTS@8, demonstrating a strong performance potential. SWE-Master provides a practical and transparent foundation for advancing reproducible research on software engineering agents. The code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/SWE-Master.

### Turning Semantics into Topology: LLM-Driven Attribute Augmentation for Collaborative Filtering
**Authors**: Junjie Meng, Ranxu zhang, Wei Wu, Rui Zhang, Chuan Qin, Qi Zhang, Qi Liu, Hui Xiong, Chao Wang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T17:01:47Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential for enhancing recommender systems through their extensive world knowledge and reasoning capabilities. However, effectively translating these semantic signals into traditional collaborative embeddings remains an open challenge. Existing approaches typically fall into two extremes: direct inference methods are computationally prohibitive for large-scale retrieval, while embedding-based methods primarily focus on unilateral feature augmentation rather than holistic collaborative signal enhancement. To bridge this gap, we propose Topology-Augmented Graph Collaborative Filtering (TAGCF), a novel framework that transforms semantic knowledge into topological connectivity. Unlike existing approaches that depend on textual features or direct interaction synthesis, TAGCF employs LLMs to infer interaction intents and underlying causal relationships from user-item pairs, representing these insights as intermediate attribute nodes within an enriched User-Attribute-Item (U-A-I) graph. Furthermore, to effectively model the heterogeneous relations in this augmented structure, we propose Adaptive Relation-weighted Graph Convolution (ARGC), which employs relation-specific prediction networks to dynamically estimate the importance of each relation type. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets and CF backbones demonstrate consistent improvements, with comprehensive evaluations including cold-start scenarios validating the effectiveness and robustness of our framework. All code will be made publicly available. For anonymous review, our code is available at the following anonymous link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AGCF-2441353190/.

### Bistatic Passive Sensing via CSI Power
**Authors**: Zhongqin Wang, J. Andrew Zhang, Kai Wu, Kuangda Chen, Min Xu, Y. Jay Guo

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:53:09Z

**Summary**: Passive object sensing with communication signals is a key enabler of perceptive mobile networks and integrated sensing and communication. In practical bistatic deployments, transmitter-receiver asynchrony and hardware impairments introduce time-varying random phase offsets in Channel State Information (CSI). Together with limited bandwidth and small antenna arrays, these effects degrade sensing accuracy. This work proposes a lightweight bistatic passive tracking and sensing framework that operates in the CSI-power domain. CSI power suppresses these offsets without explicit phase calibration, while preserving target-induced sensing cues. We show that physically admissible constraints in the spatial-frequency domain induced by transmitter-receiver geometry can resolve the mirror ambiguity inherent to real-valued CSI power. Building on these properties, we develop a real-time 3D Fourier-domain processing pipeline that jointly recovers spectral (delay), spatial (angle), and temporal (Doppler) signatures. The resulting features are integrated into an online framework with adaptive motion detection, outlier suppression, and extended Kalman filter tracking with deterministic initialization, followed by position-refined micro-Doppler feature extraction for micro-motion sensing. Extensive experiments, including simulations, a real-world prototype using 3.1 GHz LTE signals, and an open-source gait recognition dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CSI-power-based framework for bistatic passive tracking and sensing.

### Can Interest-Bearing Positions Solve the Long-Horizon Problem in Prediction Markets?
**Authors**: Caleb Maresca

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:52:15Z

**Summary**: Prediction markets suffer from reduced liquidity and price accuracy for long-horizon events due to the opportunity cost of committed capital. Recently, major platforms have introduced interest-bearing positions to mitigate this "long-horizon problem." I evaluate this policy using agent-based simulations with large language model (LLM) traders in a 2 x 2 factorial design, varying time horizon (4 days vs. 2 years) and the presence of interest. While long horizons degrade accuracy, the observed pricing bias (0.72 percentage points) is significantly smaller than theoretical and prior empirical estimates. Paying interest eliminates approximately 83% of the horizon effect on accuracy and more than triples market participation (from 17% to 62% of wealth). These findings suggest the long-horizon problem may be overstated in existing literature and that interest-bearing positions are a highly effective intervention, primarily by incentivizing participation rather than correcting bias.

### Beyond the Star Rating: A Scalable Framework for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Using LLMs and Text Classification
**Authors**: Vishal Patil, Shree Vaishnavi Bacha, Revanth Yamani, Yidan Sun, Mayank Kejriwal

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:45:17Z

**Summary**: Customer-provided reviews have become an important source of information for business owners and other customers alike. However, effectively analyzing millions of unstructured reviews remains challenging. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for natural language understanding, their application to large-scale review analysis has been limited by computational costs and scalability concerns. This study proposes a hybrid approach that uses LLMs for aspect identification while employing classic machine-learning methods for sentiment classification at scale. Using ChatGPT to analyze sampled restaurant reviews, we identified key aspects of dining experiences and developed sentiment classifiers using human-labeled reviews, which we subsequently applied to 4.7 million reviews collected over 17 years from a major online platform. Regression analysis reveals that our machine-labeled aspects significantly explain variance in overall restaurant ratings across different aspects of dining experiences, cuisines, and geographical regions. Our findings demonstrate that combining LLMs with traditional machine learning approaches can effectively automate aspect-based sentiment analysis of large-scale customer feedback, suggesting a practical framework for both researchers and practitioners in the hospitality industry and potentially, other service sectors.

### Motivation is Something You Need
**Authors**: Mehdi Acheli, Walid Gaaloul

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:26:52Z

**Summary**: This work introduces a novel training paradigm that draws from affective neuroscience. Inspired by the interplay of emotions and cognition in the human brain and more specifically the SEEKING motivational state, we design a dual-model framework where a smaller base model is trained continuously, while a larger motivated model is activated intermittently during predefined "motivation conditions". The framework mimics the emotional state of high curiosity and anticipation of reward in which broader brain regions are recruited to enhance cognitive performance. Exploiting scalable architectures where larger models extend smaller ones, our method enables shared weight updates and selective expansion of network capacity during noteworthy training steps. Empirical evaluation on the image classification task demonstrates that, not only does the alternating training scheme efficiently and effectively enhance the base model compared to a traditional scheme, in some cases, the motivational model also surpasses its standalone counterpart despite seeing less data per epoch. This opens the possibility of simultaneously training two models tailored to different deployment constraints with competitive or superior performance while keeping training cost lower than when training the larger model.

### Tool Building as a Path to "Superintelligence"
**Authors**: David Koplow, Tomer Galanti, Tomaso Poggio

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:22:10Z

**Summary**: The Diligent Learner framework suggests LLMs can achieve superintelligence via test-time search, provided a sufficient step-success probability $γ$. In this work, we design a benchmark to measure $γ$ on logical out-of-distribution inference. We construct a class of tasks involving GF(2) circuit reconstruction that grow more difficult with each reasoning step, and that are, from an information-theoretic standpoint, impossible to reliably solve unless the LLM carefully integrates all of the information provided. Our analysis demonstrates that while the $γ$ value for small LLMs declines superlinearly as depth increases, frontier models exhibit partial robustness on this task. Furthermore, we find that successful reasoning at scale is contingent upon precise tool calls, identifying tool design as a critical capability for LLMs to achieve general superintelligence through the Diligent Learner framework.

### Mapping Gemma3 onto an Edge Dataflow Architecture
**Authors**: Shouyu Du, Miaoxiang Yu, Zhenyu Xu, Zhiheng Ni, Jillian Cai, Qing Yang, Tao Wei

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:20:32Z

**Summary**: We present the first end-to-end deployment of the Gemma3 family of large language and vision models on a tiled edge dataflow architecture (AMD Ryzen AI NPU). Our work introduces a set of hardware-aware techniques. For prefill, we introduce an efficient dequantization engine, optimize tiled matrix multiplication kernels, and propose FlowQKV, a chunked, pipelined attention mechanism. For decoding, we introduce FusedDQP, which fuses dequantization and projection into a single kernel, and FlowKV, which re-structures attention to sustain high memory bandwidth utilization. Together with a compact Q4NX 4-bit quantization format, these methods yield up to $5.2\times$ faster prefill and $4.8\times$ faster decoding versus the iGPU, and $33.5\times$ and $2.2\times$ over the CPU, respectively. Power efficiency improves by as much as $67.2\times$ and $222.9\times$ compared to the iGPU and CPU. The proposed approach demonstrates that modern NPUs can deliver practical, low-power LLM and VLM inference at the edge, and provides a generalizable blueprint for mapping transformer-based models onto tiled dataflow accelerators.

### An Expert Schema for Evaluating Large Language Model Errors in Scholarly Question-Answering Systems
**Authors**: Anna Martin-Boyle, William Humphreys, Martha Brown, Cara Leckey, Harmanpreet Kaur

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:16:44Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming scholarly tasks like search and summarization, but their reliability remains uncertain. Current evaluation metrics for testing LLM reliability are primarily automated approaches that prioritize efficiency and scalability, but lack contextual nuance and fail to reflect how scientific domain experts assess LLM outputs in practice. We developed and validated a schema for evaluating LLM errors in scholarly question-answering systems that reflects the assessment strategies of practicing scientists. In collaboration with domain experts, we identified 20 error patterns across seven categories through thematic analysis of 68 question-answer pairs. We validated this schema through contextual inquiries with 10 additional scientists, which showed not only which errors experts naturally identify but also how structured evaluation schemas can help them detect previously overlooked issues. Domain experts use systematic assessment strategies, including technical precision testing, value-based evaluation, and meta-evaluation of their own practices. We discuss implications for supporting expert evaluation of LLM outputs, including opportunities for personalized, schema-driven tools that adapt to individual evaluation patterns and expertise levels.

### Latent Thinking Optimization: Your Latent Reasoning Language Model Secretly Encodes Reward Signals in Its Latent Thoughts
**Authors**: Hanwen Du, Yuxin Dong, Xia Ning

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:11:47Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at problem solving by generating chain of thoughts in natural language, but such verbal thinking is computationally costly and prone to overthinking. A recent work instead proposes a latent thinking architecture, Huginn-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning steps as a sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack interpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the correctness and reliability of the model's latent thinking processes. In this paper, we provide a systematic study of how Huginn-3.5B thinks in the latent space and how external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We show that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit highly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably predict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these insights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic algorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to optimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect latent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking processes. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains, and LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking processes. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward modeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed directly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general, efficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of LLMs.

### VAUQ: Vision-Aware Uncertainty Quantification for LVLM Self-Evaluation
**Authors**: Seongheon Park, Changdae Oh, Hyeong Kyu Choi, Xuefeng Du, Sharon Li

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:11:14Z

**Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) frequently hallucinate, limiting their safe deployment in real-world applications. Existing LLM self-evaluation methods rely on a model's ability to estimate the correctness of its own outputs, which can improve deployment reliability; however, they depend heavily on language priors and are therefore ill-suited for evaluating vision-conditioned predictions. We propose VAUQ, a vision-aware uncertainty quantification framework for LVLM self-evaluation that explicitly measures how strongly a model's output depends on visual evidence. VAUQ introduces the Image-Information Score (IS), which captures the reduction in predictive uncertainty attributable to visual input, and an unsupervised core-region masking strategy that amplifies the influence of salient regions. Combining predictive entropy with this core-masked IS yields a training-free scoring function that reliably reflects answer correctness. Comprehensive experiments show that VAUQ consistently outperforms existing self-evaluation methods across multiple datasets.

### PaperTrail: A Claim-Evidence Interface for Grounding Provenance in LLM-based Scholarly Q&A
**Authors**: Anna Martin-Boyle, Cara A. C. Leckey, Martha C. Brown, Harmanpreet Kaur

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:04:50Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in scholarly question-answering (QA) systems to help researchers synthesize vast amounts of literature. However, these systems often produce subtle errors (e.g., unsupported claims, errors of omission), and current provenance mechanisms like source citations are not granular enough for the rigorous verification that scholarly domain requires. To address this, we introduce PaperTrail, a novel interface that decomposes both LLM answers and source documents into discrete claims and evidence, mapping them to reveal supported assertions, unsupported claims, and information omitted from the source texts. We evaluated PaperTrail in a within-subjects study with 26 researchers who performed two scholarly editing tasks using PaperTrail and a baseline interface. Our results show that PaperTrail significantly lowered participants' trust compared to the baseline. However, this increased caution did not translate to behavioral changes, as people continued to rely on LLM-generated scholarly edits to avoid a cognitively burdensome task. We discuss the value of claim-evidence matching for understanding LLM trustworthiness in scholarly settings, and present design implications for cognition-friendly communication of provenance information.

### LogicGraph : Benchmarking Multi-Path Logical Reasoning via Neuro-Symbolic Generation and Verification
**Authors**: Yanrui Wu, Lingling Zhang, Xinyu Zhang, Jiayu Chang, Pengyu Li, Xu Jiang, Jingtao Hu, Jun Liu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T16:04:26Z

**Summary**: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) primarily emphasize convergent logical reasoning, where success is defined by producing a single correct proof. However, many real-world reasoning problems admit multiple valid derivations, requiring models to explore diverse logical paths rather than committing to one route. To address this limitation, we introduce LogicGraph, the first benchmark aimed to systematically evaluate multi-path logical reasoning, constructed via a neuro-symbolic framework that leverages backward logic generation and semantic instantiation. This pipeline yields solver-verified reasoning problems formalized by high-depth multi-path reasoning and inherent logical distractions, where each instance is associated with an exhaustive set of minimal proofs. We further propose a reference-free evaluation framework to rigorously assess model performance in both convergent and divergent regimes. Experiments on state-of-the-art language models reveal a common limitation: models tend to commit early to a single route and fail to explore alternatives, and the coverage gap grows substantially with reasoning depth. LogicGraph exposes this divergence gap and provides actionable insights to motivate future improvements. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/kkkkarry/LogicGraph.

### Learning Unified Representations from Heterogeneous Data for Robust Heart Rate Modeling
**Authors**: Zhengdong Huang, Zicheng Xie, Wentao Tian, Jingyu Liu, Lunhong Dong, Peng Yang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:49:40Z

**Summary**: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge in real-world deployment: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity,enabling downstream predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns. Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user heterogeneity, we employ a history-aware attention module to capture long-term physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of real-world data, we created a new benchmark dataset, PARROTAO. Evaluations on both PARROTAO and the public FitRec dataset show that our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17.5% and 10.4% in terms of test MSE, respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates their strong discriminative power,and two downstream application tasks confirm the practical value of our model.

### Do We Need Adam? Surprisingly Strong and Sparse Reinforcement Learning with SGD in LLMs
**Authors**: Sagnik Mukherjee, Lifan Yuan, Pavan Jayasinha, Dilek Hakkani-Tür, Hao Peng

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:43:09Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly RL from verifiable reward (RLVR), has become a crucial phase of training large language models (LLMs) and a key focus of current scaling efforts. However, optimization practices in RL largely follow those of next-token prediction stages (e.g., pretraining and supervised fine-tuning), despite fundamental differences between RL and these stages highlighted by recent work. One such practice is the use of the AdamW optimizer, which is widely adopted for training large-scale transformers despite its high memory overhead. Our analysis shows that both momentum and adaptive learning rates in AdamW are less influential in RL than in SFT, leading us to hypothesize that RL benefits less from Adam-style per-parameter adaptive learning rates and momentum. Confirming this hypothesis, our experiments demonstrate that the substantially more memory-efficient SGD, which is known to perform poorly in supervised learning of large-scale transformers, matches or even outperforms AdamW in RL for LLMs. Remarkably, full fine-tuning with SGD updates fewer than 0.02% of model parameters without any sparsity-promoting regularization, more than 1000 times fewer than AdamW. Our analysis offers potential reasons for this update sparsity. These findings provide new insights into the optimization dynamics of RL in LLMs and show that RL can be substantially more parameter-efficient than previously recognized.

**Summary**: Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing enables multiple logical networks to exist on top of the same physical infrastructure by allocating resources to distinct service groups, where radio resource scheduling plays a key role in ensuring compliance with slice-specific Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). Existing configuration-based or intent-driven Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches usually rely on static mappings and SLA conversions. The current literature does not integrate natural language understanding with coordinated decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose an Agentic AI framework for 6G RAN slicing, driven by a super agent built using Hierarchical Decision Mamba (HDM) controllers and a Large Language Model (LLM). The super agent interprets operator intents and translates them into actionable goals using the LLM, which are used by HDM to coordinate inter-slice, intra-slice, and self-healing agents. Compared to transformer-based and reward-driven baselines, the proposed Agentic AI framework demonstrates consistent improvements across key performance indicators, including higher throughput, improved cell-edge performance, and reduced latency across different slices.

### A Survey on the Optimization of Large Language Model-based Agents
**Authors**: Shangheng Du, Jiabao Zhao, Jinxin Shi, Zhentao Xie, Xin Jiang, Yanhong Bai, Liang He

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:31:52Z

**Summary**: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have been widely adopted in various fields, becoming essential for autonomous decision-making and interactive tasks. However, current work typically relies on prompt design or fine-tuning strategies applied to vanilla LLMs, which often leads to limited effectiveness or suboptimal performance in complex agent-related environments. Although LLM optimization techniques can improve model performance across many general tasks, they lack specialized optimization towards critical agent functionalities such as long-term planning, dynamic environmental interaction, and complex decision-making. Although numerous recent studies have explored various strategies to optimize LLM-based agents for complex agent tasks, a systematic review summarizing and comparing these methods from a holistic perspective is still lacking. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of LLM-based agent optimization approaches, categorizing them into parameter-driven and parameter-free methods. We first focus on parameter-driven optimization, covering fine-tuning-based optimization, reinforcement learning-based optimization, and hybrid strategies, analyzing key aspects such as trajectory data construction, fine-tuning techniques, reward function design, and optimization algorithms. Additionally, we briefly discuss parameter-free strategies that optimize agent behavior through prompt engineering and external knowledge retrieval. Finally, we summarize the datasets and benchmarks used for evaluation and tuning, review key applications of LLM-based agents, and discuss major challenges and promising future directions.

### When LLMs Imagine People: A Human-Centered Persona Brainstorm Audit for Bias and Fairness in Creative Applications
**Authors**: Hongliu Cao, Eoin Thomas, Rodrigo Acuna Agost

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:29:33Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) used in creative workflows can reinforce stereotypes and perpetuate inequities, making fairness auditing essential. Existing methods rely on constrained tasks and fixed benchmarks, leaving open-ended creative outputs unexamined. We introduce the Persona Brainstorm Audit (PBA), a scalable and easy to extend auditing method for bias detection across multiple intersecting identity and social roles in open-ended persona generation. PBA quantifies bias using degree-of-freedom-aware normalized Cramér's V, producing interpretable severity labels that enable fair comparison across models and dimensions. Applying PBA to 12 LLMs (120,000 personas, 16 bias dimensions), we find that bias evolves nonlinearly across model generations: larger and newer models are not consistently fairer, and biases that initially decrease can resurface in later releases. Intersectional analysis reveals disparities hidden by single-axis metrics, where dimensions appearing fair individually can exhibit high bias in combination. Robustness analyses show PBA remains stable under varying sample sizes, role-playing prompts, and debiasing prompts, establishing its reliability for fairness auditing in LLMs.

### Telemetry-Based Server Selection in the Quantum Internet via Cross-Layer Runtime Estimation
**Authors**: Masaki Nagai, Hideaki Kawaguchi, Shin Nishio, Takahiko Satoh

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:25:55Z

**Summary**: The Quantum Internet will allow clients to delegate quantum workloads to remote servers over heterogeneous networks, but choosing the server that minimizes end-to-end execution time is difficult because server processing, feedforward classical communication, and entanglement distribution can overlap in protocol-dependent ways and shift the runtime bottleneck. We propose $T_{\max}$, a lightweight runtime score that sums coarse telemetry from multiple layers to obtain a conservative ranking for online server selection without calibrating weights for each deployment. Using NetSquid discrete-event simulations of a modified parameter-blind VQE (PB-VQE) workload, we evaluate $T_{\max}$ on pools of 10,000 heterogeneous candidates (selecting among up to 100 per decision) across crossover and bottleneck-dominated regimes, including temporal jitter scenarios and jobs with multiple shots. $T_{\max}$ achieves single-digit mean regret normalized by the oracle (below 10%) in both regimes and remains in the single-digit range under classical communication latency jitter for multi-shot jobs, while performance degrades for single-shot jobs under severe jitter. To connect performance to deployment planning, we derive an operating map based on requirements relating distance and entanglement rate requirements to protocol level counts, quantify how simple multiuser contention shifts the crossover, and use Sobol global sensitivity analysis to identify regime-dependent bottlenecks. These findings suggest that simple cross-layer telemetry can enable practical server selection while providing actionable provisioning guidance for emerging Quantum Internet services.

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:16:44Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has spurred the emergence of data agents, autonomous systems designed to orchestrate Data + AI ecosystems for tackling complex data-related tasks. However, the term "data agent" currently suffers from terminological ambiguity and inconsistent adoption, conflating simple query responders with sophisticated autonomous architectures. This terminological ambiguity fosters mismatched user expectations, accountability challenges, and barriers to industry growth. Inspired by the SAE J3016 standard for driving automation, this survey introduces the first systematic hierarchical taxonomy for data agents, comprising six levels that delineate and trace progressive shifts in autonomy, from manual operations (L0) to a vision of generative, fully autonomous data agents (L5), thereby clarifying capability boundaries and responsibility allocation. Through this lens, we offer a structured review of existing research arranged by increasing autonomy, encompassing specialized data agents for data management, preparation, and analysis, alongside emerging efforts toward versatile, comprehensive systems with enhanced autonomy. We further analyze critical evolutionary leaps and technical gaps for advancing data agents, especially the ongoing L2-to-L3 transition, where data agents evolve from procedural execution to autonomous orchestration. Finally, we conclude with a forward-looking roadmap, envisioning proactive, generative data agents.

### Generative Pseudo-Labeling for Pre-Ranking with LLMs
**Authors**: Junyu Bi, Xinting Niu, Daixuan Cheng, Kun Yuan, Tao Wang, Binbin Cao, Jian Wu, Yuning Jiang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:14:49Z

**Summary**: Pre-ranking is a critical stage in industrial recommendation systems, tasked with efficiently scoring thousands of recalled items for downstream ranking. A key challenge is the train-serving discrepancy: pre-ranking models are trained only on exposed interactions, yet must score all recalled candidates -- including unexposed items -- during online serving. This mismatch not only induces severe sample selection bias but also degrades generalization, especially for long-tail content. Existing debiasing approaches typically rely on heuristics (e.g., negative sampling) or distillation from biased rankers, which either mislabel plausible unexposed items as negatives or propagate exposure bias into pseudo-labels. In this work, we propose Generative Pseudo-Labeling (GPL), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate unbiased, content-aware pseudo-labels for unexposed items, explicitly aligning the training distribution with the online serving space. By offline generating user-specific interest anchors and matching them with candidates in a frozen semantic space, GPL provides high-quality supervision without adding online latency. Deployed in a large-scale production system, GPL improves click-through rate by 3.07%, while significantly enhancing recommendation diversity and long-tail item discovery.

### Topology-Aware Coordination for Multi-Functional Low-Altitude Wireless Networks
**Authors**: Jiajun He, Han Yu, Yiran Guo, Xinping Yi, Fan Liu, Hing Cheung So, Hien Quoc Ngo, Michail Matthaiou, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:13:33Z

**Summary**: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) are expected to consist of multi-tier, heterogeneous terrestrial and non-terrestrial devices, where effective coordination is essential to fully unlock the complementary capabilities of diverse systems from different vendors. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-functional coordination framework that enables seamless cooperation within the LAWN while supporting efficient execution of diverse network functions. In the proposed architecture, each device or infrastructure element is assigned to a specific functional role, namely, edge mobile terminal (E-MT), distributed MT (D-MT), or computing center. E-MTs are equipped with lightweight, independent signal processing and computing capabilities, while D-MTs and the computing center handle regional and global coordination, respectively. To enhance the overall network efficiency, we model the LAWN as a sparse graph, where nodes represent network nodes and edges are defined according to a set of controllable connection rules. This topology-aware (TA) representation allows for efficiently solving various coordination tasks across the network. Numerical results show that the proposed TA coordination framework outperforms baseline approaches that lack topological insights, achieving higher efficiency in multi-task coordination. Finally, we discuss key technical challenges and outline potential solutions for future deployment.

### Evaluating Proactive Risk Awareness of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Xuan Luo, Yubin Chen, Zhiyu Hou, Linpu Yu, Geng Tu, Jing Li, Ruifeng Xu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T15:00:00Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in everyday decision-making, their safety responsibilities extend beyond reacting to explicit harmful intent toward anticipating unintended but consequential risks. In this work, we introduce a proactive risk awareness evaluation framework that measures whether LLMs can anticipate potential harms and provide warnings before damage occurs. We construct the Butterfly dataset to instantiate this framework in the environmental and ecological domain. It contains 1,094 queries that simulate ordinary solution-seeking activities whose responses may induce latent ecological impact. Through experiments across five widely used LLMs, we analyze the effects of response length, languages, and modality. Experimental results reveal consistent, significant declines in proactive awareness under length-restricted responses, cross-lingual similarities, and persistent blind spots in (multimodal) species protection. These findings highlight a critical gap between current safety alignment and the requirements of real-world ecological responsibility, underscoring the need for proactive safeguards in LLM deployment.

### Characterizing LLM Inference Energy-Performance Tradeoffs across Workloads and GPU Scaling
**Authors**: Paul Joe Maliakel, Shashikant Ilager, Ivona Brandic

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:57:10Z

**Summary**: LLM inference exhibits substantial variability across queries and execution phases, yet inference configurations are often applied uniformly. We present a measurement-driven characterization of workload heterogeneity and energy-performance behavior of LLM inference under GPU dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). We evaluate five decoder-only LLMs (1B-32B parameters) across four NLP benchmarks using a controlled offline setup. We show that lightweight semantic features predict inference difficulty better than input length, with 44.5% of queries achieving comparable quality across model sizes. At the hardware level, the decode phase dominates inference time (77-91%) and is largely insensitive to GPU frequency. Consequently, reducing GPU frequency from 2842 MHz to 180 MHz achieves an average of 42% energy savings with only a 1-6% latency increase. We further provide a use case with an upper-bound analysis of the potential benefits of combining workload-aware model selection with phase-aware DVFS, motivating future energy-efficient LLM inference systems.

### "Don't Do That!": Guiding Embodied Systems through Large Language Model-based Constraint Generation
**Authors**: Amin Seffo, Aladin Djuhera, Masataro Asai, Holger Boche

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:56:22Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

### Context-Aware Mapping of 2D Drawing Annotations to 3D CAD Features Using LLM-Assisted Reasoning for Manufacturing Automation
**Authors**: Muhammad Tayyab Khan, Lequn Chen, Wenhe Feng, Seung Ki Moon

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:55:20Z

**Summary**: Manufacturing automation in process planning, inspection planning, and digital-thread integration depends on a unified specification that binds the geometric features of a 3D CAD model to the geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) callouts, datum definitions, and surface requirements carried by the corresponding 2D engineering drawing. Although Model-Based Definition (MBD) allows such specifications to be embedded directly in 3D models, 2D drawings remain the primary carrier of manufacturing intent in automotive, aerospace, shipbuilding, and heavy-machinery industries. Correctly linking drawing annotations to the corresponding 3D features is difficult because of contextual ambiguity, repeated feature patterns, and the need for transparent and traceable decisions. This paper presents a deterministic-first, context-aware framework that maps 2D drawing entities to 3D CAD features to produce a unified manufacturing specification. Drawing callouts are first semantically enriched and then scored against candidate features using an interpretable metric that combines type compatibility, tolerance-aware dimensional agreement, and conservative context consistency, along with engineering-domain heuristics. When deterministic scoring cannot resolve an ambiguity, the system escalates to multimodal and constrained large-language-model reasoning, followed by a single human-in-the-loop (HITL) review step. Experiments on 20 real CAD-drawing pairs achieve a mean precision of 83.67%, recall of 90.46%, and F1 score of 86.29%. An ablation study shows that each pipeline component contributes to overall accuracy, with the full system outperforming all reduced variants. By prioritizing deterministic rules, clear decision tracking, and retaining unresolved cases for human review, the framework provides a practical foundation for downstream manufacturing automation in real-world industrial environments.

### Linear Reasoning vs. Proof by Cases: Obstacles for Large Language Models in FOL Problem Solving
**Authors**: Yuliang Ji, Fuchen Shen, Jian Wu, Qiujie Xie, Yue Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:53:34Z

**Summary**: To comprehensively evaluate the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have introduced abundant mathematical reasoning datasets. However, most existing datasets primarily focus on linear reasoning, neglecting other parts such as proof by contradiction and proof by cases, which are crucial for investigating LLMs' reasoning abilities. To address this limitation, we first introduce a novel first-order logic (FOL) dataset named PC-FOL, annotated by professional mathematicians, focusing on case-based reasoning problems. All instances in this dataset are equipped with a manually written natural language proof, clearly distinguishing it from conventional linear reasoning datasets. Our experimental results over leading LLMs demonstrate a substantial performance gap between linear reasoning and case-based reasoning problems. To further investigate this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis grounded in graphical model, which provides an explanation for the observed disparity between the two types of reasoning problems. We hope this work can reveal the core challenges in the field of automated natural language mathematical proof generation, paving the way for future research.

### Programming by Backprop: An Instruction is Worth 100 Examples When Finetuning LLMs
**Authors**: Jonathan Cook, Silvia Sapora, Arash Ahmadian, Akbir Khan, Tim Rocktaschel, Jakob Foerster, Laura Ruis

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:51:33Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained to acquire behaviours from demonstrations or experience, yet much of their training data is declarative: instructions, rules, and descriptions that specify behaviours without showing how to execute them. We introduce Programming by Backprop (PBB): a training regime that enables LLMs to acquire procedural knowledge (i.e., reusable behaviours) from declarative instructions encountered during training. With PBB, instructions in training data provide an opportunity to `program' specific behaviours into model weights. The core principle underpinning PBB is the separation of learning how instructions map to behaviour from internalising new instructions. We devise two distinct PBB curricula that leverage this principle. Through controlled experiments across two domains (algorithmic execution from Python source code and text generation from context-free grammars), we demonstrate the benefit of these curricula over training on a homogeneous data mixture. Crucially, PBB is highly sample efficient, with a single instruction substituting for up to 100 execution examples. Though execution of instructions in training data remains less reliable than when instructions are given in-context, our results demonstrate that procedural knowledge can be noisily `programmed' into LLMs through PBB, with important implications for data curation and safety.

### Blackbird Language Matrices: A Framework to Investigate the Linguistic Competence of Language Models
**Authors**: Paola Merlo, Chunyang Jiang, Giuseppe Samo, Vivi Nastase

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:45:08Z

**Summary**: This article describes a novel language task, the Blackbird Language Matrices (BLM) task, inspired by intelligence tests, and illustrates the BLM datasets, their construction and benchmarking, and targeted experiments on chunking and systematicity. BLMs are multiple-choice problems, structured at multiple levels: within each sentence, across the input sequence, within each candidate answer. Because of their rich structure, these curated, but naturalistic datasets are key to answer some core questions about current large language models abilities: do LLMs detect linguistic objects and their properties? Do they detect and use systematic patterns across sentences? Are they more prone to linguistic or reasoning errors, and how do these interact?   We show that BLMs, while challenging, can be solved at good levels of performance, in more than one language, with simple baseline models or, at better performance levels, with more tailored models. We show that their representations contain the grammatical objects and attributes relevant to solve a linguistic task. We also show that these solutions are reached by detecting systematic patterns across sentences.   The paper supports the point of view that curated, structured datasets support multi-faceted investigations of properties of language and large language models. Because they present a curated, articulated structure, because they comprise both learning contexts and expected answers, and because they are partly built by hand, BLMs fall in the category of datasets that can support explainability investigations, and be useful to ask why large language models behave the way they do.

### Sensory-Motor Control with Large Language Models via Iterative Policy Refinement
**Authors**: Jônata Tyska Carvalho, Stefano Nolfi

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:36:12Z

**Summary**: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control embodied agents through the generation of control policies that directly map continuous observation vectors to continuous action vectors. At the outset, the LLMs generate a control strategy based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation. The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. The approach proves effective with relatively compact models such as GPT-oss:120b and Qwen2.5:72b. In most cases, it successfully identifies optimal or near-optimal solutions by integrating symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

### KBVQ-MoE: KLT-guided SVD with Bias-Corrected Vector Quantization for MoE Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zukang Xu, Zhixiong Zhao, Xing Hu, Zhixuan Chen, Dawei Yang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:35:31Z

**Summary**: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have achieved great success by significantly improving performance while maintaining computational efficiency through sparse expert activation. However, their enormous parameter sizes and memory demands pose major challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Vector Quantization (VQ) offers a promising approach for ultra-low-bit compression in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging a codebook, where weight vectors are mapped to the most similar discrete codewords. Yet, directly applying VQ to MoEs often leads to substantial performance degradation due to two critical obstacles: (1) redundant representations among experts cause VQ to repeatedly quantize similar representations for each expert, resulting in inefficient use of limited codebook capacity; and (2) cumulative output bias is amplified by expert aggregation in MoE layers, leading to distributional shifts in the quantized outputs. To address these issues, we propose KBVQ-MoE, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit quantization for MoE-based LLMs. KBVQ-MoE integrates two techniques: (1) input-driven redundancy elimination, where a Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) guided singular value decomposition (SVD) extracts dominant weight components and shares them across experts; and (2) bias-corrected output stabilization, where vector quantization is applied only to expert-specific (non-redundant) representations and the quantized outputs are corrected via channel-wise affine compensation. Experiments on various MoE LLMs demonstrate that KBVQ-MoE preserves accuracy substantially better than existing quantization methods. For example, 3-bit quantization of Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B achieves an average accuracy of 67.99, nearly identical to the FP16 baseline of 68.07, underscoring KBVQ-MoE's potential for efficient deployment on edge devices and other resource-constrained platforms.

### PMG: Parameterized Motion Generator for Human-like Locomotion Control
**Authors**: Chenxi Han, Yuheng Min, Zihao Huang, Ao Hong, Hang Liu, Yi Cheng, Houde Liu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:34:42Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in data-driven reinforcement learning and motion tracking have substantially improved humanoid locomotion, yet critical practical challenges remain. In particular, while low-level motion tracking and trajectory-following controllers are mature, whole-body reference-guided methods are difficult to adapt to higher-level command interfaces and diverse task contexts: they require large, high-quality datasets, are brittle across speed and pose regimes, and are sensitive to robot-specific calibration. To address these limitations, we propose the Parameterized Motion Generator (PMG), a real-time motion generator grounded in an analysis of human motion structure that synthesizes reference trajectories using only a compact set of parameterized motion data together with high-dimensional control commands. Combined with an imitation-learning pipeline and an optimization-based sim-to-real motor parameter identification module, we validate the complete approach on our humanoid prototype ZERITH Z1 and show that, within a single integrated system, PMG produces natural, human-like locomotion, responds precisely to high-dimensional control inputs-including VR-based teleoperation-and enables efficient, verifiable sim-to-real transfer. Together, these results establish a practical, experimentally validated pathway toward natural and deployable humanoid control. Website: https://pmg-icra26.github.io/

### Some Simple Economics of AGI
**Authors**: Christian Catalini, Xiang Hui, Jane Wu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:29:45Z

**Summary**: For millennia, human cognition was the primary engine of progress on Earth. As AI decouples cognition from biology, the marginal cost of measurable execution falls to zero, absorbing any labor capturable by metrics--including creative, analytical, and innovative work. The binding constraint on growth is no longer intelligence but human verification bandwidth: the capacity to validate, audit, and underwrite responsibility when execution is abundant. We model the AGI transition as the collision of two racing cost curves: an exponentially decaying Cost to Automate and a biologically bottlenecked Cost to Verify. This structural asymmetry widens a Measurability Gap between what agents can execute and what humans can afford to verify. It also drives a shift from skill-biased to measurability-biased technical change. Rents migrate to verification-grade ground truth, cryptographic provenance, and liability underwriting--the ability to insure outcomes rather than merely generate them. The current human-in-the-loop equilibrium is unstable: eroded from below as apprenticeship collapses (Missing Junior Loop) and from within as experts codify their obsolescence (Codifier's Curse). Unverified deployment becomes privately rational--a Trojan Horse externality. Unmanaged, these forces pull toward a Hollow Economy. Yet by scaling verification alongside agentic capabilities, the forces that threaten collapse become the catalyst for unbounded discovery and experimentation--an Augmented Economy. We derive a practical playbook for individuals, companies, investors, and policymakers. Today's defining challenge is not the race to deploy the most autonomous systems; it is the race to secure the foundations of their oversight. Only by scaling our bandwidth for verification alongside our capacity for execution can we ensure that the intelligence we have summoned preserves the humanity that initiated it.

### A Simple and Efficient Jailbreak Method Exploiting LLMs' Helpfulness
**Authors**: Xuan Luo, Yue Wang, Zefeng He, Geng Tu, Jing Li, Ruifeng Xu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:28:30Z

**Summary**: This study reveals a critical safety blind spot in modern LLMs: learning-style queries, which closely resemble ordinary educational questions, can reliably elicit harmful responses. The learning-style queries are constructed by a novel reframing paradigm: HILL (Hiding Intention by Learning from LLMs). The deterministic, model-agnostic reframing framework is composed of 4 conceptual components: 1) key concept, 2) exploratory transformation, 3) detail-oriented inquiry, and optionally 4) hypotheticality. Further, new metrics are introduced to thoroughly evaluate the efficiency and harmfulness of jailbreak methods. Experiments on the AdvBench dataset across a wide range of models demonstrate HILL's strong generalizability. It achieves top attack success rates on the majority of models and across malicious categories while maintaining high efficiency with concise prompts. On the other hand, results of various defense methods show the robustness of HILL, with most defenses having mediocre effects or even increasing the attack success rates. In addition, the assessment of defenses on the constructed safe prompts reveals inherent limitations of LLMs' safety mechanisms and flaws in the defense methods. This work exposes significant vulnerabilities of safety measures against learning-style elicitation, highlighting a critical challenge of fulfilling both helpfulness and safety alignments.

### The Art of Efficient Reasoning: Data, Reward, and Optimization
**Authors**: Taiqiang Wu, Zenan Zu, Bo Zhou, Ngai Wong

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:28:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) consistently benefit from scaled Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but also suffer from heavy computational overhead. To address this issue, efficient reasoning aims to incentivize short yet accurate thinking trajectories, typically through reward shaping with Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we systematically investigate the mechanics of efficient reasoning for LLMs. For comprehensive evaluation, we advocate for more fine-grained metrics, including length distribution conditioned on correctness and performance across a wide spectrum of token budgets ranging from 2k to 32k. First, we reveal that the training process follows a two-stage paradigm: length adaptation and reasoning refinement. After that, we conduct extensive experiments (about 0.2 million GPU hours) in a unified protocol, deconstructing training prompts and rollouts, reward shaping, and optimization strategies. In particular, a key finding is to train on relatively easier prompts, ensuring the density of positive reward signals and thus avoiding the length collapse. Meanwhile, the learned length bias can be generalized across domains. We distill all findings into valuable insights and practical guidelines, and further validate them across the Qwen3 series, ranging from 0.6B to 30B, demonstrating the robustness and generalization.

### A Theoretical Framework for Modular Learning of Robust Generative Models
**Authors**: Corinna Cortes, Mehryar Mohri, Yutao Zhong

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:25:20Z

**Summary**: Training large-scale generative models is resource-intensive and relies heavily on heuristic dataset weighting. We address two fundamental questions: Can we train Large Language Models (LLMs) modularly-combining small, domain-specific experts to match monolithic performance-and can we do so robustly for any data mixture, eliminating heuristic tuning? We present a theoretical framework for modular generative modeling where a set of pre-trained experts are combined via a gating mechanism. We define the space of normalized gating functions, $G_{1}$, and formulate the problem as a minimax game to find a single robust gate that minimizes divergence to the worst-case data mixture. We prove the existence of such a robust gate using Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and show that modularity acts as a strong regularizer, with generalization bounds scaling with the lightweight gate's complexity. Furthermore, we prove that this modular approach can theoretically outperform models retrained on aggregate data, with the gap characterized by the Jensen-Shannon Divergence. Finally, we introduce a scalable Stochastic Primal-Dual algorithm and a Structural Distillation method for efficient inference. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm that our modular architecture effectively mitigates gradient conflict and can robustly outperform monolithic baselines.

**Authors**: Mike Zhang, Amalie Pernille Dilling, Léon Gondelman, Niels Erik Ruan Lyngdorf, Euan D. Lindsay, Johannes Bjerva

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:17:40Z

**Summary**: Providing high-quality feedback on student assignments is crucial for student success, but it is heavily limited by time and budgetary constraints. In this work, we introduce Synthetic Educational Feedback Loops (SEFL), a synthetic data framework designed to generate data that resembles immediate, on-demand feedback at scale without relying on extensive, real-world student assignments and teacher feedback. To obtain this type of data, two large language models (LLMs) operate in a teacher-student role to simulate assignment completion and formative feedback, generating 19.8K synthetic pairs of student work and corresponding critiques and actionable improvements from a teacher. With this data, we fine-tune smaller, more computationally efficient LLMs on these synthetic pairs, enabling them to replicate key features of high-quality, goal-oriented feedback. Through comprehensive evaluations with three LLM judges and three human experts, across a subset of 900 outputs, we demonstrate that SEFL-tuned models outperform both their untuned counterparts and an existing baseline in terms of feedback quality. The potential for societal impact is reinforced by extensive qualitative comments and ratings from human stakeholders -- both students and higher education instructors. SEFL has the potential to transform feedback processes for higher education and beyond.

### Architecting AgentOS: From Token-Level Context to Emergent System-Level Intelligence
**Authors**: ChengYou Li, XiaoDong Liu, XiangBao Meng, XinYu Zhao

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:12:21Z

**Summary**: The paradigm of Large Language Models is undergoing a fundamental transition from static inference engines to dynamic autonomous cognitive systems.While current research primarily focuses on scaling context windows or optimizing prompt engineering the theoretical bridge between micro scale token processing and macro scale systemic intelligence remains fragmented.This paper proposes AgentOS,a holistic conceptual framework that redefines the LLM as a "Reasoning Kernel" governed by structured operating system logic.Central to this architecture is Deep Context Management which conceptualizes the context window as an Addressable Semantic Space rather than a passive buffer.We systematically deconstruct the transition from discrete sequences to coherent cognitive states introducing mechanisms for Semantic Slicing and Temporal Alignment to mitigate cognitive drift in multi-agent orchestration.By mapping classical OS abstractions such as memory paging interrupt handling and process scheduling onto LLM native constructs, this review provides a rigorous roadmap for architecting resilient scalable and self-evolving cognitive environments.Our analysis asserts that the next frontier of AGI development lies in the architectural efficiency of system-level coordination.

### HELP: HyperNode Expansion and Logical Path-Guided Evidence Localization for Accurate and Efficient GraphRAG
**Authors**: Yuqi Huang, Ning Liao, Kai Yang, Anning Hu, Shengchao Hu, Xiaoxing Wang, Junchi Yan

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T14:05:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with inherent knowledge boundaries and hallucinations, limiting their reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues, it frequently overlooks structural interdependencies essential for multi-hop reasoning. Graph-based RAG approaches attempt to bridge this gap, yet they typically face trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency due to challenges such as costly graph traversals and semantic noise in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we propose HyperNode Expansion and Logical Path-Guided Evidence Localization strategies for GraphRAG (HELP), a novel framework designed to balance accuracy with practical efficiency through two core strategies: 1) HyperNode Expansion, which iteratively chains knowledge triplets into coherent reasoning paths abstracted as HyperNodes to capture complex structural dependencies and ensure retrieval accuracy; and 2) Logical Path-Guided Evidence Localization, which leverages precomputed graph-text correlations to map these paths directly to the corpus for superior efficiency. HELP avoids expensive random walks and semantic distortion, preserving knowledge integrity while drastically reducing retrieval latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HELP achieves competitive performance across multiple simple and multi-hop QA benchmarks and up to a 28.8$\times$ speedup over leading Graph-based RAG baselines.

### DVLA-RL: Dual-Level Vision-Language Alignment with Reinforcement Learning Gating for Few-Shot Learning
**Authors**: Wenhao Li, Xianjing Meng, Qiangchang Wang, Zhongyi Han, Zhibin Wu, Yilong Yin

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:56:22Z

**Summary**: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to generalize to novel categories with only a few samples. Recent approaches incorporate large language models (LLMs) to enrich visual representations with semantic embeddings derived from class names. However, they overlook progressive and adaptive alignment between vision and language from low-level to high-level semantics, resulting in limited semantic gains. To address these challenges, we propose Dual-level Vision-Language Alignment with Reinforcement Learning gating (DVLA-RL), which consists of Dual-level Semantic Construction (DSC) and RL-gated Attention (RLA). Specifically, DSC conditions LLMs on both class names and support samples to generate discriminative attributes, progressively selects the most relevant ones, and then synthesizes them into coherent class descriptions. This process provides complementary low-level attributes and high-level descriptions, enabling both fine-grained grounding and holistic class understanding. To dynamically integrate dual-level semantics along with the visual network layers, RLA formulates cross-modal fusion as a sequential decision process. A lightweight policy trained with episodic REINFORCE adaptively adjusts the contributions of self-attention and cross-attention to integrate textual and visual tokens. As a result, shallow layers refine local attributes and deep layers emphasize global semantics, enabling more precise cross-modal alignment. This achieves class-specific discrimination and generalized representations with merely a few support samples. DVLA-RL achieves new state-of-the-art performance across nine benchmarks in three diverse FSL scenarios.

### Predicting Sentence Acceptability Judgments in Multimodal Contexts
**Authors**: Hyewon Jang, Nikolai Ilinykh, Sharid Loáiciga, Jey Han Lau, Shalom Lappin

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:54:38Z

**Summary**: Previous work has examined the capacity of deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly transformers, to predict human sentence acceptability judgments, both independently of context, and in document contexts. We consider the effect of prior exposure to visual images (i.e., visual context) on these judgments for humans and large language models (LLMs). Our results suggest that, in contrast to textual context, visual images appear to have little if any impact on human acceptability ratings. However, LLMs display the compression effect seen in previous work on human judgments in document contexts. Different sorts of LLMs are able to predict human acceptability judgments to a high degree of accuracy, but in general, their performance is slightly better when visual contexts are removed. Moreover, the distribution of LLM judgments varies among models, with Qwen resembling human patterns, and others diverging from them. LLM-generated predictions on sentence acceptability are highly correlated with their normalised log probabilities in general. However, the correlations decrease when visual contexts are present, suggesting that a higher gap exists between the internal representations of LLMs and their generated predictions in the presence of visual contexts. Our experimental work suggests interesting points of similarity and of difference between human and LLM processing of sentences in multimodal contexts.

### Understanding the Ability of LLMs to Handle Character-Level Perturbation
**Authors**: Anyuan Zhuo, Xuefei Ning, Ningyuan Li, Jingyi Zhu, Yu Wang, Pinyan Lu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:53:32Z

**Summary**: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary large language models (LLMs) against frequent character-level perturbations. We examine three types of character-level perturbations including introducing numerous typos within words, shuffling the characters in each word, and inserting a large number of invisible characters into the text. Surprisingly, even under severe perturbation, such as shuffling nearly all words character-wise to produce text that is almost unreadable to humans, or inserting invisible characters which are several times more than the visible ones as noise, many LLMs still maintain notable performance. We explore the underlying causes of this robustness and find that LLMs exhibit remarkable resilience to chaotic segmentation and fragmented tokenization. Furthermore, we examine the mechanisms by which LLMs remove perturbations to correctly comprehend text, including both implicit and explicit mechanisms for character-level perturbation. We hope that our findings on the low-level robustness of LLMs will unveil their inherent architectural strengths, reveal the potential risks of their misuse, and inform the reliable deployment of LLMs across diverse application scenarios.

### When LLMs Enter Everyday Feminism on Chinese Social Media: Opportunities and Risks for Women's Empowerment
**Authors**: Runhua Zhang, Ziqi Pan, Kangyu Yuan, Qiaoyi Chen, Yulin Tian, Huamin Qu, Xiaojuan Ma

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:19:26Z

**Summary**: Everyday digital feminism refers to the ordinary, often pragmatic ways women articulate lived experiences and cultivate solidarity in online spaces. In China, such practices flourish on RedNote through discussions under hashtags like ''women's growth''. Recently, DeepSeek-generated content has been taken up as a new voice in these conversations. Given widely recognized gender biases in LLMs, this raises critical concerns about how LLMs interact with everyday feminist practices. Through an analysis of 430 RedNote posts, 139 shared DeepSeek responses, and 3211 comments, we found that users predominantly welcomed DeepSeek's advice. Yet feminist critical discourse analysis revealed that these responses primarily encouraged women to self-optimize and pursue achievements within prevailing norms rather than challenge them. By interpreting this case, we discuss the opportunities and risks that LLMs introduce for everyday feminism as a pathway toward women's empowerment, and offer design implications for leveraging LLMs to better support such practices.

### MUSE: Harnessing Precise and Diverse Semantics for Few-Shot Whole Slide Image Classification
**Authors**: Jiahao Xu, Sheng Huang, Xin Zhang, Zhixiong Nan, Jiajun Dong, Nankun Mu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:17:35Z

**Summary**: In computational pathology, few-shot whole slide image classification is primarily driven by the extreme scarcity of expert-labeled slides. Recent vision-language methods incorporate textual semantics generated by large language models, but treat these descriptions as static class-level priors that are shared across all samples and lack sample-wise refinement. This limits both the diversity and precision of visual-semantic alignment, hindering generalization under limited supervision. To overcome this, we propose the stochastic MUlti-view Semantic Enhancement (MUSE), a framework that first refines semantic precision via sample-wise adaptation and then enhances semantic richness through retrieval-augmented multi-view generation. Specifically, MUSE introduces Sample-wise Fine-grained Semantic Enhancement (SFSE), which yields a fine-grained semantic prior for each sample through MoE-based adaptive visual-semantic interaction. Guided by this prior, Stochastic Multi-view Model Optimization (SMMO) constructs an LLM-generated knowledge base of diverse pathological descriptions per class, then retrieves and stochastically integrates multiple matched textual views during training. These dynamically selected texts serve as enriched semantic supervisions to stochastically optimize the vision-language model, promoting robustness and mitigating overfitting. Experiments on three benchmark WSI datasets show that MUSE consistently outperforms existing vision-language baselines in few-shot settings, demonstrating that effective few-shot pathology learning requires not only richer semantic sources but also their active and sample-aware semantic optimization. Our code is available at: https://github.com/JiahaoXu-god/CVPR2026_MUSE.

### EAMET: Robust Massive Model Editing via Embedding Alignment Optimization
**Authors**: Yanbo Dai, Zhenlan Ji, Zongjie Li, Shuai Wang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:15:55Z

**Summary**: Model editing techniques are essential for efficiently updating knowledge in large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of existing approaches degrades in massive editing scenarios, particularly when evaluated with practical metrics. Their robustness is also limited in context-rich settings or when editing multiple facts of the same subject simultaneously. We attribute these failures to the embedding misalignment among knowledge items, which undermines editing reliability at scale. To address this, we propose EAMET (Embedding Alignment Model Editing in Transformers), which addresses this issue by aligning the space of key and residual embeddings. Extensive experiments across six LLMs and three datasets demonstrate that EAMET consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving about 90\% editing efficacy when editing 10k facts. Codes and datasets are publicly available at https://ybdai7.github.io/eamet-page/.

### SoK: Agentic Skills -- Beyond Tool Use in LLM Agents
**Authors**: Yanna Jiang, Delong Li, Haiyu Deng, Baihe Ma, Xu Wang, Qin Wang, Guangsheng Yu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:11:38Z

**Summary**: Agentic systems increasingly rely on reusable procedural capabilities, \textit{a.k.a., agentic skills}, to execute long-horizon workflows reliably. These capabilities are callable modules that package procedural knowledge with explicit applicability conditions, execution policies, termination criteria, and reusable interfaces. Unlike one-off plans or atomic tool calls, skills operate (and often do well) across tasks.   This paper maps the skill layer across the full lifecycle (discovery, practice, distillation, storage, composition, evaluation, and update) and introduces two complementary taxonomies. The first is a system-level set of \textbf{seven design patterns} capturing how skills are packaged and executed in practice, from metadata-driven progressive disclosure and executable code skills to self-evolving libraries and marketplace distribution. The second is an orthogonal \textbf{representation $\times$ scope} taxonomy describing what skills \emph{are} (natural language, code, policy, hybrid) and what environments they operate over (web, OS, software engineering, robotics).   We analyze the security and governance implications of skill-based agents, covering supply-chain risks, prompt injection via skill payloads, and trust-tiered execution, grounded by a case study of the ClawHavoc campaign in which nearly 1{,}200 malicious skills infiltrated a major agent marketplace, exfiltrating API keys, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser credentials at scale. We further survey deterministic evaluation approaches, anchored by recent benchmark evidence that curated skills can substantially improve agent success rates while self-generated skills may degrade them. We conclude with open challenges toward robust, verifiable, and certifiable skills for real-world autonomous agents.

### Oracular Programming: A Modular Foundation for Building LLM-Enabled Software
**Authors**: Jonathan Laurent, André Platzer

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:07:25Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models can solve a wide range of tasks from just a few examples, but they remain difficult to steer and lack a capability essential for building reliable software at scale: the modular composition of computations under enforceable contracts. As a result, they are typically embedded in larger software pipelines that use domain-specific knowledge to decompose tasks and improve reliability through validation and search. Yet the complexity of writing, tuning, and maintaining such pipelines has so far limited their sophistication. We propose oracular programming: a foundational paradigm for integrating traditional, explicit computations with inductive oracles such as LLMs. It rests on two directing principles: the full separation of core and search logic, and the treatment of few-shot examples as grounded and evolvable program components. Within this paradigm, experts express high-level problem-solving strategies as programs with unresolved choice points. These choice points are resolved at runtime by LLMs, which generalize from user-provided examples of correct and incorrect decisions. An oracular program is composed of three orthogonal components: a strategy that consists of a nondeterministic program with choice points that can be reified into a search tree, a policy that specifies how to navigate this tree with the help of LLM oracles, and a set of demonstrations that describe successful and unsuccessful tree navigation scenarios across diverse problem instances. Each component is expressed in a dedicated programming language and can be independently improved or substituted. We address the key programming language design challenges of modularly composing oracular programs and enforcing consistency between their components as they evolve.

### FinAnchor: Aligned Multi-Model Representations for Financial Prediction
**Authors**: Zirui He, Huopu Zhang, Yanguang Liu, Sirui Wu, Mengnan Du

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T13:02:09Z

**Summary**: Financial prediction from long documents involves significant challenges, as actionable signals are often sparse and obscured by noise, and the optimal LLM for generating embeddings varies across tasks and time periods. In this paper, we propose FinAnchor(Financial Anchored Representations), a lightweight framework that integrates embeddings from multiple LLMs without fine-tuning the underlying models. FinAnchor addresses the incompatibility of feature spaces by selecting an anchor embedding space and learning linear mappings to align representations from other models into this anchor. These aligned features are then aggregated to form a unified representation for downstream prediction. Across multiple financial NLP tasks, FinAnchor consistently outperforms strong single-model baselines and standard ensemble methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of anchoring heterogeneous representations for robust financial prediction.

### Repurposing Synthetic Data for Fine-grained Search Agent Supervision
**Authors**: Yida Zhao, Kuan Li, Xixi Wu, Liwen Zhang, Dingchu Zhang, Baixuan Li, Maojia Song, Zhuo Chen, Chenxi Wang, Xinyu Wang, Kewei Tu, Pengjun Xie, Jingren Zhou, Yong Jiang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T12:55:37Z

**Summary**: LLM-based search agents are increasingly trained on entity-centric synthetic data to solve complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, prevailing training methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) discard this rich entity information, relying instead on sparse, outcome-based rewards. This critical limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative "near-miss" samples-those with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final answer-from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals. We address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of ground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final answer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to effectively learn from these "near-misses". Experiments on diverse question-answering (QA) and deep research benchmarks show that E-GRPO consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that E-GRPO not only achieves superior accuracy but also induces more efficient reasoning policies that require fewer tool calls, demonstrating a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search agents.

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T12:33:49Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of large language model (LLM)-based agents has unlocked new possibilities for autonomous multi-turn reasoning and tool-augmented decision-making. However, their real-world deployment is hindered by severe inefficiencies that arise not from isolated model inference, but from the systemic latency accumulated across reasoning loops, context growth, and heterogeneous tool interactions. This paper presents AgentInfer, a unified framework for end-to-end agent acceleration that bridges inference optimization and architectural design. We decompose the problem into four synergistic components: AgentCollab, a hierarchical dual-model reasoning framework that balances large- and small-model usage through dynamic role assignment; AgentSched, a cache-aware hybrid scheduler that minimizes latency under heterogeneous request patterns; AgentSAM, a suffix-automaton-based speculative decoding method that reuses multi-session semantic memory to achieve low-overhead inference acceleration; and AgentCompress, a semantic compression mechanism that asynchronously distills and reorganizes agent memory without disrupting ongoing reasoning. Together, these modules form a Self-Evolution Engine capable of sustaining efficiency and cognitive stability throughout long-horizon reasoning tasks. Experiments on the BrowseComp-zh and DeepDiver benchmarks demonstrate that through the synergistic collaboration of these methods, AgentInfer reduces ineffective token consumption by over 50%, achieving an overall 1.8-2.5 times speedup with preserved accuracy. These results underscore that optimizing for agentic task completion-rather than merely per-token throughput-is the key to building scalable, efficient, and self-improving intelligent systems.

### PegasusFlow: Parallel Rolling-Denoising Score Sampling for Robot Diffusion Planner Flow Matching
**Authors**: Lei Ye, Haibo Gao, Peng Xu, Zhelin Zhang, Junqi Shan, Ao Zhang, Wei Zhang, Ruyi Zhou, Zongquan Deng, Liang Ding

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T12:33:35Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models offer powerful generative capabilities for robot trajectory planning, yet their practical deployment on robots is hindered by a critical bottleneck: a reliance on imitation learning from expert demonstrations. This paradigm is often impractical for specialized robots where data is scarce and creates an inefficient, theoretically suboptimal training pipeline. To overcome this, we introduce PegasusFlow, a hierarchical rolling-denoising framework that enables direct and parallel sampling of trajectory score gradients from environmental interaction, completely bypassing the need for expert data. Our core innovation is a novel sampling algorithm, Weighted Basis Function Optimization (WBFO), which leverages spline basis representations to achieve superior sample efficiency and faster convergence compared to traditional methods like MPPI. The framework is embedded within a scalable, asynchronous parallel simulation architecture that supports massively parallel rollouts for efficient data collection. Extensive experiments on trajectory optimization and robotic navigation tasks demonstrate that our approach, particularly Action-Value WBFO (AVWBFO) combined with a reinforcement learning warm-start, significantly outperforms baselines. In a challenging barrier-crossing task, our method achieved a 100% success rate and was 18% faster than the next-best method, validating its effectiveness for complex terrain locomotion planning. https://masteryip.github.io/pegasusflow.github.io/

### FastReChain: A Novel Bidirectional Model-Based Algorithm for Topology Engineering of OCS-Based Clusters
**Authors**: Zihan Zhu, Xinchi Han, Dongchao Wu, Zhanbang Zhang, Jian Yang, Shizhen Zhao, Xinbing Wang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T12:33:01Z

**Summary**: Optical Circuit Switching (OCS) technology is increasingly being adopted in data centers due to its advantages of low power consumption and low technology refresh costs. Unlike electrical packet switches, OCS provides programmable bandwidth for directly connected devices by configuring the mapping relationships of internal ports. Thus, how to calculate these internal port mapping relationships, i.e., Topology Engineering (ToE), is one of the key designs of OCS-based clusters.   Current deployments usually design ToE algorithms by solving Integer Linear Programming (ILP) models, with the aim of minimizing modifications to links occupied by running tasks as much as possible. However, ILP-based ToE algorithms may incur excessive runtime overhead in large-scale clusters. Some existing ToE algorithms convert the ILP model into a Minimum-Cost Flow model through greedy construction, yet such greedy strategies may increase the number of affected links during the OCS reconfiguration process. To solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel bidirectional modeling approach, along with a corresponding FastReChain algorithm in this paper. We verify the superiority of this algorithm through simulation experiments based on real-trace data.

### AgentDR: Dynamic Recommendation with Implicit Item-Item Relations via LLM-based Agents
**Authors**: Mingdai Yang, Nurendra Choudhary, Jiangshu Du, Edward W. Huang, Philip S. Yu, Karthik Subbian, Danai Koutra

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T12:32:53Z

**Summary**: Recent agent-based recommendation frameworks aim to simulate user behaviors by incorporating memory mechanisms and prompting strategies, but they struggle with hallucinating non-existent items and full-catalog ranking. Besides, a largely underexplored opportunity lies in leveraging LLMs'commonsense reasoning to capture user intent through substitute and complement relationships between items, which are usually implicit in datasets and difficult for traditional ID-based recommenders to capture. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-agent framework, AgenDR, which bridges LLM reasoning with scalable recommendation tools. Our approach delegates full-ranking tasks to traditional models while utilizing LLMs to (i) integrate multiple recommendation outputs based on personalized tool suitability and (ii) reason over substitute and complement relationships grounded in user history. This design mitigates hallucination, scales to large catalogs, and enhances recommendation relevance through relational reasoning. Through extensive experiments on three public grocery datasets, we show that our framework achieves superior full-ranking performance, yielding on average a twofold improvement over its underlying tools. We also introduce a new LLM-based evaluation metric that jointly measures semantic alignment and ranking correctness.

### Towards Robust Scaling Laws for Optimizers
**Authors**: Alexandra Volkova, Mher Safaryan, Christoph H. Lampert, Dan Alistarh

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T12:28:51Z

**Summary**: The quality of Large Language Model (LLM) pretraining depends on multiple factors, including the compute budget and the choice of optimization algorithm. Empirical scaling laws are widely used to predict loss as model size and training data grow, however, almost all existing studies fix the optimizer (typically AdamW). At the same time, a new generation of optimizers (e.g., Muon, Shampoo, SOAP) promises faster and more stable convergence, but their relationship with model and data scaling is not yet well understood. In this work, we study scaling laws across different optimizers. Empirically, we show that 1) separate Chinchilla-style scaling laws for each optimizer are ill-conditioned and have highly correlated parameters. Instead, 2) we propose a more robust law with shared power-law exponents and optimizer-specific rescaling factors, which enable direct comparison between optimizers. Finally, 3) we provide a theoretical analysis of gradient-based methods for the proxy task of a convex quadratic objective, demonstrating that Chinchilla-style scaling laws emerge naturally as a result of loss decomposition into irreducible, approximation, and optimization errors.

### Data-driven Prediction of Ionic Conductivity in Solid-State Electrolytes with Machine Learning and Large Language Models
**Authors**: Haewon Kim, Taekgi Lee, Seongeun Hong, Kyeong-Ho Kim, Yongchul G. Chung

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T12:17:34Z

**Summary**: Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are attractive for next-generation lithium-ion batteries due to improved safety and stability but their low room-temperature ionic conductivity hinders practical application. Experimental synthesis and testing of new SSEs remain time-consuming and resource intensive. Machine learning (ML) offers an accelerated route for SSE discovery; however, composition-only models neglect structural factors important for ion transport while graph neural networks (GNNs) are challenged by the scarcity of structure-labeled conductivity data and the prevalence of crystallographic disorder in CIFs. Here, we train two complementary predictors on the same room-temperature, structure-labeled dataset (n = 499). A gradient-boosted tree regressor (GBR) combining stoichiometric and geometric descriptors achieves best performance (MAE = 0.543 in log(S cm-1)), and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) identifies probe-occupiable volume (POAV) and lattice parameters as key correlations for conductivity. In parallel, we fine-tune large language models (LLMs) using compact text prompts derived from CIF metadata (formula with optional symmetry and disorder tags), avoiding direct use of raw atomic coordinates. Notably, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct achieves high accuracy (MAE = 0.657 in log(S cm-1)) using formula and symmetry information, eliminating the need for numerical feature extraction from CIF files. Together, these results show that global geometric descriptors improve tree-based predictions and enable interpretable structure-property analysis, while LLMs provide a competitive low-preprocessing alternative for rapid SSE screening.

### Semantic Parallelism: Redefining Efficient MoE Inference via Model-Data Co-Scheduling
**Authors**: Yan Li, Zhenyu Zhang, Zhengang Wang, Pengfei Chen, Pengfei Zheng

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T12:13:45Z

**Summary**: Prevailing LLM serving engines employ expert parallelism (EP) to implement multi-device inference of massive MoE models. However, the efficiency of expert parallel inference is largely bounded by inter-device communication, as EP embraces expensive all-to-all collectives to route tokens to the remote experts if not collocating on the same GPU/NPU device. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art schemes treat expert device-placement and request (or token) device-scheduling as separate concerns, triggering excessive communication between them and compromising inference efficiency   This paper proposes Semantic Parallelism, a novel parallelism paradigm that minimizes the steep communication costs in EP-centric MoE serving via model-data collaborative scheduling. We implement Semantic Parallelism in a framework called Sem-MoE. Sem-MoE maximally collocates experts and their activating tokens onto the same device using proactively modeled activation likelihood between them and introduces three key techniques: (1) Offline model scheduling, which preliminarily clusters and collocates experts onto devices based on their co-activation tendencies for certain classes of input. (2) Online inter-request data scheduling for Attention-DP setups, which proactively rebatches incoming requests onto the device that hosts experts most likely and frequently activated by the corresponding requests. (3) Online intra-request data scheduling for Attention-TP setups, which seamlessly fuses a token reshuffling procedure into the original inference pipeline and proactively reschedules tokens to devices to reduce dispersed remote routing. We build Sem-MoE into a prevailing LLM serving engine SGLANG. Experiments show our collaborative scheduling approach can effectively reduce the all-to-all communication volume in EP and achieve superior inference throughput compared to existing solutions.

### Geometric Analysis of Speech Representation Spaces: Topological Disentanglement and Confound Detection
**Authors**: Bipasha Kashyap, Pubudu N. Pathirana

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T12:00:52Z

**Summary**: Speech-based clinical tools are increasingly deployed in multilingual settings, yet whether pathological speech markers remain geometrically separable from accent variation remains unclear. Systems may misclassify healthy non-native speakers or miss pathology in multilingual patients. We propose a four-metric clustering framework to evaluate geometric disentanglement of emotional, linguistic, and pathological speech features across six corpora and eight dataset combinations. A consistent hierarchy emerges: emotional features form the tightest clusters (Silhouette 0.250), followed by pathological (0.141) and linguistic (0.077). Confound analysis shows pathological-linguistic overlap remains below 0.21, which is above the permutation null but bounded for clinical deployment. Trustworthiness analysis confirms embedding fidelity and robustness of the geometric conclusions. Our framework provides actionable guidelines for equitable and reliable speech health systems across diverse populations.

### Pressure Reveals Character: Behavioural Alignment Evaluation at Depth
**Authors**: Nora Petrova, John Burden

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T11:52:17Z

**Summary**: Evaluating alignment in language models requires testing how they behave under realistic pressure, not just what they claim they would do. While alignment failures increasingly cause real-world harm, comprehensive evaluation frameworks with realistic multi-turn scenarios remain lacking. We introduce an alignment benchmark spanning 904 scenarios across six categories -- Honesty, Safety, Non-Manipulation, Robustness, Corrigibility, and Scheming -- validated as realistic by human raters. Our scenarios place models under conflicting instructions, simulated tool access, and multi-turn escalation to reveal behavioural tendencies that single-turn evaluations miss. Evaluating 24 frontier models using LLM judges validated against human annotations, we find that even top-performing models exhibit gaps in specific categories, while the majority of models show consistent weaknesses across the board. Factor analysis reveals that alignment behaves as a unified construct (analogous to the g-factor in cognitive research) with models scoring high on one category tending to score high on others. We publicly release the benchmark and an interactive leaderboard to support ongoing evaluation, with plans to expand scenarios in areas where we observe persistent weaknesses and to add new models as they are released.

### Qwen-BIM: developing large language model for BIM-based design with domain-specific benchmark and dataset
**Authors**: Jia-Rui Lin, Yun-Hong Cai, Xiang-Rui Ni, Shaojie Zhou, Peng Pan

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T11:51:21Z

**Summary**: As the construction industry advances toward digital transformation, BIM (Building Information Modeling)-based design has become a key driver supporting intelligent construction. Despite Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in promoting BIM-based design, the lack of specific datasets and LLM evaluation benchmarks has significantly hindered the performance of LLMs. Therefore, this paper addresses this gap by proposing: 1) an evaluation benchmark for BIM-based design together with corresponding quantitative indicators to evaluate the performance of LLMs, 2) a method for generating textual data from BIM and constructing corresponding BIM-derived datasets for LLM evaluation and fine-tuning, and 3) a fine-tuning strategy to adapt LLMs for BIM-based design. Results demonstrate that the proposed domain-specific benchmark effectively and comprehensively assesses LLM capabilities, highlighting that general LLMs are still incompetent for domain-specific tasks. Meanwhile, with the proposed benchmark and datasets, Qwen-BIM is developed and achieves a 21.0% average increase in G-Eval score compared to the base LLM model. Notably, with only 14B parameters, performance of Qwen-BIM is comparable to that of general LLMs with 671B parameters for BIM-based design tasks. Overall, this study develops the first domain-specific LLM for BIM-based design by introducing a comprehensive benchmark and high-quality dataset, which provide a solid foundation for developing BIM-related LLMs in various fields.

### Mitigating Preference Leakage via Strict Estimator Separation for Normative Generative Ranking
**Authors**: Dalia Nahhas, Xiaohao Cai, Imran Razzak, Shoaib Jameel

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T11:38:36Z

**Summary**: In Generative Information Retrieval (GenIR), the bottleneck has shifted from generation to the selection of candidates, particularly for normative criteria such as cultural relevance. Current LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations often suffer from circularity and preference leakage, where overlapping supervision and evaluation models inflate performance. We address this by formalising cultural relevance as a within-query ranking task and introducing a leakage-free two-judge framework that strictly separates supervision (Judge B) from evaluation (Judge A). On a new benchmark of 33,052 (NGR-33k) culturally grounded stories, we find that while classical baselines yield only modest gains, a dense bi-encoder distilled from a Judge-B-supervised Cross-Encoder is highly effective. Although the Cross-Encoder provides a strong supervision signal for distillation, the distilled BGE-M3 model substantially outperforms it under leakage-free Judge~A evaluation. We validate our framework on the human-curated Moral Stories dataset, showing strong alignment with human norms. Our results demonstrate that rigorous evaluator separation is a prerequisite for credible GenIR evaluation, proving that subtle cultural preferences can be distilled into efficient rankers without leakage.

### Unseen-Codebases-Domain Data Synthesis and Training Based on Code Graphs
**Authors**: Guangsheng Ou, Qiming Zhang, Sirong Chen, Anji Li, Dong Xu, Tiancheng Luo, Dekun Dai, Cuiyun Gao, Long Wang, Jun Zhou, Mingwei Liu, Zibin Zheng

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T11:36:34Z

**Summary**: In the context of newly release software frameworks, large language models (LLMs) often exhibit poor performance and a high rate of hallucination, as they are not exposed to such environments during training. Although inference-time augmentation techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can partially mitigate hallucinations, knowledge injection through prompting alone is insufficient to enable models to fully understand the intrinsic relationships among different components of a codebase, or to reason about the correct compositions and apply. Although explicit knowledge injection can be achieved through post-training, compared with public code domains, unseen codebases typically provide only source code and lack large volumes of high-quality, usage-oriented code that can be directly leveraged as training data. Consequently, existing data synthesis approaches are insufficient to adequately capture unseen codebases usage scenarios when restricted to source code alone. To address these challenges, we propose UCD-Training, a two-stage training framework for reasoning-aware data synthesis grounded in a code graph constructed from unseen codebases. UCD-Training first parses the source code to build a code graph, then conducts dependency-preserving continued pretraining (CPT) using file-level dependency data, followed by graph-grounded supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on three types of synthesized data augmented with explicit reasoning traces: (1) single-hop relation reasoning data, (2) compositional API reasoning data, and (3) codebase utilization data. We further introduce a new benchmark, UnseenCodeBench, for code generation on unseen codebases and conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple codebases.

### Refusal Steering: Fine-grained Control over LLM Refusal Behaviour for Sensitive Topics
**Authors**: Iker García-Ferrero, David Montero, Roman Orus

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T11:22:02Z

**Summary**: We introduce Refusal Steering, an inference-time method to exercise fine-grained control over Large Language Models refusal behaviour on politically sensitive topics without retraining. We replace fragile pattern-based refusal detection with an LLM-as-a-judge that assigns refusal confidence scores and we propose a ridge-regularized variant to compute steering vectors that better isolate the refusal--compliance direction. On Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, our method removes the refusal behaviour of the model around politically sensitive topics while maintaining safety on JailbreakBench and near-baseline performance on general benchmarks. The approach generalizes across 4B and 80B models and can also induce targeted refusals when desired. We analize the steering vectors and show that refusal signals concentrate in deeper layers of the transformer and are distributed across many dimensions. Together, these results demonstrate that activation steering can remove political refusal behaviour while retaining safety alignment for harmful content, offering a practical path to controllable, transparent moderation at inference time.

### Federated Learning for Cross-Modality Medical Image Segmentation via Augmentation-Driven Generalization
**Authors**: Sachin Dudda Nagaraju, Ashkan Moradi, Bendik Skarre Abrahamsen, Mattijs Elschot

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T11:13:01Z

**Summary**: Artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative tool in medical image analysis, yet developing robust and generalizable segmentation models remains difficult due to fragmented, privacy-constrained imaging data siloed across institutions. While federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without centralizing data, cross-modality domain shifts pose a critical challenge, particularly when models trained on one modality fail to generalize to another. Many existing solutions require paired multimodal data per patient or rely on complex architectures, both of which are impractical in real clinical settings. In this work, we consider a realistic FL scenario where each client holds single-modality data (CT or MRI), and systematically investigate augmentation strategies for cross-modality generalization. Using abdominal organ segmentation and whole-heart segmentation as representative multi-class and binary segmentation benchmarks, we evaluate convolution-based spatial augmentation, frequency-domain manipulation, domain-specific normalization, and global intensity nonlinear (GIN) augmentation. Our results show that GIN consistently outperforms alternatives in both centralized and federated settings by simulating cross-modality appearance variations while preserving anatomical structure. For the pancreas, Dice score improved from 0.073 to 0.437, a 498% gain. Our federated approach achieves 93-98% of centralized training accuracy, demonstrating strong cross-modality generalization without compromising data privacy, pointing toward feasible federated AI deployment across diverse healthcare systems.

### Nacrith: Neural Lossless Compression via Ensemble Context Modeling and High-Precision CDF Coding
**Authors**: Roberto Tacconelli

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T11:10:17Z

**Summary**: We present Nacrith, a lossless compression system that combines a 135M-parameter transformer language model (SmolLM2-135M) with an ensemble of lightweight online predictors and a 32-bit arithmetic coder, achieving the best compression results among the systems evaluated in this study on natural language text. Beyond the base LLM-plus-arithmetic-coding paradigm, Nacrith introduces several contributions: (1) a CDF precision upgrade from 2^16 to 2^24 that eliminates ~75% of quantization overhead caused by minimum-probability floors in large vocabularies; (2) a token-level N-gram model for fast local predictions; (3) an adaptive log-space bias head correcting per-document LLM errors via online gradient descent; (4) confidence-based LLM skip for accelerating highly predictable tokens; (5) a hybrid binary format (NC06) extending neural compression to arbitrary binary files--to our knowledge a first among LLM-based compressors; (6) a llama cpp inference backend achieving ~7x faster single-token decode than PyTorch; (7) parallel multi-GPU compression across up to 8 workers; and (8) native KV cache sliding window reducing per-slide cost by ~37x. The system requires only ~500 MB of GGUF weights and ~1.2 GB VRAM per worker, running on consumer GPUs.   On alice29 (Canterbury Corpus, 152 KB), Nacrith achieves 0.918 bits per byte (bpb)--outperforming gzip by 3.1x, bzip2 by 2.5x, CMIX v21 by 44%, and ts_zip by 20%, while compressing below the 0th-, 1st-, and 2nd-order byte-level Shannon entropy bounds. On enwik8 (100 MB), Nacrith achieves 0.9389 bpb (11.74%), surpassing ts_zip (~1.11 bpb) by 15% and FineZip (1.024 bpb) by 8% despite using a 60x smaller model with no fine-tuning. An out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation on a document published after the model's training cutoff confirms these gains are not memorization artifacts, achieving 0.723 bpb on unseen text.

### Uncertainty Calibration of Multi-Label Bird Sound Classifiers
**Authors**: Raphael Schwinger, Ben McEwen, Vincent S. Kather, René Heinrich, Lukas Rauch, Sven Tomforde

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T11:04:10Z

**Summary**: Passive acoustic monitoring enables large-scale biodiversity assessment, but reliable classification of bioacoustic sounds requires not only high accuracy but also well-calibrated uncertainty estimates to ground decision-making. In bioacoustics, calibration is challenged by overlapping vocalisations, long-tailed species distributions, and distribution shifts between training and deployment data. The calibration of multi-label deep learning classifiers within the domain of bioacoustics has not yet been assessed. We systematically benchmark the calibration of four state-of-the-art multi-label bird sound classifiers on the BirdSet benchmark, evaluating both global, per-dataset and per-class calibration using threshold-free calibration metrics (ECE, MCS) alongside discrimination metrics (cmAP). Model calibration varies significantly across datasets and classes. While Perch v2 and ConvNeXt$_{BS}$ show better global calibration, results vary between datasets. Both models indicate consistent underconfidence, while AudioProtoPNet and BirdMAE are mostly overconfident. Surprisingly, calibration seems to be better for less frequent classes. Using simple post hoc calibration methods we demonstrate a straightforward way to improve calibration. A small labelled calibration set is sufficient to significantly improve calibration with Platt scaling, while global calibration parameters suffer from dataset variability. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating and improving uncertainty calibration in bioacoustic classifiers.

### Pipeline for Verifying LLM-Generated Mathematical Solutions
**Authors**: Varvara Sazonova, Dmitri Shmelkin, Stanislav Kikot, Vasily Motolygin

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T11:01:25Z

**Summary**: With the growing popularity of Large Reasoning Models and their results in solving mathematical problems, it becomes crucial to measure their capabilities. We introduce a pipeline for both automatic and interactive verification as a more accurate alternative to only checking the answer which is currently the most popular approach for benchmarks. The pipeline can also be used as a generator of correct solutions both in formal and informal languages. 3 AI agents, which can be chosen for the benchmark accordingly, are included in the structure. The key idea is the use of prompts to obtain the solution in the specific form which allows for easier verification using proof assistants and possible use of small models ($\le 8B$). Experiments on several datasets suggest low probability of False Positives. The open-source implementation with instructions on setting up a server is available at https://github.com/LogicEnj/lean4_verification_pipeline.

### Anatomy of Unlearning: The Dual Impact of Fact Salience and Model Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Borisiuk Anna, Andrey Savchenko, Alexander Panchenko, Elena Tutubalina

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T10:56:28Z

**Summary**: Machine Unlearning (MU) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to remove unsafe or outdated information. However, existing work assumes that all facts are equally forgettable and largely ignores whether the forgotten knowledge originates from pretraining or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this paper, we introduce DUAL (Dual Unlearning Evaluation across Training Stages), a benchmark of 28.6k Wikidata-derived triplets annotated with fact popularity using Wikipedia link counts and LLM-based salience scores. Our experiments show that pretrained and SFT models respond differently to unlearning. An SFT step on the forget data yields smoother forgetting, more stable tuning, and 10-50% higher retention, while direct unlearning on pretrained models remains unstable and prone to relearning or catastrophic forgetting.

### SAGE-5GC: Security-Aware Guidelines for Evaluating Anomaly Detection in the 5G Core Network
**Authors**: Cristian Manca, Christian Scano, Giorgio Piras, Fabio Brau, Maura Pintor, Battista Biggio

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T10:55:09Z

**Summary**: Machine learning-based anomaly detection systems are increasingly being adopted in 5G Core networks to monitor complex, high-volume traffic. However, most existing approaches are evaluated under strong assumptions that rarely hold in operational environments, notably the availability of independent and identically distributed (IID) data and the absence of adaptive attackers. In this work, we study the problem of detecting 5G attacks in the wild, focusing on realistic deployment settings. We propose a set of Security-Aware Guidelines for Evaluating anomaly detectors in 5G Core Network (SAGE-5GC), driven by domain knowledge and consideration of potential adversarial threats. Using a realistic 5G Core dataset, we first train several anomaly detectors and assess their baseline performance against standard 5GC control-plane cyberattacks targeting PFCP-based network services. We then extend the evaluation to adversarial settings, where an attacker tries to manipulate the observable features of the network traffic to evade detection, under the constraint that the intended functionality of the malicious traffic is preserved. Starting from a selected set of controllable features, we analyze model sensitivity and adversarial robustness through randomized perturbations. Finally, we introduce a practical optimization strategy based on genetic algorithms that operates exclusively on attacker-controllable features and does not require prior knowledge of the underlying detection model. Our experimental results show that adversarially crafted attacks can substantially degrade detection performance, underscoring the need for robust, security-aware evaluation methodologies for anomaly detection in 5G networks deployed in the wild.

### STAR: Similarity-guided Teacher-Assisted Refinement for Super-Tiny Function Calling Models
**Authors**: Jiliang Ni, Jiachen Pu, Zhongyi Yang, Jingfeng Luo, Conggang Hu

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T10:53:31Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in function calling is pivotal for creating advanced AI agents, yet their large scale hinders widespread adoption, necessitating transferring their capabilities into smaller ones. However, existing paradigms are often plagued by overfitting, training instability, ineffective binary rewards for multi-solution tasks, and the difficulty of synergizing techniques. We introduce STAR: Similarity-guided Teacher-Assisted Refinement, a novel holistic framework that effectively transfers LLMs' capabilities to super-tiny models. STAR consists of two core technical innovations: (1) Constrained Knowledge Distillation (CKD), a training objective that augments top-k forward KL divergence to suppress confidently incorrect predictions, ensuring training stability while preserving exploration capacity for downstream RL. STAR holistically synergizes these strategies within a cohesive training curriculum, enabling super-tiny models to achieve exceptional performance on complex function calling tasks; (2) Similarity-guided RL (Sim-RL), a RL mechanism that introduces a fine-grained, similarity-based reward. This provides a robust, continuous, and rich signal for better policy optimization by evaluating the similarity between generated outputs and the ground truth. Extensive experiments on challenging and renowned benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our STAR models establish SOTA in their size classes, significantly outperforming baselines. Remarkably, our 0.6B STAR model achieves the best performance among all open models under 1B, surpassing even several well-known open models at a larger scale. STAR demonstrates a training framework that distills capabilities of LLMs into super-tiny models, paving the way for powerful, accessible, and efficient AI agents.

### Rethinking RSSI for WiFi Sensing
**Authors**: Zhongqin Wang, J. Andrew Zhang, Kai Wu, Y. Jay Guo

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T10:35:47Z

**Summary**: The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is ubiquitously available on commodity WiFi devices but is commonly regarded as too coarse for fine-grained sensing. This paper revisits its sensing potential and presents WiRSSI, a bistatic WiFi sensing framework that enables RSSI-only passive human tracking and motion sensing. WiRSSI employs a transmitter and a receiver equipped with a three-antenna array (1Tx-3Rx), and is readily extensible to Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) deployments. We first show how Channel State Information (CSI) power implicitly preserves phase-related motion modulation and how this relationship carries over to RSSI, indicating that RSSI can retain exploitable Doppler, Angle-of-Arrival (AoA), and delay cues. WiRSSI extracts Doppler-AoA features via a lightweight 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) pipeline and infers bistatic delay from amplitude-only information in the absence of subcarrier-level phase. The estimated AoA and delay are then mapped to Cartesian coordinates and denoised to recover motion trajectories. Experiments in practical environments show that WiRSSI achieves median XY localization errors of 0.905 m, 0.784 m, and 0.785 m for elliptical, linear, and rectangular trajectories, respectively, compared with 0.574 m, 0.599 m, and 0.514 m from a representative CSI-based method. We further demonstrate RSSI-only gesture recognition on the Widar3.0 dataset, where WiRSSI features provide meaningful discriminative performance. These results suggest that, despite lacking subcarrier-level information compared with CSI, RSSI can support practical WiFi sensing as a complementary and hardware-friendly option when CSI is restricted, unreliable, or privacy-sensitive.

**Authors**: Abdelrahman Shaker, Ahmed Heakl, Jaseel Muhammad, Ritesh Thawkar, Omkar Thawakar, Senmao Li, Hisham Cholakkal, Ian Reid, Eric P. Xing, Salman Khan, Fahad Shahbaz Khan

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T10:29:43Z

**Summary**: Unified multimodal models can both understand and generate visual content within a single architecture. Existing models, however, remain data-hungry and too heavy for deployment on edge devices. We present Mobile-O, a compact vision-language-diffusion model that brings unified multimodal intelligence to a mobile device. Its core module, the Mobile Conditioning Projector (MCP), fuses vision-language features with a diffusion generator using depthwise-separable convolutions and layerwise alignment. This design enables efficient cross-modal conditioning with minimal computational cost. Trained on only a few million samples and post-trained in a novel quadruplet format (generation prompt, image, question, answer), Mobile-O jointly enhances both visual understanding and generation capabilities. Despite its efficiency, Mobile-O attains competitive or superior performance compared to other unified models, achieving 74% on GenEval and outperforming Show-O and JanusFlow by 5% and 11%, while running 6x and 11x faster, respectively. For visual understanding, Mobile-O surpasses them by 15.3% and 5.1% averaged across seven benchmarks. Running in only ~3s per 512x512 image on an iPhone, Mobile-O establishes the first practical framework for real-time unified multimodal understanding and generation on edge devices. We hope Mobile-O will ease future research in real-time unified multimodal intelligence running entirely on-device with no cloud dependency. Our code, models, datasets, and mobile application are publicly available at https://amshaker.github.io/Mobile-O/

### Coherent and Multi-modality Image Inpainting via Latent Space Optimization
**Authors**: Lingzhi Pan, Tong Zhang, Bingyuan Chen, Qi Zhou, Wei Ke, Sabine Süsstrunk, Mathieu Salzmann

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T10:22:16Z

**Summary**: With the advancements in denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), image inpainting has significantly evolved from merely filling information based on nearby regions to generating content conditioned on various prompts such as text, exemplar images, and sketches. However, existing methods, such as model fine-tuning and simple concatenation of latent vectors, often result in generation failures due to overfitting and inconsistency between the inpainted region and the background. In this paper, we argue that the current large diffusion models are sufficiently powerful to generate realistic images without further tuning. Hence, we introduce PILOT (in\textbf{P}ainting v\textbf{I}a \textbf{L}atent \textbf{O}p\textbf{T}imization), an optimization approach grounded on a novel \textit{semantic centralization} and \textit{background preservation loss}. Our method searches latent spaces capable of generating inpainted regions that exhibit high fidelity to user-provided prompts while maintaining coherence with the background. Furthermore, we propose a strategy to balance optimization expense and image quality, significantly enhancing generation efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with any pre-trained model, including ControlNet and DreamBooth, making it suitable for deployment in multi-modal editing tools. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that PILOT outperforms existing approaches by generating more coherent, diverse, and faithful inpainted regions in response to provided prompts.

The system uses smaller LLMs, enabling operation on a single   consumer-grade GPU while supporting complex research tasks. It builds on the   G-RAG system, winner of the ACM~SIGIR~2025 LiveRAG Challenge, and extends it   with modules informed by qualitative review of outputs. R2RAG won the Best   Dynamic Evaluation award in the Open Source category, demonstrating high   effectiveness with careful design and efficient use of resources.

### CHESS: Context-aware Hierarchical Efficient Semantic Selection for Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Chao Fei, Guozhong Li, Chenxi Liu, Panos Kalnis

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T09:54:59Z

**Summary**: Long-context LLMs demand accurate inference at low latency, yet decoding becomes primarily constrained by KV cache as context grows. Prior pruning methods are largely context-agnostic: their token selection ignores step-wise relevance and local semantics, which undermines quality. Moreover, their irregular accesses and selection overheads yield only limited wall-clock speedups. To address this, we propose \textbf{CHESS}, an \textit{algorithm-system co-design} KV-cache management system. Algorithmically, CHESS introduces a context-aware, hierarchical selection policy that dynamically reconstructs a coherent context for the current decoding. System-wise, coarse granularity selection eliminates expensive data movement, fully realizing practical acceleration from theoretical sparsity. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CHESS surpasses Full-KV quality using only \textbf{1\%} of the KV cache, delivers low-latency stable inference with up to \textbf{4.56$\times$} higher throughput, and consistently outperforms other strong baselines.

### Balancing Multiple Objectives in Urban Traffic Control with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback
**Authors**: Chenyang Zhao, Vinny Cahill, Ivana Dusparic

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T09:47:25Z

**Summary**: Reward design has been one of the central challenges for real world reinforcement learning (RL) deployment, especially in settings with multiple objectives. Preference-based RL offers an appealing alternative by learning from human preferences over pairs of behavioural outcomes. More recently, RL from AI feedback (RLAIF) has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can generate preference labels at scale, mitigating the reliance on human annotators. However, existing RLAIF work typically focuses only on single-objective tasks, leaving the open question of how RLAIF handles systems that involve multiple objectives. In such systems trade-offs among conflicting objectives are difficult to specify, and policies risk collapsing into optimizing for a dominant goal. In this paper, we explore the extension of the RLAIF paradigm to multi-objective self-adaptive systems. We show that multi-objective RLAIF can produce policies that yield balanced trade-offs reflecting different user priorities without laborious reward engineering. We argue that integrating RLAIF into multi-objective RL offers a scalable path toward user-aligned policy learning in domains with inherently conflicting objectives.

### ID-LoRA: Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation Inspired by Matrix Interpolative Decomposition
**Authors**: Xindian Ma, Rundong Kong, Peng Zhang, Ruoxiang Huang, Yongyu Jiang

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T09:45:10Z

**Summary**: LoRA has become a universal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) technique that equips Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt quickly to new tasks. However, when these models are scaled up, even the latest LoRA variants still introduce considerable overhead in trainable parameters. Conversely, aggressively lowering the rank to curb this overhead markedly degrades performance in complex multi-task settings. We propose ID-LoRA, a novel PEFT framework that breaks the trade-off. Its core innovation lies in extracting and reusing clustered parameter groups from the pretrained weight matrix. These groups are then used to form multiple low-rank components, all of which share only a single initialized trainable low-rank matrix. This approach cuts the number of trainable parameters while keeping the model's capacity intact. We evaluate ID-LoRA on five diverse benchmarks: Mathematical Reasoning, Code Generation, MMLU, CommonsenseQA, and Safety Alignment. ID-LoRA outperforms both full fine-tuning and existing PEFT baselines (e.g., LoRA, DoRA, HydraLoRA) while using up to 46% fewer trainable parameters than the standard LoRA. In multi-task scenarios, it surpasses LoRA and its recent variants (e.g., DoRA and HydraLoRA) on both Code and MMLU tasks, yet requires only 54% of the trainable parameters demanded by the conventional LoRA.

### AdapTools: Adaptive Tool-based Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks on Agentic LLMs
**Authors**: Che Wang, Jiaming Zhang, Ziqi Zhang, Zijie Wang, Yinghui Wang, Jianbo Gao, Tao Wei, Zhong Chen, Wei Yang Bryan Lim

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T09:32:19Z

**Summary**: The integration of external data services (e.g., Model Context Protocol, MCP) has made large language model-based agents increasingly powerful for complex task execution. However, this advancement introduces critical security vulnerabilities, particularly indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks. Existing attack methods are limited by their reliance on static patterns and evaluation on simple language models, failing to address the fast-evolving nature of modern AI agents. We introduce AdapTools, a novel adaptive IPI attack framework that selects stealthier attack tools and generates adaptive attack prompts to create a rigorous security evaluation environment. Our approach comprises two key components: (1) Adaptive Attack Strategy Construction, which develops transferable adversarial strategies for prompt optimization, and (2) Attack Enhancement, which identifies stealthy tools capable of circumventing task-relevance defenses. Comprehensive experimental evaluation shows that AdapTools achieves a 2.13 times improvement in attack success rate while degrading system utility by a factor of 1.78. Notably, the framework maintains its effectiveness even against state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. Our method advances the understanding of IPI attacks and provides a useful reference for future research.

### Coupling Experts and Routers in Mixture-of-Experts via an Auxiliary Loss
**Authors**: Ang Lv, Jin Ma, Yiyuan Ma, Siyuan Qiao

**Updated**: 2026-02-24T09:29:19Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models lack explicit constraints to ensure the router's decisions align well with the experts' capabilities, which ultimately limits model performance. To address this, we propose expert-router coupling (ERC) loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss that tightly couples the router's decisions with expert capabilities. Our approach treats each expert's router embedding as a proxy token for the tokens assigned to that expert, and feeds perturbed router embeddings through the experts to obtain intermediate activations. The ERC loss enforces two constraints on these activations: (1) Each expert must exhibit higher activation for its own proxy token than for the proxy tokens of any other expert. (2) Each proxy token must elicit stronger activation from its corresponding expert than from any other expert. These constraints jointly ensure that each router embedding faithfully represents its corresponding expert's capability, while each expert specializes in processing the tokens actually routed to it. The ERC loss is computationally efficient, operating only on $n^2$ activations, where $n$ is the number of experts. This represents a fixed cost independent of batch size, unlike prior coupling methods that scale with the number of tokens (often millions per batch). Through pre-training MoE-LLMs ranging from 3B to 15B parameters and extensive analysis on trillions of tokens, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERC loss. Moreover, the ERC loss offers flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization levels during training, providing valuable insights into MoEs.
