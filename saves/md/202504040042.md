**Authors**: Weixiang Zhang, Shuzhao Xie, Chengwei Ren, Siyi Xie, Chen Tang, Shijia Ge, Mingzi Wang, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T14:51:11Z

**Summary**: We propose EVOlutionary Selector (EVOS), an efficient training paradigm for accelerating Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Unlike conventional INR training that feeds all samples through the neural network in each iteration, our approach restricts training to strategically selected points, reducing computational overhead by eliminating redundant forward passes. Specifically, we treat each sample as an individual in an evolutionary process, where only those fittest ones survive and merit inclusion in training, adaptively evolving with the neural network dynamics. While this is conceptually similar to Evolutionary Algorithms, their distinct objectives (selection for acceleration vs. iterative solution optimization) require a fundamental redefinition of evolutionary mechanisms for our context. In response, we design sparse fitness evaluation, frequency-guided crossover, and augmented unbiased mutation to comprise EVOS. These components respectively guide sample selection with reduced computational cost, enhance performance through frequency-domain balance, and mitigate selection bias from cached evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves approximately 48%-66% reduction in training time while ensuring superior convergence without additional cost, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.

**Authors**: Dean You, Jieyu Jiang, Xiaoxuan Wang, Yushu Du, Zhihang Tan, Wenbo Xu, Hui Wang, Jiapeng Guan, Zhenyuan Wang, Ran Wei, Shuai Zhao, Zhe Jiang

**Summary**: Runahead execution is a technique to mask memory latency caused by irregular memory accesses. By pre-executing the application code during occurrences of long-latency operations and prefetching anticipated cache-missed data into the cache hierarchy, runahead effectively masks memory latency for subsequent cache misses and achieves high prefetching accuracy; however, this technique has been limited to superscalar out-of-order and superscalar in-order cores. For implementation in scalar in-order cores, the challenges of area-/energy-constraint and severe cache contention remain.   Here, we build the first full-stack system featuring runahead, MERE, from SoC and a dedicated ISA to the OS and programming model. Through this deployment, we show that enabling runahead in scalar in-order cores is possible, with minimal area and power overheads, while still achieving high performance. By re-constructing the sequential runahead employing a hardware/software co-design approach, the system can be implemented on a mature processor and SoC. Building on this, an adaptive runahead mechanism is proposed to mitigate the severe cache contention in scalar in-order cores. Combining this, we provide a comprehensive solution for embedded processors managing irregular workloads. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed MERE attains 93.5% of a 2-wide out-of-order core's performance while constraining area and power overheads below 5%, with the adaptive runahead mechanism delivering an additional 20.1% performance gain through mitigating the severe cache contention issues.

**Authors**: Shuqing Luo, Jie Peng, Pingzhi Li, Hanrui Wang, Tianlong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T04:57:15Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a practical approach to scale up parameters for the Transformer model to achieve better generalization while maintaining a sub-linear increase in computation overhead. Current MoE models are mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it usually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy communication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore developing a \texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \texttt{EX}pert \texttt{A}llocation framework, \textbf{\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing efficiency. It contains two components: ($1$) \textit{Expert-Specific Operators}. We replace the typical general matrix multiplication or grouped matrix multiplication interfaces with our operators, which allows the computing to be performed in an in-place manner with \textbf{ZERO} redundancy. ($2$) \textit{Adaptive Data- and Model-Centric Configurations} for different workload scales. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline-shared cache on each device to tackle the heavy memory consumption in the existing data-centric MoE library. Comprehensive experiments on the Swin-MoE benchmark consistently reveal the effectiveness of our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} framework, i.e., reducing $10\%\sim48\%$ memory consumption and achieving $0.5\sim4.3\times$ speed up compared to current state-of-the-art MoE libraries. Furthermore, we examine our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} with heterogeneous devices for both data- and model-centric settings. Promising results show that employing optimal parallel configuration with \texttt{HEXA-MoE} on heterogeneous devices can substantially minimize overall latency. Codes are available at https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/HEXA-MoE.

### MagicDec: Breaking the Latency-Throughput Tradeoff for Long Context   Generation with Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Jian Chen, Zhuoming Chen, Vashisth Tiwari, Ruihang Lai, Jinyuan Shi, Ian En-Hsu Yen, Avner May, Tianqi Chen, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T01:58:38Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency losslessly, but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy SD more effectively for high throughput inference. We leverage draft model with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck, which scales with both sequence length and batch size. Additionally, we propose a theoretical model to select the optimal drafting strategy for maximum speedup. Our work highlights the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2.51x speedup for Llama3.1-8B when serving batch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on various types of hardware and tasks.

**Authors**: Seungheon Shin, Kyle Liddy, Yinxuan Zhu, Chandan Joishi, Brianna A. Klein, Andrew Armstrong, Andrew A. Allerman, Siddharth Rajan

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T01:49:58Z

**Summary**: We report on energy bands and breakdown characteristics of Al2O3 dielectrics on ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructures. Metal-dielectric-semiconductor structures are important to sustain high fields needed for future high-performance UWBG transistors. Using systematic experiments, we determined the fixed charge density (> 1013 cm-2), the dielectric/interface, and electric fields in the oxide of under flat-band conditions in the semiconductor. Low gate-to-drain leakage current of up to 5 x 10-7 A/cm2 were obtained in the metal-oxide-semiconductor structures. In lateral metal-semiconductor-insulator test structures, breakdown voltage exceeding 1 kV was obtained with a channel sheet charge density of 1.27 x 1013 cm-2. The effective peak electric field and average breakdown field were estimated to be > 4.27 MV/cm and 1.99 MV/cm, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of Al2O2 integration for enhancing the breakdown performance of UWBG AlGaN HEMTs.

### Scaling Test-Time Inference with Policy-Optimized, Dynamic   Retrieval-Augmented Generation via KV Caching and Decoding
**Authors**: Sakhinana Sagar Srinivas, Venkataramana Runkana

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T01:23:22Z

**Summary**: We present a comprehensive framework for enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems through dynamic retrieval strategies and reinforcement fine-tuning. This approach significantly improves large language models on knowledge-intensive tasks, including opendomain question answering and complex reasoning. Our framework integrates two complementary techniques: Policy-Optimized RetrievalAugmented Generation (PORAG), which optimizes the use of retrieved information, and Adaptive Token-Layer Attention Scoring (ATLAS), which dynamically determines retrieval timing and content based on contextual needs. Together, these techniques enhance both the utilization and relevance of retrieved content, improving factual accuracy and response quality. Designed as a lightweight solution compatible with any Transformer-based LLM without requiring additional training, our framework excels in knowledge-intensive tasks, boosting output accuracy in RAG settings. We further propose CRITIC, a novel method to selectively compress key-value caches by token importance, mitigating memory bottlenecks in long-context applications. The framework also incorporates test-time scaling techniques to dynamically balance reasoning depth and computational resources, alongside optimized decoding strategies for faster inference. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our framework reduces hallucinations, strengthens domain-specific reasoning, and achieves significant efficiency and scalability gains over traditional RAG systems. This integrated approach advances the development of robust, efficient, and scalable RAG systems across diverse applications.

### Beyond Quacking: Deep Integration of Language Models and RAG into DuckDB
**Authors**: Anas Dorbani, Sunny Yasser, Jimmy Lin, Amine Mhedhbi

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T19:48:17Z

**Summary**: Knowledge-intensive analytical applications retrieve context from both structured tabular data and unstructured, text-free documents for effective decision-making. Large language models (LLMs) have made it significantly easier to prototype such retrieval and reasoning data pipelines. However, implementing these pipelines efficiently still demands significant effort and has several challenges. This often involves orchestrating heterogeneous data systems, managing data movement, and handling low-level implementation details, e.g., LLM context management.   To address these challenges, we introduce FlockMTL: an extension for DBMSs that deeply integrates LLM capabilities and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FlockMTL includes model-driven scalar and aggregate functions, enabling chained predictions through tuple-level mappings and reductions. Drawing inspiration from the relational model, FlockMTL incorporates: (i) cost-based optimizations, which seamlessly apply techniques such as batching and caching; and (ii) resource independence, enabled through novel SQL DDL abstractions: PROMPT and MODEL, introduced as first-class schema objects alongside TABLE. FlockMTL streamlines the development of knowledge-intensive analytical applications, and its optimizations ease the implementation burden.

### Fundamentals of Caching Layered Data objects
**Authors**: Agrim Bari, Gustavo de Veciana, George Kesidis

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T18:21:43Z

**Summary**: The effective management of large amounts of data processed or required by today's cloud or edge computing systems remains a fundamental challenge. This paper focuses on cache management for applications where data objects can be stored in layered representations. In such representations, each additional data layer enhances the "quality" of the object's version but comes with an incremental cost of memory space. This layered approach proves beneficial in various scenarios, including the delivery of zoomable maps, video coding, future Virtual Reality gaming, and layered neural network models where additional data layers improve inference accuracy. In systems where users or devices demand different versions of a data object, layered representations offer flexibility for caching policies to achieve improved hit rates.   In this paper, we explore the performance of various traditionally studied caching policies, such as Belady, LRU, and LFU, both with and without layering. To this end, we develop an asymptotically accurate analytical model for Layered LRU (LLRU). We study how the performance of LLRU is impacted by factors such as the number of layers, the popularity of different objects and layers, and overheads associated with storing layered representations. For instance, we show that, for LLRU, more layers are not always beneficial and indeed performance depends in subtle ways on the popularity and size profiles of layers.

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T18:00:48Z

**Summary**: Water drops spontaneously accumulate charges when they move on hydrophobic dielectric surfaces by slide electrification. On the one hand, slide electrification generates electricity with possible applications on tiny devices. On the other hand, the potential of up to 1 KV generated by slide electrification alters wetting and drop motion. Therefore, it is important to know the factors that affect slide electrification. To find out how surfactants affect slide electrification, we measured drop charges of aqueous drops containing cationic CTAB, anionic SDS and neutral C8E3 sliding on different hydrophobic surfaces. The result is: addition of surfactant significantly reduces the spontaneous charging of moving water drops. Based on zeta potential measurements, confocal microscopy of deposited surface-active dyes and drop impact studies, we propose that several factors contribute to this suppression of charge separation: (1) Surfactants tend to lower the contact angles, which reduces charge separation. (2) Surfactant adsorption at the solid-liquid interface can reduce the density of primary ions, particularly for anionic surfactants. (3) Anionic and neutral surfactants are mostly transferred to the liquid-air interface at the rear of the sliding drop, retaining primary ions within the drop. (4) Deposited cationic surfactant directly reduces the charge of the drop.

### MergeVQ: A Unified Framework for Visual Generation and Representation   with Disentangled Token Merging and Quantization
**Authors**: Siyuan Li, Luyuan Zhang, Zedong Wang, Juanxi Tian, Cheng Tan, Zicheng Liu, Chang Yu, Qingsong Xie, Haonan Lu, Haoqian Wang, Zhen Lei

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T17:39:19Z

**Summary**: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with Vector Quantization (VQ) has achieved great success in both self-supervised pre-training and image generation. However, most existing methods struggle to address the trade-off in shared latent space for generation quality vs. representation learning and efficiency. To push the limits of this paradigm, we propose MergeVQ, which incorporates token merging techniques into VQ-based generative models to bridge the gap between image generation and visual representation learning in a unified architecture. During pre-training, MergeVQ decouples top-k semantics from latent space with the token merge module after self-attention blocks in the encoder for subsequent Look-up Free Quantization (LFQ) and global alignment and recovers their fine-grained details through cross-attention in the decoder for reconstruction. As for the second-stage generation, we introduce MergeAR, which performs KV Cache compression for efficient raster-order prediction. Extensive experiments on ImageNet verify that MergeVQ as an AR generative model achieves competitive performance in both visual representation learning and image generation tasks while maintaining favorable token efficiency and inference speed. The code and model will be available at https://apexgen-x.github.io/MergeVQ.

### SentenceKV: Efficient LLM Inference via Sentence-Level Semantic KV   Caching
**Authors**: Yuxuan Zhu, Ali Falahati, David H. Yang, Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T17:08:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models face significant computational and memory challenges when processing long contexts. During inference, efficient management of the key-value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate activations for autoregressive generation, is critical to reducing memory overhead and improving computational efficiency. Traditional token-level efficient KV caching methods overlook semantic information, treating tokens independently without considering their semantic relationships. Meanwhile, existing semantic-preserving KV cache management approaches often suffer from substantial memory usage and high time-to-first-token. To address these limitations, we propose SentenceKV, a novel sentence-level semantic KV caching approach designed to enhance inference efficiency while preserving semantic coherence. During prefilling, SentenceKV groups tokens based on sentence-level semantic similarity, compressing sentence representations into concise semantic vectors stored directly on the GPU, while individual KV pairs are offloaded to CPU. During decoding, SentenceKV generates tokens by selectively retrieving semantically relevant sentence-level KV entries, leveraging the semantic similarity between the prefilling-stage semantic vectors and decoding-stage queries. This ensures efficient and contextually accurate predictions, minimizing the loading of redundant or irrelevant data into GPU memory and significantly reducing memory overhead while maintaining stable inference latency, even for extremely long contexts. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including PG-19, LongBench, and Needle-In-A-Haystack demonstrate that SentenceKV significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and memory usage, without compromising model accuracy.

### Knowledge-Aware Iterative Retrieval for Multi-Agent Systems
**Authors**: Seyoung Song

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T14:21:15Z

**Summary**: We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-driven agent framework, which iteratively refines queries and filters contextual evidence by leveraging dynamically evolving knowledge. A defining feature of the system is its decoupling of external sources from an internal knowledge cache that is progressively updated to guide both query generation and evidence selection. This design mitigates bias-reinforcement loops and enables dynamic, trackable search exploration paths, thereby optimizing the trade-off between exploring diverse information and maintaining accuracy through autonomous agent decision-making. Our approach is evaluated on a broad range of open-domain question answering benchmarks, including multi-step tasks that mirror real-world scenarios where integrating information from multiple sources is critical, especially given the vulnerabilities of LLMs that lack explicit reasoning or planning capabilities. The results show that the proposed system not only outperforms single-step baselines regardless of task difficulty but also, compared to conventional iterative retrieval methods, demonstrates pronounced advantages in complex tasks through precise evidence-based reasoning and enhanced efficiency. The proposed system supports both competitive and collaborative sharing of updated context, enabling multi-agent extension. The benefits of multi-agent configurations become especially prominent as task difficulty increases. The number of convergence steps scales with task difficulty, suggesting cost-effective scalability.

### EMO: Edge Model Overlays to Scale Model Size in Federated Learning
**Authors**: Di Wu, Weibo He, Wanglei Feng, Zhenyu Wen, Bin Qian, Blesson Varghese

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T12:34:58Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) trains machine learning models on edge devices with distributed data. However, the computational and memory limitations of these devices restrict the training of large models using FL. Split Federated Learning (SFL) addresses this challenge by distributing the model across the device and server, but it introduces a tightly coupled data flow, leading to computational bottlenecks and high communication costs. We propose EMO as a solution to enable the training of large models in FL while mitigating the challenges of SFL. EMO introduces Edge Model Overlay(s) between the device and server, enabling the creation of a larger ensemble model without modifying the FL workflow. The key innovation in EMO is Augmented Federated Learning (AFL), which builds an ensemble model by connecting the original (smaller) FL model with model(s) trained in the overlay(s) to facilitate horizontal or vertical scaling. This is accomplished through three key modules: a hierarchical activation replay cache to decouple AFL from FL, a convergence-aware communication controller to optimize communication overhead, and an ensemble inference module. Evaluations on a real-world prototype show that EMO improves accuracy by up to 17.77% compared to FL, and reduces communication costs by up to 7.17x and decreases training time by up to 6.9x compared to SFL.

### Efficient LLaMA-3.2-Vision by Trimming Cross-attended Visual Features
**Authors**: Jewon Lee, Ki-Ung Song, Seungmin Yang, Donguk Lim, Jaeyeon Kim, Wooksu Shin, Bo-Kyeong Kim, Yong Jae Lee, Tae-Ho Kim

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T09:10:32Z

**Summary**: Visual token reduction lowers inference costs caused by extensive image features in large vision-language models (LVLMs). Unlike relevant studies that prune tokens in self-attention-only LVLMs, our work uniquely addresses cross-attention-based models, which achieve superior performance. We identify that the key-value (KV) cache size for image tokens in cross-attention layers significantly exceeds that of text tokens in self-attention layers, posing a major compute bottleneck. To mitigate this issue, we exploit the sparse nature in cross-attention maps to selectively prune redundant visual features. Our Trimmed Llama effectively reduces KV cache demands without requiring additional training. By benefiting from 50%-reduced visual features, our model can reduce inference latency and memory usage while achieving benchmark parity.

### High specific impulse electrospray propulsion with small capillary   emitters
**Authors**: Manel Caballero-Pérez, Marc Galobardes-Esteban, Manuel Gamero-Castaño

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T07:04:30Z

**Summary**: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using smaller capillary emitters to achieve higher specific impulse ($I_\text{sp}$) in electrospray propulsion. Four ionic liquids were characterized using capillary emitters with tip diameters from 15 to 50 $\mu$m. Smaller diameter capillaries produced smaller and more stable Taylor cones. This stabilization enabled steady cone-jet operation at significantly lower flow rates compared to larger emitters. This was unexpected because when the jet diameter is much smaller than far-field geometric features, the minimum flow rate is thought to be solely determined by the physical properties of the propellant. Using the smaller emitters and acceleration voltages of 10 kV, specific impulses up to 3000 s could be achieved with efficiencies above 50%, approximately doubling the $I_\text{sp}$ observed with larger emitters. For one of the liquids and the smallest emitters, the beam consisted solely of ions at the lowest flow rates, similarly to studies using externally wetted and porous emitters. Another important finding was that at sufficiently low flow rates, a significant fraction of the propellant fed to the emitter is not accelerated by the electrostatic field. These propellant losses make the time-of-flight technique unreliable for determining the $I_\text{sp}$.

### SQuat: Subspace-orthogonal KV Cache Quantization
**Authors**: Hao Wang, Ligong Han, Kai Xu, Akash Srivastava

**Updated**: 2025-03-31T17:37:32Z

**Summary**: The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from previously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of increased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress KV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can accumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired outputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache quantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to capture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor quantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and original keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of quantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no model fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and is grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82, improves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark scores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms.

### CITRAS: Covariate-Informed Transformer for Time Series Forecasting
**Authors**: Yosuke Yamaguchi, Issei Suemitsu, Wenpeng Wei

**Updated**: 2025-03-31T12:32:23Z

**Summary**: Covariates play an indispensable role in practical time series forecasting, offering rich context from the past and sometimes extending into the future. However, their availability varies depending on the scenario, and situations often involve multiple target variables simultaneously. Moreover, the cross-variate dependencies between them are multi-granular, with some covariates having a short-term impact on target variables and others showing long-term correlations. This heterogeneity and the intricate dependencies arising in covariate-informed forecasting present significant challenges to existing deep models. To address these issues, we propose CITRAS, a patch-based Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets and covariates covering both the past and the future forecasting horizon. While preserving the strong autoregressive capabilities of the canonical Transformer, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future known covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing transforms locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both covariate-informed and multivariate forecasting, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate dependency for improved forecasting accuracy.

### Rethinking Key-Value Cache Compression Techniques for Large Language   Model Serving
**Authors**: Wei Gao, Xinyu Zhou, Peng Sun, Tianwei Zhang, Yonggang Wen

**Updated**: 2025-03-31T12:23:31Z

**Summary**: Key-Value cache (\texttt{KV} \texttt{cache}) compression has emerged as a promising technique to optimize Large Language Model (LLM) serving. It primarily decreases the memory consumption of \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} to reduce the computation cost. Despite the development of many compression algorithms, their applications in production environments are still not prevalent. In this paper, we revisit mainstream \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression solutions from a practical perspective. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we comprehensively review existing algorithmic designs and benchmark studies for \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression and identify missing pieces in their performance measurement, which could hinder their adoption in practice. Second, we empirically evaluate representative \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression methods to uncover two key issues that affect the computational efficiency: (1) while compressing \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} can reduce memory consumption, current implementations (e.g., FlashAttention, PagedAttention) do not optimize for production-level LLM serving, resulting in suboptimal throughput performance; (2) compressing \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} may lead to longer outputs, resulting in increased end-to-end latency. We further investigate the accuracy performance of individual samples rather than the overall performance, revealing the intrinsic limitations in \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression when handling specific LLM tasks. Third, we provide tools to shed light on future \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression studies and facilitate their practical deployment in production. They are open-sourced in \href{https://github.com/LLMkvsys/rethink-kv-compression}{https://github.com/LLMkvsys/rethink-kv-compression}.

### Deep Learning Model Deployment in Multiple Cloud Providers: an   Exploratory Study Using Low Computing Power Environments
**Authors**: Elayne Lemos, Rodrigo Oliveira, Jairson Rodrigues, Rosalvo F. Oliveira Neto

**Updated**: 2025-03-31T11:58:37Z

**Summary**: The deployment of Machine Learning models at cloud have grown by tech companies. Hardware requirements are higher when these models involve Deep Learning (DL) techniques and the cloud providers' costs may be a barrier. We explore deploying DL models using for experiments the GECToR model, a DL solution for Grammatical Error Correction, across three of the major cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure). We evaluate real-time latency, hardware usage and cost at each cloud provider by 7 execution environments with 10 experiments reproduced. We found that while GPUs excel in performance, they had an average cost 300% higher than solutions without GPU. Our analysis also identifies that processor cache size is crucial for cost-effective CPU deployments, enabling over 50% of cost reduction compared to GPUs. This study demonstrates the feasibility and affordability of cloud-based DL inference solutions without GPUs, benefiting resource-constrained users like startups.

### AirCache: Activating Inter-modal Relevancy KV Cache Compression for   Efficient Large Vision-Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Kai Huang, Hao Zou, Bochen Wang, Ye Xi, Zhen Xie, Hao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-31T11:13:18Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable reasoning capabilities and proficiency in generalization. However, processing a large number of visual tokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational overhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression method aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically investigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the attention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable redundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these tokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context generation. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation window for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache, focusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced multi-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of token importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to uniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the full cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing decoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of inputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits increasing performance advantages over existing approaches.

### Mitigating Cache Noise in Test-Time Adaptation for Large Vision-Language   Models
**Authors**: Haotian Zhai, Xinyu Chen, Can Zhang, Tianming Sha, Ruirui Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-31T10:28:04Z

**Summary**: Test-time adaptation (TTA) of visual language models has recently attracted significant attention as a solution to the performance degradation caused by distribution shifts in downstream tasks. However, existing cache-based TTA methods have certain limitations. They mainly rely on the accuracy of cached feature labels, and the presence of noisy pseudo-labels can cause these features to deviate from their true distribution. This makes cache retrieval methods based on similarity matching highly sensitive to outliers or extreme samples. Moreover, current methods lack effective mechanisms to model class distributions, which limits their ability to fully exploit the potential of cached information. To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive and reliable caching mechanism and propose a novel zero-shot TTA method called "Cache, Residual, Gaussian" (CRG). This method not only employs learnable residual parameters to better align positive and negative visual prototypes with text prototypes, thereby optimizing the quality of cached features, but also incorporates Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA) to dynamically model intra-class feature distributions, further mitigating the impact of noisy features. Experimental results on 13 benchmarks demonstrate that CRG outperforms state-of-the-art TTA methods, showcasing exceptional robustness and adaptability.

**Authors**: Yufei Wang, Lanqing Guo, Zhihao Li, Jiaxing Huang, Pichao Wang, Bihan Wen, Jian Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-31T09:46:56Z

**Summary**: Text-guided image editing is an essential task that enables users to modify images through natural language descriptions. Recent advances in diffusion models and rectified flows have significantly improved editing quality, primarily relying on inversion techniques to extract structured noise from input images. However, inaccuracies in inversion can propagate errors, leading to unintended modifications and compromising fidelity. Moreover, even with perfect inversion, the entanglement between textual prompts and image features often results in global changes when only local edits are intended. To address these challenges, we propose a novel text-guided image editing framework based on VAR (Visual AutoRegressive modeling), which eliminates the need for explicit inversion while ensuring precise and controlled modifications. Our method introduces a caching mechanism that stores token indices and probability distributions from the original image, capturing the relationship between the source prompt and the image. Using this cache, we design an adaptive fine-grained masking strategy that dynamically identifies and constrains modifications to relevant regions, preventing unintended changes. A token reassembling approach further refines the editing process, enhancing diversity, fidelity, and control. Our framework operates in a training-free manner and achieves high-fidelity editing with faster inference speeds, processing a 1K resolution image in as fast as 1.2 seconds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, existing diffusion- and rectified flow-based approaches in both quantitative metrics and visual quality. The code will be released.

### Training-Free Exponential Context Extension via Cascading KV Cache
**Authors**: Jeffrey Willette, Heejun Lee, Youngwan Lee, Myeongjae Jeon, Sung Ju Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-03-31T03:28:44Z

**Summary**: The transformer's context window is vital for tasks such as few-shot learning and conditional generation as it preserves previous tokens for active memory. However, as the context lengths increase, the computational costs grow quadratically, hindering the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world, long sequence scenarios. Although some recent key-value caching (KV Cache) methods offer linear inference complexity, they naively manage the stored context, prematurely evicting tokens and losing valuable information. Moreover, they lack an optimized prefill/prompt stage strategy, resulting in higher latency than even quadratic attention for realistic context sizes. In response, we introduce a novel mechanism that leverages cascading sub-cache buffers to selectively retain the most relevant tokens, enabling the model to maintain longer context histories without increasing the cache size. Our approach outperforms linear caching baselines across key benchmarks, including streaming perplexity, question answering, book summarization, and passkey retrieval, where it retains better retrieval accuracy at 1M tokens after four doublings of the cache size of 65K. Additionally, our method reduces prefill stage latency by a factor of 6.8 when compared to flash attention on 1M tokens. These innovations not only enhance the computational efficiency of LLMs but also pave the way for their effective deployment in resource-constrained environments, enabling large-scale, real-time applications with significantly reduced latency.

### Skip-Vision: Efficient and Scalable Acceleration of Vision-Language   Models via Adaptive Token Skipping
**Authors**: Weili Zeng, Ziyuan Huang, Kaixiang Ji, Yichao Yan

**Updated**: 2025-03-31T02:19:29Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based models have driven significant advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet their computational costs surge drastically when scaling resolution, training data, and model parameters. A key bottleneck stems from the proliferation of visual tokens required for fine-grained image understanding. We propose Skip-Vision, a unified framework addressing both training and inference inefficiencies in vision-language models. On top of conventional token compression approaches, our method introduces two complementary acceleration strategies. For training acceleration, we observe that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) computations on visual tokens induce marginal feature updates. This motivates our Skip-FFN strategy, which bypasses FFN layers for redundant visual tokens. For inference acceleration, we design a selective KV-cache removal mechanism that prunes the skipped key-value pairs during decoding while preserving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Skip-Vision reduces training time by up to 35\%, inference FLOPs by 75\%, and latency by 45\%, while achieving comparable or superior performance to existing methods. Our work provides a practical solution for scaling high-performance MLLMs with enhanced efficiency.

### EEdit: Rethinking the Spatial and Temporal Redundancy for Efficient   Image Editing
**Authors**: Zexuan Yan, Yue Ma, Chang Zou, Wenteng Chen, Qifeng Chen, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-30T11:14:17Z

**Summary**: Inversion-based image editing is rapidly gaining momentum while suffering from significant computation overhead, hindering its application in real-time interactive scenarios. In this paper, we rethink that the redundancy in inversion-based image editing exists in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, such as the unnecessary computation in unedited regions and the redundancy in the inversion progress. To tackle these challenges, we propose a practical framework, named EEdit, to achieve efficient image editing. Specifically, we introduce three techniques to solve them one by one. For spatial redundancy, spatial locality caching is introduced to compute the edited region and its neighboring regions while skipping the unedited regions, and token indexing preprocessing is designed to further accelerate the caching. For temporal redundancy, inversion step skipping is proposed to reuse the latent for efficient editing. Our experiments demonstrate an average of 2.46 $\times$ acceleration without performance drop in a wide range of editing tasks including prompt-guided image editing, dragging and image composition.

### FB$^+$-tree: A Memory-Optimized B$^+$-tree with Latch-Free Update
**Authors**: Yuan Chen, Ao Li, Wenhai Li, Lingfeng Deng

**Updated**: 2025-03-30T11:09:06Z

**Summary**: B$^+$-trees are prevalent in traditional database systems due to their versatility and balanced structure. While binary search is typically utilized for branch operations, it may lead to inefficient cache utilization in main-memory scenarios. In contrast, trie-based index structures drive branch operations through prefix matching. While these structures generally produce fewer cache misses and are thus increasingly popular, they may underperform in range scans because of frequent pointer chasing. This paper proposes a new high-performance B$^+$-tree variant called \textbf{Feature B$^+$-tree (FB$^+$-tree)}. Similar to employing bit or byte for branch operation in tries, FB$^+$-tree progressively considers several bytes following the common prefix on each level of its inner nodes\textemdash referred to as features, which allows FB$^+$-tree to benefit from prefix skewness. FB$^+$-tree blurs the lines between B$^+$-trees and tries, while still retaining balance. In the best case, FB$^+$-tree almost becomes a trie, whereas in the worst case, it continues to function as a B$^+$-tree. Meanwhile, a crafted synchronization protocol that combines the link technique and optimistic lock is designed to support efficient concurrent index access. Distinctively, FB$^+$-tree leverages subtle atomic operations seamlessly coordinated with optimistic lock to facilitate latch-free updates, which can be easily extended to other structures. Intensive experiments on multiple workload-dataset combinations demonstrate that FB$^+$-tree shows comparable lookup performance to state-of-the-art trie-based indexes and outperforms popular B$^+$-trees by 2.3x$\ \sim\ $3.7x under 96 threads. FB$^+$-tree also exhibits significant potential on other workloads, especially update workloads under contention and scan workloads.

### COSMIC: Clique-Oriented Semantic Multi-space Integration for Robust CLIP   Test-Time Adaptation
**Authors**: Fanding Huang, Jingyan Jiang, Qinting Jiang, Hebei Li, Faisal Nadeem Khan, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-30T10:34:45Z

**Summary**: Recent vision-language models (VLMs) face significant challenges in test-time adaptation to novel domains. While cache-based methods show promise by leveraging historical information, they struggle with both caching unreliable feature-label pairs and indiscriminately using single-class information during querying, significantly compromising adaptation accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose COSMIC (Clique-Oriented Semantic Multi-space Integration for CLIP), a robust test-time adaptation framework that enhances adaptability through multi-granular, cross-modal semantic caching and graph-based querying mechanisms. Our framework introduces two key innovations: Dual Semantics Graph (DSG) and Clique Guided Hyper-class (CGH). The Dual Semantics Graph constructs complementary semantic spaces by incorporating textual features, coarse-grained CLIP features, and fine-grained DINOv2 features to capture rich semantic relationships. Building upon these dual graphs, the Clique Guided Hyper-class component leverages structured class relationships to enhance prediction robustness through correlated class selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate COSMIC's superior performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods: 15.81% gain on out-of-distribution tasks and 5.33% on cross-domain generation with CLIP RN-50. Code is available at github.com/hf618/COSMIC.

### A Unified Framework for Quantitative Cache Analysis
**Authors**: Sophie Kahlen, Jan Reineke

**Updated**: 2025-03-30T09:46:34Z

**Summary**: In this work we unify two existing lines of work towards cache analysis for non-LRU policies. To this end, we extend the notion of competitiveness to block competitiveness and systematically analyze the competitiveness and block competitiveness of FIFO and MRU relative to LRU for arbitrary associativities. We show how competitiveness and block competitiveness can be exploited in state-of-the-art WCET analysis based on the results of existing persistence analyses for LRU. Unlike prior work, our approach is applicable to microarchitectures that exhibit timing anomalies. We experimentally evaluate the precision and cost of our approach on benchmarks from TACLeBench. The experiments demonstrate that quantitative cache analysis for FIFO and MRU comes close to the precision of LRU.

### MVREC: A General Few-shot Defect Classification Model Using Multi-View   Region-Context
**Authors**: Shuai Lyu, Rongchen Zhang, Zeqi Ma, Fangjian Liao, Dongmei Mo, Waikeung Wong

**Updated**: 2025-03-30T09:19:53Z

**Summary**: Few-shot defect multi-classification (FSDMC) is an emerging trend in quality control within industrial manufacturing. However, current FSDMC research often lacks generalizability due to its focus on specific datasets. Additionally, defect classification heavily relies on contextual information within images, and existing methods fall short of effectively extracting this information. To address these challenges, we propose a general FSDMC framework called MVREC, which offers two primary advantages: (1) MVREC extracts general features for defect instances by incorporating the pre-trained AlphaCLIP model. (2) It utilizes a region-context framework to enhance defect features by leveraging mask region input and multi-view context augmentation. Furthermore, Few-shot Zip-Adapter(-F) classifiers within the model are introduced to cache the visual features of the support set and perform few-shot classification. We also introduce MVTec-FS, a new FSDMC benchmark based on MVTec AD, which includes 1228 defect images with instance-level mask annotations and 46 defect types. Extensive experiments conducted on MVTec-FS and four additional datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in general defect classification and its ability to incorporate contextual information to improve classification performance.

### FastVAR: Linear Visual Autoregressive Modeling via Cached Token Pruning
**Authors**: Hang Guo, Yawei Li, Taolin Zhang, Jiangshan Wang, Tao Dai, Shu-Tao Xia, Luca Benini

**Updated**: 2025-03-30T08:51:19Z

**Summary**: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling has gained popularity for its shift towards next-scale prediction. However, existing VAR paradigms process the entire token map at each scale step, leading to the complexity and runtime scaling dramatically with image resolution. To address this challenge, we propose FastVAR, a post-training acceleration method for efficient resolution scaling with VARs. Our key finding is that the majority of latency arises from the large-scale step where most tokens have already converged. Leveraging this observation, we develop the cached token pruning strategy that only forwards pivotal tokens for scale-specific modeling while using cached tokens from previous scale steps to restore the pruned slots. This significantly reduces the number of forwarded tokens and improves the efficiency at larger resolutions. Experiments show the proposed FastVAR can further speedup FlashAttention-accelerated VAR by 2.7$\times$ with negligible performance drop of <1%. We further extend FastVAR to zero-shot generation of higher resolution images. In particular, FastVAR can generate one 2K image with 15GB memory footprints in 1.5s on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code is available at https://github.com/csguoh/FastVAR.

### PQCache: Product Quantization-based KVCache for Long Context LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Hailin Zhang, Xiaodong Ji, Yilin Chen, Fangcheng Fu, Xupeng Miao, Xiaonan Nie, Weipeng Chen, Bin Cui

**Updated**: 2025-03-30T08:13:50Z

**Summary**: As the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to evolve, the context length in inference is steadily growing. Key-Value Cache (KVCache), the intermediate representations of tokens within LLM inference, has now become the primary memory bottleneck due to limited GPU memory. Current methods selectively determine suitable keys and values for self-attention computation in LLMs to address the issue. However, they either fall short in maintaining model quality or result in high serving latency. Drawing inspiration from advanced embedding retrieval techniques prevalent in the data management community, we consider the storage and retrieval of KVCache as a typical embedding retrieval problem. We propose PQCache, which employs Product Quantization (PQ) to manage KVCache, maintaining model quality while ensuring low serving latency. During the prefilling phase, we apply PQ to tokens' keys for each LLM layer and head. During the autoregressive decoding phase, we use PQ codes and centroids to approximately identify important preceding tokens, then fetch the corresponding key-value pairs for self-attention computation. Through meticulous design of overlapping and caching, we minimize any additional computation and communication overhead during both phases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQCache achieves both effectiveness and efficiency, with 4.60% score improvement over existing methods on InfiniteBench and low system latency in both prefilling and decoding.

### Cocktail: Chunk-Adaptive Mixed-Precision Quantization for Long-Context   LLM Inference
**Authors**: Wei Tao, Bin Zhang, Xiaoyang Qu, Jiguang Wan, Jianzong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-30T03:20:34Z

**Summary**: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been able to handle longer and longer contexts. However, a context that is too long may cause intolerant inference latency and GPU memory usage. Existing methods propose mixed-precision quantization to the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs based on token granularity, which is time-consuming in the search process and hardware inefficient during computation. This paper introduces a novel approach called Cocktail, which employs chunk-adaptive mixed-precision quantization to optimize the KV cache. Cocktail consists of two modules: chunk-level quantization search and chunk-level KV cache computation. Chunk-level quantization search determines the optimal bitwidth configuration of the KV cache chunks quickly based on the similarity scores between the corresponding context chunks and the query, maintaining the model accuracy. Furthermore, chunk-level KV cache computation reorders the KV cache chunks before quantization, avoiding the hardware inefficiency caused by mixed-precision quantization in inference computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Cocktail outperforms state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods on various models and datasets.

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating text, images, and video content. However, as context length grows, the computational cost of attention increases quadratically with the number of tokens, presenting significant efficiency challenges. This paper presents an analysis of various Key-Value (KV) cache compression strategies, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes these methods by their underlying principles and implementation techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate their impact on performance and inference latency, providing critical insights into their effectiveness. Our findings highlight the trade-offs involved in KV cache compression and its influence on handling long-context scenarios, paving the way for more efficient LLM implementations.

### TopV: Compatible Token Pruning with Inference Time Optimization for Fast   and Low-Memory Multimodal Vision Language Model
**Authors**: Cheng Yang, Yang Sui, Jinqi Xiao, Lingyi Huang, Yu Gong, Chendi Li, Jinghua Yan, Yu Bai, Ponnuswamy Sadayappan, Xia Hu, Bo Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-03-29T23:00:27Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demand substantial computational resources during inference, largely due to the extensive visual input tokens for representing visual information. Previous studies have noted that visual tokens tend to receive less attention than text tokens, suggesting their lower importance during inference and potential for pruning. However, their methods encounter several challenges: reliance on greedy heuristic criteria for token importance and incompatibility with FlashAttention and KV cache. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{TopV}, a compatible \textbf{TO}ken \textbf{P}runing with inference Time Optimization for fast and low-memory \textbf{V}LM, achieving efficient pruning without additional training or fine-tuning. Instead of relying on attention scores, we formulate token pruning as an optimization problem, accurately identifying important visual tokens while remaining compatible with FlashAttention. Additionally, since we only perform this pruning once during the prefilling stage, it effectively reduces KV cache size. Our optimization framework incorporates a visual-aware cost function considering factors such as Feature Similarity, Relative Spatial Distance, and Absolute Central Distance, to measure the importance of each source visual token, enabling effective pruning of low-importance tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous token pruning methods, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

### X-EcoMLA: Upcycling Pre-Trained Attention into MLA for Efficient and   Extreme KV Compression
**Authors**: Guihong Li, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Mingyu Yang, Vikram Appia, Emad Barsoum

**Updated**: 2025-03-29T04:43:11Z

**Summary**: Multi-head latent attention (MLA) is designed to optimize KV cache memory through low-rank key-value joint compression. Rather than caching keys and values separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing memory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory efficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation lies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be trained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits fully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different attention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post training distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention into an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training adaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that leveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training accuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising model performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively compress the KV cache while preserving the performance on the benchmarks; specifically, for Llama3.2-1B-Instruct baseline, a 6.4x compression achieves the same average score by using only 3.6B training tokens and 70 GPU hours on AMD MI300, whereas a 10.6x compression have less than 0.1\% average score drop with 7B training tokens and 140 GPU hours.

### SR-LIO++: Efficient LiDAR-Inertial Odometry and Quantized Mapping with   Sweep Reconstruction
**Authors**: Zikang Yuan, Ruiye Ming, Chengwei Zhao, Yonghao Tan, Pingcheng Dong, Hongcheng Luo, Yuzhong Jiao, Xin Yang, Kwang-Ting Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-03-29T01:06:54Z

**Summary**: Addressing the inherent low acquisition frequency limitation of 3D LiDAR to achieve high-frequency output has become a critical research focus in the LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) domain. To ensure real-time performance, frequency-enhanced LIO systems must process each sweep within significantly reduced timeframe, which presents substantial challenges for deployment on low-computational-power platforms. To address these limitations, we introduce SR-LIO++, an innovative LIO system capable of achieving doubled output frequency relative to input frequency on resource-constrained hardware platforms, including the Raspberry Pi 4B. Our system employs a sweep reconstruction methodology to enhance LiDAR sweep frequency, generating high-frequency reconstructed sweeps. Building upon this foundation, we propose a caching mechanism for intermediate results (i.e., surface parameters) of the most recent segments, effectively minimizing redundant processing of common segments in adjacent reconstructed sweeps. This method decouples processing time from the traditionally linear dependence on reconstructed sweep frequency. Furthermore, we present a quantized map point management based on index table mapping, significantly reducing memory usage by converting global 3D point storage from 64-bit double precision to 8-bit char representation. This method also converts the computationally intensive Euclidean distance calculations in nearest neighbor searches from 64-bit double precision to 16-bit short and 32-bit integer formats, significantly reducing both memory and computational cost. Extensive experimental evaluations across three distinct computing platforms and four public datasets demonstrate that SR-LIO++ maintains state-of-the-art accuracy while substantially enhancing efficiency. Notably, our system successfully achieves 20Hz state output on Raspberry Pi 4B hardware.

**Summary**: This study explores the use of automatic BLAS offloading and INT8-based emulation for accelerating traditional HPC workloads on modern GPU architectures. Through the use of low-bitwidth integer units and cache-coherent Unified Memory Architecture, we emulate double-precision matrix multiplications in the MuST application without code changes. We find that accuracy depends on both arithmetic precision and the properties of the operator, which can be dealt with through tunable precision emulation. Unlike traditional mixed-precision approaches, this method preserves original algorithms while optimizing hardware utilization. We showcases the potential of improving accuracy and performance at the same time. This work highlights the potential of AI-driven hardware to transform HPC, advocating for adaptive precision strategies in future scientific computing.

**Updated**: 2025-03-28T18:00:12Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image generation models, especially Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT), have shown remarkable progress in generating high-quality images. However, these models often face significant computational bottlenecks, particularly in attention mechanisms, which hinder their scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce DiTFastAttnV2, a post-training compression method designed to accelerate attention in MMDiT. Through an in-depth analysis of MMDiT's attention patterns, we identify key differences from prior DiT-based methods and propose head-wise arrow attention and caching mechanisms to dynamically adjust attention heads, effectively bridging this gap. We also design an Efficient Fused Kernel for further acceleration. By leveraging local metric methods and optimization techniques, our approach significantly reduces the search time for optimal compression schemes to just minutes while maintaining generation quality. Furthermore, with the customized kernel, DiTFastAttnV2 achieves a 68% reduction in attention FLOPs and 1.5x end-to-end speedup on 2K image generation without compromising visual fidelity.

### Towards Stabilized and Efficient Diffusion Transformers through   Long-Skip-Connections with Spectral Constraints
**Authors**: Guanjie Chen, Xinyu Zhao, Yucheng Zhou, Xiaoye Qu, Tianlong Chen, Yu Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-03-28T16:15:19Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a powerful architecture for image and video generation, offering superior quality and scalability. However, their practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability, leading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms as the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity. To this end, we propose Skip-DiT, a novel DiT variant enhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in U-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how LSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized dynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep features across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks demonstrate that Skip-DiT achieves: (1) 4.4 times training acceleration and faster convergence, (2) 1.5-2 times inference acceleration without quality loss and high fidelity to original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods across various quantitative metrics. Our findings establish long-skip connections as critical architectural components for training stable and efficient diffusion transformers.

### DyCoke: Dynamic Compression of Tokens for Fast Video Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Keda Tao, Can Qin, Haoxuan You, Yang Sui, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-28T14:11:37Z

**Summary**: Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.

### A Refined Analysis of Massive Activations in LLMs
**Authors**: Louis Owen, Nilabhra Roy Chowdhury, Abhay Kumar, Fabian Güra

**Updated**: 2025-03-28T11:08:34Z

**Summary**: Motivated in part by their relevance for low-precision training and quantization, massive activations in large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a topic of interest. However, existing analyses are limited in scope, and generalizability across architectures is unclear. This paper helps address some of these gaps by conducting an analysis of massive activations across a broad range of LLMs, including both GLU-based and non-GLU-based architectures. Our findings challenge several prior assumptions, most importantly: (1) not all massive activations are detrimental, i.e. suppressing them does not lead to an explosion of perplexity or a collapse in downstream task performance; (2) proposed mitigation strategies such as Attention KV bias are model-specific and ineffective in certain cases. We consequently investigate novel hybrid mitigation strategies; in particular pairing Target Variance Rescaling (TVR) with Attention KV bias or Dynamic Tanh (DyT) successfully balances the mitigation of massive activations with preserved downstream model performance in the scenarios we investigated. Our code is available at: https://github.com/bluorion-com/refine_massive_activations.

**Authors**: Jiyu Chen, Shuang Peng, Daxiong Luo, Fan Yang, Renshou Wu, Fangyuan Li, Xiaoxin Chen

**Updated**: 2025-03-28T07:26:37Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) encounter challenges in processing long sequences on edge devices due to the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms and growing memory demands from Key-Value (KV) cache. Existing KV cache optimizations struggle with irreversible token eviction in long-output tasks, while alternative sequence modeling architectures prove costly to adopt within established Transformer infrastructure. We present EdgeInfinite, a memory-efficient solution for infinite contexts that integrates compressed memory into Transformer-based LLMs through a trainable memory-gating module. This approach maintains full compatibility with standard Transformer architectures, requiring fine-tuning only a small part of parameters, and enables selective activation of the memory-gating module for long and short context task routing. The experimental result shows that EdgeInfinite achieves comparable performance to baseline Transformer-based LLM on long context benchmarks while optimizing memory consumption and time to first token.

**Summary**: The growing prevalence of data-intensive workloads, such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), high-performance computing (HPC), in-memory databases, and real-time analytics, has exposed limitations in conventional memory technologies like DRAM. While DRAM offers low latency and high throughput, it is constrained by high costs, scalability challenges, and volatility, making it less viable for capacity-bound and persistent applications in modern datacenters.   Recently, Compute Express Link (CXL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling high-speed, cacheline-granular communication between CPUs and external devices. By leveraging CXL technology, NAND flash can now be used as memory expansion, offering three-fold benefits: byte-addressability, scalable capacity, and persistence at a low cost. Samsung's CXL Memory Module Hybrid (CMM-H) is the first product to deliver these benefits through a hardware-only solution, i.e., it does not incur any OS and IO overheads like conventional block devices. In particular, CMM-H integrates a DRAM cache with NAND flash in a single device to deliver near-DRAM latency. This paper presents the first publicly available study for comprehensive characterizations of an FPGA-based CMM-H prototype. Through this study, we address users' concerns about whether a wide variety of applications can successfully run on a memory device backed by NAND flash medium. Additionally, based on these characterizations, we provide key insights into how to best take advantage of the CMM-H device.

### Reimagining Memory Access for LLM Inference: Compression-Aware Memory   Controller Design
**Authors**: Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Linsen Ma, Yunhua Fang, Zirak Burzin Engineer, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-27T17:48:14Z

**Summary**: The efficiency of Large Language Model~(LLM) inference is often constrained by substantial memory bandwidth and capacity demands. Existing techniques, such as pruning, quantization, and mixture of experts/depth, reduce memory capacity and/or bandwidth consumption at the cost of slight degradation in inference quality. This paper introduces a design solution that further alleviates memory bottlenecks by enhancing the on-chip memory controller in AI accelerators to achieve two main objectives: (1) significantly reducing memory capacity and bandwidth usage through lossless block compression~(e.g., LZ4 and ZSTD) of model weights and key-value (KV) cache without compromising inference quality, and (2) enabling memory bandwidth and energy consumption to scale proportionally with context-dependent dynamic quantization. These goals are accomplished by equipping the on-chip memory controller with mechanisms to improve fine-grained bit-level accessibility and compressibility of weights and KV cache through LLM-aware configuration of in-memory placement and representation. Experimental results on publicly available LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing memory footprint reductions of 25.2\% for model weights and 46.9\% for KV cache. In addition, our hardware prototype at 4\,GHz and 32 lanes (7\,nm) achieves 8\,TB/s throughput with a modest area overhead (under 3.8\,mm\(^2\)), which underscores the viability of LLM-aware memory control as a key to efficient large-scale inference.

**Summary**: We present the design and characterization of a low-noise environment for measuring the electron's electric dipole moment (EDM) with a beam of molecules. To minimize magnetic Johnson noise from metals, the design features ceramic electric field plates housed in a glass vacuum chamber. To suppress external magnetic noise the apparatus is enclosed within a cylindrical four-layer mu-metal shield with a shielding factor exceeding $10^6$ in one radial direction and $10^5$ in the other. Finite element modelling shows that the difference between these shielding factors is due to imperfect joints between sections of mu-metal. Using atomic magnetometers to monitor the magnetic field inside the shield, we measure noise below 40 fT/$\sqrt{{\rm Hz}}$ at 1 Hz and above, rising to 500 fT/$\sqrt{{\rm Hz}}$ at 0.1 Hz. Analytical and numerical studies show that residual magnetic Johnson noise contributes approximately 13 fT/$\sqrt{{\rm Hz}}$. The background magnetic field averaged along the beamline is maintained below 3 pT, with typical gradients of a few nT/m. An electric field of 20 kV/cm is applied without discharges and with leakage currents below 1 nA. Each magnetometer measures the magnetic field correlated with the direction of the applied electric field with a precision of 0.11 fT in 104 hours of data. These results demonstrate that the apparatus is suitable for measuring the electron EDM with precision at the $10^{-31}$ e cm level. The design principles and characterization techniques presented here are broadly applicable to precision measurements probing fundamental symmetries in molecules, atoms, and neutrons.

### Spineless Traversal for Layout Invalidation
**Authors**: Marisa Kirisame, Tiezhi Wang, Pavel Panchekha

**Updated**: 2025-03-27T15:21:19Z

**Summary**: Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

### WindowKV: Task-Adaptive Group-Wise KV Cache Window Selection for   Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Youhui Zuo, Sibo Wei, Chen Zhang, Zhuorui Liu, Wenpeng Lu, Dawei Song

**Updated**: 2025-03-27T14:11:37Z

**Summary**: With the advancements in long-context inference capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the KV cache has become one of the foundational components. However, its substantial GPU memory consumption makes KV cache compression a key technique for enabling efficient LLM inference in industrial scenarios. While recent studies have focused on optimizing the memory occupied by the KV cache, they overlook two critical factors: preserving semantic coherence and considering task-specific characteristic during compression. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task-adaptive KV cache window selection method, WindowKV. WindowKV dynamically selects local semantic windows consisting of consecutive tokens, according to task-specific characteristics, ensuring the retained KV cache captures continuous, essential context. Additionally, we introduce an intra-group layer KV cache indices sharing strategy to reduce computational overhead, achieving a balance between performance and efficiency. We rigorously evaluate WindowKV on the LongBench benchmark, and the results demonstrate that it maintains a performance comparable to full KV cache retention while using only 12% of the original KV cache, significantly reducing memory requirements. Furthermore, our method also achieves state-of-the-art results in the Needle-in-a-Haystack evaluation, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

### Arm DynamIQ Shared Unit and Real-Time: An Empirical Evaluation
**Authors**: Ashutosh Pradhan, Daniele Ottaviano, Yi Jiang, Haozheng Huang, Alexander Zuepke, Andrea Bastoni, Marco Caccamo

**Updated**: 2025-03-27T12:14:56Z

**Summary**: The increasing complexity of embedded hardware platforms poses significant challenges for real-time workloads. Architectural features such as Intel RDT, Arm QoS, and Arm MPAM are either unavailable on commercial embedded platforms or designed primarily for server environments optimized for average-case performance and might fail to deliver the expected real-time guarantees. Arm DynamIQ Shared Unit (DSU) includes isolation features-among others, hardware per-way cache partitioning-that can improve the real-time guarantees of complex embedded multicore systems and facilitate real-time analysis. However, the DSU also targets average cases, and its real-time capabilities have not yet been evaluated. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of three real-world deployments of the Arm DSU on Rockchip RK3568, Rockchip RK3588, and NVIDIA Orin platforms. We integrate support for the DSU at the operating system and hypervisor level and conduct a large-scale evaluation using both synthetic and real-world benchmarks with varying types and intensities of interference. Our results make extensive use of performance counters and indicate that, although effective, the quality of partitioning and isolation provided by the DSU depends on the type and the intensity of the interfering workloads. In addition, we uncover and analyze in detail the correlation between benchmarks and different types and intensities of interference.

### Rethinking Video Tokenization: A Conditioned Diffusion-based Approach
**Authors**: Nianzu Yang, Pandeng Li, Liming Zhao, Yang Li, Chen-Wei Xie, Yehui Tang, Xudong Lu, Zhihang Liu, Yun Zheng, Yu Liu, Junchi Yan

**Updated**: 2025-03-27T11:46:22Z

**Summary**: Existing video tokenizers typically use the traditional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture for video compression and reconstruction. However, to achieve good performance, its training process often relies on complex multi-stage training tricks that go beyond basic reconstruction loss and KL regularization. Among these tricks, the most challenging is the precise tuning of adversarial training with additional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the final stage, which can hinder stable convergence. In contrast to GANs, diffusion models offer more stable training processes and can generate higher-quality results. Inspired by these advantages, we propose CDT, a novel Conditioned Diffusion-based video Tokenizer, that replaces the GAN-based decoder with a conditional causal diffusion model. The encoder compresses spatio-temporal information into compact latents, while the decoder reconstructs videos through a reverse diffusion process conditioned on these latents. During inference, we incorporate a feature cache mechanism to generate videos of arbitrary length while maintaining temporal continuity and adopt sampling acceleration technique to enhance efficiency. Trained using only a basic MSE diffusion loss for reconstruction, along with KL term and LPIPS perceptual loss from scratch, extensive experiments demonstrate that CDT achieves state-of-the-art performance in video reconstruction tasks with just a single-step sampling. Even a scaled-down version of CDT (3$\times$ inference speedup) still performs comparably with top baselines. Moreover, the latent video generation model trained with CDT also exhibits superior performance. The source code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/ali-vilab/CDT.

### FlooNoC: A 645 Gbps/link 0.15 pJ/B/hop Open-Source NoC with Wide   Physical Links and End-to-End AXI4 Parallel Multi-Stream Support
**Authors**: Tim Fischer, Michael Rogenmoser, Thomas Benz, Frank K. Gürkaynak, Luca Benini

**Updated**: 2025-03-27T09:53:15Z

**Summary**: The new generation of domain-specific AI accelerators is characterized by rapidly increasing demands for bulk data transfers, as opposed to small, latency-critical cache line transfers typical of traditional cache-coherent systems. In this paper, we address this critical need by introducing the FlooNoC Network-on-Chip (NoC), featuring very wide, fully Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI4) compliant links designed to meet the massive bandwidth needs at high energy efficiency. At the transport level, non-blocking transactions are supported for latency tolerance. Additionally, a novel end-to-end ordering approach for AXI4, enabled by a multi-stream capable Direct Memory Access (DMA) engine simplifies network interfaces and eliminates inter-stream dependencies. Furthermore, dedicated physical links are instantiated for short, latency-critical messages. A complete end-to-end reference implementation in 12nm FinFET technology demonstrates the physical feasibility and power performance area (PPA) benefits of our approach. Utilizing wide links on high levels of metal, we achieve a bandwidth of 645 Gbps per link and a total aggregate bandwidth of 103 Tbps for an 8x4 mesh of processors cluster tiles, with a total of 288 RISC-V cores. The NoC imposes a minimal area overhead of only 3.5% per compute tile and achieves a leading-edge energy efficiency of 0.15 pJ/B/hop at 0.8 V. Compared to state-of-the-art NoCs, our system offers three times the energy efficiency and more than double the link bandwidth. Furthermore, compared to a traditional AXI4-based multi-layer interconnect, our NoC achieves a 30% reduction in area, corresponding to a 47% increase in GFLOPSDP within the same floorplan.

### Time and Memory Trade-off of KV-Cache Compression in Tensor Transformer   Decoding
**Authors**: Yifang Chen, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Yu Tian

**Updated**: 2025-03-27T07:02:19Z

**Summary**: The key-value (KV) cache in the tensor version of transformers presents a significant bottleneck during inference. While previous work analyzes the fundamental space complexity barriers in standard attention mechanisms [Haris and Onak, 2025], our work generalizes the space complexity barriers result to tensor attention version. Our theoretical contributions rely on a reduction from communication complexity and deduce the memory lower bound for tensor-structured attention mechanisms when $d = \Omega(\log n)$. Furthermore, we introduce two types of tensor attention cache and present a trade-off between time and memory for two scenarios. Overall, our work provides a theoretical foundation for us to understand the time-memory tradeoff of KV-Cache compression in tensor attention decoding and offers more perspectives in developing more memory-efficient tensor attention Transformer architectures.

**Authors**: Zeqiang Lai, Yunfei Zhao, Zibo Zhao, Haolin Liu, Fuyun Wang, Huiwen Shi, Xianghui Yang, Qingxiang Lin, Jingwei Huang, Yuhong Liu, Jie Jiang, Chunchao Guo, Xiangyu Yue

**Updated**: 2025-03-26T15:08:12Z

**Summary**: 3D shape generation has greatly flourished through the development of so-called "native" 3D diffusion, particularly through the Vecset Diffusion Model (VDM). While recent advancements have shown promising results in generating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles with high-speed generation. Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating diffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in previous works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic framework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables flexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable quality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with our newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a lightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical Volume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of the vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder drastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply FlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic evaluation, we show that our model significantly outperforms existing fast 3D generation methods, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art while reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for generation. Code and models are available at https://github.com/Tencent/FlashVDM.

### SGDRC: Software-Defined Dynamic Resource Control for Concurrent DNN   Inference on NVIDIA GPUs
**Authors**: Yongkang Zhang, Haoxuan Yu, Chenxia Han, Cheng Wang, Baotong Lu, Yunzhe Li, Zhifeng Jiang, Yang Li, Xiaowen Chu, Huaicheng Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-26T13:59:53Z

**Summary**: Cloud service providers heavily colocate high-priority, latency-sensitive (LS), and low-priority, best-effort (BE) DNN inference services on the same GPU to improve resource utilization in data centers. Among the critical shared GPU resources, there has been very limited analysis on the dynamic allocation of compute units and VRAM bandwidth, mainly for two reasons: (1) The native GPU resource management solutions are either hardware-specific, or unable to dynamically allocate resources to different tenants, or both; (2) NVIDIA doesn't expose interfaces for VRAM bandwidth allocation, and the software stack and VRAM channel architectures are black-box, both of which limit the software-level resource management. These drive prior work to design either conservative sharing policies detrimental to throughput, or static resource partitioning only applicable to a few GPU models.   To bridge this gap, this paper proposes SGDRC, a fully software-defined dynamic VRAM bandwidth and compute unit management solution for concurrent DNN inference services. SGDRC aims at guaranteeing service quality, maximizing the overall throughput, and providing general applicability to NVIDIA GPUs. SGDRC first reveals a general VRAM channel hash mapping architecture of NVIDIA GPUs through comprehensive reverse engineering and eliminates VRAM channel conflicts using software-level cache coloring. SGDRC applies bimodal tensors and tidal SM masking to dynamically allocate VRAM bandwidth and compute units, and guides the allocation of resources based on offline profiling. We evaluate 11 mainstream DNNs with real-world workloads on two NVIDIA GPUs. The results show that compared with the state-of-the-art GPU sharing solutions, SGDRC achieves the highest SLO attainment rates (99.0% on average), and improves overall throughput by up to 1.47x and BE job throughput by up to 2.36x.

### Analyzing Modern NVIDIA GPU cores
**Authors**: Rodrigo Huerta, Mojtaba Abaie Shoushtary, José-Lorenzo Cruz, Antonio González

**Updated**: 2025-03-26T12:10:53Z

**Summary**: GPUs are the most popular platform for accelerating HPC workloads, such as artificial intelligence and science simulations. However, most microarchitectural research in academia relies on GPU core pipeline designs based on architectures that are more than 15 years old.   This paper reverse engineers modern NVIDIA GPU cores, unveiling many key aspects of its design and explaining how GPUs leverage hardware-compiler techniques where the compiler guides hardware during execution. In particular, it reveals how the issue logic works including the policy of the issue scheduler, the structure of the register file and its associated cache, and multiple features of the memory pipeline. Moreover, it analyses how a simple instruction prefetcher based on a stream buffer fits well with modern NVIDIA GPUs and is likely to be used. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the register file cache and the number of register file read ports on both simulation accuracy and performance.   By modeling all these new discovered microarchitectural details, we achieve 18.24% lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in execution cycles than previous state-of-the-art simulators, resulting in an average of 13.98% MAPE with respect to real hardware (NVIDIA RTX A6000). Also, we demonstrate that this new model stands for other NVIDIA architectures, such as Turing. Finally, we show that the software-based dependence management mechanism included in modern NVIDIA GPUs outperforms a hardware mechanism based on scoreboards in terms of performance and area.

### Point-Cache: Test-time Dynamic and Hierarchical Cache for Robust and   Generalizable Point Cloud Analysis
**Authors**: Hongyu Sun, Qiuhong Ke, Ming Cheng, Yongcai Wang, Deying Li, Chenhui Gou, Jianfei Cai

**Updated**: 2025-03-26T11:08:20Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a general solution to enable point cloud recognition models to handle distribution shifts at test time. Unlike prior methods, which rely heavily on training data (often inaccessible during online inference) and are limited to recognizing a fixed set of point cloud classes predefined during training, we explore a more practical and challenging scenario: adapting the model solely based on online test data to recognize both previously seen classes and novel, unseen classes at test time. To this end, we develop \textbf{Point-Cache}, a hierarchical cache model that captures essential clues of online test samples, particularly focusing on the global structure of point clouds and their local-part details. Point-Cache, which serves as a rich 3D knowledge base, is dynamically managed to prioritize the inclusion of high-quality samples. Designed as a plug-and-play module, our method can be flexibly integrated into large multimodal 3D models to support open-vocabulary point cloud recognition. Notably, our solution operates with efficiency comparable to zero-shot inference, as it is entirely training-free. Point-Cache demonstrates substantial gains across 8 challenging benchmarks and 4 representative large 3D models, highlighting its effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/auniquesun/Point-Cache.

### Devil is in the Uniformity: Exploring Diverse Learners within   Transformer for Image Restoration
**Authors**: Shihao Zhou, Dayu Li, Jinshan Pan, Juncheng Zhou, Jinglei Shi, Jufeng Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-26T02:58:41Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based approaches have gained significant attention in image restoration, where the core component, i.e, Multi-Head Attention (MHA), plays a crucial role in capturing diverse features and recovering high-quality results. In MHA, heads perform attention calculation independently from uniform split subspaces, and a redundancy issue is triggered to hinder the model from achieving satisfactory outputs. In this paper, we propose to improve MHA by exploring diverse learners and introducing various interactions between heads, which results in a Hierarchical multI-head atteNtion driven Transformer model, termed HINT, for image restoration. HINT contains two modules, i.e., the Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention (HMHA) and the Query-Key Cache Updating (QKCU) module, to address the redundancy problem that is rooted in vanilla MHA. Specifically, HMHA extracts diverse contextual features by employing heads to learn from subspaces of varying sizes and containing different information. Moreover, QKCU, comprising intra- and inter-layer schemes, further reduces the redundancy problem by facilitating enhanced interactions between attention heads within and across layers. Extensive experiments are conducted on 12 benchmarks across 5 image restoration tasks, including low-light enhancement, dehazing, desnowing, denoising, and deraining, to demonstrate the superiority of HINT. The source code is available in the supplementary materials.

### Medha: Efficiently Serving Multi-Million Context Length LLM Inference   Requests Without Approximations
**Authors**: Amey Agrawal, Haoran Qiu, Junda Chen, Íñigo Goiri, Ramachandran Ramjee, Chaojie Zhang, Alexey Tumanov, Esha Choukse

**Updated**: 2025-03-26T01:58:40Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) handle increasingly longer contexts, serving inference requests for context lengths in the range of millions of tokens presents unique challenges. While existing techniques are effective for training, they fail to address the unique challenges of inference, such as varying prefill and decode phases and their associated latency constraints -- like Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time per Output Token (TPOT). Furthermore, no long-context inference solutions address head-of-line blocking today.   We present Medha, a system for efficient long-context LLM inference that introduces three key innovations: adaptive chunking with slack-aware scheduling to prevent head-ofline blocking, Sequence Pipeline Parallelism (SPP) to reduce TTFT, and KV Cache Parallelism (KVP) to minimize TPOT. By combining these into a novel 3D parallelism serving engine, Medha achieves unprecedented scale -- supporting contexts up to 10M tokens with production-grade latency. Our evaluation shows Medha reduces median latency by up to 30x compared to state-of-the-art systems when serving a mix of short and long requests, while improving throughput by upwards of 5x. This enables, for the first time, efficient long-context LLM inference at scale without compromising on shorter request latencies or system efficiency.

### Visualizing the Invisible: A Generative AR System for Intuitive   Multi-Modal Sensor Data Presentation
**Authors**: Yunqi Guo, Kaiyuan Hou, Heming Fu, Hongkai Chen, Zhenyu Yan, Guoliang Xing, Xiaofan Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T17:56:01Z

**Summary**: Understanding sensor data can be difficult for non-experts because of the complexity and different semantic meanings of sensor modalities. This leads to a need for intuitive and effective methods to present sensor information. However, creating intuitive sensor data visualizations presents three key challenges: the variability of sensor readings, gaps in domain comprehension, and the dynamic nature of sensor data. To address these issues, we propose Vivar, a novel system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D volumetric content for AR visualization. In particular, we introduce a cross-modal embedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual embedding space through barycentric interpolation. This approach accurately reflects value changes in multi-modal sensor information, ensuring that sensor variations are properly shown in visualization outcomes. Vivar also incorporates sensor-aware AR scene generation using foundation models and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) without requiring domain expertise. In addition, Vivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR content generation, demonstrating 11x latency reduction without compromising quality. A user study involving over 503 participants, including domain experts, demonstrates Vivar's effectiveness in accuracy, consistency, and real-world applicability, paving the way for more intuitive sensor data visualization.

### LogQuant: Log-Distributed 2-Bit Quantization of KV Cache with Superior   Accuracy Preservation
**Authors**: Han Chen, Zicong Jiang, Zining Zhang, Bingsheng He, Pingyi Luo, Mian Lu, Yuqiang Chen

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T16:24:45Z

**Summary**: We introduce LogQuant, a groundbreaking 2-bit quantization technique for KV Cache in large language model (LLM) inference, delivering substantial memory savings while preserving superior performance. Previous methods either assume that later tokens are more important or attempt to predict important tokens based on earlier attention patterns. Both approaches, however, can result in performance bottlenecks or frequent mispredictions.   LogQuant takes a different approach. By applying a log-based filtering mechanism, it selectively compresses the KV Cache across the entire context, achieving better performance with the same or even reduced memory footprint compared to existing methods. In benchmark tests, it enhances throughput by 25% and boosts batch size by 60% without increasing memory consumption. For challenging tasks such as Math and Code Completion, LogQuant improves accuracy by 40% to 200% at the same compression ratio, outperforming comparable techniques.LogQuant integrates effortlessly with popular inference frameworks like Python's transformers library. Implementation can be available in https://github.com/Concyclics/LogQuantKV.

**Summary**: We introduce Gemma 3, a multimodal addition to the Gemma family of lightweight open models, ranging in scale from 1 to 27 billion parameters. This version introduces vision understanding abilities, a wider coverage of languages and longer context - at least 128K tokens. We also change the architecture of the model to reduce the KV-cache memory that tends to explode with long context. This is achieved by increasing the ratio of local to global attention layers, and keeping the span on local attention short. The Gemma 3 models are trained with distillation and achieve superior performance to Gemma 2 for both pre-trained and instruction finetuned versions. In particular, our novel post-training recipe significantly improves the math, chat, instruction-following and multilingual abilities, making Gemma3-4B-IT competitive with Gemma2-27B-IT and Gemma3-27B-IT comparable to Gemini-1.5-Pro across benchmarks. We release all our models to the community.

### Integrating Prefetcher Selection with Dynamic Request Allocation   Improves Prefetching Efficiency
**Authors**: Mengming Li, Qijun Zhang, Yongqing Ren, Zhiyao Xie

**Updated**: 2025-03-25T06:45:13Z

**Summary**: Hardware prefetching plays a critical role in hiding the off-chip DRAM latency. The complexity of applications results in a wide variety of memory access patterns, prompting the development of numerous cache-prefetching algorithms. Consequently, commercial processors often employ a hybrid of these algorithms to enhance the overall prefetching performance. Nonetheless, since these prefetchers share hardware resources, conflicts arising from competing prefetching requests can negate the benefits of hardware prefetching. Under such circumstances, several prefetcher selection algorithms have been proposed to mitigate conflicts between prefetchers. However, these prior solutions suffer from two limitations. First, the input demand request allocation is inaccurate. Second, the prefetcher selection criteria are coarse-grained.   In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing an efficient and widely applicable prefetcher selection algorithm--Alecto, which tailors the demand requests for each prefetcher. Every demand request is first sent to Alecto to identify suitable prefetchers before being routed to prefetchers for training and prefetching. Our analysis shows that Alecto is adept at not only harmonizing prefetching accuracy, coverage, and timeliness but also significantly enhancing the utilization of the prefetcher table, which is vital for temporal prefetching. Alecto outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based prefetcher selection algorithm--Bandit by 2.76% in single-core, and 7.56% in eight-core. For memory-intensive benchmarks, Alecto outperforms Bandit by 5.25%. Alecto consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance in scheduling various types of cache prefetchers. In addition to the performance improvement, Alecto can reduce the energy consumption associated with accessing the prefetchers' table by 48%, while only adding less than 1 KB of storage overhead.

**Authors**: Insu Han, Zeliang Zhang, Zhiyuan Wang, Yifan Zhu, Susan Liang, Jiani Liu, Haiting Lin, Mingjie Zhao, Chenliang Xu, Kun Wan, Wentian Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T23:47:51Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse applications. However, their computational overhead during deployment remains a critical bottleneck. While Key-Value (KV) caching effectively trades memory for computation to enhance inference efficiency, the growing memory footprint from extensive KV caches significantly reduces throughput and restricts prolonged deployment on memory-constrained GPU devices. To address this challenge, we propose CalibQuant, a simple yet highly effective visual quantization strategy that drastically reduces both memory and computational overhead. Specifically, CalibQuant introduces an extreme 1-bit quantization scheme, complemented by novel post-scaling and calibration techniques tailored to the intrinsic patterns of KV caches, thereby ensuring high efficiency without compromising model performance. Leveraging Triton for runtime optimization, we achieve a 10x throughput increase on InternVL models. Our method is designed to be plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating with various existing MLLMs without requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining computational efficiency and preserving multimodal capabilities. Codes are available at https://github.com/insuhan/calibquant.

### Skew-Symmetric Matrix Decompositions on Shared-Memory Architectures
**Authors**: Ishna Satyarth, Chao Yin, Devin A. Matthews, Maggie Myers, Robert van de Geijn, RuQing G. Xu

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T21:27:53Z

**Summary**: The factorization of skew-symmetric matrices is a critically understudied area of dense linear algebra, particularly in comparison to that of general and symmetric matrices. While some algorithms can be adapted from the symmetric case, the cost of algorithms can be reduced by exploiting skew-symmetry. This work examines the factorization of a skew-symmetric matrix $X$ into its $LTL^\mathrm{T}$ decomposition, where $L$ is unit lower triangular and $T$ is tridiagonal. This is also known as a triangular tridiagonalization. This operation is a means for computing the determinant of $X$ as the square of the (cheaply-computed) Pfaffian of the skew-symmetric tridiagonal matrix $T$ as well as for solving systems of equations, across fields such as quantum electronic structure and machine learning. Its application also often requires pivoting in order to improve numerical stability. We compare and contrast previously-published algorithms with those systematically derived using the FLAME methodology. Performant parallel CPU implementations are achieved by fusing operations at multiple levels in order to reduce memory traffic overhead. A key factor is the employment of new capabilities of the BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software (BLIS) framework, which now supports casting level-2 and level-3 BLAS-like operations by leveraging its gemm and other kernels, hierarchical parallelism, and cache blocking. A prototype, concise C++ API facilitates the translation of correct-by-construction algorithms into correct code. Experiments verify that the resulting implementations greatly exceed the performance of previous work.

### Compositional Caching for Training-free Open-vocabulary Attribute   Detection
**Authors**: Marco Garosi, Alessandro Conti, Gaowen Liu, Elisa Ricci, Massimiliano Mancini

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T21:00:37Z

**Summary**: Attribute detection is crucial for many computer vision tasks, as it enables systems to describe properties such as color, texture, and material. Current approaches often rely on labor-intensive annotation processes which are inherently limited: objects can be described at an arbitrary level of detail (e.g., color vs. color shades), leading to ambiguities when the annotators are not instructed carefully. Furthermore, they operate within a predefined set of attributes, reducing scalability and adaptability to unforeseen downstream applications. We present Compositional Caching (ComCa), a training-free method for open-vocabulary attribute detection that overcomes these constraints. ComCa requires only the list of target attributes and objects as input, using them to populate an auxiliary cache of images by leveraging web-scale databases and Large Language Models to determine attribute-object compatibility. To account for the compositional nature of attributes, cache images receive soft attribute labels. Those are aggregated at inference time based on the similarity between the input and cache images, refining the predictions of underlying Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Importantly, our approach is model-agnostic, compatible with various VLMs. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that ComCa significantly outperforms zero-shot and cache-based baselines, competing with recent training-based methods, proving that a carefully designed training-free approach can successfully address open-vocabulary attribute detection.

### Mitigating KV Cache Competition to Enhance User Experience in LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Haiying Shen, Tanmoy Sen, Masahiro Tanaka

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T18:50:09Z

**Summary**: In Large Language Model (LLM) serving, the KV-cache (KVC) bottleneck causes high tail Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) and Time-Between-Tokens (TBT), impairing user experience, particularly in time-sensitive applications. However, satisfying both TTFT and TBT service-level objectives (SLOs) is challenging. To address this, we propose a system, named CacheOPT for mitigating KV Cache competition, based on key insights from our measurements, incorporating novel components. First, it estimates a request's output length, bounding the deviation with a high specified probability, adjusted based on the request arrival rate. Second, it allocates the estimated KVC demand to a request, and reuses other requests' allocated KVC to avoid preemptions while reducing waiting time. Third, it proactively allocates KVC before instead of at the time a request exhausts its allocation and reserves KVC globally to prevent preemptions. Fourth, it chooses a request that has long TBT SLO, long job remaining time and short preemption time to preempt. Fifth, it selects the shortest-latency strategy between swapping and recomputation for preemptions. Experiments show that CacheOPT achieves up to 3.29$\times$ and 2.83$\times$ lower tail TBT and tail TTFT, 47\% and 53\% higher TTFT and TBT SLO attainments, and supports up to 1.58$\times$ higher request arrival rate than the state-of-the-art methods.

### EconoServe: Maximizing Multi-Resource Utilization with SLO Guarantees in   LLM Serving
**Authors**: Haiying Shen, Tanmoy Sen

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T18:16:58Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to grow, reducing costs and alleviating GPU demands has become increasingly critical. However, existing schedulers primarily target either GPU compute or Key-Value Cache (KVC) utilization, failing to fully optimize both GPU compute and KVC usage during each iteration or guarantee timely KVC allocations when needed. To address these challenges, we conducted a trace-based experimental analysis and made insightful observations, leading to the design of a system called EconoServe. EconoServe maximizes multi-resource utilization while ensuring service-level objective (SLO) guarantees in LLM serving. To enable adding prompts to a batch to maximize GPU utilization in each iteration, EconoServe maintains separate waiting queues for prompt processing tasks (PTs) and generation tasks (GTs). It batches GTs with the same predicted response lengths (RL) to save scheduling time and allocates KVC space for the predicted RL to avoid KVC allocation failures. It further has a novel KVC pipelining method, allowing sharing allocated but unused KVC space to enhance KVC utilization. In addition, it prioritizes queued requests that occupy more KVC to release KVC earlier and satisfy request service-level-objective (SLO). Experimental results demonstrate that EconoServe increases throughput by up to 4$\times$ with the same level of latency, generates up to 91\% lower job completion time and up to 91\% higher SLO satisfaction ratio compared to vLLM. It also reduces the number of GPUs used in DistServe by up to 78\% while maintaining the same level of goodput.

### xKV: Cross-Layer SVD for KV-Cache Compression
**Authors**: Chi-Chih Chang, Chien-Yu Lin, Yash Akhauri, Wei-Cheng Lin, Kai-Chiang Wu, Luis Ceze, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T17:06:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context windows enable powerful applications but come at the cost of high memory consumption to store the Key and Value states (KV-Cache). Recent studies attempted to merge KV-cache from multiple layers into shared representations, yet these approaches either require expensive pretraining or rely on assumptions of high per-token cosine similarity across layers which generally does not hold in practice. We find that the dominant singular vectors are remarkably well-aligned across multiple layers of the KV-Cache. Exploiting this insight, we propose xKV, a simple post-training method that applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the KV-Cache of grouped layers. xKV consolidates the KV-Cache of multiple layers into a shared low-rank subspace, significantly reducing KV-Cache sizes. Through extensive evaluations on the RULER long-context benchmark with widely-used LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.1 and Qwen2.5), xKV achieves up to 6.8x higher compression rates than state-of-the-art inter-layer technique while improving accuracy by 2.7%. Moreover, xKV is compatible with the emerging Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) (e.g., DeepSeek-Coder-V2), yielding a notable 3x compression rates on coding tasks without performance degradation. These results highlight xKV's strong capability and versatility in addressing memory bottlenecks for long-context LLM inference. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/abdelfattah-lab/xKV.

### HERMES: High-Performance RISC-V Memory Hierarchy for ML Workloads
**Authors**: Pranav Suryadevara

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T16:47:48Z

**Summary**: The growth of machine learning (ML) workloads has underscored the importance of efficient memory hierarchies to address bandwidth, latency, and scalability challenges. HERMES focuses on optimizing memory subsystems for RISC-V architectures to meet the computational needs of ML models such as CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers. This project explores state-of-the-art techniques such as advanced prefetching, tensor-aware caching, and hybrid memory models. The cornerstone of HERMES is the integration of shared L3 caches with fine-grained coherence protocols equipped with specialized pathways to deep-learning accelerators such as Gemmini. Simulation tools like Gem5 and DRAMSim2 were used to evaluate baseline performance and scalability under representative ML workloads. The findings of this study highlight the design choices, and the anticipated challenges, paving the way for low-latency scalable memory operations for ML applications.

### Exploring the Integration of Key-Value Attention Into Pure and Hybrid   Transformers for Semantic Segmentation
**Authors**: DeShin Hwa, Tobias Holmes, Klaus Drechsler

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T16:38:31Z

**Summary**: While CNNs were long considered state of the art for image processing, the introduction of Transformer architectures has challenged this position. While achieving excellent results in image classification and segmentation, Transformers remain inherently reliant on large training datasets and remain computationally expensive. A newly introduced Transformer derivative named KV Transformer shows promising results in synthetic, NLP, and image classification tasks, while reducing complexity and memory usage. This is especially conducive to use cases where local inference is required, such as medical screening applications. We endeavoured to further evaluate the merit of KV Transformers on semantic segmentation tasks, specifically in the domain of medical imaging. By directly comparing traditional and KV variants of the same base architectures, we provide further insight into the practical tradeoffs of reduced model complexity. We observe a notable reduction in parameter count and multiply accumulate operations, while achieving similar performance from most of the KV variant models when directly compared to their QKV implementation.

### BitDecoding: Unlocking Tensor Cores for Long-Context LLMs Decoding with   Low-Bit KV Cache
**Authors**: Dayou Du, Shijie Cao, Jianyi Cheng, Ting Cao, Mao Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T15:22:41Z

**Summary**: The growing adoption of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced significant memory and computational challenges in autoregressive decoding due to the expanding Key-Value (KV) cache. KV cache quantization has emerged as a promising solution, with prior work showing that 4-bit or even 2-bit quantization can maintain model accuracy while reducing memory costs. However, despite these benefits, preliminary implementations for the low-bit KV cache struggle to deliver the expected speedup due to quantization and dequantization overheads and the lack of Tensor Cores utilization. In this work, we propose BitDecoding, a GPU-optimized framework that unlocks Tensor Cores for efficient decoding with low-bit KV cache. Efficiently leveraging Tensor Cores for low-bit KV cache is challenging due to the dynamic nature of KV cache generation at each decoding step. BitDecoding addresses these challenges with a Tensor Cores-Centric BitFusion Scheme that ensures data layout compatibility to enable high utilization of Tensor Cores. Additionally, BitDecoding incorporates a warp-efficient parallel decoding kernel and a fine-grained asynchronous pipeline, minimizing dequantization overhead and improving computational efficiency. Experiments show that BitDecoding achieves up to 7.5x speedup on RTX 4090, 4.8x on A100, and 8.9x on H100, compared to FP16 FlashDecoding-v2. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art low-bit KV cache implementation (QServe) by up to 4.3x. On LLaMA-3.1-8B with a 128K sequence length, BitDecoding reduces single-batch decoding latency by 3x, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-context generation scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/DD-DuDa/BitDecoding.

### Choosing Augmentation Parameters in OSQP- A New Approach based on   Conjugate Directions
**Authors**: Avinash Kumar

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T13:09:03Z

**Summary**: This work proposes a new method to select the augmentation parameters in the operator splitting quadratic program (OSQP) algorithm so as to reduce the computation time of overall algorithm. The selection is based upon the information of conjugate directions of the coefficient matrix of a linear system of equations present in the algorithm. This selection makes it possible to cache these conjugate directions, instead of computing them at each iteration, resulting in faster computation of the solution of the linear system thus reducing the overall computation time. This reduction is demonstrated by a numerical example.

### Oaken: Fast and Efficient LLM Serving with Online-Offline Hybrid KV   Cache Quantization
**Authors**: Minsu Kim, Seongmin Hong, RyeoWook Ko, Soongyu Choi, Hunjong Lee, Junsoo Kim, Joo-Young Kim, Jongse Park

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T11:56:50Z

**Summary**: Modern Large Language Model serving system batches multiple requests to achieve high throughput, while batching attention operations is challenging, rendering memory bandwidth a critical bottleneck. The community relies on high-end GPUs with multiple high-bandwidth memory channels. Unfortunately, HBM's high bandwidth often comes at the expense of limited memory capacity, which reduces core utilization and increases costs. Recent advancements enabling longer contexts for LLMs have substantially increased the key-value cache size, further intensifying the pressures on memory capacity. The literature has explored KV cache quantization techniques, which commonly use low bitwidth for most values, selectively using higher bitwidth for outlier values. While this approach helps achieve high accuracy and low bitwidth simultaneously, it comes with the limitation that cost for online outlier detection is excessively high, negating the advantages. We propose Oaken, an acceleration solution that achieves high accuracy and high performance simultaneously through co-designing algorithm and hardware. To effectively find a sweet spot in the accuracy-performance trade-off space of KV cache quantization, Oaken employs an online-offline hybrid approach, setting outlier thresholds offline, which are then used to determine the quantization scale online. To translate the proposed algorithmic technique into tangible performance gains, Oaken also comes with custom quantization engines and memory management units that can be integrated with any LLM accelerators. We built an Oaken accelerator on top of an LLM accelerator, LPU, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation. Our experiments show that for a batch size of 256, Oaken achieves up to 1.58x throughput improvement over NVIDIA A100 GPU, incurring a minimal accuracy loss of only 0.54\% on average, compared to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization techniques.

### Register Dispersion: Reducing the Footprint of the Vector Register File   in Vector Engines of Low-Cost RISC-V CPUs
**Authors**: Vasileios Titopoulos, George Alexakis, Kosmas Alexandridis, Chrysostomos Nicopoulos, Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T11:00:35Z

**Summary**: The deployment of Machine Learning (ML) applications at the edge on resource-constrained devices has accentuated the need for efficient ML processing on low-cost processors. While traditional CPUs provide programming flexibility, their general-purpose architecture often lacks the throughput required for complex ML models. The augmentation of a RISC-V processor with a vector unit can provide substantial data-level parallelism. However, increasing the data-level parallelism supported by vector processing would make the Vector Register File (VRF) a major area consumer in ultra low-cost processors, since 32 vector registers are required for RISC-V Vector ISA compliance. This work leverages the insight that many ML vectorized kernels require a small number of active vector registers, and proposes the use of a physically smaller VRF that dynamically caches only the vector registers currently accessed by the application. This approach, called Register Dispersion, maps the architectural vector registers to a smaller set of physical registers. The proposed ISA-compliant VRF is significantly smaller than a full-size VRF and operates like a conventional cache, i.e., it only stores the most recently accessed vector registers. Essential registers remain readily accessible within the compact VRF, while the others are offloaded to the cache/memory sub-system. The compact VRF design is demonstrated to yield substantial area and power savings, as compared to using a full VRF, with no or minimal impact on performance. This effective trade-off renders the inclusion of vector units in low-cost processors feasible and practical.

### iFlame: Interleaving Full and Linear Attention for Efficient Mesh   Generation
**Authors**: Hanxiao Wang, Biao Zhang, Weize Quan, Dong-Ming Yan, Peter Wonka

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T03:18:49Z

**Summary**: This paper propose iFlame, a novel transformer-based network architecture for mesh generation. While attention-based models have demonstrated remarkable performance in mesh generation, their quadratic computational complexity limits scalability, particularly for high-resolution 3D data. Conversely, linear attention mechanisms offer lower computational costs but often struggle to capture long-range dependencies, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. To address this trade-off, we propose an interleaving autoregressive mesh generation framework that combines the efficiency of linear attention with the expressive power of full attention mechanisms. To further enhance efficiency and leverage the inherent structure of mesh representations, we integrate this interleaving approach into an hourglass architecture, which significantly boosts efficiency. Our approach reduces training time while achieving performance comparable to pure attention-based models. To improve inference efficiency, we implemented a caching algorithm that almost doubles the speed and reduces the KV cache size by seven-eighths compared to the original Transformer. We evaluate our framework on ShapeNet and Objaverse, demonstrating its ability to generate high-quality 3D meshes efficiently. Our results indicate that the proposed interleaving framework effectively balances computational efficiency and generative performance, making it a practical solution for mesh generation. The training takes only 2 days with 4 GPUs on 39k data with a maximum of 4k faces on Objaverse.

**Authors**: Chen Zhang, Kuntai Du, Shu Liu, Woosuk Kwon, Xiangxi Mo, Yufeng Wang, Xiaoxuan Liu, Kaichao You, Zhuohan Li, Mingsheng Long, Jidong Zhai, Joseph Gonzalez, Ion Stoica

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T02:28:04Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used but expensive to run, especially as inference workloads grow. To lower costs, maximizing the request batch size by managing GPU memory efficiently is crucial. While PagedAttention has recently been proposed to improve the efficiency of memory management, we find that the growing heterogeneity in the embeddings dimensions, attention, and access patterns of modern LLM architectures introduces new challenges for memory allocation.   In this paper, we present Jenga, a novel memory allocation framework for heterogeneous embeddings in LLMs. Jenga tackles two key challenges: (1) minimizing memory fragmentation when managing embeddings of different sizes, and (2) enabling flexible caching and eviction policies tailored to the specific token-dependency patterns of various layers. Jenga employs a two-level memory allocator, leveraging the least common multiple (LCM) of embedding sizes to optimize memory usage and providing APIs to express layer-specific caching logic to enhance memory reuse.   We implemente Jenga on vLLM, a state-of-the-art LLM inference engine, and evaluate it with diverse LLMs, datasets, and GPU configurations. Evaluations show that Jenga improves GPU memory utilization by up to 79.6%, and increases serving throughput by up to 4.92x (1.80x on average).

### ReTaKe: Reducing Temporal and Knowledge Redundancy for Long Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Xiao Wang, Qingyi Si, Jianlong Wu, Shiyu Zhu, Li Cao, Liqiang Nie

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T02:17:34Z

**Summary**: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have made significant strides in video understanding but struggle with long videos due to the limitations of their backbone LLMs. Existing solutions rely on length extrapolation, which is memory-constrained, or visual token compression, which primarily leverages low-level temporal redundancy while overlooking the more effective high-level knowledge redundancy. To address this, we propose $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, a training-free method with two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for video compression. To align with the way of human temporal perception, DPSelect identifies keyframes based on inter-frame distance peaks. To leverage LLMs' learned prior knowledge, PivotKV marks the keyframes as pivots and compress non-pivot frames by pruning low-attention tokens in their KV cache. ReTaKe enables VideoLLMs to process 8 times longer frames (up to 2048), outperforming similar-sized models by 3-5% and even rivaling much larger ones on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench. Moreover, by overlapping compression operations with prefilling, ReTaKe introduces only ~10% prefilling latency overhead while reducing decoding latency by ~20%. Our code is available at https://github.com/SCZwangxiao/video-ReTaKe.

**Updated**: 2025-03-24T01:15:43Z

**Summary**: Effective risk management solutions become absolutely crucial when financial markets embrace distributed technology and decentralized financing (DeFi). This study offers a thorough survey and comparative analysis of the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in risk management for distributed arbitrage systems. We examine several modern caching techniques namely in memory caching, distributed caching, and proxy caching and their functions in enhancing performance in decentralized settings. Through literature review we examine the utilization of AI techniques for alleviating risks related to market volatility, liquidity challenges, operational failures, regulatory compliance, and security threats. This comparison research evaluates various case studies from prominent DeFi technologies, emphasizing critical performance metrics like latency reduction, load balancing, and system resilience. Additionally, we examine the problems and trade offs associated with these technologies, emphasizing their effects on consistency, scalability, and fault tolerance. By meticulously analyzing real world applications, specifically centering on the Aave platform as our principal case study, we illustrate how the purposeful amalgamation of AI with contemporary caching methodologies has revolutionized risk management in distributed arbitrage systems.

### Enabling the Write-Back Page Cache with Strong Consistency in   Distributed Userspace File Systems
**Authors**: Haoyu Li, Jingkai Fu, Qing Li, Windsor Hsu, Asaf Cidon

**Updated**: 2025-03-23T20:18:16Z

**Summary**: The large-scale, multi-tenant nature of cloud computing requires distributed file systems that offer stability, adaptability, and compatibility. FUSE-based distributed file systems have emerged as a popular solution for the cloud, offering fast deployment, fault isolation, and POSIX compliance. However, FUSE's performance limitations, particularly its inability to reconcile page caching with strong consistency in distributed environments, remain a persistent problem. Existing approaches either sacrifice consistency for performance or rely on inefficient caching, limiting their practicality.   To this end, we present DistFUSE, the first FUSE-based distributed file system that relies on a write-back kernel-based page cache for performance and provides strong consistency. DistFUSE achieves this by offloading userspace lock management to the kernel driver, allowing coordinated access to the kernel's page cache across nodes. This design eliminates blind local cache updates and ensures cluster-wide consistency without compromising performance. Our evaluation shows DistFUSE improves throughput by up to 75% compared to baseline approaches.

### Formal Verification of Parameterized Systems based on Induction
**Authors**: Jiaqi Xiu, Yongjian Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-23T11:07:24Z

**Summary**: Parameterized systems play a crucial role in the computer field, and their security is of great significance. Formal verification of parameterized protocols is especially challenging due to its "parameterized" feature, which brings complexity and undecidability. Existing automated parameterized verification methods have limitations, such as facing difficulties in automatically deriving parameterized invariants constrained by mixed Forall and Exists quantifiers, or having challenges in completing the parameterized verification of large and complex protocols. This paper proposes a formal verification framework for parameterized systems based on induction, named wiseParaverifier. It starts from small concretizations of protocols, analyzes inductive counterexamples, and constructs counterexample formulas to guide the entire process of parameterized verification. It also presents a heuristic Generalize method to quickly find auxiliary invariants, a method for promoting complex mixed quantifiers and merging parameterized invariants, and uses symmetric reduction ideas to accelerate the verification process. Experimental results show that wiseParaverifier can successfully complete automatic inductive verification on 7 cache coherence protocols and 10 distributed protocols. It has strong verification capabilities and migration capabilities, and can provide concise and readable verification results, which is helpful for learners to understand protocol behaviors.

### Knowledge Rumination for Client Utility Evaluation in Heterogeneous   Federated Learning
**Authors**: Xiaorui Jiang, Yu Gao, Hengwei Xu, Qi Zhang, Yong Liao, Pengyuan Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-03-23T06:14:35Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) allows several clients to cooperatively train machine learning models without disclosing the raw data. In practical applications, asynchronous FL (AFL) can address the straggler effect compared to synchronous FL. However, Non-IID data and stale models pose significant challenges to AFL, as they can diminish the practicality of the global model and even lead to training failures. In this work, we propose a novel AFL framework called Federated Historical Learning (FedHist), which effectively addresses the challenges posed by both Non-IID data and gradient staleness based on the concept of knowledge rumination. FedHist enhances the stability of local gradients by performing weighted fusion with historical global gradients cached on the server. Relying on hindsight, it assigns aggregation weights to each participant in a multi-dimensional manner during each communication round. To further enhance the efficiency and stability of the training process, we introduce an intelligent $\ell_2$-norm amplification scheme, which dynamically regulates the learning progress based on the $\ell_2$-norms of the submitted gradients. Extensive experiments indicate FedHist outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence performance and test accuracy.

### Cache-Aware Cooperative Multicast Beamforming in Dynamic   Satellite-Terrestrial Networks
**Authors**: Shuo Yuan, Yaohua Sun, Mugen Peng

**Updated**: 2025-03-23T03:20:25Z

**Summary**: With the burgeoning demand for data-intensive services, satellite-terrestrial networks (STNs) face increasing backhaul link congestion, deteriorating user quality of service (QoS), and escalating power consumption. Cache-aided STNs are acknowledged as a promising paradigm for accelerating content delivery to users and alleviating the load of backhaul links. However, the dynamic nature of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and the complex interference among satellite beams and terrestrial base stations pose challenges in effectively managing limited edge resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method for dynamically scheduling caching and communication resources, aiming to reduce network costs in terms of transmission power consumption and backhaul traffic, while meeting user QoS demands and resource constraints. We formulate a mixed timescale problem to jointly optimize cache placement, LEO satellite beam direction, and cooperative multicast beamforming among satellite beams and base stations. To tackle this intricate problem, we propose a two-stage solution framework, where the primary problem is decoupled into a short-term content delivery subproblem and a long-term cache placement subproblem. The former subproblem is solved by designing an alternating optimization approach with whale optimization and successive convex approximation methods according to the cache placement state, while cache content in STNs is updated using an iterative algorithm that utilizes historical information. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, showcasing their convergence and significantly reducing transmission power consumption and backhaul traffic by up to 52%.

**Authors**: Xiaoyao Zhong, Haotian Li, Jiabao Jin, Mingyu Yang, Deming Chu, Xiangyu Wang, Zhitao Shen, Wei Jia, George Gu, Yi Xie, Xuemin Lin, Heng Tao Shen, Jingkuan Song, Peng Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-03-23T03:16:50Z

**Summary**: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a fundamental problem in vector databases and AI infrastructures. Recent graph-based ANNS algorithms have achieved high search accuracy with practical efficiency. Despite the advancements, these algorithms still face performance bottlenecks in production, due to the random memory access patterns of graph-based search and the high computational overheads of vector distance. In addition, the performance of a graph-based ANNS algorithm is highly sensitive to parameters, while selecting the optimal parameters is cost-prohibitive, e.g., manual tuning requires repeatedly re-building the index.   This paper introduces VSAG, an open-source framework that aims to enhance the in production performance of graph-based ANNS algorithms. VSAG has been deployed at scale in the services of Ant Group, and it incorporates three key optimizations: (i) efficient memory access: it reduces L3 cache misses with pre-fetching and cache-friendly vector organization; (ii) automated parameter tuning: it automatically selects performance-optimal parameters without requiring index rebuilding; (iii) efficient distance computation: it leverages modern hardware, scalar quantization, and smartly switches to low-precision representation to dramatically reduce the distance computation costs. We evaluate VSAG on real-world datasets. The experimental results show that VSAG achieves the state-of-the-art performance and provides up to 4x speedup over HNSWlib (an industry-standard library) while ensuring the same accuracy.

### Orientation-Dependent \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Heterojunction Diode with Atomic   Layer Deposition (ALD) Grown NiO
**Authors**: Yizheng Liu, Shane M. W. Witsell, John F. Conley, Sriram Krishnamoorthy

**Updated**: 2025-03-23T01:17:08Z

**Summary**: This work reports the demonstration of ALD-deposited NiO/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterojunction diodes (HJDs) on low doped drift layer and highly doped (001) & (100) n+ substrates with experimental observation of a parallel-plane junction electric field as high as 7.5 MV/cm, revealing a crystal orientation dependence in \b{eta}-Ga2O3. We use a novel metalorganic precursor bis(1,4-di-tert-butyl-1,3-diazadienyl) (nickel Ni(tBu2DAD)2) with ozone (O3) to deposit NiO. The NiO/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJD on 7.7 {\mu}m-thick HVPE-grown drift region exhibited an on-state current density of ~20 A/cm2 at 5 V, ~10-8 A/cm2 reverse leakage at low reverse bias(-5 V), and a rectifying ratio(Jon/Joff) of ~109. The HJD broke down at ~2.2 kV reverse bias, corresponding to a ~3.4 MV/cm parallel-plane junction electric field, with a noise floor reverse leakage (10-8~10-6 A/cm2, nA) at 80% of the device catastrophic breakdown voltage. The NiO/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs on n+ (001) & (100) highly-doped substrates exhibited breakdown voltages at 12.5-16.0 V and 28.5-70.5 V, respectively, with extracted critical electric field (EC) at 2.30-2.76 MV/cm, and 4.33-7.50 MV/cm, revealing a substrate crystal orientation dependence on breakdown electric field for \b{eta}-Ga2O3. The 7.5 MV/cm EC reported here is one of the highest parallel-plane junction electric fields reported in literature.

### A Generative Caching System for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Arun Iyengar, Ashish Kundu, Ramana Kompella, Sai Nandan Mamidi

**Updated**: 2025-03-22T01:17:56Z

**Summary**: Caching has the potential to be of significant benefit for accessing large language models (LLMs) due to their high latencies which typically range from a small number of seconds to well over a minute. Furthermore, many LLMs charge money for queries; caching thus has a clear monetary benefit. This paper presents a new caching system for improving user experiences with LLMs. In addition to reducing both latencies and monetary costs for accessing LLMs, our system also provides important features that go beyond the performance benefits typically associated with caches. A key feature we provide is generative caching, wherein multiple cached responses can be synthesized to provide answers to queries which have never been seen before. Our generative caches function as repositories of valuable information which can be mined and analyzed. We also improve upon past semantic caching techniques by tailoring the caching algorithms to optimally balance cost and latency reduction with the quality of responses provided. Performance tests indicate that our caches are considerably faster than GPTcache.

### Multiport Support for Vortex OpenGPU Memory Hierarchy
**Authors**: Injae Shin, Blaise Tine

**Updated**: 2025-03-22T01:16:24Z

**Summary**: Modern day applications have grown in size and require more computational power. The rise of machine learning and AI increased the need for parallel computation, which has increased the need for GPGPUs. With the increasing demand for computational power, GPGPUs' SIMT architecture has solved this with an increase in the number of threads and the number of cores in a GPU, increasing the throughput of these processors to match the demand of the applications. However, this created a larger demand for the memory, making the memory bandwidth a bottleneck. The introduction of High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) with its increased number of memory ports offers a potential solution for the GPU to exploit its memory parallelism to increase the memory bandwidth. However, effectively leveraging HBM's memory parallelism to maximize bandwidth presents a unique and complex challenge for GPU architectures on how to distribute those ports among the streaming multiprocessors in the GPGPU. In this work, we extend the Vortex OpenGPU microarchitecture to incorporate a multiport memory hierarchy, spanning from the L1 cache to the last-level cache (LLC). In addition, we propose various arbitration strategies to optimize memory transfers across the cache hierarchy. The results have shown that an increase in memory ports increases IPC, achieving an average speedup of 2.34x with 8 memory ports in the tested configuration while showing relatively small area overhead.

### PIM Is All You Need: A CXL-Enabled GPU-Free System for Large Language   Model Inference
**Authors**: Yufeng Gu, Alireza Khadem, Sumanth Umesh, Ning Liang, Xavier Servot, Onur Mutlu, Ravi Iyer, Reetuparna Das

**Updated**: 2025-03-21T21:10:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference uses an autoregressive manner to generate one token at a time, which exhibits notably lower operational intensity compared to earlier Machine Learning (ML) models such as encoder-only transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. At the same time, LLMs possess large parameter sizes and use key-value caches to store context information. Modern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate versatile text, audio, and video content. A large key-value cache unique to each prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch size. Both low operational intensity and limited batch size necessitate a high memory bandwidth. However, contemporary hardware systems for ML model deployment, such as GPUs and TPUs, are primarily optimized for compute throughput. This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs and makes users pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized for the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.   We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which harnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM sizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory bandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable CXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives across CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute LLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported batch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3$\times$ higher throughput and consumes 2.3$\times$ less energy. CENT enhances the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2$\times$ more tokens per dollar than GPUs.

### RoSTE: An Efficient Quantization-Aware Supervised Fine-Tuning Approach   for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Quan Wei, Chung-Yiu Yau, Hoi-To Wai, Yang Katie Zhao, Dongyeop Kang, Youngsuk Park, Mingyi Hong

**Updated**: 2025-03-21T19:26:12Z

**Summary**: Supervised fine-tuning is a standard method for adapting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. Quantization has been recently studied as a post-training technique for efficient LLM deployment. To obtain quantized fine-tuned LLMs, conventional pipelines would first fine-tune the pre-trained models, followed by post-training quantization. This often yields suboptimal performance as it fails to leverage the synergy between fine-tuning and quantization. To effectively realize low-bit quantization of weights, activations, and KV caches in LLMs, we propose an algorithm named Rotated Straight-Through-Estimator (RoSTE), which combines quantization-aware supervised fine-tuning (QA-SFT) with an adaptive rotation strategy that identifies an effective rotation configuration to reduce activation outliers. We provide theoretical insights on RoSTE by analyzing its prediction error when applied to an overparameterized least square quantized training problem. Our findings reveal that the prediction error is directly proportional to the quantization error of the converged weights, which can be effectively managed through an optimized rotation configuration. Experiments on Pythia, Qwen and Llama models of different sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of RoSTE. Compared to existing post-SFT quantization baselines, our method consistently achieves superior performances across various tasks and different LLM architectures.

### LazyDiT: Lazy Learning for the Acceleration of Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Xuan Shen, Zhao Song, Yufa Zhou, Bo Chen, Yanyu Li, Yifan Gong, Kai Zhang, Hao Tan, Jason Kuen, Henghui Ding, Zhihao Shu, Wei Niu, Pu Zhao, Yanzhi Wang, Jiuxiang Gu

**Updated**: 2025-03-21T15:52:39Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the preeminent models for a wide array of generative tasks, demonstrating superior performance and efficacy across various applications. The promising results come at the cost of slow inference, as each denoising step requires running the whole transformer model with a large amount of parameters. In this paper, we show that performing the full computation of the model at each diffusion step is unnecessary, as some computations can be skipped by lazily reusing the results of previous steps. Furthermore, we show that the lower bound of similarity between outputs at consecutive steps is notably high, and this similarity can be linearly approximated using the inputs. To verify our demonstrations, we propose the \textbf{LazyDiT}, a lazy learning framework that efficiently leverages cached results from earlier steps to skip redundant computations. Specifically, we incorporate lazy learning layers into the model, effectively trained to maximize laziness, enabling dynamic skipping of redundant computations. Experimental results show that LazyDiT outperforms the DDIM sampler across multiple diffusion transformer models at various resolutions. Furthermore, we implement our method on mobile devices, achieving better performance than DDIM with similar latency. Code: https://github.com/shawnricecake/lazydit

### AttriBoT: A Bag of Tricks for Efficiently Approximating Leave-One-Out   Context Attribution
**Authors**: Fengyuan Liu, Nikhil Kandpal, Colin Raffel

**Updated**: 2025-03-21T15:47:53Z

**Summary**: The influence of contextual input on the behavior of large language models (LLMs) has prompted the development of context attribution methods that aim to quantify each context span's effect on an LLM's generations. The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods.

### Dynamic-LLaVA: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models via Dynamic   Vision-language Context Sparsification
**Authors**: Wenxuan Huang, Zijie Zhai, Yunhang Shen, Shaosheng Cao, Fei Zhao, Xiangfeng Xu, Zheyu Ye, Yao Hu, Shaohui Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-21T13:30:33Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/Osilly/dynamic_llava .

### Language-Queried Target Sound Extraction Without Parallel Training Data
**Authors**: Hao Ma, Zhiyuan Peng, Xu Li, Yukai Li, Mingjie Shao, Qiuqiang Kong, Ju Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-21T12:51:15Z

**Summary**: Language-queried target sound extraction (TSE) aims to extract specific sounds from mixtures based on language queries. Traditional fully-supervised training schemes require extensively annotated parallel audio-text data, which are labor-intensive. We introduce a parallel-data-free training scheme, requiring only unlabelled audio clips for TSE model training by utilizing the contrastive language-audio pre-trained model (CLAP). In a vanilla parallel-data-free training stage, target audio is encoded using the pre-trained CLAP audio encoder to form a condition embedding, while during testing, user language queries are encoded by CLAP text encoder as the condition embedding. This vanilla approach assumes perfect alignment between text and audio embeddings, which is unrealistic. Two major challenges arise from training-testing mismatch: the persistent modality gap between text and audio and the risk of overfitting due to the exposure of rich acoustic details in target audio embedding during training. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented strategy. Specifically, we create an embedding cache using audio captions generated by a large language model (LLM). During training, target audio embeddings retrieve text embeddings from this cache to use as condition embeddings, ensuring consistent modalities between training and testing and eliminating information leakage. Extensive experiment results show that our retrieval-augmented approach achieves consistent and notable performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art with better generalizability.

### Sparse Logit Sampling: Accelerating Knowledge Distillation in LLMs
**Authors**: Anshumann, Mohd Abbas Zaidi, Akhil Kedia, Jinwoo Ahn, Taehwak Kwon, Kangwook Lee, Haejun Lee, Joohyung Lee

**Updated**: 2025-03-21T05:58:18Z

**Summary**: Knowledge distillation can be a cost-effective technique to distill knowledge in Large Language Models, if the teacher output logits can be pre-computed and cached. However, successfully applying this to pre-training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we prove that naive approaches for sparse knowledge distillation such as caching Top-K probabilities, while intuitive, provide biased estimates of teacher probability distribution to the student, resulting in suboptimal performance and calibration. We propose an importance-sampling-based method `Random Sampling Knowledge Distillation', which provides unbiased estimates, preserves the gradient in expectation, and requires storing significantly sparser logits. Our method enables faster training of student models with marginal overhead (<10%) compared to cross-entropy based training, while maintaining competitive performance compared to full distillation, across a range of model sizes from 300M to 3B.

**Authors**: Feiyang Li, Yingjian Chen, Haoran Liu, Rui Yang, Han Yuan, Yuang Jiang, Tianxiao Li, Edison Marrese Taylor, Hossein Rouhizadeh, Yusuke Iwasawa, Douglas Teodoro, Yutaka Matsuo, Irene Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-21T01:59:12Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in medical question answering (QA), yet their effectiveness remains predominantly limited to English due to imbalanced multilingual training data and scarce medical resources for low-resource languages. To address this critical language gap in medical QA, we propose Multilingual Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval Ranking (MKG-Rank), a knowledge graph-enhanced framework that enables English-centric LLMs to perform multilingual medical QA. Through a word-level translation mechanism, our framework efficiently integrates comprehensive English-centric medical knowledge graphs into LLM reasoning at a low cost, mitigating cross-lingual semantic distortion and achieving precise medical QA across language barriers. To enhance efficiency, we introduce caching and multi-angle ranking strategies to optimize the retrieval process, significantly reducing response times and prioritizing relevant medical knowledge. Extensive evaluations on multilingual medical QA benchmarks across Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Swahili demonstrate that MKG-Rank consistently outperforms zero-shot LLMs, achieving maximum 35.03% increase in accuracy, while maintaining an average retrieval time of only 0.0009 seconds.

**Updated**: 2025-03-20T21:49:15Z

**Summary**: Web refresh crawling is the problem of keeping a cache of web pages fresh, that is, having the most recent copy available when a page is requested, given a limited bandwidth available to the crawler. Under the assumption that the change and request events, resp., to each web page follow independent Poisson processes, the optimal scheduling policy was derived by Azar et al. 2018. In this paper, we study an extension of this problem where side information indicating content changes, such as various types of web pings, for example, signals from sitemaps, content delivery networks, etc., is available. Incorporating such side information into the crawling policy is challenging, because (i) the signals can be noisy with false positive events and with missing change events; and (ii) the crawler should achieve a fair performance over web pages regardless of the quality of the side information, which might differ from web page to web page. We propose a scalable crawling algorithm which (i) uses the noisy side information in an optimal way under mild assumptions; (ii) can be deployed without heavy centralized computation; (iii) is able to crawl web pages at a constant total rate without spikes in the total bandwidth usage over any time interval, and automatically adapt to the new optimal solution when the total bandwidth changes without centralized computation. Experiments clearly demonstrate the versatility of our approach.

### Plug-and-Play 1.x-Bit KV Cache Quantization for Video Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Keda Tao, Haoxuan You, Yang Sui, Can Qin, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-20T15:52:43Z

**Summary**: Video large language models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated the capability to process longer video inputs and enable complex reasoning and analysis. However, due to the thousands of visual tokens from the video frames, key-value (KV) cache can significantly increase memory requirements, becoming a bottleneck for inference speed and memory usage. KV cache quantization is a widely used approach to address this problem. In this paper, we find that 2-bit KV quantization of VideoLLMs can hardly hurt the model performance, while the limit of KV cache quantization in even lower bits has not been investigated. To bridge this gap, we introduce VidKV, a plug-and-play KV cache quantization method to compress the KV cache to lower than 2 bits. Specifically, (1) for key, we propose a mixed-precision quantization strategy in the channel dimension, where we perform 2-bit quantization for anomalous channels and 1-bit quantization combined with FFT for normal channels; (2) for value, we implement 1.58-bit quantization while selectively filtering semantically salient visual tokens for targeted preservation, for a better trade-off between precision and model performance. Importantly, our findings suggest that the value cache of VideoLLMs should be quantized in a per-channel fashion instead of the per-token fashion proposed by prior KV cache quantization works for LLMs. Empirically, extensive results with LLaVA-OV-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on six benchmarks show that VidKV effectively compresses the KV cache to 1.5-bit and 1.58-bit precision with almost no performance drop compared to the FP16 counterparts.

### SpeCache: Speculative Key-Value Caching for Efficient Generation of LLMs
**Authors**: Shibo Jie, Yehui Tang, Kai Han, Zhi-Hong Deng, Jing Han

**Updated**: 2025-03-20T14:01:56Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have already achieved remarkable results on long-text tasks, but the limited GPU memory (VRAM) resources struggle to accommodate the linearly growing demand for key-value (KV) cache as the sequence length increases, which has become a bottleneck for the application of LLMs on long sequences. Existing KV cache compression methods include eviction, merging, or quantization of the KV cache to reduce its size. However, compression results in irreversible information forgetting, potentially affecting the accuracy of subsequent decoding. In this paper, we propose SpeCache, which takes full advantage of the large and easily expandable CPU memory to offload the complete KV cache, and dynamically fetches KV pairs back in each decoding step based on their importance measured by low-bit KV cache copy in VRAM. To avoid inference latency caused by CPU-GPU communication, SpeCache speculatively predicts the KV pairs that the next token might attend to, allowing us to prefetch them before the next decoding step which enables parallelization of prefetching and computation. Experiments on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks verify that SpeCache effectively reduces VRAM usage while avoiding information forgetting for long sequences without re-training, even with a 10x high KV cache compression ratio.

### PromptMobile: Efficient Promptus for Low Bandwidth Mobile Video   Streaming
**Authors**: Liming Liu, Jiangkai Wu, Haoyang Wang, Peiheng Wang, Xinggong Zhang, Zongming Guo

**Updated**: 2025-03-20T13:00:36Z

**Summary**: Traditional video compression algorithms exhibit significant quality degradation at extremely low bitrates. Promptus emerges as a new paradigm for video streaming, substantially cutting down the bandwidth essential for video streaming. However, Promptus is computationally intensive and can not run in real-time on mobile devices. This paper presents PromptMobile, an efficient acceleration framework tailored for on-device Promptus. Specifically, we propose (1) a two-stage efficient generation framework to reduce computational cost by 8.1x, (2) a fine-grained inter-frame caching to reduce redundant computations by 16.6\%, (3) system-level optimizations to further enhance efficiency. The evaluations demonstrate that compared with the original Promptus, PromptMobile achieves a 13.6x increase in image generation speed. Compared with other streaming methods, PromptMobile achives an average LPIPS improvement of 0.016 (compared with H.265), reducing 60\% of severely distorted frames (compared to VQGAN).

### BlockDance: Reuse Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal Features to   Accelerate Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Hui Zhang, Tingwei Gao, Jie Shao, Zuxuan Wu

**Updated**: 2025-03-20T08:07:31Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generation capabilities, particularly with recent advancements leveraging transformer architectures to improve both visual and artistic quality. However, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) continue to encounter challenges related to low inference speed, primarily due to the iterative denoising process. To address this issue, we propose BlockDance, a training-free approach that explores feature similarities at adjacent time steps to accelerate DiTs. Unlike previous feature-reuse methods that lack tailored reuse strategies for features at different scales, BlockDance prioritizes the identification of the most structurally similar features, referred to as Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal (STSS) features. These features are primarily located within the structure-focused blocks of the transformer during the later stages of denoising. BlockDance caches and reuses these highly similar features to mitigate redundant computation, thereby accelerating DiTs while maximizing consistency with the generated results of the original model. Furthermore, considering the diversity of generated content and the varying distributions of redundant features, we introduce BlockDance-Ada, a lightweight decision-making network tailored for instance-specific acceleration. BlockDance-Ada dynamically allocates resources and provides superior content quality. Both BlockDance and BlockDance-Ada have proven effective across various generation tasks and models, achieving accelerations between 25% and 50% while maintaining generation quality.

### Mobile Edge Intelligence for Large Language Models: A Contemporary   Survey
**Authors**: Guanqiao Qu, Qiyuan Chen, Wei Wei, Zheng Lin, Xianhao Chen, Kaibin Huang

**Updated**: 2025-03-20T05:23:42Z

**Summary**: On-device large language models (LLMs), referring to running LLMs on edge devices, have raised considerable interest since they are more cost-effective, latency-efficient, and privacy-preserving compared with the cloud paradigm. Nonetheless, the performance of on-device LLMs is intrinsically constrained by resource limitations on edge devices. Sitting between cloud and on-device AI, mobile edge intelligence (MEI) presents a viable solution by provisioning AI capabilities at the edge of mobile networks, enabling end users to offload heavy AI computation to capable edge servers nearby. This article provides a contemporary survey on harnessing MEI for LLMs. We begin by illustrating several killer applications to demonstrate the urgent need for deploying LLMs at the network edge. Next, we present the preliminaries of LLMs and MEI, followed by resource-efficient LLM techniques. We then present an architectural overview of MEI for LLMs (MEI4LLM), outlining its core components and how it supports the deployment of LLMs. Subsequently, we delve into various aspects of MEI4LLM, extensively covering edge LLM caching and delivery, edge LLM training, and edge LLM inference. Finally, we identify future research opportunities. We hope this article inspires researchers in the field to leverage mobile edge computing to facilitate LLM deployment, thereby unleashing the potential of LLMs across various privacy- and delay-sensitive applications.

### Formalising CXL Cache Coherence
**Authors**: Chengsong Tan, Alastair F. Donaldson, John Wickerson

**Updated**: 2025-03-19T10:19:30Z

**Summary**: We report our experience formally modelling and verifying CXL.cache, the inter-device cache coherence protocol of the Compute Express Link standard. We have used the Isabelle proof assistant to create a formal model for CXL.cache based on the prose English specification. This led to us identifying and proposing fixes to several problems we identified as unclear, ambiguous or inaccurate, some of which could lead to incoherence if left unfixed. Nearly all our issues and proposed fixes have been confirmed and tentatively accepted by the CXL consortium for adoption, save for one which is still under discussion. To validate the faithfulness of our model we performed scenario verification of essential restrictions such as "Snoop-pushes-GO", and produced a fully mechanised proof of a coherence property of the model. The considerable size of this proof, comprising tens of thousands of lemmas, prompted us to develop new proof automation tools, which we have made available for other Isabelle users working with similarly cumbersome proofs.

 ### Slot-Level Robotic Placement via Visual Imitation from Single Human   Video
**Authors**: Dandan Shan, Kaichun Mo, Wei Yang, Yu-Wei Chao, David Fouhey, Dieter Fox, Arsalan Mousavian

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:59:45Z

**Summary**: The majority of modern robot learning methods focus on learning a set of pre-defined tasks with limited or no generalization to new tasks. Extending the robot skillset to novel tasks involves gathering an extensive amount of training data for additional tasks. In this paper, we address the problem of teaching new tasks to robots using human demonstration videos for repetitive tasks (e.g., packing). This task requires understanding the human video to identify which object is being manipulated (the pick object) and where it is being placed (the placement slot). In addition, it needs to re-identify the pick object and the placement slots during inference along with the relative poses to enable robot execution of the task. To tackle this, we propose SLeRP, a modular system that leverages several advanced visual foundation models and a novel slot-level placement detector Slot-Net, eliminating the need for expensive video demonstrations for training. We evaluate our system using a new benchmark of real-world videos. The evaluation results show that SLeRP outperforms several baselines and can be deployed on a real robot.

### VideoScene: Distilling Video Diffusion Model to Generate 3D Scenes in   One Step
**Authors**: Hanyang Wang, Fangfu Liu, Jiawei Chi, Yueqi Duan

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:59:21Z

**Summary**: Recovering 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging task due to its inherent ill-posed problem. Conventional methods have developed specialized solutions (e.g., geometry regularization or feed-forward deterministic model) to mitigate the issue. However, they still suffer from performance degradation by minimal overlap across input views with insufficient visual information. Fortunately, recent video generative models show promise in addressing this challenge as they are capable of generating video clips with plausible 3D structures. Powered by large pretrained video diffusion models, some pioneering research start to explore the potential of video generative prior and create 3D scenes from sparse views. Despite impressive improvements, they are limited by slow inference time and the lack of 3D constraint, leading to inefficiencies and reconstruction artifacts that do not align with real-world geometry structure. In this paper, we propose VideoScene to distill the video diffusion model to generate 3D scenes in one step, aiming to build an efficient and effective tool to bridge the gap from video to 3D. Specifically, we design a 3D-aware leap flow distillation strategy to leap over time-consuming redundant information and train a dynamic denoising policy network to adaptively determine the optimal leap timestep during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VideoScene achieves faster and superior 3D scene generation results than previous video diffusion models, highlighting its potential as an efficient tool for future video to 3D applications.

### The LLM Wears Prada: Analysing Gender Bias and Stereotypes through   Online Shopping Data
**Authors**: Massimiliano Luca, Ciro Beneduce, Bruno Lepri, Jacopo Staiano

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:56:08Z

**Summary**: With the wide and cross-domain adoption of Large Language Models, it becomes crucial to assess to which extent the statistical correlations in training data, which underlie their impressive performance, hide subtle and potentially troubling biases. Gender bias in LLMs has been widely investigated from the perspectives of works, hobbies, and emotions typically associated with a specific gender. In this study, we introduce a novel perspective. We investigate whether LLMs can predict an individual's gender based solely on online shopping histories and whether these predictions are influenced by gender biases and stereotypes. Using a dataset of historical online purchases from users in the United States, we evaluate the ability of six LLMs to classify gender and we then analyze their reasoning and products-gender co-occurrences. Results indicate that while models can infer gender with moderate accuracy, their decisions are often rooted in stereotypical associations between product categories and gender. Furthermore, explicit instructions to avoid bias reduce the certainty of model predictions, but do not eliminate stereotypical patterns. Our findings highlight the persistent nature of gender biases in LLMs and emphasize the need for robust bias-mitigation strategies.

### OpenCodeReasoning: Advancing Data Distillation for Competitive Coding
**Authors**: Wasi Uddin Ahmad, Sean Narenthiran, Somshubra Majumdar, Aleksander Ficek, Siddhartha Jain, Jocelyn Huang, Vahid Noroozi, Boris Ginsburg

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:50:31Z

**Summary**: Since the advent of reasoning-based large language models, many have found great success from distilling reasoning capabilities into student models. Such techniques have significantly bridged the gap between reasoning and standard LLMs on coding tasks. Despite this, much of the progress on distilling reasoning models remains locked behind proprietary datasets or lacks details on data curation, filtering and subsequent training. To address this, we construct a superior supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset that we use to achieve state-of-the-art coding capability results in models of various sizes. Our distilled models use only SFT to achieve 61.8% on LiveCodeBench and 24.6% on CodeContests, surpassing alternatives trained with reinforcement learning. We then perform analysis on the data sources used to construct our dataset, the impact of code execution filtering, and the importance of instruction/solution diversity. We observe that execution filtering negatively affected benchmark accuracy, leading us to prioritize instruction diversity over solution correctness. Finally, we also analyze the token efficiency and reasoning patterns utilized by these models. We will open-source these datasets and distilled models to the community.

### Critical Thinking: Which Kinds of Complexity Govern Optimal Reasoning   Length?
**Authors**: Celine Lee, Alexander M. Rush, Keyon Vafa

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:45:58Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often benefit from verbalized reasoning at inference time, but it remains unclear which aspects of task difficulty these extra reasoning tokens address. To investigate this question, we formalize a framework using deterministic finite automata (DFAs). DFAs offer a formalism through which we can characterize task complexity through measurable properties such as run length (number of reasoning steps required) and state-space size (decision complexity). We first show that across different tasks and models of different sizes and training paradigms, there exists an optimal amount of reasoning tokens such that the probability of producing a correct solution is maximized. We then investigate which properties of complexity govern this critical length: we find that task instances with longer corresponding underlying DFA runs (i.e. demand greater latent state-tracking requirements) correlate with longer reasoning lengths, but, surprisingly, that DFA size (i.e. state-space complexity) does not. We then demonstrate an implication of these findings: being able to predict the optimal number of reasoning tokens for new problems and filtering out non-optimal length answers results in consistent accuracy improvements.

### Hessian-aware Training for Enhancing DNNs Resilience to Parameter   Corruptions
**Authors**: Tahmid Hasan Prato, Seijoon Kim, Lizhong Chen, Sanghyun Hong

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:42:31Z

**Summary**: Deep neural networks are not resilient to parameter corruptions: even a single-bitwise error in their parameters in memory can cause an accuracy drop of over 10%, and in the worst cases, up to 99%. This susceptibility poses great challenges in deploying models on computing platforms, where adversaries can induce bit-flips through software or bitwise corruptions may occur naturally. Most prior work addresses this issue with hardware or system-level approaches, such as integrating additional hardware components to verify a model's integrity at inference. However, these methods have not been widely deployed as they require infrastructure or platform-wide modifications.   In this paper, we propose a new approach to addressing this issue: training models to be more resilient to bitwise corruptions to their parameters. Our approach, Hessian-aware training, promotes models with $flatter$ loss surfaces. We show that, while there have been training methods, designed to improve generalization through Hessian-based approaches, they do not enhance resilience to parameter corruptions. In contrast, models trained with our method demonstrate increased resilience to parameter corruptions, particularly with a 20$-$50% reduction in the number of bits whose individual flipping leads to a 90$-$100% accuracy drop. Moreover, we show the synergy between ours and existing hardware and system-level defenses.

### Lost in Sequence: Do Large Language Models Understand Sequential   Recommendation?
**Authors**: Sein Kim, Hongseok Kang, Kibum Kim, Jiwan Kim, Donghyun Kim, Minchul Yang, Kwangjin Oh, Julian McAuley, Chanyoung Park

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:42:03Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for recommendation thanks to their advanced textual understanding ability and context-awareness. Despite the current practice of training and evaluating LLM-based recommendation (LLM4Rec) models under a sequential recommendation scenario, we found that whether these models understand the sequential information inherent in users' item interaction sequences has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we first demonstrate through a series of experiments that existing LLM4Rec models do not fully capture sequential information both during training and inference. Then, we propose a simple yet effective LLM-based sequential recommender, called LLM-SRec, a method that enhances the integration of sequential information into LLMs by distilling the user representations extracted from a pre-trained CF-SRec model into LLMs. Our extensive experiments show that LLM-SRec enhances LLMs' ability to understand users' item interaction sequences, ultimately leading to improved recommendation performance. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM4Rec models that require fine-tuning of LLMs, LLM-SRec achieves state-of-the-art performance by training only a few lightweight MLPs, highlighting its practicality in real-world applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/Sein-Kim/LLM-SRec.

### Review, Refine, Repeat: Understanding Iterative Decoding of AI Agents   with Dynamic Evaluation and Selection
**Authors**: Souradip Chakraborty, Mohammadreza Pourreza, Ruoxi Sun, Yiwen Song, Nino Scherrer, Jindong Gu, Furong Huang, Amrit Singh Bedi, Ahmad Beirami, Hamid Palangi, Tomas Pfister

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:40:47Z

**Summary**: While AI agents have shown remarkable performance at various tasks, they still struggle with complex multi-modal applications, structured generation and strategic planning. Improvements via standard fine-tuning is often impractical, as solving agentic tasks usually relies on black box API access without control over model parameters. Inference-time methods such as Best-of-N (BON) sampling offer a simple yet effective alternative to improve performance. However, BON lacks iterative feedback integration mechanism. Hence, we propose Iterative Agent Decoding (IAD) which combines iterative refinement with dynamic candidate evaluation and selection guided by a verifier. IAD differs in how feedback is designed and integrated, specifically optimized to extract maximal signal from reward scores. We conduct a detailed comparison of baselines across key metrics on Sketch2Code, Text2SQL, and Webshop where IAD consistently outperforms baselines, achieving 3--6% absolute gains on Sketch2Code and Text2SQL (with and without LLM judges) and 8--10% gains on Webshop across multiple metrics. To better understand the source of IAD's gains, we perform controlled experiments to disentangle the effect of adaptive feedback from stochastic sampling, and find that IAD's improvements are primarily driven by verifier-guided refinement, not merely sampling diversity. We also show that both IAD and BON exhibit inference-time scaling with increased compute when guided by an optimal verifier. Our analysis highlights the critical role of verifier quality in effective inference-time optimization and examines the impact of noisy and sparse rewards on scaling behavior. Together, these findings offer key insights into the trade-offs and principles of effective inference-time optimization.

### A thorough benchmark of automatic text classification: From traditional   approaches to large language models
**Authors**: Washington Cunha, Leonardo Rocha, Marcos André Gonçalves

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:40:08Z

**Summary**: Automatic text classification (ATC) has experienced remarkable advancements in the past decade, best exemplified by recent small and large language models (SLMs and LLMs), leveraged by Transformer architectures. Despite recent effectiveness improvements, a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis investigating whether the effectiveness gains of these recent approaches compensate their much higher costs when compared to more traditional text classification approaches such as SVMs and Logistic Regression is still missing in the literature. In this context, this work's main contributions are twofold: (i) we provide a scientifically sound comparative analysis of the cost-benefit of twelve traditional and recent ATC solutions including five open LLMs, and (ii) a large benchmark comprising {22 datasets}, including sentiment analysis and topic classification, with their (train-validation-test) partitions based on folded cross-validation procedures, along with documentation, and code. The release of code, data, and documentation enables the community to replicate experiments and advance the field in a more scientifically sound manner. Our comparative experimental results indicate that LLMs outperform traditional approaches (up to 26%-7.1% on average) and SLMs (up to 4.9%-1.9% on average) in terms of effectiveness. However, LLMs incur significantly higher computational costs due to fine-tuning, being, on average 590x and 8.5x slower than traditional methods and SLMs, respectively. Results suggests the following recommendations: (1) LLMs for applications that require the best possible effectiveness and can afford the costs; (2) traditional methods such as Logistic Regression and SVM for resource-limited applications or those that cannot afford the cost of tuning large LLMs; and (3) SLMs like Roberta for near-optimal effectiveness-efficiency trade-off.

### Is the Reversal Curse a Binding Problem? Uncovering Limitations of   Transformers from a Basic Generalization Failure
**Authors**: Boshi Wang, Huan Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:38:03Z

**Summary**: Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs exhibit a basic generalization failure known as the Reversal Curse, where they struggle to learn reversible factual associations. Understanding why this occurs could help identify weaknesses in current models and advance their generalization and robustness. In this paper, we conjecture that the Reversal Curse in LLMs is a manifestation of the long-standing binding problem in cognitive science, neuroscience and AI. Specifically, we identify two primary causes of the Reversal Curse stemming from transformers' limitations in conceptual binding: the inconsistency and entanglements of concept representations. We perform a series of experiments that support these conjectures. Our exploration leads to a model design based on JEPA (Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture) that for the first time breaks the Reversal Curse without side-stepping it with specialized data augmentation or non-causal masking, and moreover, generalization could be further improved by incorporating special memory layers that support disentangled concept representations. We demonstrate that the skill of reversal unlocks a new kind of memory integration that enables models to solve large-scale arithmetic reasoning problems via parametric forward-chaining, outperforming frontier LLMs based on non-parametric memory and prolonged explicit reasoning.

### Gen-C: Populating Virtual Worlds with Generative Crowds
**Authors**: Andreas Panayiotou, Panayiotis Charalambous, Ioannis Karamouzas

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:33:53Z

**Summary**: Over the past two decades, researchers have made significant advancements in simulating human crowds, yet these efforts largely focus on low-level tasks like collision avoidance and a narrow range of behaviors such as path following and flocking. However, creating compelling crowd scenes demands more than just functional movement-it requires capturing high-level interactions between agents, their environment, and each other over time. To address this issue, we introduce Gen-C, a generative model to automate the task of authoring high-level crowd behaviors. Gen-C bypasses the labor-intensive and challenging task of collecting and annotating real crowd video data by leveraging a large language model (LLM) to generate a limited set of crowd scenarios, which are subsequently expanded and generalized through simulations to construct time-expanded graphs that model the actions and interactions of virtual agents. Our method employs two Variational Graph Auto-Encoders guided by a condition prior network: one dedicated to learning a latent space for graph structures (agent interactions) and the other for node features (agent actions and navigation). This setup enables the flexible generation of dynamic crowd interactions. The trained model can be conditioned on natural language, empowering users to synthesize novel crowd behaviors from text descriptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in two scenarios, a University Campus and a Train Station, showcasing its potential for populating diverse virtual environments with agents exhibiting varied and dynamic behaviors that reflect complex interactions and high-level decision-making patterns.

**Authors**: Baban Gain, Dibyanayan Bandyopadhyay, Asif Ekbal

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:26:40Z

**Summary**: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly reshaped the landscape of machine translation (MT), particularly for low-resource languages and domains that lack sufficient parallel corpora, linguistic tools, and computational infrastructure. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of recent progress in leveraging LLMs for MT. We analyze techniques such as few-shot prompting, cross-lingual transfer, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning that enable effective adaptation to under-resourced settings. The paper also explores synthetic data generation strategies using LLMs, including back-translation and lexical augmentation. Additionally, we compare LLM-based translation with traditional encoder-decoder models across diverse language pairs, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each. We discuss persistent challenges such as hallucinations, evaluation inconsistencies, and inherited biases while also evaluating emerging LLM-driven metrics for translation quality. This survey offers practical insights and outlines future directions for building robust, inclusive, and scalable MT systems in the era of large-scale generative models.

**Authors**: Miguel Romero Rosas, Miguel Torres Sanchez, Rudolf Eigenmann

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:22:18Z

**Summary**: Traditional optimizing compilers have played an important role in adapting to the growing complexity of modern software systems. The need for efficient parallel programming in current architectures requires strong optimization techniques. The beginning of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises intriguing questions about the potential of these AI approaches to revolutionize code optimization methodologies. This work aims to answer an essential question for the compiler community: "Can AI-driven models revolutionize the way we approach code optimization?".   To address this question, we present a comparative analysis between three classical optimizing compilers and two recent large language models, evaluating their respective abilities and limitations in optimizing code for maximum efficiency. In addition, we introduce a benchmark suite of challenging optimization patterns and an automatic mechanism for evaluating the performance and correctness of the code generated by LLMs. We used three different prompting strategies to evaluate the performance of the LLMs, Simple Instruction (IP), Detailed Instruction Prompting (DIP), and Chain of Thought (CoT).   A key finding is that while LLMs have the potential to outperform current optimizing compilers, they often generate incorrect code on large code sizes, calling for automated verification methods. In addition, expressing a compiler strategy as part of the LLMs prompt substantially improves its overall performance. Our evaluation across three benchmark suites shows CodeLlama-70B as the superior LLM, capable of achieving speedups of up to x1.75. Additionally, CETUS is the best among the current optimizing compilers, achieving a maximum speedup of 1.67x. We also found substantial differences among the three prompting strategies.

### Representing Flow Fields with Divergence-Free Kernels for Reconstruction
**Authors**: Xingyu Ni, Jingrui Xing, Xingqiao Li, Bin Wang, Baoquan Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:13:59Z

**Summary**: Accurately reconstructing continuous flow fields from sparse or indirect measurements remains an open challenge, as existing techniques often suffer from oversmoothing artifacts, reliance on heterogeneous architectures, and the computational burden of enforcing physics-informed losses in implicit neural representations (INRs). In this paper, we introduce a novel flow field reconstruction framework based on divergence-free kernels (DFKs), which inherently enforce incompressibility while capturing fine structures without relying on hierarchical or heterogeneous representations. Through qualitative analysis and quantitative ablation studies, we identify the matrix-valued radial basis functions derived from Wendland's $\mathcal{C}^4$ polynomial (DFKs-Wen4) as the optimal form of analytically divergence-free approximation for velocity fields, owing to their favorable numerical properties, including compact support, positive definiteness, and second-order differentiablility. Experiments across various reconstruction tasks, spanning data compression, inpainting, super-resolution, and time-continuous flow inference, has demonstrated that DFKs-Wen4 outperform INRs and other divergence-free representations in both reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency while requiring the fewest trainable parameters.

### Advancing AI-Scientist Understanding: Making LLM Think Like a Physicist   with Interpretable Reasoning
**Authors**: Yinggan Xu, Hana Kimlee, Yijia Xiao, Di Luo

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:13:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing an expanding role in physics research by enhancing reasoning, symbolic manipulation, and numerical computation. However, ensuring the reliability and interpretability of their outputs remains a significant challenge. In our framework, we conceptualize the collaboration between AI and human scientists as a dynamic interplay among three modules: the reasoning module, the interpretation module, and the AI-scientist interaction module. Recognizing that effective physics reasoning demands rigorous logical consistency, quantitative precision, and deep integration with established theoretical models, we introduce the interpretation module to improve the understanding of AI-generated outputs, which is not previously explored in the literature. This module comprises multiple specialized agents, including summarizers, model builders, UI builders, and testers, which collaboratively structure LLM outputs within a physically grounded framework, by constructing a more interpretable science model. A case study demonstrates that our approach enhances transparency, facilitates validation, and strengthens AI-augmented reasoning in scientific discovery.

### Build Code Needs Maintenance Too: A Study on Refactoring and Technical   Debt in Build Systems
**Authors**: Anwar Ghammam, Dhia Elhaq Rzig, Mohamed Almukhtar, Rania Khalsi, Foyzul Hassan, Marouane Kessentini

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:07:38Z

**Summary**: In modern software engineering, build systems play the crucial role of facilitating the conversion of source code into software artifacts. Recent research has explored high-level causes of build failures, but has largely overlooked the structural properties of build files. Akin to source code, build systems face technical debt challenges that hinder maintenance and optimization. While refactoring is often seen as a key tool for addressing technical debt in source code, there is a significant research gap regarding the specific refactoring changes developers apply to build code and whether these refactorings effectively address technical debt. In this paper, we address this gap by examining refactorings applied to build scripts in open-source projects, covering the widely used build systems of Gradle, Ant, and Maven. Additionally, we investigate whether these refactorings are used to tackle technical debts in build systems. Our analysis was conducted on \totalCommits examined build-file-related commits. We identified \totalRefactoringCategories build-related refactorings, which we divided into \totalCategories main categories. These refactorings are organized into the first empirically derived taxonomy of build system refactorings. Furthermore, we investigate how developers employ these refactoring types to address technical debts via a manual commit-analysis and a developer survey. In this context, we identified \totalTechnicalDebts technical debts addressed by these refactorings and discussed their correlation with the different refactorings. Finally, we introduce BuildRefMiner, an LLM-powered tool leveraging GPT-4o to automate the detection of refactorings within build systems. We evaluated its performance and found that it achieves an F1 score of \toolFoneScore across all build systems.

### STAR-1: Safer Alignment of Reasoning LLMs with 1K Data
**Authors**: Zijun Wang, Haoqin Tu, Yuhan Wang, Juncheng Wu, Jieru Mei, Brian R. Bartoldson, Bhavya Kailkhura, Cihang Xie

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:04:04Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces STAR-1, a high-quality, just-1k-scale safety dataset specifically designed for large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1. Built on three core principles -- diversity, deliberative reasoning, and rigorous filtering -- STAR-1 aims to address the critical needs for safety alignment in LRMs. Specifically, we begin by integrating existing open-source safety datasets from diverse sources. Then, we curate safety policies to generate policy-grounded deliberative reasoning samples. Lastly, we apply a GPT-4o-based safety scoring system to select training examples aligned with best practices. Experimental results show that fine-tuning LRMs with STAR-1 leads to an average 40% improvement in safety performance across four benchmarks, while only incurring a marginal decrease (e.g., an average of 1.1%) in reasoning ability measured across five reasoning tasks. Extensive ablation studies further validate the importance of our design principles in constructing STAR-1 and analyze its efficacy across both LRMs and traditional LLMs. Our project page is https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/STAR-1.

### Multilingual European Language Models: Benchmarking Approaches and   Challenges
**Authors**: Fabio Barth, Georg Rehm

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:57:12Z

**Summary**: The breakthrough of generative large language models (LLMs) that can solve different tasks through chat interaction has led to a significant increase in the use of general benchmarks to assess the quality or performance of these models beyond individual applications. There is also a need for better methods to evaluate and also to compare models due to the ever increasing number of new models published. However, most of the established benchmarks revolve around the English language. This paper analyses the benefits and limitations of current evaluation datasets, focusing on multilingual European benchmarks. We analyse seven multilingual benchmarks and identify four major challenges. Furthermore, we discuss potential solutions to enhance translation quality and mitigate cultural biases, including human-in-the-loop verification and iterative translation ranking. Our analysis highlights the need for culturally aware and rigorously validated benchmarks to assess the reasoning and question-answering capabilities of multilingual LLMs accurately.

### Multi-fidelity Parameter Estimation Using Conditional Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Caroline Tatsuoka, Minglei Yang, Dongbin Xiu, Guannan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:54:47Z

**Summary**: We present a multi-fidelity method for uncertainty quantification of parameter estimates in complex systems, leveraging generative models trained to sample the target conditional distribution. In the Bayesian inference setting, traditional parameter estimation methods rely on repeated simulations of potentially expensive forward models to determine the posterior distribution of the parameter values, which may result in computationally intractable workflows. Furthermore, methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) necessitate rerunning the entire algorithm for each new data observation, further increasing the computational burden. Hence, we propose a novel method for efficiently obtaining posterior distributions of parameter estimates for high-fidelity models given data observations of interest. The method first constructs a low-fidelity, conditional generative model capable of amortized Bayesian inference and hence rapid posterior density approximation over a wide-range of data observations. When higher accuracy is needed for a specific data observation, the method employs adaptive refinement of the density approximation. It uses outputs from the low-fidelity generative model to refine the parameter sampling space, ensuring efficient use of the computationally expensive high-fidelity solver. Subsequently, a high-fidelity, unconditional generative model is trained to achieve greater accuracy in the target posterior distribution. Both low- and high- fidelity generative models enable efficient sampling from the target posterior and do not require repeated simulation of the high-fidelity forward model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on several numerical examples, including cases with multi-modal densities, as well as an application in plasma physics for a runaway electron simulation model.

### Granger causal inference for climate change attribution
**Authors**: Mark D. Risser, Mohammed Ombadi, Michael F. Wehner

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:50:31Z

**Summary**: Climate change detection and attribution (D&A) is concerned with determining the extent to which anthropogenic activities have influenced specific aspects of the global climate system. D&A fits within the broader field of causal inference, the collection of statistical methods that identify cause and effect relationships. There are a wide variety of methods for making attribution statements, each of which require different types of input data and each of which are conditional to varying extents. Some methods are based on Pearl causality (experimental interference) while others leverage Granger (predictive) causality, and the causal framing provides important context for how the resulting attribution conclusion should be interpreted. However, while Granger-causal attribution analyses have become more common, there is no clear statement of their strengths and weaknesses and no clear consensus on where and when Granger-causal perspectives are appropriate. In this prospective paper, we provide a formal definition for Granger-based approaches to trend and event attribution and a clear comparison with more traditional methods for assessing the human influence on extreme weather and climate events. Broadly speaking, Granger-causal attribution statements can be constructed quickly from observations and do not require computationally-intesive dynamical experiments. These analyses also enable rapid attribution, which is useful in the aftermath of a severe weather event, and provide multiple lines of evidence for anthropogenic climate change when paired with Pearl-causal attribution. Confidence in attribution statements is increased when different methodologies arrive at similar conclusions. Moving forward, we encourage the D&A community to embrace hybrid approaches to climate change attribution that leverage the strengths of both Granger and Pearl causality.

### TransientTables: Evaluating LLMs' Reasoning on Temporally Evolving   Semi-structured Tables
**Authors**: Abhilash Shankarampeta, Harsh Mahajan, Tushar Kataria, Dan Roth, Vivek Gupta

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:34:43Z

**Summary**: Humans continuously make new discoveries, and understanding temporal sequence of events leading to these breakthroughs is essential for advancing science and society. This ability to reason over time allows us to identify future steps and understand the effects of financial and political decisions on our lives. However, large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on static datasets, limiting their ability to perform effective temporal reasoning. To assess the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we present the TRANSIENTTABLES dataset, which comprises 3,971 questions derived from over 14,000 tables, spanning 1,238 entities across multiple time periods. We introduce a template-based question-generation pipeline that harnesses LLMs to refine both templates and questions. Additionally, we establish baseline results using state-of-the-art LLMs to create a benchmark. We also introduce novel modeling strategies centered around task decomposition, enhancing LLM performance.

### CoMatcher: Multi-View Collaborative Feature Matching
**Authors**: Jintao Zhang, Zimin Xia, Mingyue Dong, Shuhan Shen, Linwei Yue, Xianwei Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:27:44Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a multi-view collaborative matching strategy for reliable track construction in complex scenarios. We observe that the pairwise matching paradigms applied to image set matching often result in ambiguous estimation when the selected independent pairs exhibit significant occlusions or extreme viewpoint changes. This challenge primarily stems from the inherent uncertainty in interpreting intricate 3D structures based on limited two-view observations, as the 3D-to-2D projection leads to significant information loss. To address this, we introduce CoMatcher, a deep multi-view matcher to (i) leverage complementary context cues from different views to form a holistic 3D scene understanding and (ii) utilize cross-view projection consistency to infer a reliable global solution. Building on CoMatcher, we develop a groupwise framework that fully exploits cross-view relationships for large-scale matching tasks. Extensive experiments on various complex scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method over the mainstream two-view matching paradigm.

### Interpreting Emergent Planning in Model-Free Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Thomas Bush, Stephen Chung, Usman Anwar, Adrià Garriga-Alonso, David Krueger

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:24:23Z

**Summary**: We present the first mechanistic evidence that model-free reinforcement learning agents can learn to plan. This is achieved by applying a methodology based on concept-based interpretability to a model-free agent in Sokoban -- a commonly used benchmark for studying planning. Specifically, we demonstrate that DRC, a generic model-free agent introduced by Guez et al. (2019), uses learned concept representations to internally formulate plans that both predict the long-term effects of actions on the environment and influence action selection. Our methodology involves: (1) probing for planning-relevant concepts, (2) investigating plan formation within the agent's representations, and (3) verifying that discovered plans (in the agent's representations) have a causal effect on the agent's behavior through interventions. We also show that the emergence of these plans coincides with the emergence of a planning-like property: the ability to benefit from additional test-time compute. Finally, we perform a qualitative analysis of the planning algorithm learned by the agent and discover a strong resemblance to parallelized bidirectional search. Our findings advance understanding of the internal mechanisms underlying planning behavior in agents, which is important given the recent trend of emergent planning and reasoning capabilities in LLMs through RL

### Automate Strategy Finding with LLM in Quant Investment
**Authors**: Zhizhuo Kou, Holam Yu, Junyu Luo, Jingshu Peng, Lei Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:21:22Z

**Summary**: Despite significant progress in deep learning for financial trading, existing models often face instability and high uncertainty, hindering their practical application. Leveraging advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-agent architectures, we propose a novel framework for quantitative stock investment in portfolio management and alpha mining. Our framework addresses these issues by integrating LLMs to generate diversified alphas and employing a multi-agent approach to dynamically evaluate market conditions. This paper proposes a framework where large language models (LLMs) mine alpha factors from multimodal financial data, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics. The first module extracts predictive signals by integrating numerical data, research papers, and visual charts. The second module uses ensemble learning to construct a diverse pool of trading agents with varying risk preferences, enhancing strategy performance through a broader market analysis. In the third module, a dynamic weight-gating mechanism selects and assigns weights to the most relevant agents based on real-time market conditions, enabling the creation of an adaptive and context-aware composite alpha formula. Extensive experiments on the Chinese stock markets demonstrate that this framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple financial metrics. The results underscore the efficacy of combining LLM-generated alphas with a multi-agent architecture to achieve superior trading performance and stability. This work highlights the potential of AI-driven approaches in enhancing quantitative investment strategies and sets a new benchmark for integrating advanced machine learning techniques in financial trading can also be applied on diverse markets.

### From Code Generation to Software Testing: AI Copilot with Context-Based   RAG
**Authors**: Yuchen Wang, Shangxin Guo, Chee Wei Tan

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:20:05Z

**Summary**: The rapid pace of large-scale software development places increasing demands on traditional testing methodologies, often leading to bottlenecks in efficiency, accuracy, and coverage. We propose a novel perspective on software testing by positing bug detection and coding with fewer bugs as two interconnected problems that share a common goal, which is reducing bugs with limited resources. We extend our previous work on AI-assisted programming, which supports code auto-completion and chatbot-powered Q&A, to the realm of software testing. We introduce Copilot for Testing, an automated testing system that synchronizes bug detection with codebase updates, leveraging context-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Our evaluation demonstrates a 31.2% improvement in bug detection accuracy, a 12.6% increase in critical test coverage, and a 10.5% higher user acceptance rate, highlighting the transformative potential of AI-driven technologies in modern software development practices.

### Large Language Model Can Transcribe Speech in Multi-Talker Scenarios   with Versatile Instructions
**Authors**: Lingwei Meng, Shujie Hu, Jiawen Kang, Zhaoqing Li, Yuejiao Wang, Wenxuan Wu, Xixin Wu, Xunying Liu, Helen Meng

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:16:33Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, bringing significant progress and new opportunities. Despite progress in speech-related tasks, LLMs have not been sufficiently explored in multi-talker scenarios. In this work, we present a pioneering effort to investigate the capability of LLMs in transcribing speech in multi-talker environments, following versatile instructions related to multi-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR), target talker ASR, and ASR based on specific talker attributes such as sex, occurrence order, language, and keyword spoken. Our approach utilizes WavLM and Whisper encoder to extract multi-faceted speech representations that are sensitive to speaker characteristics and semantic context. These representations are then fed into an LLM fine-tuned using LoRA, enabling the capabilities for speech comprehension and transcription. Comprehensive experiments reveal the promising performance of our proposed system, MT-LLM, in cocktail party scenarios, highlighting the potential of LLM to handle speech-related tasks based on user instructions in such complex settings. The code, model, and samples are available at https://github.com/cuhealthybrains/MT-LLM.

### Investigating the Variable Continuum Lags in PG 2130+099
**Authors**: Jake A. Miller, Edward M. Cackett, Mike Goad, Kirk T. Korista

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:10:36Z

**Summary**: Broadband photometric reverberation mapping (RM) provides a measure of the size of the continuum-emitting region in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous monitoring campaigns of PG 2130+099 disagree as to whether the continuum emitting region size is consistent with that predicted for a standard optically thick geometrically thin accretion disk. We present $\sim$6 months of observations from several robotic telescopes, providing the highest cadence and widest wavelength coverage photometric RM study of PG 2130+099 to date. Our results indicate that inferred size of the continuum-emitting region in PG 2130+099, like many recently observed AGN, is larger than the simplest predictions for an irradiated geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk. We also perform a flux-flux analysis, finding a variable spectrum broadly consistent with a disk, and a constant component with enhanced $\textit{i}$-band emission, potentially due to H$\alpha$. We find some evidence of increasing lag with luminosity, but previous lag measurements are too uncertain to be definitive.

### Cross-Lingual Consistency: A Novel Inference Framework for Advancing   Reasoning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhiwei Yu, Tuo Li, Changhong Wang, Hui Chen, Lang Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:09:39Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-thought (CoT) has emerged as a critical mechanism for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), with self-consistency demonstrating notable promise in boosting performance. However, inherent linguistic biases in multilingual training corpora frequently cause semantic drift and logical inconsistencies, especially in sub-10B parameter LLMs handling complex inference tasks. To overcome these constraints, we propose the Cross-Lingual Consistency (CLC) framework, an innovative inference paradigm that integrates multilingual reasoning paths through majority voting to elevate LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Empirical evaluations on the CMATH dataset reveal CLC's superiority over the conventional self-consistency method, delivering 9.5%, 6.5%, and 6.0% absolute accuracy gains for DeepSeek-Math-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct, and Gemma2-9B-Instruct respectively. Expanding CLC's linguistic scope to 11 diverse languages implies two synergistic benefits: 1) neutralizing linguistic biases in multilingual training corpora through multilingual ensemble voting, 2) escaping monolingual reasoning traps by exploring the broader multilingual solution space. This dual benefits empirically enables more globally optimal reasoning paths compared to monolingual self-consistency baselines, as evidenced by the 4.1%-18.5% accuracy gains using Gemma2-9B-Instruct on the MGSM dataset.

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:04:22Z

**Summary**: We present a comprehensive analysis of the MIRI Extremely Red Object Virgil, a Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter at $z_{spec} = 6.6379 \pm 0.0035$ with the photometric properties of a Little Red Dot. Leveraging new JWST/MIRI imaging from the MIDIS and PAHSPECS programs, we confirm Virgil's extraordinary nature among galaxies in JADES/GOODS-South, exhibiting a strikingly red NIRCam-to-MIRI color (F444W $-$ F1500W = $2.84\pm0.04$~mag). Deep NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy from the OASIS program offers key insights into the host galaxy, revealing properties of an average star-forming galaxy during Cosmic Reionization, such as a subsolar metallicity, low-to-moderate dust content, and a relatively high ionization parameter and electron temperature. By estimating the star formation rate of Virgil from UV and H$\alpha$, we find evidence that the galaxy is either entering or fading out of a bursty episode. Although line-ratio diagnostics employed at high-$z$ would classify Virgil as an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), this classification becomes ambiguous once redshift evolution is considered. Nonetheless, Virgil occupies the same parameter space as recently confirmed AGNs at similar redshifts. The new deep MIRI data at 15~$\mu$m reinforce the AGN nature of Virgil, as inferred from multiple spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes. Virgil's rising infrared SED and UV excess resemble those of Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) studied with Spitzer at Cosmic Noon, particularly blue-excess HotDOGs. Our results highlight the need for a multi-wavelength approach incorporating MIRI to uncover such extreme sources at $z\gtrsim6$ and to shed light on the interplay between galaxy evolution and early black hole growth during Cosmic Reionization.

### Code Red! On the Harmfulness of Applying Off-the-shelf Large Language   Models to Programming Tasks
**Authors**: Ali Al-Kaswan, Sebastian Deatc, Begüm Koç, Arie van Deursen, Maliheh Izadi

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:00:14Z

**Summary**: Nowadays, developers increasingly rely on solutions powered by Large Language Models (LLM) to assist them with their coding tasks. This makes it crucial to align these tools with human values to prevent malicious misuse. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for assessing the potential harmfulness of LLMs within the software engineering domain. We begin by developing a taxonomy of potentially harmful software engineering scenarios and subsequently, create a dataset of prompts based on this taxonomy. To systematically assess the responses, we design and validate an automatic evaluator that classifies the outputs of a variety of LLMs both open-source and closed-source models, as well as general-purpose and code-specific LLMs. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of models size, architecture family, and alignment strategies on their tendency to generate harmful content. The results show significant disparities in the alignment of various LLMs for harmlessness. We find that some models and model families, such as Openhermes, are more harmful than others and that code-specific models do not perform better than their general-purpose counterparts. Notably, some fine-tuned models perform significantly worse than their base-models due to their design choices. On the other side, we find that larger models tend to be more helpful and are less likely to respond with harmful information. These results highlight the importance of targeted alignment strategies tailored to the unique challenges of software engineering tasks and provide a foundation for future work in this critical area.

**Summary**: We introduce PaperBench, a benchmark evaluating the ability of AI agents to replicate state-of-the-art AI research. Agents must replicate 20 ICML 2024 Spotlight and Oral papers from scratch, including understanding paper contributions, developing a codebase, and successfully executing experiments. For objective evaluation, we develop rubrics that hierarchically decompose each replication task into smaller sub-tasks with clear grading criteria. In total, PaperBench contains 8,316 individually gradable tasks. Rubrics are co-developed with the author(s) of each ICML paper for accuracy and realism. To enable scalable evaluation, we also develop an LLM-based judge to automatically grade replication attempts against rubrics, and assess our judge's performance by creating a separate benchmark for judges. We evaluate several frontier models on PaperBench, finding that the best-performing tested agent, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New) with open-source scaffolding, achieves an average replication score of 21.0\%. Finally, we recruit top ML PhDs to attempt a subset of PaperBench, finding that models do not yet outperform the human baseline. We \href{https://github.com/openai/preparedness}{open-source our code} to facilitate future research in understanding the AI engineering capabilities of AI agents.

**Summary**: Recently, building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to enhance the capability of large language models (LLMs) has become a common practice. Especially in the legal domain, previous judicial decisions play a significant role under the doctrine of stare decisis which emphasizes the importance of making decisions based on (retrieved) prior documents. However, the overall performance of RAG system depends on many components: (1) retrieval corpora, (2) retrieval algorithms, (3) rerankers, (4) LLM backbones, and (5) evaluation metrics. Here we propose LRAGE, an open-source tool for holistic evaluation of RAG systems focusing on the legal domain. LRAGE provides GUI and CLI interfaces to facilitate seamless experiments and investigate how changes in the aforementioned five components affect the overall accuracy. We validated LRAGE using multilingual legal benches including Korean (KBL), English (LegalBench), and Chinese (LawBench) by demonstrating how the overall accuracy changes when varying the five components mentioned above. The source code is available at https://github.com/hoorangyee/LRAGE.

### Estimating hazard rates from $δ$-records in discrete distributions
**Authors**: Martín Alcalde, Miguel Lafuente, F. Javier López, Lina Maldonado, Gerardo Sanz

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T15:43:19Z

**Summary**: This paper focuses on nonparametric statistical inference of the hazard rate function of discrete distributions based on $\delta$-record data. We derive the explicit expression of the maximum likelihood estimator and determine its exact distribution, as well as some important characteristics such as its bias and mean squared error. We then discuss the construction of confidence intervals and goodness-of-fit tests. The performance of our proposals is evaluated using simulation methods. Applications to real data are given, as well. The estimation of the hazard rate function based on usual records has been studied in the literature, although many procedures require several samples of records. In contrast, our approach relies on a single sequence of $\delta$-records, simplifying the experimental design and increasing the applicability of the methods.

**Authors**: Sumuk Shashidhar, Clémentine Fourrier, Alina Lozovskia, Thomas Wolf, Gokhan Tur, Dilek Hakkani-Tür

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T15:40:24Z

**Summary**: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) effectively remains a critical bottleneck, as traditional static benchmarks suffer from saturation and contamination, while human evaluations are costly and slow. This hinders timely or domain-specific assessment, crucial for real-world applications. We introduce YourBench, a novel, open-source framework that addresses these limitations by enabling dynamic, automated generation of reliable, up-to-date, and domain-tailored benchmarks cheaply and without manual annotation, directly from user-provided documents. We demonstrate its efficacy by replicating 7 diverse MMLU subsets using minimal source text, achieving this for under 15 USD in total inference costs while perfectly preserving the relative model performance rankings (Spearman Rho = 1) observed on the original benchmark. To ensure that YourBench generates data grounded in provided input instead of relying on posterior parametric knowledge in models, we also introduce Tempora-0325, a novel dataset of over 7K diverse documents, published exclusively after March 2025. Our comprehensive analysis spans 26 SoTA models from 7 major families across varying scales (3-671B parameters) to validate the quality of generated evaluations through rigorous algorithmic checks (e.g., citation grounding) and human assessments. We release the YourBench library, the Tempora-0325 dataset, 150k+ question answer pairs based on Tempora and all evaluation and inference traces to facilitate reproducible research and empower the community to generate bespoke benchmarks on demand, fostering more relevant and trustworthy LLM evaluation.

### Neural Network-based model of galaxy power spectrum: Fast full-shape   galaxy power spectrum analysis
**Authors**: Svyatoslav Trusov, Pauline Zarrouk, Shaun Cole

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T15:34:17Z

**Summary**: We present a Neural Network based emulator for the galaxy redshift-space power spectrum that enables several orders of magnitude acceleration in the galaxy clustering parameter inference, while preserving 3$\sigma$ accuracy better than 0.5\% up to $k_{\mathrm{max}}$=0.25$h^{-1}Mpc$ within $\Lambda$CDM and around 0.5\% $w_0$-$w_a$CDM. Our surrogate model only emulates the galaxy bias-invariant terms of 1-loop perturbation theory predictions, these terms are then combined analytically with galaxy bias terms, counter-terms and stochastic terms in order to obtain the non-linear redshift space galaxy power spectrum. This allows us to avoid any galaxy bias prescription in the training of the emulator, which makes it more flexible. Moreover, we include the redshift $z \in [0,1.4]$ in the training which further avoids the need for re-training the emulator. We showcase the performance of the emulator in recovering the cosmological parameters of $\Lambda$CDM by analysing the suite of 25 AbacusSummit simulations that mimic the DESI Luminous Red Galaxies at $z=0.5$ and $z=0.8$, together as the Emission Line Galaxies at $z=0.8$. We obtain similar performance in all cases, demonstrating the reliability of the emulator for any galaxy sample at any redshift in $0 < z < 1.4$

### Can A Society of Generative Agents Simulate Human Behavior and Inform   Public Health Policy? A Case Study on Vaccine Hesitancy
**Authors**: Abe Bohan Hou, Hongru Du, Yichen Wang, Jingyu Zhang, Zixiao Wang, Paul Pu Liang, Daniel Khashabi, Lauren Gardner, Tianxing He

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T15:30:46Z

**Summary**: Can we simulate a sandbox society with generative agents to model human behavior, thereby reducing the over-reliance on real human trials for assessing public policies? In this work, we investigate the feasibility of simulating health-related decision-making, using vaccine hesitancy, defined as the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccination services (MacDonald, 2015), as a case study. To this end, we introduce the VacSim framework with 100 generative agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). VacSim simulates vaccine policy outcomes with the following steps: 1) instantiate a population of agents with demographics based on census data; 2) connect the agents via a social network and model vaccine attitudes as a function of social dynamics and disease-related information; 3) design and evaluate various public health interventions aimed at mitigating vaccine hesitancy. To align with real-world results, we also introduce simulation warmup and attitude modulation to adjust agents' attitudes. We propose a series of evaluations to assess the reliability of various LLM simulations. Experiments indicate that models like Llama and Qwen can simulate aspects of human behavior but also highlight real-world alignment challenges, such as inconsistent responses with demographic profiles. This early exploration of LLM-driven simulations is not meant to serve as definitive policy guidance; instead, it serves as a call for action to examine social simulation for policy development.

### Inference of hidden common driver dynamics by anisotropic   self-organizing neural networks
**Authors**: Zsigmond Benkő, Marcell Stippinger, Zoltán Somogyvári

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T15:17:23Z

**Summary**: We are introducing a novel approach to infer the underlying dynamics of hidden common drivers, based on analyzing time series data from two driven dynamical systems. The inference relies on time-delay embedding, estimation of the intrinsic dimension of the observed systems, and their mutual dimension. A key component of our approach is a new anisotropic training technique applied to Kohonen's self-organizing map, which effectively learns the attractor of the driven system and separates it into submanifolds corresponding to the self-dynamics and shared dynamics.   To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted simulated experiments using different chaotic maps in a setup, where two chaotic maps were driven by a third map with nonlinear coupling. The inferred time series exhibited high correlation with the time series of the actual hidden common driver, in contrast to the observed systems. The quality of our reconstruction were compared and shown to be superior to several other methods that are intended to find the common features behind the observed time series, including linear methods like PCA and ICA as well as nonlinear methods like dynamical component analysis, canonical correlation analysis and even deep canonical correlation analysis.

### Non-Determinism of "Deterministic" LLM Settings
**Authors**: Berk Atil, Sarp Aykent, Alexa Chittams, Lisheng Fu, Rebecca J. Passonneau, Evan Radcliffe, Guru Rajan Rajagopal, Adam Sloan, Tomasz Tudrej, Ferhan Ture, Zhe Wu, Lixinyu Xu, Breck Baldwin

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T15:17:02Z

**Summary**: LLM (large language model) practitioners commonly notice that outputs can vary for the same inputs under settings expected to be deterministic. Yet the questions of how pervasive this is, and with what impact on results, have not to our knowledge been systematically investigated. We investigate non-determinism in five LLMs configured to be deterministic when applied to eight common tasks in across 10 runs, in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. We see accuracy variations up to 15% across naturally occurring runs with a gap of best possible performance to worst possible performance up to 70%. In fact, none of the LLMs consistently delivers repeatable accuracy across all tasks, much less identical output strings. Sharing preliminary results with insiders has revealed that non-determinism perhaps essential to the efficient use of compute resources via co-mingled data in input buffers so this issue is not going away anytime soon. To better quantify our observations, we introduce metrics focused on quantifying determinism, TARr@N for the total agreement rate at N runs over raw output, and TARa@N for total agreement rate of parsed-out answers. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/breckbaldwin/llm-stability.

### Barrier Certificates for Unknown Systems with Latent States and   Polynomial Dynamics using Bayesian Inference
**Authors**: Robert Lefringhausen, Sami Leon Noel Aziz Hanna, Elias August, Sandra Hirche

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T15:12:34Z

**Summary**: Certifying safety in dynamical systems is crucial, but barrier certificates - widely used to verify that system trajectories remain within a safe region - typically require explicit system models. When dynamics are unknown, data-driven methods can be used instead, yet obtaining a valid certificate requires rigorous uncertainty quantification. For this purpose, existing methods usually rely on full-state measurements, limiting their applicability. This paper proposes a novel approach for synthesizing barrier certificates for unknown systems with latent states and polynomial dynamics. A Bayesian framework is employed, where a prior in state-space representation is updated using input-output data via a targeted marginal Metropolis-Hastings sampler. The resulting samples are used to construct a candidate barrier certificate through a sum-of-squares program. It is shown that if the candidate satisfies the required conditions on a test set of additional samples, it is also valid for the true, unknown system with high probability. The approach and its probabilistic guarantees are illustrated through a numerical simulation.

### Quattro: Transformer-Accelerated Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator   Framework for Fast Trajectory Optimization
**Authors**: Yue Wang, Hoayu Wang, Zhaoxing Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T15:12:18Z

**Summary**: Real-time optimal control remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, especially for nonlinear systems with stringent performance requirements. As one of the representative trajectory optimization algorithms, the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) faces limitations due to their inherently sequential computational nature, which restricts the efficiency and applicability of real-time control for robotic systems. While existing parallel implementations aim to overcome the above limitations, they typically demand additional computational iterations and high-performance hardware, leading to only modest practical improvements. In this paper, we introduce Quattro, a transformer-accelerated iLQR framework employing an algorithm-hardware co-design strategy to predict intermediate feedback and feedforward matrices. It facilitates effective parallel computations on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on cart-pole and quadrotor systems show an algorithm-level acceleration of up to 5.3$\times$ and 27$\times$ per iteration, respectively. When integrated into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, Quattro achieves overall speedups of 2.8$\times$ for the cart-pole and 17.8$\times$ for the quadrotor compared to the one that applies traditional iLQR. Transformer inference is deployed on FPGA to maximize performance, achieving up to 27.3$\times$ speedup over commonly used computing devices, with around 2 to 4$\times$ power reduction and acceptable hardware overhead.

### Investigating and Scaling up Code-Switching for Multilingual Language   Model Pre-Training
**Authors**: Zhijun Wang, Jiahuan Li, Hao Zhou, Rongxiang Weng, Jingang Wang, Xin Huang, Xue Han, Junlan Feng, Chao Deng, Shujian Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T15:09:58Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable multilingual capabilities despite the extreme language imbalance in the pre-training data. In this paper, we closely examine the reasons behind this phenomenon, focusing on the pre-training corpus. We find that the existence of code-switching, alternating between different languages within a context, is key to multilingual capabilities. We conduct an analysis to investigate code-switching in the pre-training corpus, examining its presence and categorizing it into four types within two quadrants. We then assess its impact on multilingual performance. These types of code-switching data are unbalanced in proportions and demonstrate different effects on facilitating language transfer. To better explore the power of code-switching for language alignment during pre-training, we investigate the strategy of synthetic code-switching. We continuously scale up the synthetic code-switching data and observe remarkable improvements in both benchmarks and representation space. Extensive experiments indicate that incorporating synthetic code-switching data enables better language alignment and generalizes well to high, medium, and low-resource languages with pre-training corpora of varying qualities.

### Batch, match, and patch: low-rank approximations for score-based   variational inference
**Authors**: Chirag Modi, Diana Cai, Lawrence K. Saul

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T15:05:47Z

**Summary**: Black-box variational inference (BBVI) scales poorly to high-dimensional problems when it is used to estimate a multivariate Gaussian approximation with a full covariance matrix. In this paper, we extend the batch-and-match (BaM) framework for score-based BBVI to problems where it is prohibitively expensive to store such covariance matrices, let alone to estimate them. Unlike classical algorithms for BBVI, which use stochastic gradient descent to minimize the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, BaM uses more specialized updates to match the scores of the target density and its Gaussian approximation. We extend the updates for BaM by integrating them with a more compact parameterization of full covariance matrices. In particular, borrowing ideas from factor analysis, we add an extra step to each iteration of BaM--a patch--that projects each newly updated covariance matrix into a more efficiently parameterized family of diagonal plus low rank matrices. We evaluate this approach on a variety of synthetic target distributions and real-world problems in high-dimensional inference.

**Summary**: We present OpenThaiGPT 1.6 and R1 (OTG-1.6 and OTG-R1), Thai-centric Large Language Models (LLMs) developed through distinct methodologies to enhance generalization and reasoning capabilities. OTG-1.6 employs Task Arithmetic model merging for broad generalization, while OTG-R1 integrates multi-stage training with the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO) for advanced reasoning. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate superior performance across Thai language tasks, achieving competitive results against larger-scale open-source Thai LLMs. This paper details the proposed models, training processes, benchmarks, and results, highlighting improvements over previous models and establishing new performance standards for Thai-centric LLMs.

### DreamScape: 3D Scene Creation via Gaussian Splatting joint Correlation   Modeling
**Authors**: Yueming Zhao, Xuening Yuan, Hongyu Yang, Di Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T14:54:24Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-3D creation integrate the potent prior of Diffusion Models from text-to-image generation into 3D domain. Nevertheless, generating 3D scenes with multiple objects remains challenging. Therefore, we present DreamScape, a method for generating 3D scenes from text. Utilizing Gaussian Splatting for 3D representation, DreamScape introduces 3D Gaussian Guide that encodes semantic primitives, spatial transformations and relationships from text using LLMs, enabling local-to-global optimization. Progressive scale control is tailored during local object generation, addressing training instability issue arising from simple blending in the global optimization stage. Collision relationships between objects are modeled at the global level to mitigate biases in LLMs priors, ensuring physical correctness. Additionally, to generate pervasive objects like rain and snow distributed extensively across the scene, we design specialized sparse initialization and densification strategy. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScape achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling high-fidelity, controllable 3D scene generation.

### BlenderGym: Benchmarking Foundational Model Systems for Graphics Editing
**Authors**: Yunqi Gu, Ian Huang, Jihyeon Je, Guandao Yang, Leonidas Guibas

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T14:51:45Z

**Summary**: 3D graphics editing is crucial in applications like movie production and game design, yet it remains a time-consuming process that demands highly specialized domain expertise. Automating this process is challenging because graphical editing requires performing a variety of tasks, each requiring distinct skill sets. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for automating the editing process, but their development and evaluation are bottlenecked by the lack of a comprehensive benchmark that requires human-level perception and presents real-world editing complexity. In this work, we present BlenderGym, the first comprehensive VLM system benchmark for 3D graphics editing. BlenderGym evaluates VLM systems through code-based 3D reconstruction tasks. We evaluate closed- and open-source VLM systems and observe that even the state-of-the-art VLM system struggles with tasks relatively easy for human Blender users. Enabled by BlenderGym, we study how inference scaling techniques impact VLM's performance on graphics editing tasks. Notably, our findings reveal that the verifier used to guide the scaling of generation can itself be improved through inference scaling, complementing recent insights on inference scaling of LLM generation in coding and math tasks. We further show that inference compute is not uniformly effective and can be optimized by strategically distributing it between generation and verification.

**Authors**: Kegang Wang, Jiankai Tang, Yuxuan Fan, Jiatong Ji, Yuanchun Shi, Yuntao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T14:34:04Z

**Summary**: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), enabling non-contact physiological monitoring through facial light reflection analysis, faces critical computational bottlenecks as deep learning introduces performance gains at the cost of prohibitive resource demands. This paper proposes ME-rPPG, a memory-efficient algorithm built on temporal-spatial state space duality, which resolves the trilemma of model scalability, cross-dataset generalization, and real-time constraints. Leveraging a transferable state space, ME-rPPG efficiently captures subtle periodic variations across facial frames while maintaining minimal computational overhead, enabling training on extended video sequences and supporting low-latency inference. Achieving cross-dataset MAEs of 5.38 (MMPD), 0.70 (VitalVideo), and 0.25 (PURE), ME-rPPG outperforms all baselines with improvements ranging from 21.3% to 60.2%. Our solution enables real-time inference with only 3.6 MB memory usage and 9.46 ms latency -- surpassing existing methods by 19.5%-49.7% accuracy and 43.2% user satisfaction gains in real-world deployments. The code and demos are released for reproducibility on https://github.com/Health-HCI-Group/ME-rPPG-demo.

**Authors**: Haoyu Dong, Jianbo Zhao, Yuzhang Tian, Junyu Xiong, Shiyu Xia, Mengyu Zhou, Yun Lin, José Cambronero, Yeye He, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T14:33:38Z

**Summary**: Spreadsheets are characterized by their extensive two-dimensional grids, flexible layouts, and varied formatting options, which pose significant challenges for large language models (LLMs). In response, we introduce SpreadsheetLLM, pioneering an efficient encoding method designed to unleash and optimize LLMs' powerful understanding and reasoning capability on spreadsheets. Initially, we propose a vanilla serialization approach that incorporates cell addresses, values, and formats. However, this approach was limited by LLMs' token constraints, making it impractical for most applications. To tackle this challenge, we develop SheetCompressor, an innovative encoding framework that compresses spreadsheets effectively for LLMs. It comprises three modules: structural-anchor-based compression, inverse index translation, and data-format-aware aggregation. It significantly improves performance in the spreadsheet table detection task, outperforming the vanilla approach by 25.6% in GPT4's in-context learning setting. Moreover, fine-tuned LLM with SheetCompressor has an average compression ratio of 25 times, and achieves a state-of-the-art 78.9% F1 score, surpassing the best existing models by 12.3%. Finally, we propose Chain of Spreadsheet for downstream tasks of spreadsheet understanding and validate it in a new and demanding spreadsheet QA task. We methodically leverage the inherent layout and structure of spreadsheets, demonstrating that SpreadsheetLLM is highly effective across a variety of spreadsheet tasks.

### Leveraging Embedding Techniques in Multimodal Machine Learning for   Mental Illness Assessment
**Authors**: Abdelrahaman A. Hassan, Abdelrahman A. Ali, Aya E. Fouda, Radwa J. Hanafy, Mohammed E. Fouda

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T14:19:06Z

**Summary**: The increasing global prevalence of mental disorders, such as depression and PTSD, requires objective and scalable diagnostic tools. Traditional clinical assessments often face limitations in accessibility, objectivity, and consistency. This paper investigates the potential of multimodal machine learning to address these challenges, leveraging the complementary information available in text, audio, and video data. Our approach involves a comprehensive analysis of various data preprocessing techniques, including novel chunking and utterance-based formatting strategies. We systematically evaluate a range of state-of-the-art embedding models for each modality and employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional LSTM Networks (BiLSTMs) for feature extraction. We explore data-level, feature-level, and decision-level fusion techniques, including a novel integration of Large Language Model (LLM) predictions. We also investigate the impact of replacing Multilayer Perceptron classifiers with Support Vector Machines. We extend our analysis to severity prediction using PHQ-8 and PCL-C scores and multi-class classification (considering co-occurring conditions). Our results demonstrate that utterance-based chunking significantly improves performance, particularly for text and audio modalities. Decision-level fusion, incorporating LLM predictions, achieves the highest accuracy, with a balanced accuracy of 94.8% for depression and 96.2% for PTSD detection. The combination of CNN-BiLSTM architectures with utterance-level chunking, coupled with the integration of external LLM, provides a powerful and nuanced approach to the detection and assessment of mental health conditions. Our findings highlight the potential of MMML for developing more accurate, accessible, and personalized mental healthcare tools.

**Summary**: Financial LLMs hold promise for advancing financial tasks and domain-specific applications. However, they are limited by scarce corpora, weak multimodal capabilities, and narrow evaluations, making them less suited for real-world application. To address this, we introduce \textit{Open-FinLLMs}, the first open-source multimodal financial LLMs designed to handle diverse tasks across text, tabular, time-series, and chart data, excelling in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. The suite includes FinLLaMA, pre-trained on a comprehensive 52-billion-token corpus; FinLLaMA-Instruct, fine-tuned with 573K financial instructions; and FinLLaVA, enhanced with 1.43M multimodal tuning pairs for strong cross-modal reasoning. We comprehensively evaluate Open-FinLLMs across 14 financial tasks, 30 datasets, and 4 multimodal tasks in zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised fine-tuning settings, introducing two new multimodal evaluation datasets. Our results show that Open-FinLLMs outperforms afvanced financial and general LLMs such as GPT-4, across financial NLP, decision-making, and multi-modal tasks, highlighting their potential to tackle real-world challenges. To foster innovation and collaboration across academia and industry, we release all codes (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PIXIU2-0D70/B1D7/LICENSE) and models under OSI-approved licenses.

### Non-parametric Quantile Regression and Uniform Inference with Unknown   Error Distribution
**Authors**: Haoze Hou, Wei Huang, Zheng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T14:16:39Z

**Summary**: This paper studies the non-parametric estimation and uniform inference for the conditional quantile regression function (CQRF) with covariates exposed to measurement errors. We consider the case that the distribution of the measurement error is unknown and allowed to be either ordinary or super smooth. We estimate the density of the measurement error by the repeated measurements and propose the deconvolution kernel estimator for the CQRF. We derive the uniform Bahadur representation of the proposed estimator and construct the uniform confidence bands for the CQRF, uniformly in the sense for all covariates and a set of quantile indices, and establish the theoretical validity of the proposed inference. A data-driven approach for selecting the tuning parameter is also included. Monte Carlo simulations and a real data application demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method.

**Summary**: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) provide a rigorous framework for inference in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the alpha-HMM algorithm motivated by the optimal online filtering formulation in settings where the true state evolves as a Markov chain with equal exit probabilities. We quantify the dynamics of the algorithm in stationary environments, revealing a trade-off between inference and adaptation, showing how key parameters and the quality of observations affect performance. Comprehensive theoretical analysis on the nonlinear dynamical system that governs the evolution of the log-belief ratio over time and numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively balances adaptation and inference performance.

### Text2Tracks: Prompt-based Music Recommendation via Generative Retrieval
**Authors**: Enrico Palumbo, Gustavo Penha, Andreas Damianou, José Luis Redondo García, Timothy Christopher Heath, Alice Wang, Hugues Bouchard, Mounia Lalmas

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T14:08:21Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled users to provide highly specific music recommendation requests using natural language prompts (e.g. "Can you recommend some old classics for slow dancing?"). In this setup, the recommended tracks are predicted by the LLM in an autoregressive way, i.e. the LLM generates the track titles one token at a time. While intuitive, this approach has several limitation. First, it is based on a general purpose tokenization that is optimized for words rather than for track titles. Second, it necessitates an additional entity resolution layer that matches the track title to the actual track identifier. Third, the number of decoding steps scales linearly with the length of the track title, slowing down inference. In this paper, we propose to address the task of prompt-based music recommendation as a generative retrieval task. Within this setting, we introduce novel, effective, and efficient representations of track identifiers that significantly outperform commonly used strategies. We introduce Text2Tracks, a generative retrieval model that learns a mapping from a user's music recommendation prompt to the relevant track IDs directly. Through an offline evaluation on a dataset of playlists with language inputs, we find that (1) the strategy to create IDs for music tracks is the most important factor for the effectiveness of Text2Tracks and semantic IDs significantly outperform commonly used strategies that rely on song titles as identifiers (2) provided with the right choice of track identifiers, Text2Tracks outperforms sparse and dense retrieval solutions trained to retrieve tracks from language prompts.

### Hyper-Compression: Model Compression via Hyperfunction
**Authors**: Fenglei Fan, Juntong Fan, Dayang Wang, Jingbo Zhang, Zelin Dong, Shijun Zhang, Ge Wang, Tieyong Zeng

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T13:58:50Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of large models' size has far outpaced that of computing resources. To bridge this gap, encouraged by the parsimonious relationship between genotype and phenotype in the brain's growth and development, we propose the so-called hyper-compression that turns the model compression into the issue of parameter representation via a hyperfunction. Specifically, it is known that the trajectory of some low-dimensional dynamic systems can fill the high-dimensional space eventually. Thus, hyper-compression, using these dynamic systems as the hyperfunctions, represents the parameters of the target network by their corresponding composition number or trajectory length. This suggests a novel mechanism for model compression, substantially different from the existing pruning, quantization, distillation, and decomposition. Along this direction, we methodologically identify a suitable dynamic system with the irrational winding as the hyperfunction and theoretically derive its associated error bound. Next, guided by our theoretical insights, we propose several engineering twists to make the hyper-compression pragmatic and effective. Lastly, systematic and comprehensive experiments confirm that hyper-compression enjoys the following \textbf{PNAS} merits: 1) \textbf{P}referable compression ratio; 2) \textbf{N}o post-hoc retraining; 3) \textbf{A}ffordable inference time; and 4) \textbf{S}hort compression time. It compresses LLaMA2-7B in an hour and achieves close-to-int4-quantization performance, without retraining and with a performance drop of less than 1\%. We have open-sourced our code in https://github.com/Juntongkuki/Hyper-Compression.git for free download and evaluation.

### A Model-Agnostic Approach for Semantically Driven Disambiguation in   Human-Robot Interaction
**Authors**: Fethiye Irmak Dogan, Maithili Patel, Weiyu Liu, Iolanda Leite, Sonia Chernova

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T13:51:04Z

**Summary**: Ambiguities are inevitable in human-robot interaction, especially when a robot follows user instructions in a large, shared space. For example, if a user asks the robot to find an object in a home environment with underspecified instructions, the object could be in multiple locations depending on missing factors. For instance, a bowl might be in the kitchen cabinet or on the dining room table, depending on whether it is clean or dirty, full or empty, and the presence of other objects around it. Previous works on object search have assumed that the queried object is immediately visible to the robot or have predicted object locations using one-shot inferences, which are likely to fail for ambiguous or partially understood instructions. This paper focuses on these gaps and presents a novel model-agnostic approach leveraging semantically driven clarifications to enhance the robot's ability to locate queried objects in fewer attempts. Specifically, we leverage different knowledge embedding models, and when ambiguities arise, we propose an informative clarification method, which follows an iterative prediction process. The user experiment evaluation of our method shows that our approach is applicable to different custom semantic encoders as well as LLMs, and informative clarifications improve performances, enabling the robot to locate objects on its first attempts. The user experiment data is publicly available at https://github.com/IrmakDogan/ExpressionDataset.

### AdPO: Enhancing the Adversarial Robustness of Large Vision-Language   Models with Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Chaohu Liu, Tianyi Gui, Yu Liu, Linli Xu

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T13:43:21Z

**Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), such as GPT-4o and LLaVA, have recently witnessed remarkable advancements and are increasingly being deployed in real-world applications. However, inheriting the sensitivity of visual neural networks, LVLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can result in erroneous or malicious outputs. While existing efforts utilize adversarial fine-tuning to enhance robustness, they often suffer from performance degradation on clean inputs. In this paper, we proposes AdPO, a novel adversarial defense strategy for LVLMs based on preference optimization. For the first time, we reframe adversarial training as a preference optimization problem, aiming to enhance the model's preference for generating normal outputs on clean inputs while rejecting the potential misleading outputs for adversarial examples. Notably, AdPO achieves this by solely modifying the image encoder, e.g., CLIP ViT, resulting in superior clean and adversarial performance in a variety of downsream tasks. Considering that training involves large language models (LLMs), the computational cost increases significantly. We validate that training on smaller LVLMs and subsequently transferring to larger models can achieve competitive performance while maintaining efficiency comparable to baseline methods. Our comprehensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed AdPO, which provides a novel perspective for future adversarial defense research.

**Authors**: Zhiming Ma, Peidong Wang, Minhua Huang, Jingpeng Wang, Kai Wu, Xiangzhao Lv, Yachun Pang, Yin Yang, Wenjie Tang, Yuchen Kang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T13:32:22Z

**Summary**: The detection of telecom fraud faces significant challenges due to the lack of high-quality multimodal training data that integrates audio signals with reasoning-oriented textual analysis. To address this gap, we present TeleAntiFraud-28k, the first open-source audio-text slow-thinking dataset specifically designed for automated telecom fraud analysis. Our dataset is constructed through three strategies: (1) Privacy-preserved text-truth sample generation using automatically speech recognition (ASR)-transcribed call recordings (with anonymized original audio), ensuring real-world consistency through text-to-speech (TTS) model regeneration; (2) Semantic enhancement via large language model (LLM)-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR outputs to expand scenario coverage; (3) Multi-agent adversarial synthesis that simulates emerging fraud tactics through predefined communication scenarios and fraud typologies. The generated dataset contains 28,511 rigorously processed speech-text pairs, complete with detailed annotations for fraud reasoning. The dataset is divided into three tasks: scenario classification, fraud detection, fraud type classification. Furthermore, we construct TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a standardized evaluation benchmark comprising proportionally sampled instances from the dataset, to facilitate systematic testing of model performance on telecom fraud detection tasks. We also contribute a production-optimized supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model trained on hybrid real/synthetic data, while open-sourcing the data processing framework to enable community-driven dataset expansion. This work establishes a foundational framework for multimodal anti-fraud research while addressing critical challenges in data privacy and scenario diversity. The project will be released at https://github.com/JimmyMa99/TeleAntiFraud.

### Interpretable Steering of Large Language Models with Feature Guided   Activation Additions
**Authors**: Samuel Soo, Chen Guang, Wesley Teng, Chandrasekaran Balaganesh, Tan Guoxian, Yan Ming

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T13:20:40Z

**Summary**: Effective and reliable control over large language model (LLM) behavior is a significant challenge. While activation steering methods, which add steering vectors to a model's hidden states, are a promising approach, existing techniques often lack precision and interpretability in how they influence model outputs. We introduce Feature Guided Activation Additions (FGAA), a novel activation steering method that leverages insights from Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and Sparse Autoencoder-Targeted Steering (SAE-TS). By operating in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) and employing optimization techniques to select desired SAE features, FGAA constructs precise steering vectors that provide better steering effects while maintaining coherence of steered model outputs. In this regard, evaluations on Gemma-2-2B and Gemma-2-9B models across various steering tasks demonstrate that FGAA outperforms existing steering methods of CAA, SAE decoder steering, and SAE-TS. Our results also highlight important trade-offs between steering scale and general model capabilities that are consistent across all tested steering methods.

### Graph Representation Learning via Causal Diffusion for   Out-of-Distribution Recommendation
**Authors**: Chu Zhao, Enneng Yang, Yuliang Liang, Pengxiang Lan, Yuting Liu, Jianzhe Zhao, Guibing Guo, Xingwei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T13:16:51Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation algorithms typically assume that training and testing data are drawn from independent and identically distributed (IID) spaces. However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.

### TransforMerger: Transformer-based Voice-Gesture Fusion for Robust   Human-Robot Communication
**Authors**: Petr Vanc, Karla Stepanova

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T13:15:59Z

**Summary**: As human-robot collaboration advances, natural and flexible communication methods are essential for effective robot control. Traditional methods relying on a single modality or rigid rules struggle with noisy or misaligned data as well as with object descriptions that do not perfectly fit the predefined object names (e.g. 'Pick that red object'). We introduce TransforMerger, a transformer-based reasoning model that infers a structured action command for robotic manipulation based on fused voice and gesture inputs. Our approach merges multimodal data into a single unified sentence, which is then processed by the language model. We employ probabilistic embeddings to handle uncertainty and we integrate contextual scene understanding to resolve ambiguous references (e.g., gestures pointing to multiple objects or vague verbal cues like "this"). We evaluate TransforMerger in simulated and real-world experiments, demonstrating its robustness to noise, misalignment, and missing information. Our results show that TransforMerger outperforms deterministic baselines, especially in scenarios requiring more contextual knowledge, enabling more robust and flexible human-robot communication. Code and datasets are available at: http://imitrob.ciirc.cvut.cz/publications/transformerger.

### InfiniteICL: Breaking the Limit of Context Window Size via Long   Short-term Memory Transformation
**Authors**: Bowen Cao, Deng Cai, Wai Lam

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T08:53:06Z

**Summary**: In-context learning (ICL) is critical for large language models (LLMs), but its effectiveness is constrained by finite context windows, particularly in ultra-long contexts. To overcome this, we introduce InfiniteICL, a framework that parallels context and parameters in LLMs with short- and long-term memory in human cognitive systems, focusing on transforming temporary context knowledge into permanent parameter updates. This approach significantly reduces memory usage, maintains robust performance across varying input lengths, and theoretically enables infinite context integration through the principles of context knowledge elicitation, selection, and consolidation. Evaluations demonstrate that our method reduces context length by 90% while achieving 103% average performance of full-context prompting across fact recall, grounded reasoning, and skill acquisition tasks. When conducting sequential multi-turn transformations on complex, real-world contexts (with length up to 2M tokens), our approach surpasses full-context prompting while using only 0.4% of the original contexts. These findings highlight InfiniteICL's potential to enhance the scalability and efficiency of LLMs by breaking the limitations of conventional context window sizes.

### Towards Physically Plausible Video Generation via VLM Planning
**Authors**: Xindi Yang, Baolu Li, Yiming Zhang, Zhenfei Yin, Lei Bai, Liqian Ma, Zhiyong Wang, Jianfei Cai, Tien-Tsin Wong, Huchuan Lu, Xu Jia

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T13:05:28Z

**Summary**: Video diffusion models (VDMs) have advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the generation of highly realistic videos and drawing the attention of the community in their potential as world simulators. However, despite their capabilities, VDMs often fail to produce physically plausible videos due to an inherent lack of understanding of physics, resulting in incorrect dynamics and event sequences. To address this limitation, we propose a novel two-stage image-to-video generation framework that explicitly incorporates physics. In the first stage, we employ a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a coarse-grained motion planner, integrating chain-of-thought and physics-aware reasoning to predict a rough motion trajectories/changes that approximate real-world physical dynamics while ensuring the inter-frame consistency. In the second stage, we use the predicted motion trajectories/changes to guide the video generation of a VDM. As the predicted motion trajectories/changes are rough, noise is added during inference to provide freedom to the VDM in generating motion with more fine details. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can produce physically plausible motion, and comparative evaluations highlight the notable superiority of our approach over existing methods. More video results are available on our Project Page: https://madaoer.github.io/projects/physically_plausible_video_generation.

### A Causal Inference Framework for Data Rich Environments
**Authors**: Alberto Abadie, Anish Agarwal, Devavrat Shah

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T13:04:26Z

**Summary**: We propose a formal model for counterfactual estimation with unobserved confounding in "data-rich" settings, i.e., where there are a large number of units and a large number of measurements per unit. Our model provides a bridge between the structural causal model view of causal inference common in the graphical models literature with that of the latent factor model view common in the potential outcomes literature. We show how classic models for potential outcomes and treatment assignments fit within our framework. We provide an identification argument for the average treatment effect, the average treatment effect on the treated, and the average treatment effect on the untreated. For any estimator that has a fast enough estimation error rate for a certain nuisance parameter, we establish it is consistent for these various causal parameters. We then show principal component regression is one such estimator that leads to consistent estimation, and we analyze the minimal smoothness required of the potential outcomes function for consistency.

### Reasoning LLMs for User-Aware Multimodal Conversational Agents
**Authors**: Hamed Rahimi, Jeanne Cattoni, Meriem Beghili, Mouad Abrini, Mahdi Khoramshahi, Maribel Pino, Mohamed Chetouani

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T13:00:17Z

**Summary**: Personalization in social robotics is critical for fostering effective human-robot interactions, yet systems often face the cold start problem, where initial user preferences or characteristics are unavailable. This paper proposes a novel framework called USER-LLM R1 for a user-aware conversational agent that addresses this challenge through dynamic user profiling and model initiation. Our approach integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning models to iteratively infer user preferences and vision-language models (VLMs) to initialize user profiles from multimodal inputs, enabling personalized interactions from the first encounter. Leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, the system dynamically refines user representations within an inherent CoT process, ensuring contextually relevant and adaptive responses. Evaluations on the ElderlyTech-VQA Bench demonstrate significant improvements in ROUGE-1 (+23.2%), ROUGE-2 (+0.6%), and ROUGE-L (+8%) F1 scores over state-of-the-art baselines, with ablation studies underscoring the impact of reasoning model size on performance. Human evaluations further validate the framework's efficacy, particularly for elderly users, where tailored responses enhance engagement and trust. Ethical considerations, including privacy preservation and bias mitigation, are rigorously discussed and addressed to ensure responsible deployment.

### ToM-RL: Reinforcement Learning Unlocks Theory of Mind in Small LLMs
**Authors**: Yi-Long Lu, Chunhui Zhang, Jiajun Song, Lifeng Fan, Wei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T12:58:42Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), applied during the post-training phase of large language models (LLMs), have significantly enhanced their capabilities in structured reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logical inference. However, the effectiveness of RL in social reasoning, particularly in Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer others' mental states, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that RL methods effectively unlock ToM reasoning capabilities even in small-scale LLMs (0.5B to 7B parameters). Using a modest dataset comprising 3200 questions across diverse scenarios, our RL-trained 7B model achieves 84.50\% accuracy on the Hi-ToM benchmark, surpassing models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-v3 despite significantly fewer parameters. While smaller models ($\leq$3B parameters) suffer from reasoning collapse, larger models (7B parameters) maintain stable performance through consistent belief tracking. Additionally, our RL-based models demonstrate robust generalization to higher-order, out-of-distribution ToM problems, novel textual presentations, and previously unseen datasets. These findings highlight RL's potential to enhance social cognitive reasoning, bridging the gap between structured problem-solving and nuanced social inference in LLMs.

### Method-of-Moments Inference for GLMs and Doubly Robust Functionals under   Proportional Asymptotics
**Authors**: Xingyu Chen, Lin Liu, Rajarshi Mukherjee

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T12:46:26Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we consider the estimation of regression coefficients and signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio in high-dimensional Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), and explore their implications in inferring popular estimands such as average treatment effects in high-dimensional observational studies. Under the ``proportional asymptotic'' regime and Gaussian covariates with known (population) covariance $\Sigma$, we derive Consistent and Asymptotically Normal (CAN) estimators of our targets of inference through a Method-of-Moments type of estimators that bypasses estimation of high dimensional nuisance functions and hyperparameter tuning altogether. Additionally, under non-Gaussian covariates, we demonstrate universality of our results under certain additional assumptions on the regression coefficients and $\Sigma$. We also demonstrate that knowing $\Sigma$ is not essential to our proposed methodology when the sample covariance matrix estimator is invertible. Finally, we complement our theoretical results with numerical experiments and comparisons with existing literature.

### Satellite Edge Artificial Intelligence with Large Models: Architectures   and Technologies
**Authors**: Yuanming Shi, Jingyang Zhu, Chunxiao Jiang, Linling Kuang, Khaled B. Letaief

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T12:25:57Z

**Summary**: Driven by the growing demand for intelligent remote sensing applications, large artificial intelligence (AI) models pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled datasets and fine-tuned for downstream tasks have significantly improved learning performance for various downstream tasks due to their generalization capabilities. However, many specific downstream tasks, such as extreme weather nowcasting (e.g., downburst and tornado), disaster monitoring, and battlefield surveillance, require real-time data processing. Traditional methods via transferring raw data to ground stations for processing often cause significant issues in terms of latency and trustworthiness. To address these challenges, satellite edge AI provides a paradigm shift from ground-based to on-board data processing by leveraging the integrated communication-and-computation capabilities in space computing power networks (Space-CPN), thereby enhancing the timeliness, effectiveness, and trustworthiness for remote sensing downstream tasks. Moreover, satellite edge large AI model (LAM) involves both the training (i.e., fine-tuning) and inference phases, where a key challenge lies in developing computation task decomposition principles to support scalable LAM deployment in resource-constrained space networks with time-varying topologies. In this article, we first propose a satellite federated fine-tuning architecture to split and deploy the modules of LAM over space and ground networks for efficient LAM fine-tuning. We then introduce a microservice-empowered satellite edge LAM inference architecture that virtualizes LAM components into lightweight microservices tailored for multi-task multimodal inference. Finally, we discuss the future directions for enhancing the efficiency and scalability of satellite edge LAM, including task-oriented communication, brain-inspired computing, and satellite edge AI network optimization.

### Testing Low-Resource Language Support in LLMs Using Language Proficiency   Exams: the Case of Luxembourgish
**Authors**: Cedric Lothritz, Jordi Cabot

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T12:16:14Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an increasingly important tool in research and society at large. While LLMs are regularly used all over the world by experts and lay-people alike, they are predominantly developed with English-speaking users in mind, performing well in English and other wide-spread languages while less-resourced languages such as Luxembourgish are seen as a lower priority. This lack of attention is also reflected in the sparsity of available evaluation tools and datasets. In this study, we investigate the viability of language proficiency exams as such evaluation tools for the Luxembourgish language. We find that large models such as ChatGPT, Claude and DeepSeek-R1 typically achieve high scores, while smaller models show weak performances. We also find that the performances in such language exams can be used to predict performances in other NLP tasks.

### Nonlinear electrodynamic black holes and their role in testing modified   theories of gravity
**Authors**: Javokhir Sharipov, Mirzabek Alloqulov, Pankaj Sheoran, Sanjar Shaymatov

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T12:00:35Z

**Summary**: The nature of black holes (BHs) and potential deviations from General Relativity (GR) remain key questions in astrophysics. Nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) offers a mechanism for constructing regular BHs that evade singularities. We perform a geometrical and observational analysis of NED-inspired BHs, constraining the magnetic parameter via Bayesian inference using EHT data, obtaining \( q = 0.98^{+0.09}_{-0.08} \) for M87* and \( q = 1.10\pm0.10 \) for Sgr A*. Deviations from Schwarzschild BHs manifest in horizon structure, shadow properties, and lensing effects. We analyze BH shadows under plasma conditions, identifying imprints of NED on strong-field processes. Future observations from LISA, next-generation X-ray telescopes, and EHT will further constrain these deviations and provide tests for alternative gravity theories.

### Sparse Gaussian Neural Processes
**Authors**: Tommy Rochussen, Vincent Fortuin

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T12:00:09Z

**Summary**: Despite significant recent advances in probabilistic meta-learning, it is common for practitioners to avoid using deep learning models due to a comparative lack of interpretability. Instead, many practitioners simply use non-meta-models such as Gaussian processes with interpretable priors, and conduct the tedious procedure of training their model from scratch for each task they encounter. While this is justifiable for tasks with a limited number of data points, the cubic computational cost of exact Gaussian process inference renders this prohibitive when each task has many observations. To remedy this, we introduce a family of models that meta-learn sparse Gaussian process inference. Not only does this enable rapid prediction on new tasks with sparse Gaussian processes, but since our models have clear interpretations as members of the neural process family, it also allows manual elicitation of priors in a neural process for the first time. In meta-learning regimes for which the number of observed tasks is small or for which expert domain knowledge is available, this offers a crucial advantage.

### Proposition of Affordance-Driven Environment Recognition Framework Using   Symbol Networks in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Kazuma Arii, Satoshi Kurihara

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T11:48:44Z

**Summary**: In the quest to enable robots to coexist with humans, understanding dynamic situations and selecting appropriate actions based on common sense and affordances are essential. Conventional AI systems face challenges in applying affordance, as it represents implicit knowledge derived from common sense. However, large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities due to their ability to process extensive human knowledge. This study proposes a method for automatic affordance acquisition by leveraging LLM outputs. The process involves generating text using LLMs, reconstructing the output into a symbol network using morphological and dependency analysis, and calculating affordances based on network distances. Experiments using ``apple'' as an example demonstrated the method's ability to extract context-dependent affordances with high explainability. The results suggest that the proposed symbol network, reconstructed from LLM outputs, enables robots to interpret affordances effectively, bridging the gap between symbolized data and human-like situational understanding.

**Authors**: Reo Abe, Akifumi Ito, Kanata Takayasu, Satoshi Kurihara

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T11:42:49Z

**Summary**: Planning methods with high adaptability to dynamic environments are crucial for the development of autonomous and versatile robots. We propose a method for leveraging a large language model (GPT-4o) to automatically generate networks capable of adapting to dynamic environments. The proposed method collects environmental "status," representing conditions and goals, and uses them to generate agents. These agents are interconnected on the basis of specific conditions, resulting in networks that combine flexibility and generality. We conducted evaluation experiments to compare the networks automatically generated with the proposed method with manually constructed ones, confirming the comprehensiveness of the proposed method's networks and their higher generality.

**Summary**: Modern deep learning relies nearly exclusively on dedicated electronic hardware accelerators. Photonic approaches, with low consumption and high operation speed, are increasingly considered for inference but, to date, remain mostly limited to relatively basic tasks. Simultaneously, the problem of training deep and complex neural networks, overwhelmingly performed through backpropagation, remains a significant limitation to the size and, consequently, the performance of current architectures and a major compute and energy bottleneck. Here, we experimentally implement a versatile and scalable training algorithm, called direct feedback alignment, on a hybrid electronic-photonic platform. An optical processing unit performs large-scale random matrix multiplications, which is the central operation of this algorithm, at speeds up to 1500 TeraOPS under 30 Watts of power. We perform optical training of modern deep learning architectures, including Transformers, with more than 1B parameters, and obtain good performances on language, vision, and diffusion-based generative tasks. We study the scaling of the training time, and demonstrate a potential advantage of our hybrid opto-electronic approach for ultra-deep and wide neural networks, thus opening a promising route to sustain the exponential growth of modern artificial intelligence beyond traditional von Neumann approaches.

**Authors**: Weizhi Wang, Yu Tian, Linjie Yang, Heng Wang, Xifeng Yan

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T11:17:09Z

**Summary**: The reproduction of state-of-the-art multimodal LLM pre-training faces barriers at every stage of the pipeline, including high-quality data filtering, multimodal data mixture strategies, sequence packing techniques, and training frameworks. We introduce Open-Qwen2VL, a fully open-source 2B-parameter Multimodal Large Language Model pre-trained efficiently on 29M image-text pairs using only 220 A100-40G GPU hours. Our approach employs low-to-high dynamic image resolution and multimodal sequence packing to significantly enhance pre-training efficiency. The training dataset was carefully curated using both MLLM-based filtering techniques (e.g., MLM-Filter) and conventional CLIP-based filtering methods, substantially improving data quality and training efficiency. The Open-Qwen2VL pre-training is conducted on academic level 8xA100-40G GPUs at UCSB on 5B packed multimodal tokens, which is 0.36% of 1.4T multimodal pre-training tokens of Qwen2-VL. The final instruction-tuned Open-Qwen2VL outperforms partially-open state-of-the-art MLLM Qwen2-VL-2B on various multimodal benchmarks of MMBench, SEEDBench, MMstar, and MathVista, indicating the remarkable training efficiency of Open-Qwen2VL. We open-source all aspects of our work, including compute-efficient and data-efficient training details, data filtering methods, sequence packing scripts, pre-training data in WebDataset format, FSDP-based training codebase, and both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints. We redefine "fully open" for multimodal LLMs as the complete release of: 1) the training codebase, 2) detailed data filtering techniques, and 3) all pre-training and supervised fine-tuning data used to develop the model.

### Comment Staytime Prediction with LLM-enhanced Comment Understanding
**Authors**: Changshuo Zhang, Zihan Lin, Shukai Liu, Yongqi Liu, Han Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T11:09:18Z

**Summary**: In modern online streaming platforms, the comments section plays a critical role in enhancing the overall user experience. Understanding user behavior within the comments section is essential for comprehensive user interest modeling. A key factor of user engagement is staytime, which refers to the amount of time that users browse and post comments. Existing watchtime prediction methods struggle to adapt to staytime prediction, overlooking interactions with individual comments and their interrelation. In this paper, we present a micro-video recommendation dataset with video comments (named as KuaiComt) which is collected from Kuaishou platform. correspondingly, we propose a practical framework for comment staytime prediction with LLM-enhanced Comment Understanding (LCU). Our framework leverages the strong text comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to understand textual information of comments, while also incorporating fine-grained comment ranking signals as auxiliary tasks. The framework is two-staged: first, the LLM is fine-tuned using domain-specific tasks to bridge the video and the comments; second, we incorporate the LLM outputs into the prediction model and design two comment ranking auxiliary tasks to better understand user preference. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, showing significant improvements on the task of comment staytime prediction. Additionally, online A/B testing further validates the practical benefits on industrial scenario. Our dataset KuaiComt (https://github.com/lyingCS/KuaiComt.github.io) and code for LCU (https://github.com/lyingCS/LCU) are fully released.

### Building Knowledge from Interactions: An LLM-Based Architecture for   Adaptive Tutoring and Social Reasoning
**Authors**: Luca Garello, Giulia Belgiovine, Gabriele Russo, Francesco Rea, Alessandra Sciutti

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T10:45:41Z

**Summary**: Integrating robotics into everyday scenarios like tutoring or physical training requires robots capable of adaptive, socially engaging, and goal-oriented interactions. While Large Language Models show promise in human-like communication, their standalone use is hindered by memory constraints and contextual incoherence. This work presents a multimodal, cognitively inspired framework that enhances LLM-based autonomous decision-making in social and task-oriented Human-Robot Interaction. Specifically, we develop an LLM-based agent for a robot trainer, balancing social conversation with task guidance and goal-driven motivation. To further enhance autonomy and personalization, we introduce a memory system for selecting, storing and retrieving experiences, facilitating generalized reasoning based on knowledge built across different interactions. A preliminary HRI user study and offline experiments with a synthetic dataset validate our approach, demonstrating the system's ability to manage complex interactions, autonomously drive training tasks, and build and retrieve contextual memories, advancing socially intelligent robotics.

### Beyond Text-to-Text: An Overview of Multimodal and Generative Artificial   Intelligence for Education Using Topic Modeling
**Authors**: Ville Heilala, Roberto Araya, Raija Hämäläinen

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T10:19:10Z

**Summary**: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can reshape education and learning. While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT dominate current educational research, multimodal capabilities, such as text-to-speech and text-to-image, are less explored. This study uses topic modeling to map the research landscape of multimodal and generative AI in education. An extensive literature search using Dimensions yielded 4175 articles. Employing a topic modeling approach, latent topics were extracted, resulting in 38 interpretable topics organized into 14 thematic areas. Findings indicate a predominant focus on text-to-text models in educational contexts, with other modalities underexplored, overlooking the broader potential of multimodal approaches. The results suggest a research gap, stressing the importance of more balanced attention across different AI modalities and educational levels. In summary, this research provides an overview of current trends in generative AI for education, underlining opportunities for future exploration of multimodal technologies to fully realize the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in education.

### GPT Adoption and the Impact of Disclosure Policies
**Authors**: Cathy Yang, David Restrepo Amariles, Leo Allen, Aurore Troussel

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T10:09:54Z

**Summary**: Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, have proven effective in content generation and productivity enhancement. However, legal risks associated with these tools lead to adoption variance and concealment of AI use within organizations. This study examines the impact of disclosure on ChatGPT adoption in legal, audit and advisory roles in consulting firms through the lens of agency theory. We conducted a survey experiment to evaluate agency costs in the context of unregulated corporate use of ChatGPT, with a particular focus on how mandatory disclosure influences information asymmetry and misaligned interests. Our findings indicate that in the absence of corporate regulations, such as an AI policy, firms may incur agency costs, which can hinder the full benefits of GPT adoption. While disclosure policies reduce information asymmetry, they do not significantly lower overall agency costs due to managers undervaluing analysts' contributions with GPT use. Finally, we examine the scope of existing regulations in Europe and the United States regarding disclosure requirements, explore the sharing of risk and responsibility within firms, and analyze how incentive mechanisms promote responsible AI adoption.

### STPNet: Scale-aware Text Prompt Network for Medical Image Segmentation
**Authors**: Dandan Shan, Zihan Li, Yunxiang Li, Qingde Li, Jie Tian, Qingqi Hong

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T10:01:42Z

**Summary**: Accurate segmentation of lesions plays a critical role in medical image analysis and diagnosis. Traditional segmentation approaches that rely solely on visual features often struggle with the inherent uncertainty in lesion distribution and size. To address these issues, we propose STPNet, a Scale-aware Text Prompt Network that leverages vision-language modeling to enhance medical image segmentation. Our approach utilizes multi-scale textual descriptions to guide lesion localization and employs retrieval-segmentation joint learning to bridge the semantic gap between visual and linguistic modalities. Crucially, STPNet retrieves relevant textual information from a specialized medical text repository during training, eliminating the need for text input during inference while retaining the benefits of cross-modal learning. We evaluate STPNet on three datasets: COVID-Xray, COVID-CT, and Kvasir-SEG. Experimental results show that our vision-language approach outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating textual semantic knowledge into medical image analysis. The code has been made publicly on https://github.com/HUANGLIZI/STPNet.

### Identifying Macro Causal Effects in C-DMGs
**Authors**: Simon Ferreira, Charles K. Assaad

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:48:27Z

**Summary**: Causal effect identification using causal graphs is a fundamental challenge in causal inference. While extensive research has been conducted in this area, most existing methods assume the availability of fully specified causal graphs. However, in complex domains such as medicine and epidemiology, complete causal knowledge is often unavailable, and only partial information about the system is accessible. This paper focuses on causal effect identification within partially specified causal graphs, with particular emphasis on cluster-directed mixed graphs (C-DMGs). These graphs provide a higher-level representation of causal relationships by grouping variables into clusters, offering a more practical approach for handling complex systems. Unlike fully specified causal graphs, C-DMGs can contain cycles, which complicate their analysis and interpretation. Furthermore, their cluster-based nature introduces new challenges, as it gives rise to two distinct types of causal effects, macro causal effects and micro causal effects, with different properties. In this work, we focus on macro causal effects, which describe the effects of entire clusters on other clusters. We establish that the do-calculus is both sound and complete for identifying these effects in C-DMGs. Additionally, we provide a graphical characterization of non-identifiability for macro causal effects in these graphs.

### Representation Bending for Large Language Model Safety
**Authors**: Ashkan Yousefpour, Taeheon Kim, Ryan S. Kwon, Seungbeen Lee, Wonje Jeung, Seungju Han, Alvin Wan, Harrison Ngan, Youngjae Yu, Jonghyun Choi

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:47:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools, but their inherent safety risks - ranging from harmful content generation to broader societal harms - pose significant challenges. These risks can be amplified by the recent adversarial attacks, fine-tuning vulnerabilities, and the increasing deployment of LLMs in high-stakes environments. Existing safety-enhancing techniques, such as fine-tuning with human feedback or adversarial training, are still vulnerable as they address specific threats and often fail to generalize across unseen attacks, or require manual system-level defenses. This paper introduces RepBend, a novel approach that fundamentally disrupts the representations underlying harmful behaviors in LLMs, offering a scalable solution to enhance (potentially inherent) safety. RepBend brings the idea of activation steering - simple vector arithmetic for steering model's behavior during inference - to loss-based fine-tuning. Through extensive evaluation, RepBend achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior methods such as Circuit Breaker, RMU, and NPO, with up to 95% reduction in attack success rates across diverse jailbreak benchmarks, all with negligible reduction in model usability and general capabilities.

### A Volumetric Approach to Privacy of Dynamical Systems
**Authors**: Chuanghong Weng, Ehsan Nekouei

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:45:53Z

**Summary**: Information-theoretic metrics, such as mutual information, have been widely used to evaluate privacy leakage in dynamic systems. However, these approaches are typically limited to stochastic systems and face computational challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel volumetric framework for analyzing privacy in systems affected by unknown but bounded noise. Our model considers a dynamic system comprising public and private states, where an observation set of the public state is released. An adversary utilizes the observed public state to infer an uncertainty set of the private state, referred to as the inference attack. We define the evolution dynamics of these inference attacks and quantify the privacy level of the private state using the volume of its uncertainty sets. We then develop an approximate computation method leveraging interval analysis to compute the private state set. We investigate the properties of the proposed volumetric privacy measure and demonstrate that it is bounded by the information gain derived from the observation set. Furthermore, we propose an optimization approach to designing privacy filter using randomization and linear programming based on the proposed privacy measure. The effectiveness of the optimal privacy filter design is evaluated through a production-inventory case study, illustrating its robustness against inference attacks and its superiority compared to a truncated Gaussian mechanism.

### Induction Heads as an Essential Mechanism for Pattern Matching in   In-context Learning
**Authors**: Joy Crosbie, Ekaterina Shutova

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:40:08Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to learn and perform complex tasks through in-context learning (ICL). However, a comprehensive understanding of its internal mechanisms is still lacking. This paper explores the role of induction heads in a few-shot ICL setting. We analyse two state-of-the-art models, Llama-3-8B and InternLM2-20B on abstract pattern recognition and NLP tasks. Our results show that even a minimal ablation of induction heads leads to ICL performance decreases of up to ~32% for abstract pattern recognition tasks, bringing the performance close to random. For NLP tasks, this ablation substantially decreases the model's ability to benefit from examples, bringing few-shot ICL performance close to that of zero-shot prompts. We further use attention knockout to disable specific induction patterns, and present fine-grained evidence for the role that the induction mechanism plays in ICL.

### Register Always Matters: Analysis of LLM Pretraining Data Through the   Lens of Language Variation
**Authors**: Amanda Myntti, Erik Henriksson, Veronika Laippala, Sampo Pyysalo

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:30:24Z

**Summary**: Pretraining data curation is a cornerstone in Large Language Model (LLM) development, leading to growing research on quality filtering of large web corpora. From statistical quality flags to LLM-based labeling systems, datasets are divided into categories, frequently reducing to a binary: those passing the filters deemed as valuable examples, others discarded as useless or detrimental. However, a more detailed understanding of the contribution of different kinds of texts to model performance is still largely lacking. In this article, we present the first study utilizing registers (also known as genres) - a widely used standard in corpus linguistics to model linguistic variation - to curate pretraining datasets and investigate the effect of register on the performance of LLMs. We perform comparative studies by training models with register classified data and evaluating them using standard benchmarks, and show that the register of pretraining data substantially affects model performance. We uncover surprising relationships between the pretraining material and the resulting models: using the News register results in subpar performance, and on the contrary, including the Opinion class, covering texts such as reviews and opinion blogs, is highly beneficial. While a model trained on the entire unfiltered dataset outperforms those trained on datasets limited to a single register, combining well-performing registers like How-to-Instructions, Informational Description, and Opinion leads to major improvements. Furthermore, analysis of individual benchmark results reveals key differences in the strengths and drawbacks of specific register classes as pretraining data. These findings show that register is an important explainer of model variation and can facilitate more deliberate future data selection practices.

### From Smør-re-brød to Subwords: Training LLMs on Danish, One   Morpheme at a Time
**Authors**: Mikkel Wildner Kildeberg, Emil Allerslev Schledermann, Nicolaj Larsen, Rob van der Goot

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:26:02Z

**Summary**: The best performing transformer-based language models use subword tokenization techniques, such as Byte-Pair-Encoding (BPE). However, these approaches often overlook linguistic principles, such as morphological segmentation, which we believe is fundamental for understanding language-specific word structure. In this study, we leverage an annotated Danish morphological dataset to train a semisupervised model for morphological segmentation, enabling the development of tokenizers optimized for Danish morphology. We evaluate four distinct tokenizers, including two custom morphological tokenizers, by analyzing their performance in morphologically segmenting Danish words. Additionally, we train two generative transformer models, \textit{CerebrasGPT-111M} and \textit{LLaMA-3.2 1B}, using these tokenizers and evaluate their downstream performance. Our findings reveal that our custom-developed tokenizers substantially enhance morphological segmentation, achieving an F1 score of 58.84, compared to 39.28 achieved by a Danish BPE tokenizer. In downstream tasks, models trained with our morphological tokenizers outperform those using BPE tokenizers across different evaluation metrics. These results highlight that incorporating Danish morphological segmentation strategies into tokenizers leads to improved performance in generative transformer models on Danish language

### Context-Aware Toxicity Detection in Multiplayer Games: Integrating   Domain-Adaptive Pretraining and Match Metadata
**Authors**: Adrien Schurger-Foy, Rafal Dariusz Kocielnik, Caglar Gulcehre, R. Michael Alvarez

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:21:41Z

**Summary**: The detrimental effects of toxicity in competitive online video games are widely acknowledged, prompting publishers to monitor player chat conversations. This is challenging due to the context-dependent nature of toxicity, often spread across multiple messages or informed by non-textual interactions. Traditional toxicity detectors focus on isolated messages, missing the broader context needed for accurate moderation. This is especially problematic in video games, where interactions involve specialized slang, abbreviations, and typos, making it difficult for standard models to detect toxicity, especially given its rarity. We adapted RoBERTa LLM to support moderation tailored to video games, integrating both textual and non-textual context. By enhancing pretrained embeddings with metadata and addressing the unique slang and language quirks through domain adaptive pretraining, our method better captures the nuances of player interactions. Using two gaming datasets - from Defense of the Ancients 2 (DOTA 2) and Call of Duty$^\circledR$: Modern Warfare$^\circledR$III (MWIII) we demonstrate which sources of context (metadata, prior interactions...) are most useful, how to best leverage them to boost performance, and the conditions conducive to doing so. This work underscores the importance of context-aware and domain-specific approaches for proactive moderation.

### LightDefense: A Lightweight Uncertainty-Driven Defense against   Jailbreaks via Shifted Token Distribution
**Authors**: Zhuoran Yang, Jie Peng, Zhen Tan, Tianlong Chen, Yanyong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:21:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) face threats from jailbreak prompts. Existing methods for defending against jailbreak attacks are primarily based on auxiliary models. These strategies, however, often require extensive data collection or training. We propose LightDefense, a lightweight defense mechanism targeted at white-box models, which utilizes a safety-oriented direction to adjust the probabilities of tokens in the vocabulary, making safety disclaimers appear among the top tokens after sorting tokens by probability in descending order. We further innovatively leverage LLM's uncertainty about prompts to measure their harmfulness and adaptively adjust defense strength, effectively balancing safety and helpfulness. The effectiveness of LightDefense in defending against 5 attack methods across 2 target LLMs, without compromising helpfulness to benign user queries, highlights its potential as a novel and lightweight defense mechanism, enhancing security of LLMs.

### The Ejection of Transient Jets in Swift J1727.8-1613 Revealed by   Time-Dependent Visibility Modelling

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:12:50Z

**Summary**: High angular resolution radio observations of relativistic jets are necessary to understand the causal connection between accretion and jet ejection in low mass X-ray binaries. Images from these observations can be difficult to reconstruct due to the rapid intra-observational motion and variability of transient jets. We have developed a time-dependent visibility model fitting and self-calibration procedure and applied it to a single four-hour VLBA observation of the low-mass X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613 during the bright flaring period of its 2023 outburst. This allowed us to detect and model a slightly resolved self-absorbed compact core, as well as three downstream transient jet knots. We were able to precisely measure the proper motion and flux density variability of these three jet knots, as well as (for the first time) their intra-observational expansion. Using simultaneous multi-frequency data, we were also able to measure the spectral index of the furthest downstream jet knot, and the core, as well as the frequency-dependent core shift between 2.3 and 8.3 GHz. Using these measurements, we inferred the ejection dates of the three jet knots, including one to within $\pm40$ minutes, which is one of the most precise ever measured. The ejection of the transient jet knots coincided with a bright X-ray flare and a drastic change in the X-ray spectral and timing properties as seen by HXMT, which is the clearest association ever seen between the launching of transient relativistic jets in an X-ray binary and a sudden change in the X-ray properties of the accretion inflow.

### On the limitations for causal inference in Cox models with time-varying   treatment
**Authors**: Mark B. Knudsen, Erin E. Gabriel, Torben Martinussen, Helene C. W. Rytgaard, Arvid Sjölander

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:10:48Z

**Summary**: When using the Cox model to analyze the effect of a time-varying treatment on a survival outcome, treatment is commonly included, using only the current level as a time-dependent covariate. Such a model does not necessarily assume that past treatment is not associated with the outcome (the Markov property), since it is possible to model the hazard conditional on only the current treatment value. However, modeling the hazard conditional on the full treatment history is required in order to interpret the results causally, and such a full model assumes the Markov property when only including current treatment. This is, for example, common in marginal structural Cox models. We demonstrate that relying on the Markov property is problematic, since it only holds in unrealistic settings or if the treatment has no causal effect. This is the case even if there are no confounders and the true causal effect of treatment really only depends on its current level. Further, we provide an example of a scenario where the Markov property is not fulfilled, but the Cox model that includes only current treatment as a covariate is correctly specified. Transforming the result to the survival scale does not give the true intervention-specific survival probabilities, showcasing that it is unclear how to make causal statements from such models.

### Adapting Knowledge Prompt Tuning for Enhanced Automated Program Repair
**Authors**: Xuemeng Cai, Lingxiao Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:10:02Z

**Summary**: Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to enhance software reliability by automatically generating bug-fixing patches. Recent work has improved the state-of-the-art of APR by fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as CodeT5, for APR. However, the effectiveness of fine-tuning becomes weakened in data scarcity scenarios, and data scarcity can be a common issue in practice, limiting fine-tuning performance. To alleviate this limitation, this paper adapts prompt tuning for enhanced APR and conducts a comprehensive study to evaluate its effectiveness in data scarcity scenarios, using three LLMs of different sizes and six diverse datasets across four programming languages. Prompt tuning rewrites the input to a model by adding extra prompt tokens and tunes both the model and the prompts on a small dataset. These tokens provide task-specific knowledge that can improve the model for APR, which is especially critical in data scarcity scenarios. Moreover, domain knowledge has proven crucial in many code intelligence tasks, but existing studies fail to leverage domain knowledge during the prompt tuning for APR. To close this gap, we introduce knowledge prompt tuning, an approach that adapts prompt tuning with six distinct types of code- or bug-related domain knowledge for APR. Our work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to adapt and evaluate prompt tuning and the effectiveness of code- or bug-related domain knowledge for APR, particularly under data scarcity settings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that prompt tuning with knowledge generally outperforms fine-tuning under various experimental settings, achieving an average improvement of 87.33% over fine-tuning in data scarcity scenarios.

### Redefining technology for indigenous languages
**Authors**: Silvia Fernandez-Sabido, Laura Peniche-Sabido

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:08:53Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we offer an overview of indigenous languages, identifying the causes of their devaluation and the need for legislation on language rights. We review the technologies used to revitalize these languages, finding that when they come from outside, they often have the opposite effect to what they seek; however, when developed from within communities, they become powerful instruments of expression. We propose that the inclusion of Indigenous knowledge in large language models (LLMs) will enrich the technological landscape, but must be done in a participatory environment that encourages the exchange of knowledge.

### Chain of Correction for Full-text Speech Recognition with Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Zhiyuan Tang, Dong Wang, Zhikai Zhou, Yong Liu, Shen Huang, Shidong Shang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:06:23Z

**Summary**: Full-text error correction with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has gained increased attention due to its potential to correct errors across long contexts and address a broader spectrum of error types, including punctuation restoration and inverse text normalization. Nevertheless, many challenges persist, including issues related to stability, controllability, completeness, and fluency. To mitigate these challenges, this paper proposes the Chain of Correction (CoC) for full-text error correction with LLMs, which corrects errors segment by segment using pre-recognized text as guidance within a regular multi-turn chat format. The CoC also uses pre-recognized full text for context, allowing the model to better grasp global semantics and maintain a comprehensive overview of the entire content. Utilizing the open-sourced full-text error correction dataset ChFT, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to evaluate the performance of the CoC framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the CoC effectively corrects errors in full-text ASR outputs, significantly outperforming baseline and benchmark systems. We further analyze how to set the correction threshold to balance under-correction and over-rephrasing, extrapolate the CoC model on extremely long ASR outputs, and investigate whether other types of information can be employed to guide the error correction process.

### Bench4Merge: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Merging in Realistic Dense   Traffic with Micro-Interactive Vehicles
**Authors**: Zhengming Wang, Junli Wang, Pengfei Li, Zhaohan Li, Chunyang Liu, Bo Zhang, Peng Li, Yilun Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:02:05Z

**Summary**: While the capabilities of autonomous driving have advanced rapidly, merging into dense traffic remains a significant challenge, many motion planning methods for this scenario have been proposed but it is hard to evaluate them. Most existing closed-loop simulators rely on rule-based controls for other vehicles, which results in a lack of diversity and randomness, thus failing to accurately assess the motion planning capabilities in highly interactive scenarios. Moreover, traditional evaluation metrics are insufficient for comprehensively evaluating the performance of merging in dense traffic. In response, we proposed a closed-loop evaluation benchmark for assessing motion planning capabilities in merging scenarios. Our approach involves other vehicles trained in large scale datasets with micro-behavioral characteristics that significantly enhance the complexity and diversity. Additionally, we have restructured the evaluation mechanism by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess each autonomous vehicle merging onto the main lane. Extensive experiments and test-vehicle deployment have demonstrated the progressiveness of this benchmark. Through this benchmark, we have obtained an evaluation of existing methods and identified common issues. The simulation environment and evaluation process can be accessed at https://github.com/WZM5853/Bench4Merge.

**Authors**: Zhengwei Tao, Zhi Jin, Bincheng Li, Xiaoying Bai, Haiyan Zhao, Chengfeng Dou, Xiancai Chen, Jia Li, Linyu Li, Chongyang Tao

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T08:57:42Z

**Summary**: Predicting future events stands as one of the ultimate aspirations of artificial intelligence. Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based systems have shown remarkable potential in forecasting future events, thereby garnering significant interest in the research community. Currently, several benchmarks have been established to evaluate the forecasting capabilities by formalizing the event prediction as a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and reasoning task. In these benchmarks, each prediction question is answered with relevant retrieved news articles. However, because there is no consideration on whether the questions can be supported by valid or sufficient supporting rationales, some of the questions in these benchmarks may be inherently noninferable. To address this issue, we introduce a new benchmark, PROPHET, which comprises inferable forecasting questions paired with relevant news for retrieval. To ensure the inferability of the benchmark, we propose Causal Intervened Likelihood (CIL), a statistical measure that assesses inferability through causal inference. In constructing this benchmark, we first collected recent trend forecasting questions and then filtered the data using CIL, resulting in an inferable benchmark for event prediction. Through extensive experiments, we first demonstrate the validity of CIL and in-depth investigations into event prediction with the aid of CIL. Subsequently, we evaluate several representative prediction systems on PROPHET, drawing valuable insights for future directions.

### UAKNN: Label Distribution Learning via Uncertainty-Aware KNN
**Authors**: Pu Wang, Yu Zhang, Zhuoran Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T08:57:23Z

**Summary**: Label Distribution Learning (LDL) aims to characterize the polysemy of an instance by building a set of descriptive degrees corresponding to the instance. In recent years, researchers seek to model to obtain an accurate label distribution by using low-rank, label relations, expert experiences, and label uncertainty estimation. In general, these methods are based on algorithms with parameter learning in a linear (including kernel functions) or deep learning framework. However, these methods are difficult to deploy and update online due to high training costs, limited scalability, and outlier sensitivity. To address this problem, we design a novel LDL method called UAKNN, which has the advantages of the KNN algorithm with the benefits of uncertainty modeling. In addition, we provide solutions to the dilemma of existing work on extremely label distribution spaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is significantly competitive on 12 benchmarks and that the inference speed of the model is well-suited for industrial-level applications.

### MLKV: Efficiently Scaling up Large Embedding Model Training with   Disk-based Key-Value Storage
**Authors**: Yongjun He, Roger Waleffe, Zhichao Han, Johnu George, Binhang Yuan, Zitao Zhang, Yinan Shan, Yang Zhao, Debojyoti Dutta, Theodoros Rekatsinas, Ce Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T08:57:01Z

**Summary**: Many modern machine learning (ML) methods rely on embedding models to learn vector representations (embeddings) for a set of entities (embedding tables). As increasingly diverse ML applications utilize embedding models and embedding tables continue to grow in size and number, there has been a surge in the ad-hoc development of specialized frameworks targeted to train large embedding models for specific tasks. Although the scalability issues that arise in different embedding model training tasks are similar, each of these frameworks independently reinvents and customizes storage components for specific tasks, leading to substantial duplicated engineering efforts in both development and deployment. This paper presents MLKV, an efficient, extensible, and reusable data storage framework designed to address the scalability challenges in embedding model training, specifically data stall and staleness. MLKV augments disk-based key-value storage by democratizing optimizations that were previously exclusive to individual specialized frameworks and provides easy-to-use interfaces for embedding model training tasks. Extensive experiments on open-source workloads, as well as applications in eBay's payment transaction risk detection and seller payment risk detection, show that MLKV outperforms offloading strategies built on top of industrial-strength key-value stores by 1.6-12.6x. MLKV is open-source at https://github.com/llm-db/MLKV.

### Do We Truly Need So Many Samples? Multi-LLM Repeated Sampling   Efficiently Scales Test-Time Compute
**Authors**: Jianhao Chen, Zishuo Xun, Bocheng Zhou, Han Qi, Qiaosheng Zhang, Yang Chen, Wei Hu, Yuzhong Qu, Wanli Ouyang, Shuyue Hu

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T08:55:04Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a simple, effective, and cost-efficient strategy to improve LLM performance by scaling test-time compute. Our strategy builds upon the repeated-sampling-then-voting framework, with a novel twist: incorporating multiple models, even weaker ones, to leverage their complementary strengths that potentially arise from diverse training data and paradigms. By using consistency as a signal, our strategy dynamically switches between models. Theoretical analysis highlights the efficiency and performance advantages of our strategy. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our strategy not only outperforms self-consistency and state-of-the-art multi-agent debate approaches, but also significantly reduces inference costs. Additionally, ModelSwitch requires only a few comparable LLMs to achieve optimal performance and can be extended with verification methods, demonstrating the potential of leveraging multiple LLMs in the generation-verification paradigm.

### Linear Representations of Political Perspective Emerge in Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Junsol Kim, James Evans, Aaron Schein

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T08:53:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate text that realistically reflects a range of different subjective human perspectives. This paper studies how LLMs are seemingly able to reflect more liberal versus more conservative viewpoints among other political perspectives in American politics. We show that LLMs possess linear representations of political perspectives within activation space, wherein more similar perspectives are represented closer together. To do so, we probe the attention heads across the layers of three open transformer-based LLMs (Llama-2-7b-chat, Mistral-7b-instruct, Vicuna-7b). We first prompt models to generate text from the perspectives of different U.S. lawmakers. We then identify sets of attention heads whose activations linearly predict those lawmakers' DW-NOMINATE scores, a widely-used and validated measure of political ideology. We find that highly predictive heads are primarily located in the middle layers, often speculated to encode high-level concepts and tasks. Using probes only trained to predict lawmakers' ideology, we then show that the same probes can predict measures of news outlets' slant from the activations of models prompted to simulate text from those news outlets. These linear probes allow us to visualize, interpret, and monitor ideological stances implicitly adopted by an LLM as it generates open-ended responses. Finally, we demonstrate that by applying linear interventions to these attention heads, we can steer the model outputs toward a more liberal or conservative stance. Overall, our research suggests that LLMs possess a high-level linear representation of American political ideology and that by leveraging recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we can identify, monitor, and steer the subjective perspective underlying generated text.

### Are Autonomous Web Agents Good Testers?
**Authors**: Antoine Chevrot, Alexandre Vernotte, Jean-Rémy Falleri, Xavier Blanc, Bruno Legeard

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T08:48:01Z

**Summary**: Despite advances in automated testing, manual testing remains prevalent due to the high maintenance demands associated with test script fragility-scripts often break with minor changes in application structure. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential alternative by powering Autonomous Web Agents (AWAs) that can autonomously interact with applications. These agents may serve as Autonomous Test Agents (ATAs), potentially reducing the need for maintenance-heavy automated scripts by utilising natural language instructions similar to those used by human testers. This paper investigates the feasibility of adapting AWAs for natural language test case execution and how to evaluate them. We contribute with (1) a benchmark of three offline web applications, and a suite of 113 manual test cases, split between passing and failing cases, to evaluate and compare ATAs performance, (2) SeeAct-ATA and pinATA, two open-source ATA implementations capable of executing test steps, verifying assertions and giving verdicts, and (3) comparative experiments using our benchmark that quantifies our ATAs effectiveness. Finally we also proceed to a qualitative evaluation to identify the limitations of PinATA, our best performing implementation. Our findings reveal that our simple implementation, SeeAct-ATA, does not perform well compared to our more advanced PinATA implementation when executing test cases (50% performance improvement). However, while PinATA obtains around 60% of correct verdict and up to a promising 94% specificity, we identify several limitations that need to be addressed to develop more resilient and reliable ATAs, paving the way for robust, low maintenance test automation.

## Keyword: LLM Deployment 
 ### The LLM Wears Prada: Analysing Gender Bias and Stereotypes through   Online Shopping Data
**Authors**: Massimiliano Luca, Ciro Beneduce, Bruno Lepri, Jacopo Staiano

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:56:08Z

**Summary**: With the wide and cross-domain adoption of Large Language Models, it becomes crucial to assess to which extent the statistical correlations in training data, which underlie their impressive performance, hide subtle and potentially troubling biases. Gender bias in LLMs has been widely investigated from the perspectives of works, hobbies, and emotions typically associated with a specific gender. In this study, we introduce a novel perspective. We investigate whether LLMs can predict an individual's gender based solely on online shopping histories and whether these predictions are influenced by gender biases and stereotypes. Using a dataset of historical online purchases from users in the United States, we evaluate the ability of six LLMs to classify gender and we then analyze their reasoning and products-gender co-occurrences. Results indicate that while models can infer gender with moderate accuracy, their decisions are often rooted in stereotypical associations between product categories and gender. Furthermore, explicit instructions to avoid bias reduce the certainty of model predictions, but do not eliminate stereotypical patterns. Our findings highlight the persistent nature of gender biases in LLMs and emphasize the need for robust bias-mitigation strategies.

### OpenCodeReasoning: Advancing Data Distillation for Competitive Coding
**Authors**: Wasi Uddin Ahmad, Sean Narenthiran, Somshubra Majumdar, Aleksander Ficek, Siddhartha Jain, Jocelyn Huang, Vahid Noroozi, Boris Ginsburg

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:50:31Z

**Summary**: Since the advent of reasoning-based large language models, many have found great success from distilling reasoning capabilities into student models. Such techniques have significantly bridged the gap between reasoning and standard LLMs on coding tasks. Despite this, much of the progress on distilling reasoning models remains locked behind proprietary datasets or lacks details on data curation, filtering and subsequent training. To address this, we construct a superior supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset that we use to achieve state-of-the-art coding capability results in models of various sizes. Our distilled models use only SFT to achieve 61.8% on LiveCodeBench and 24.6% on CodeContests, surpassing alternatives trained with reinforcement learning. We then perform analysis on the data sources used to construct our dataset, the impact of code execution filtering, and the importance of instruction/solution diversity. We observe that execution filtering negatively affected benchmark accuracy, leading us to prioritize instruction diversity over solution correctness. Finally, we also analyze the token efficiency and reasoning patterns utilized by these models. We will open-source these datasets and distilled models to the community.

### Critical Thinking: Which Kinds of Complexity Govern Optimal Reasoning   Length?
**Authors**: Celine Lee, Alexander M. Rush, Keyon Vafa

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:45:58Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often benefit from verbalized reasoning at inference time, but it remains unclear which aspects of task difficulty these extra reasoning tokens address. To investigate this question, we formalize a framework using deterministic finite automata (DFAs). DFAs offer a formalism through which we can characterize task complexity through measurable properties such as run length (number of reasoning steps required) and state-space size (decision complexity). We first show that across different tasks and models of different sizes and training paradigms, there exists an optimal amount of reasoning tokens such that the probability of producing a correct solution is maximized. We then investigate which properties of complexity govern this critical length: we find that task instances with longer corresponding underlying DFA runs (i.e. demand greater latent state-tracking requirements) correlate with longer reasoning lengths, but, surprisingly, that DFA size (i.e. state-space complexity) does not. We then demonstrate an implication of these findings: being able to predict the optimal number of reasoning tokens for new problems and filtering out non-optimal length answers results in consistent accuracy improvements.

### Lost in Sequence: Do Large Language Models Understand Sequential   Recommendation?
**Authors**: Sein Kim, Hongseok Kang, Kibum Kim, Jiwan Kim, Donghyun Kim, Minchul Yang, Kwangjin Oh, Julian McAuley, Chanyoung Park

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:42:03Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for recommendation thanks to their advanced textual understanding ability and context-awareness. Despite the current practice of training and evaluating LLM-based recommendation (LLM4Rec) models under a sequential recommendation scenario, we found that whether these models understand the sequential information inherent in users' item interaction sequences has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we first demonstrate through a series of experiments that existing LLM4Rec models do not fully capture sequential information both during training and inference. Then, we propose a simple yet effective LLM-based sequential recommender, called LLM-SRec, a method that enhances the integration of sequential information into LLMs by distilling the user representations extracted from a pre-trained CF-SRec model into LLMs. Our extensive experiments show that LLM-SRec enhances LLMs' ability to understand users' item interaction sequences, ultimately leading to improved recommendation performance. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM4Rec models that require fine-tuning of LLMs, LLM-SRec achieves state-of-the-art performance by training only a few lightweight MLPs, highlighting its practicality in real-world applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/Sein-Kim/LLM-SRec.

### Review, Refine, Repeat: Understanding Iterative Decoding of AI Agents   with Dynamic Evaluation and Selection
**Authors**: Souradip Chakraborty, Mohammadreza Pourreza, Ruoxi Sun, Yiwen Song, Nino Scherrer, Jindong Gu, Furong Huang, Amrit Singh Bedi, Ahmad Beirami, Hamid Palangi, Tomas Pfister

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:40:47Z

**Summary**: While AI agents have shown remarkable performance at various tasks, they still struggle with complex multi-modal applications, structured generation and strategic planning. Improvements via standard fine-tuning is often impractical, as solving agentic tasks usually relies on black box API access without control over model parameters. Inference-time methods such as Best-of-N (BON) sampling offer a simple yet effective alternative to improve performance. However, BON lacks iterative feedback integration mechanism. Hence, we propose Iterative Agent Decoding (IAD) which combines iterative refinement with dynamic candidate evaluation and selection guided by a verifier. IAD differs in how feedback is designed and integrated, specifically optimized to extract maximal signal from reward scores. We conduct a detailed comparison of baselines across key metrics on Sketch2Code, Text2SQL, and Webshop where IAD consistently outperforms baselines, achieving 3--6% absolute gains on Sketch2Code and Text2SQL (with and without LLM judges) and 8--10% gains on Webshop across multiple metrics. To better understand the source of IAD's gains, we perform controlled experiments to disentangle the effect of adaptive feedback from stochastic sampling, and find that IAD's improvements are primarily driven by verifier-guided refinement, not merely sampling diversity. We also show that both IAD and BON exhibit inference-time scaling with increased compute when guided by an optimal verifier. Our analysis highlights the critical role of verifier quality in effective inference-time optimization and examines the impact of noisy and sparse rewards on scaling behavior. Together, these findings offer key insights into the trade-offs and principles of effective inference-time optimization.

### A thorough benchmark of automatic text classification: From traditional   approaches to large language models
**Authors**: Washington Cunha, Leonardo Rocha, Marcos André Gonçalves

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:40:08Z

**Summary**: Automatic text classification (ATC) has experienced remarkable advancements in the past decade, best exemplified by recent small and large language models (SLMs and LLMs), leveraged by Transformer architectures. Despite recent effectiveness improvements, a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis investigating whether the effectiveness gains of these recent approaches compensate their much higher costs when compared to more traditional text classification approaches such as SVMs and Logistic Regression is still missing in the literature. In this context, this work's main contributions are twofold: (i) we provide a scientifically sound comparative analysis of the cost-benefit of twelve traditional and recent ATC solutions including five open LLMs, and (ii) a large benchmark comprising {22 datasets}, including sentiment analysis and topic classification, with their (train-validation-test) partitions based on folded cross-validation procedures, along with documentation, and code. The release of code, data, and documentation enables the community to replicate experiments and advance the field in a more scientifically sound manner. Our comparative experimental results indicate that LLMs outperform traditional approaches (up to 26%-7.1% on average) and SLMs (up to 4.9%-1.9% on average) in terms of effectiveness. However, LLMs incur significantly higher computational costs due to fine-tuning, being, on average 590x and 8.5x slower than traditional methods and SLMs, respectively. Results suggests the following recommendations: (1) LLMs for applications that require the best possible effectiveness and can afford the costs; (2) traditional methods such as Logistic Regression and SVM for resource-limited applications or those that cannot afford the cost of tuning large LLMs; and (3) SLMs like Roberta for near-optimal effectiveness-efficiency trade-off.

### Is the Reversal Curse a Binding Problem? Uncovering Limitations of   Transformers from a Basic Generalization Failure
**Authors**: Boshi Wang, Huan Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:38:03Z

**Summary**: Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs exhibit a basic generalization failure known as the Reversal Curse, where they struggle to learn reversible factual associations. Understanding why this occurs could help identify weaknesses in current models and advance their generalization and robustness. In this paper, we conjecture that the Reversal Curse in LLMs is a manifestation of the long-standing binding problem in cognitive science, neuroscience and AI. Specifically, we identify two primary causes of the Reversal Curse stemming from transformers' limitations in conceptual binding: the inconsistency and entanglements of concept representations. We perform a series of experiments that support these conjectures. Our exploration leads to a model design based on JEPA (Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture) that for the first time breaks the Reversal Curse without side-stepping it with specialized data augmentation or non-causal masking, and moreover, generalization could be further improved by incorporating special memory layers that support disentangled concept representations. We demonstrate that the skill of reversal unlocks a new kind of memory integration that enables models to solve large-scale arithmetic reasoning problems via parametric forward-chaining, outperforming frontier LLMs based on non-parametric memory and prolonged explicit reasoning.

### Gen-C: Populating Virtual Worlds with Generative Crowds
**Authors**: Andreas Panayiotou, Panayiotis Charalambous, Ioannis Karamouzas

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:33:53Z

**Summary**: Over the past two decades, researchers have made significant advancements in simulating human crowds, yet these efforts largely focus on low-level tasks like collision avoidance and a narrow range of behaviors such as path following and flocking. However, creating compelling crowd scenes demands more than just functional movement-it requires capturing high-level interactions between agents, their environment, and each other over time. To address this issue, we introduce Gen-C, a generative model to automate the task of authoring high-level crowd behaviors. Gen-C bypasses the labor-intensive and challenging task of collecting and annotating real crowd video data by leveraging a large language model (LLM) to generate a limited set of crowd scenarios, which are subsequently expanded and generalized through simulations to construct time-expanded graphs that model the actions and interactions of virtual agents. Our method employs two Variational Graph Auto-Encoders guided by a condition prior network: one dedicated to learning a latent space for graph structures (agent interactions) and the other for node features (agent actions and navigation). This setup enables the flexible generation of dynamic crowd interactions. The trained model can be conditioned on natural language, empowering users to synthesize novel crowd behaviors from text descriptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in two scenarios, a University Campus and a Train Station, showcasing its potential for populating diverse virtual environments with agents exhibiting varied and dynamic behaviors that reflect complex interactions and high-level decision-making patterns.

### Ensuring Safe and Smooth Control in Safety-Critical Systems via Filtered   Control Barrier Functions
**Authors**: Shuo Liu, Wei Xiao, Calin A. Belta

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:33:38Z

**Summary**: In safety-critical control systems, ensuring both system safety and smooth control input is essential for theoretical guarantees and practical deployment. Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) frameworks, especially High-Order CBFs (HOCBFs), effectively enforce safety constraints but often lead to nonsmooth or discontinuous control inputs that can degrade system performance or violate actuator limitations. This paper introduces Filtered Control Barrier Functions (FCBFs), which extend HOCBFs by incorporating an auxiliary dynamic system - referred to as input regularization filter - to produce Lipschitz continuous control inputs. The proposed framework ensures safety, control bounds, and smoothness simultaneously by integrating FCBFs and HOCBFs within a unified quadratic program (QP). Theoretical guarantees are provided and simulations on a unicycle model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to standard and smoothness-penalized HOCBF approaches.

### Bridging the Linguistic Divide: A Survey on Leveraging Large Language   Models for Machine Translation
**Authors**: Baban Gain, Dibyanayan Bandyopadhyay, Asif Ekbal

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:26:40Z

**Summary**: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly reshaped the landscape of machine translation (MT), particularly for low-resource languages and domains that lack sufficient parallel corpora, linguistic tools, and computational infrastructure. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of recent progress in leveraging LLMs for MT. We analyze techniques such as few-shot prompting, cross-lingual transfer, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning that enable effective adaptation to under-resourced settings. The paper also explores synthetic data generation strategies using LLMs, including back-translation and lexical augmentation. Additionally, we compare LLM-based translation with traditional encoder-decoder models across diverse language pairs, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each. We discuss persistent challenges such as hallucinations, evaluation inconsistencies, and inherited biases while also evaluating emerging LLM-driven metrics for translation quality. This survey offers practical insights and outlines future directions for building robust, inclusive, and scalable MT systems in the era of large-scale generative models.

### Should AI Optimize Your Code? A Comparative Study of Classical   Optimizing Compilers Versus Current Large Language Models
**Authors**: Miguel Romero Rosas, Miguel Torres Sanchez, Rudolf Eigenmann

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:22:18Z

**Summary**: Traditional optimizing compilers have played an important role in adapting to the growing complexity of modern software systems. The need for efficient parallel programming in current architectures requires strong optimization techniques. The beginning of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises intriguing questions about the potential of these AI approaches to revolutionize code optimization methodologies. This work aims to answer an essential question for the compiler community: "Can AI-driven models revolutionize the way we approach code optimization?".   To address this question, we present a comparative analysis between three classical optimizing compilers and two recent large language models, evaluating their respective abilities and limitations in optimizing code for maximum efficiency. In addition, we introduce a benchmark suite of challenging optimization patterns and an automatic mechanism for evaluating the performance and correctness of the code generated by LLMs. We used three different prompting strategies to evaluate the performance of the LLMs, Simple Instruction (IP), Detailed Instruction Prompting (DIP), and Chain of Thought (CoT).   A key finding is that while LLMs have the potential to outperform current optimizing compilers, they often generate incorrect code on large code sizes, calling for automated verification methods. In addition, expressing a compiler strategy as part of the LLMs prompt substantially improves its overall performance. Our evaluation across three benchmark suites shows CodeLlama-70B as the superior LLM, capable of achieving speedups of up to x1.75. Additionally, CETUS is the best among the current optimizing compilers, achieving a maximum speedup of 1.67x. We also found substantial differences among the three prompting strategies.

### Advancing AI-Scientist Understanding: Making LLM Think Like a Physicist   with Interpretable Reasoning
**Authors**: Yinggan Xu, Hana Kimlee, Yijia Xiao, Di Luo

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:13:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing an expanding role in physics research by enhancing reasoning, symbolic manipulation, and numerical computation. However, ensuring the reliability and interpretability of their outputs remains a significant challenge. In our framework, we conceptualize the collaboration between AI and human scientists as a dynamic interplay among three modules: the reasoning module, the interpretation module, and the AI-scientist interaction module. Recognizing that effective physics reasoning demands rigorous logical consistency, quantitative precision, and deep integration with established theoretical models, we introduce the interpretation module to improve the understanding of AI-generated outputs, which is not previously explored in the literature. This module comprises multiple specialized agents, including summarizers, model builders, UI builders, and testers, which collaboratively structure LLM outputs within a physically grounded framework, by constructing a more interpretable science model. A case study demonstrates that our approach enhances transparency, facilitates validation, and strengthens AI-augmented reasoning in scientific discovery.

### Build Code Needs Maintenance Too: A Study on Refactoring and Technical   Debt in Build Systems
**Authors**: Anwar Ghammam, Dhia Elhaq Rzig, Mohamed Almukhtar, Rania Khalsi, Foyzul Hassan, Marouane Kessentini

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:07:38Z

**Summary**: In modern software engineering, build systems play the crucial role of facilitating the conversion of source code into software artifacts. Recent research has explored high-level causes of build failures, but has largely overlooked the structural properties of build files. Akin to source code, build systems face technical debt challenges that hinder maintenance and optimization. While refactoring is often seen as a key tool for addressing technical debt in source code, there is a significant research gap regarding the specific refactoring changes developers apply to build code and whether these refactorings effectively address technical debt. In this paper, we address this gap by examining refactorings applied to build scripts in open-source projects, covering the widely used build systems of Gradle, Ant, and Maven. Additionally, we investigate whether these refactorings are used to tackle technical debts in build systems. Our analysis was conducted on \totalCommits examined build-file-related commits. We identified \totalRefactoringCategories build-related refactorings, which we divided into \totalCategories main categories. These refactorings are organized into the first empirically derived taxonomy of build system refactorings. Furthermore, we investigate how developers employ these refactoring types to address technical debts via a manual commit-analysis and a developer survey. In this context, we identified \totalTechnicalDebts technical debts addressed by these refactorings and discussed their correlation with the different refactorings. Finally, we introduce BuildRefMiner, an LLM-powered tool leveraging GPT-4o to automate the detection of refactorings within build systems. We evaluated its performance and found that it achieves an F1 score of \toolFoneScore across all build systems.

**Authors**: Zijun Wang, Haoqin Tu, Yuhan Wang, Juncheng Wu, Jieru Mei, Brian R. Bartoldson, Bhavya Kailkhura, Cihang Xie

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T17:04:04Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces STAR-1, a high-quality, just-1k-scale safety dataset specifically designed for large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1. Built on three core principles -- diversity, deliberative reasoning, and rigorous filtering -- STAR-1 aims to address the critical needs for safety alignment in LRMs. Specifically, we begin by integrating existing open-source safety datasets from diverse sources. Then, we curate safety policies to generate policy-grounded deliberative reasoning samples. Lastly, we apply a GPT-4o-based safety scoring system to select training examples aligned with best practices. Experimental results show that fine-tuning LRMs with STAR-1 leads to an average 40% improvement in safety performance across four benchmarks, while only incurring a marginal decrease (e.g., an average of 1.1%) in reasoning ability measured across five reasoning tasks. Extensive ablation studies further validate the importance of our design principles in constructing STAR-1 and analyze its efficacy across both LRMs and traditional LLMs. Our project page is https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/STAR-1.

### Multilingual European Language Models: Benchmarking Approaches and   Challenges
**Authors**: Fabio Barth, Georg Rehm

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:57:12Z

**Summary**: The breakthrough of generative large language models (LLMs) that can solve different tasks through chat interaction has led to a significant increase in the use of general benchmarks to assess the quality or performance of these models beyond individual applications. There is also a need for better methods to evaluate and also to compare models due to the ever increasing number of new models published. However, most of the established benchmarks revolve around the English language. This paper analyses the benefits and limitations of current evaluation datasets, focusing on multilingual European benchmarks. We analyse seven multilingual benchmarks and identify four major challenges. Furthermore, we discuss potential solutions to enhance translation quality and mitigate cultural biases, including human-in-the-loop verification and iterative translation ranking. Our analysis highlights the need for culturally aware and rigorously validated benchmarks to assess the reasoning and question-answering capabilities of multilingual LLMs accurately.

**Authors**: Abhilash Shankarampeta, Harsh Mahajan, Tushar Kataria, Dan Roth, Vivek Gupta

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:34:43Z

**Summary**: Humans continuously make new discoveries, and understanding temporal sequence of events leading to these breakthroughs is essential for advancing science and society. This ability to reason over time allows us to identify future steps and understand the effects of financial and political decisions on our lives. However, large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on static datasets, limiting their ability to perform effective temporal reasoning. To assess the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we present the TRANSIENTTABLES dataset, which comprises 3,971 questions derived from over 14,000 tables, spanning 1,238 entities across multiple time periods. We introduce a template-based question-generation pipeline that harnesses LLMs to refine both templates and questions. Additionally, we establish baseline results using state-of-the-art LLMs to create a benchmark. We also introduce novel modeling strategies centered around task decomposition, enhancing LLM performance.

### Interpreting Emergent Planning in Model-Free Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Thomas Bush, Stephen Chung, Usman Anwar, Adrià Garriga-Alonso, David Krueger

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:24:23Z

**Summary**: We present the first mechanistic evidence that model-free reinforcement learning agents can learn to plan. This is achieved by applying a methodology based on concept-based interpretability to a model-free agent in Sokoban -- a commonly used benchmark for studying planning. Specifically, we demonstrate that DRC, a generic model-free agent introduced by Guez et al. (2019), uses learned concept representations to internally formulate plans that both predict the long-term effects of actions on the environment and influence action selection. Our methodology involves: (1) probing for planning-relevant concepts, (2) investigating plan formation within the agent's representations, and (3) verifying that discovered plans (in the agent's representations) have a causal effect on the agent's behavior through interventions. We also show that the emergence of these plans coincides with the emergence of a planning-like property: the ability to benefit from additional test-time compute. Finally, we perform a qualitative analysis of the planning algorithm learned by the agent and discover a strong resemblance to parallelized bidirectional search. Our findings advance understanding of the internal mechanisms underlying planning behavior in agents, which is important given the recent trend of emergent planning and reasoning capabilities in LLMs through RL

### Automate Strategy Finding with LLM in Quant Investment
**Authors**: Zhizhuo Kou, Holam Yu, Junyu Luo, Jingshu Peng, Lei Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:21:22Z

**Summary**: Despite significant progress in deep learning for financial trading, existing models often face instability and high uncertainty, hindering their practical application. Leveraging advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-agent architectures, we propose a novel framework for quantitative stock investment in portfolio management and alpha mining. Our framework addresses these issues by integrating LLMs to generate diversified alphas and employing a multi-agent approach to dynamically evaluate market conditions. This paper proposes a framework where large language models (LLMs) mine alpha factors from multimodal financial data, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics. The first module extracts predictive signals by integrating numerical data, research papers, and visual charts. The second module uses ensemble learning to construct a diverse pool of trading agents with varying risk preferences, enhancing strategy performance through a broader market analysis. In the third module, a dynamic weight-gating mechanism selects and assigns weights to the most relevant agents based on real-time market conditions, enabling the creation of an adaptive and context-aware composite alpha formula. Extensive experiments on the Chinese stock markets demonstrate that this framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple financial metrics. The results underscore the efficacy of combining LLM-generated alphas with a multi-agent architecture to achieve superior trading performance and stability. This work highlights the potential of AI-driven approaches in enhancing quantitative investment strategies and sets a new benchmark for integrating advanced machine learning techniques in financial trading can also be applied on diverse markets.

### From Code Generation to Software Testing: AI Copilot with Context-Based   RAG
**Authors**: Yuchen Wang, Shangxin Guo, Chee Wei Tan

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:20:05Z

**Summary**: The rapid pace of large-scale software development places increasing demands on traditional testing methodologies, often leading to bottlenecks in efficiency, accuracy, and coverage. We propose a novel perspective on software testing by positing bug detection and coding with fewer bugs as two interconnected problems that share a common goal, which is reducing bugs with limited resources. We extend our previous work on AI-assisted programming, which supports code auto-completion and chatbot-powered Q&A, to the realm of software testing. We introduce Copilot for Testing, an automated testing system that synchronizes bug detection with codebase updates, leveraging context-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Our evaluation demonstrates a 31.2% improvement in bug detection accuracy, a 12.6% increase in critical test coverage, and a 10.5% higher user acceptance rate, highlighting the transformative potential of AI-driven technologies in modern software development practices.

### Large Language Model Can Transcribe Speech in Multi-Talker Scenarios   with Versatile Instructions
**Authors**: Lingwei Meng, Shujie Hu, Jiawen Kang, Zhaoqing Li, Yuejiao Wang, Wenxuan Wu, Xixin Wu, Xunying Liu, Helen Meng

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:16:33Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, bringing significant progress and new opportunities. Despite progress in speech-related tasks, LLMs have not been sufficiently explored in multi-talker scenarios. In this work, we present a pioneering effort to investigate the capability of LLMs in transcribing speech in multi-talker environments, following versatile instructions related to multi-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR), target talker ASR, and ASR based on specific talker attributes such as sex, occurrence order, language, and keyword spoken. Our approach utilizes WavLM and Whisper encoder to extract multi-faceted speech representations that are sensitive to speaker characteristics and semantic context. These representations are then fed into an LLM fine-tuned using LoRA, enabling the capabilities for speech comprehension and transcription. Comprehensive experiments reveal the promising performance of our proposed system, MT-LLM, in cocktail party scenarios, highlighting the potential of LLM to handle speech-related tasks based on user instructions in such complex settings. The code, model, and samples are available at https://github.com/cuhealthybrains/MT-LLM.

### Cross-Lingual Consistency: A Novel Inference Framework for Advancing   Reasoning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhiwei Yu, Tuo Li, Changhong Wang, Hui Chen, Lang Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:09:39Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-thought (CoT) has emerged as a critical mechanism for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), with self-consistency demonstrating notable promise in boosting performance. However, inherent linguistic biases in multilingual training corpora frequently cause semantic drift and logical inconsistencies, especially in sub-10B parameter LLMs handling complex inference tasks. To overcome these constraints, we propose the Cross-Lingual Consistency (CLC) framework, an innovative inference paradigm that integrates multilingual reasoning paths through majority voting to elevate LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Empirical evaluations on the CMATH dataset reveal CLC's superiority over the conventional self-consistency method, delivering 9.5%, 6.5%, and 6.0% absolute accuracy gains for DeepSeek-Math-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct, and Gemma2-9B-Instruct respectively. Expanding CLC's linguistic scope to 11 diverse languages implies two synergistic benefits: 1) neutralizing linguistic biases in multilingual training corpora through multilingual ensemble voting, 2) escaping monolingual reasoning traps by exploring the broader multilingual solution space. This dual benefits empirically enables more globally optimal reasoning paths compared to monolingual self-consistency baselines, as evidenced by the 4.1%-18.5% accuracy gains using Gemma2-9B-Instruct on the MGSM dataset.

### Code Red! On the Harmfulness of Applying Off-the-shelf Large Language   Models to Programming Tasks
**Authors**: Ali Al-Kaswan, Sebastian Deatc, Begüm Koç, Arie van Deursen, Maliheh Izadi

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T16:00:14Z

**Summary**: Nowadays, developers increasingly rely on solutions powered by Large Language Models (LLM) to assist them with their coding tasks. This makes it crucial to align these tools with human values to prevent malicious misuse. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for assessing the potential harmfulness of LLMs within the software engineering domain. We begin by developing a taxonomy of potentially harmful software engineering scenarios and subsequently, create a dataset of prompts based on this taxonomy. To systematically assess the responses, we design and validate an automatic evaluator that classifies the outputs of a variety of LLMs both open-source and closed-source models, as well as general-purpose and code-specific LLMs. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of models size, architecture family, and alignment strategies on their tendency to generate harmful content. The results show significant disparities in the alignment of various LLMs for harmlessness. We find that some models and model families, such as Openhermes, are more harmful than others and that code-specific models do not perform better than their general-purpose counterparts. Notably, some fine-tuned models perform significantly worse than their base-models due to their design choices. On the other side, we find that larger models tend to be more helpful and are less likely to respond with harmful information. These results highlight the importance of targeted alignment strategies tailored to the unique challenges of software engineering tasks and provide a foundation for future work in this critical area.

**Authors**: Giulio Starace, Oliver Jaffe, Dane Sherburn, James Aung, Jun Shern Chan, Leon Maksin, Rachel Dias, Evan Mays, Benjamin Kinsella, Wyatt Thompson, Johannes Heidecke, Amelia Glaese, Tejal Patwardhan

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T15:55:24Z

**Summary**: We introduce PaperBench, a benchmark evaluating the ability of AI agents to replicate state-of-the-art AI research. Agents must replicate 20 ICML 2024 Spotlight and Oral papers from scratch, including understanding paper contributions, developing a codebase, and successfully executing experiments. For objective evaluation, we develop rubrics that hierarchically decompose each replication task into smaller sub-tasks with clear grading criteria. In total, PaperBench contains 8,316 individually gradable tasks. Rubrics are co-developed with the author(s) of each ICML paper for accuracy and realism. To enable scalable evaluation, we also develop an LLM-based judge to automatically grade replication attempts against rubrics, and assess our judge's performance by creating a separate benchmark for judges. We evaluate several frontier models on PaperBench, finding that the best-performing tested agent, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New) with open-source scaffolding, achieves an average replication score of 21.0\%. Finally, we recruit top ML PhDs to attempt a subset of PaperBench, finding that models do not yet outperform the human baseline.

### LARGE: Legal Retrieval Augmented Generation Evaluation Tool
**Authors**: Minhu Park, Hongseok Oh, Eunkyung Choi, Wonseok Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T15:45:03Z

**Summary**: Recently, building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to enhance the capability of large language models (LLMs) has become a common practice. Especially in the legal domain, previous judicial decisions play a significant role under the doctrine of stare decisis which emphasizes the importance of making decisions based on (retrieved) prior documents. However, the overall performance of RAG system depends on many components: (1) retrieval corpora, (2) retrieval algorithms, (3) rerankers, (4) LLM backbones, and (5) evaluation metrics. Here we propose LRAGE, an open-source tool for holistic evaluation of RAG systems focusing on the legal domain. LRAGE provides GUI and CLI interfaces to facilitate seamless experiments and investigate how changes in the aforementioned five components affect the overall accuracy. We validated LRAGE using multilingual legal benches including Korean (KBL), English (LegalBench), and Chinese (LawBench) by demonstrating how the overall accuracy changes when varying the five components mentioned above. The source code is available at https://github.com/hoorangyee/LRAGE.

### YourBench: Easy Custom Evaluation Sets for Everyone
**Authors**: Sumuk Shashidhar, Clémentine Fourrier, Alina Lozovskia, Thomas Wolf, Gokhan Tur, Dilek Hakkani-Tür

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T15:40:24Z

**Summary**: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) effectively remains a critical bottleneck, as traditional static benchmarks suffer from saturation and contamination, while human evaluations are costly and slow. This hinders timely or domain-specific assessment, crucial for real-world applications. We introduce YourBench, a novel, open-source framework that addresses these limitations by enabling dynamic, automated generation of reliable, up-to-date, and domain-tailored benchmarks cheaply and without manual annotation, directly from user-provided documents. We demonstrate its efficacy by replicating 7 diverse MMLU subsets using minimal source text, achieving this for under 15 USD in total inference costs while perfectly preserving the relative model performance rankings (Spearman Rho = 1) observed on the original benchmark. To ensure that YourBench generates data grounded in provided input instead of relying on posterior parametric knowledge in models, we also introduce Tempora-0325, a novel dataset of over 7K diverse documents, published exclusively after March 2025. Our comprehensive analysis spans 26 SoTA models from 7 major families across varying scales (3-671B parameters) to validate the quality of generated evaluations through rigorous algorithmic checks (e.g., citation grounding) and human assessments. We release the YourBench library, the Tempora-0325 dataset, 150k+ question answer pairs based on Tempora and all evaluation and inference traces to facilitate reproducible research and empower the community to generate bespoke benchmarks on demand, fostering more relevant and trustworthy LLM evaluation.

### Can A Society of Generative Agents Simulate Human Behavior and Inform   Public Health Policy? A Case Study on Vaccine Hesitancy
**Authors**: Abe Bohan Hou, Hongru Du, Yichen Wang, Jingyu Zhang, Zixiao Wang, Paul Pu Liang, Daniel Khashabi, Lauren Gardner, Tianxing He

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T15:30:46Z

**Summary**: Can we simulate a sandbox society with generative agents to model human behavior, thereby reducing the over-reliance on real human trials for assessing public policies? In this work, we investigate the feasibility of simulating health-related decision-making, using vaccine hesitancy, defined as the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccination services (MacDonald, 2015), as a case study. To this end, we introduce the VacSim framework with 100 generative agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). VacSim simulates vaccine policy outcomes with the following steps: 1) instantiate a population of agents with demographics based on census data; 2) connect the agents via a social network and model vaccine attitudes as a function of social dynamics and disease-related information; 3) design and evaluate various public health interventions aimed at mitigating vaccine hesitancy. To align with real-world results, we also introduce simulation warmup and attitude modulation to adjust agents' attitudes. We propose a series of evaluations to assess the reliability of various LLM simulations. Experiments indicate that models like Llama and Qwen can simulate aspects of human behavior but also highlight real-world alignment challenges, such as inconsistent responses with demographic profiles. This early exploration of LLM-driven simulations is not meant to serve as definitive policy guidance; instead, it serves as a call for action to examine social simulation for policy development.

### Non-Determinism of "Deterministic" LLM Settings
**Authors**: Berk Atil, Sarp Aykent, Alexa Chittams, Lisheng Fu, Rebecca J. Passonneau, Evan Radcliffe, Guru Rajan Rajagopal, Adam Sloan, Tomasz Tudrej, Ferhan Ture, Zhe Wu, Lixinyu Xu, Breck Baldwin

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T15:17:02Z

**Summary**: LLM (large language model) practitioners commonly notice that outputs can vary for the same inputs under settings expected to be deterministic. Yet the questions of how pervasive this is, and with what impact on results, have not to our knowledge been systematically investigated. We investigate non-determinism in five LLMs configured to be deterministic when applied to eight common tasks in across 10 runs, in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. We see accuracy variations up to 15% across naturally occurring runs with a gap of best possible performance to worst possible performance up to 70%. In fact, none of the LLMs consistently delivers repeatable accuracy across all tasks, much less identical output strings. Sharing preliminary results with insiders has revealed that non-determinism perhaps essential to the efficient use of compute resources via co-mingled data in input buffers so this issue is not going away anytime soon. To better quantify our observations, we introduce metrics focused on quantifying determinism, TARr@N for the total agreement rate at N runs over raw output, and TARa@N for total agreement rate of parsed-out answers. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/breckbaldwin/llm-stability.

### Investigating and Scaling up Code-Switching for Multilingual Language   Model Pre-Training
**Authors**: Zhijun Wang, Jiahuan Li, Hao Zhou, Rongxiang Weng, Jingang Wang, Xin Huang, Xue Han, Junlan Feng, Chao Deng, Shujian Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T15:09:58Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable multilingual capabilities despite the extreme language imbalance in the pre-training data. In this paper, we closely examine the reasons behind this phenomenon, focusing on the pre-training corpus. We find that the existence of code-switching, alternating between different languages within a context, is key to multilingual capabilities. We conduct an analysis to investigate code-switching in the pre-training corpus, examining its presence and categorizing it into four types within two quadrants. We then assess its impact on multilingual performance. These types of code-switching data are unbalanced in proportions and demonstrate different effects on facilitating language transfer. To better explore the power of code-switching for language alignment during pre-training, we investigate the strategy of synthetic code-switching. We continuously scale up the synthetic code-switching data and observe remarkable improvements in both benchmarks and representation space. Extensive experiments indicate that incorporating synthetic code-switching data enables better language alignment and generalizes well to high, medium, and low-resource languages with pre-training corpora of varying qualities.

### Rethinking industrial artificial intelligence: a unified foundation   framework
**Authors**: Jay Lee, Hanqi Su

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T15:05:32Z

**Summary**: Recent advancement in industrial artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the industry, driving smarter manufacturing, predictive maintenance, and intelligent decision-making. However, existing approaches often focus primarily on algorithms and models, overlooking the importance of systematically integrating domain knowledge, data, and models to ensure more comprehensive and effective AI solutions. Therefore, the effective development and deployment of Industrial AI solutions require a more comprehensive and systematic approach. To address this gap, this paper summarizes previous research and rethinks the role of industrial AI and presents a unified industrial AI foundation framework comprising three core modules: knowledge module, data module, and model module. These modules help to extend and enhance the industrial AI methodology platform, supporting various industrial applications. In addition, a case study on rotating machinery diagnosis demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, and several future directions are highlighted for the development of the industrial AI foundation framework.

**Authors**: Yueming Zhao, Xuening Yuan, Hongyu Yang, Di Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T14:54:24Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-3D creation integrate the potent prior of Diffusion Models from text-to-image generation into 3D domain. Nevertheless, generating 3D scenes with multiple objects remains challenging. Therefore, we present DreamScape, a method for generating 3D scenes from text. Utilizing Gaussian Splatting for 3D representation, DreamScape introduces 3D Gaussian Guide that encodes semantic primitives, spatial transformations and relationships from text using LLMs, enabling local-to-global optimization. Progressive scale control is tailored during local object generation, addressing training instability issue arising from simple blending in the global optimization stage. Collision relationships between objects are modeled at the global level to mitigate biases in LLMs priors, ensuring physical correctness. Additionally, to generate pervasive objects like rain and snow distributed extensively across the scene, we design specialized sparse initialization and densification strategy. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScape achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling high-fidelity, controllable 3D scene generation.

### BlenderGym: Benchmarking Foundational Model Systems for Graphics Editing
**Authors**: Yunqi Gu, Ian Huang, Jihyeon Je, Guandao Yang, Leonidas Guibas

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T14:51:45Z

**Summary**: 3D graphics editing is crucial in applications like movie production and game design, yet it remains a time-consuming process that demands highly specialized domain expertise. Automating this process is challenging because graphical editing requires performing a variety of tasks, each requiring distinct skill sets. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for automating the editing process, but their development and evaluation are bottlenecked by the lack of a comprehensive benchmark that requires human-level perception and presents real-world editing complexity. In this work, we present BlenderGym, the first comprehensive VLM system benchmark for 3D graphics editing. BlenderGym evaluates VLM systems through code-based 3D reconstruction tasks. We evaluate closed- and open-source VLM systems and observe that even the state-of-the-art VLM system struggles with tasks relatively easy for human Blender users. Enabled by BlenderGym, we study how inference scaling techniques impact VLM's performance on graphics editing tasks. Notably, our findings reveal that the verifier used to guide the scaling of generation can itself be improved through inference scaling, complementing recent insights on inference scaling of LLM generation in coding and math tasks. We further show that inference compute is not uniformly effective and can be optimized by strategically distributing it between generation and verification.

**Authors**: Kegang Wang, Jiankai Tang, Yuxuan Fan, Jiatong Ji, Yuanchun Shi, Yuntao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T14:34:04Z

**Summary**: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), enabling non-contact physiological monitoring through facial light reflection analysis, faces critical computational bottlenecks as deep learning introduces performance gains at the cost of prohibitive resource demands. This paper proposes ME-rPPG, a memory-efficient algorithm built on temporal-spatial state space duality, which resolves the trilemma of model scalability, cross-dataset generalization, and real-time constraints. Leveraging a transferable state space, ME-rPPG efficiently captures subtle periodic variations across facial frames while maintaining minimal computational overhead, enabling training on extended video sequences and supporting low-latency inference. Achieving cross-dataset MAEs of 5.38 (MMPD), 0.70 (VitalVideo), and 0.25 (PURE), ME-rPPG outperforms all baselines with improvements ranging from 21.3% to 60.2%. Our solution enables real-time inference with only 3.6 MB memory usage and 9.46 ms latency -- surpassing existing methods by 19.5%-49.7% accuracy and 43.2% user satisfaction gains in real-world deployments. The code and demos are released for reproducibility on https://github.com/Health-HCI-Group/ME-rPPG-demo.

**Authors**: Haoyu Dong, Jianbo Zhao, Yuzhang Tian, Junyu Xiong, Shiyu Xia, Mengyu Zhou, Yun Lin, José Cambronero, Yeye He, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T14:33:38Z

**Summary**: Spreadsheets are characterized by their extensive two-dimensional grids, flexible layouts, and varied formatting options, which pose significant challenges for large language models (LLMs). In response, we introduce SpreadsheetLLM, pioneering an efficient encoding method designed to unleash and optimize LLMs' powerful understanding and reasoning capability on spreadsheets. Initially, we propose a vanilla serialization approach that incorporates cell addresses, values, and formats. However, this approach was limited by LLMs' token constraints, making it impractical for most applications. To tackle this challenge, we develop SheetCompressor, an innovative encoding framework that compresses spreadsheets effectively for LLMs. It comprises three modules: structural-anchor-based compression, inverse index translation, and data-format-aware aggregation. It significantly improves performance in the spreadsheet table detection task, outperforming the vanilla approach by 25.6% in GPT4's in-context learning setting. Moreover, fine-tuned LLM with SheetCompressor has an average compression ratio of 25 times, and achieves a state-of-the-art 78.9% F1 score, surpassing the best existing models by 12.3%. Finally, we propose Chain of Spreadsheet for downstream tasks of spreadsheet understanding and validate it in a new and demanding spreadsheet QA task. We methodically leverage the inherent layout and structure of spreadsheets, demonstrating that SpreadsheetLLM is highly effective across a variety of spreadsheet tasks.

**Authors**: Abdelrahaman A. Hassan, Abdelrahman A. Ali, Aya E. Fouda, Radwa J. Hanafy, Mohammed E. Fouda

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T14:19:06Z

**Summary**: The increasing global prevalence of mental disorders, such as depression and PTSD, requires objective and scalable diagnostic tools. Traditional clinical assessments often face limitations in accessibility, objectivity, and consistency. This paper investigates the potential of multimodal machine learning to address these challenges, leveraging the complementary information available in text, audio, and video data. Our approach involves a comprehensive analysis of various data preprocessing techniques, including novel chunking and utterance-based formatting strategies. We systematically evaluate a range of state-of-the-art embedding models for each modality and employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional LSTM Networks (BiLSTMs) for feature extraction. We explore data-level, feature-level, and decision-level fusion techniques, including a novel integration of Large Language Model (LLM) predictions. We also investigate the impact of replacing Multilayer Perceptron classifiers with Support Vector Machines. We extend our analysis to severity prediction using PHQ-8 and PCL-C scores and multi-class classification (considering co-occurring conditions). Our results demonstrate that utterance-based chunking significantly improves performance, particularly for text and audio modalities. Decision-level fusion, incorporating LLM predictions, achieves the highest accuracy, with a balanced accuracy of 94.8% for depression and 96.2% for PTSD detection. The combination of CNN-BiLSTM architectures with utterance-level chunking, coupled with the integration of external LLM, provides a powerful and nuanced approach to the detection and assessment of mental health conditions. Our findings highlight the potential of MMML for developing more accurate, accessible, and personalized mental healthcare tools.

**Summary**: Financial LLMs hold promise for advancing financial tasks and domain-specific applications. However, they are limited by scarce corpora, weak multimodal capabilities, and narrow evaluations, making them less suited for real-world application. To address this, we introduce \textit{Open-FinLLMs}, the first open-source multimodal financial LLMs designed to handle diverse tasks across text, tabular, time-series, and chart data, excelling in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. The suite includes FinLLaMA, pre-trained on a comprehensive 52-billion-token corpus; FinLLaMA-Instruct, fine-tuned with 573K financial instructions; and FinLLaVA, enhanced with 1.43M multimodal tuning pairs for strong cross-modal reasoning. We comprehensively evaluate Open-FinLLMs across 14 financial tasks, 30 datasets, and 4 multimodal tasks in zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised fine-tuning settings, introducing two new multimodal evaluation datasets. Our results show that Open-FinLLMs outperforms afvanced financial and general LLMs such as GPT-4, across financial NLP, decision-making, and multi-modal tasks, highlighting their potential to tackle real-world challenges. To foster innovation and collaboration across academia and industry, we release all codes (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PIXIU2-0D70/B1D7/LICENSE) and models under OSI-approved licenses.

### Text2Tracks: Prompt-based Music Recommendation via Generative Retrieval
**Authors**: Enrico Palumbo, Gustavo Penha, Andreas Damianou, José Luis Redondo García, Timothy Christopher Heath, Alice Wang, Hugues Bouchard, Mounia Lalmas

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T14:08:21Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled users to provide highly specific music recommendation requests using natural language prompts (e.g. "Can you recommend some old classics for slow dancing?"). In this setup, the recommended tracks are predicted by the LLM in an autoregressive way, i.e. the LLM generates the track titles one token at a time. While intuitive, this approach has several limitation. First, it is based on a general purpose tokenization that is optimized for words rather than for track titles. Second, it necessitates an additional entity resolution layer that matches the track title to the actual track identifier. Third, the number of decoding steps scales linearly with the length of the track title, slowing down inference. In this paper, we propose to address the task of prompt-based music recommendation as a generative retrieval task. Within this setting, we introduce novel, effective, and efficient representations of track identifiers that significantly outperform commonly used strategies. We introduce Text2Tracks, a generative retrieval model that learns a mapping from a user's music recommendation prompt to the relevant track IDs directly. Through an offline evaluation on a dataset of playlists with language inputs, we find that (1) the strategy to create IDs for music tracks is the most important factor for the effectiveness of Text2Tracks and semantic IDs significantly outperform commonly used strategies that rely on song titles as identifiers (2) provided with the right choice of track identifiers, Text2Tracks outperforms sparse and dense retrieval solutions trained to retrieve tracks from language prompts.

### Doctor: Optimizing Container Rebuild Efficiency by Instruction   Re-Orchestration
**Authors**: Zhiling Zhu, Tieming Chen, Chengwei Liu, Han Liu, Qijie Song, Zhengzi Xu, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T13:53:35Z

**Summary**: Containerization has revolutionized software deployment, with Docker leading the way due to its ease of use and consistent runtime environment. As Docker usage grows, optimizing Dockerfile performance, particularly by reducing rebuild time, has become essential for maintaining efficient CI/CD pipelines. However, existing optimization approaches primarily address single builds without considering the recurring rebuild costs associated with modifications and evolution, limiting long-term efficiency gains. To bridge this gap, we present Doctor, a method for improving Dockerfile build efficiency through instruction re-ordering that addresses key challenges: identifying instruction dependencies, predicting future modifications, ensuring behavioral equivalence, and managing the optimization computational complexity. We developed a comprehensive dependency taxonomy based on Dockerfile syntax and a historical modification analysis to prioritize frequently modified instructions. Using a weighted topological sorting algorithm, Doctor optimizes instruction order to minimize future rebuild time while maintaining functionality. Experiments on 2,000 GitHub repositories show that Doctor improves 92.75% of Dockerfiles, reducing rebuild time by an average of 26.5%, with 12.82% of files achieving over a 50% reduction. Notably, 86.2% of cases preserve functional similarity. These findings highlight best practices for Dockerfile management, enabling developers to enhance Docker efficiency through informed optimization strategies.

### A Model-Agnostic Approach for Semantically Driven Disambiguation in   Human-Robot Interaction
**Authors**: Fethiye Irmak Dogan, Maithili Patel, Weiyu Liu, Iolanda Leite, Sonia Chernova

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T13:51:04Z

**Summary**: Ambiguities are inevitable in human-robot interaction, especially when a robot follows user instructions in a large, shared space. For example, if a user asks the robot to find an object in a home environment with underspecified instructions, the object could be in multiple locations depending on missing factors. For instance, a bowl might be in the kitchen cabinet or on the dining room table, depending on whether it is clean or dirty, full or empty, and the presence of other objects around it. Previous works on object search have assumed that the queried object is immediately visible to the robot or have predicted object locations using one-shot inferences, which are likely to fail for ambiguous or partially understood instructions. This paper focuses on these gaps and presents a novel model-agnostic approach leveraging semantically driven clarifications to enhance the robot's ability to locate queried objects in fewer attempts. Specifically, we leverage different knowledge embedding models, and when ambiguities arise, we propose an informative clarification method, which follows an iterative prediction process. The user experiment evaluation of our method shows that our approach is applicable to different custom semantic encoders as well as LLMs, and informative clarifications improve performances, enabling the robot to locate objects on its first attempts. The user experiment data is publicly available at https://github.com/IrmakDogan/ExpressionDataset.

### AdPO: Enhancing the Adversarial Robustness of Large Vision-Language   Models with Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Chaohu Liu, Tianyi Gui, Yu Liu, Linli Xu

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T13:43:21Z

**Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), such as GPT-4o and LLaVA, have recently witnessed remarkable advancements and are increasingly being deployed in real-world applications. However, inheriting the sensitivity of visual neural networks, LVLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can result in erroneous or malicious outputs. While existing efforts utilize adversarial fine-tuning to enhance robustness, they often suffer from performance degradation on clean inputs. In this paper, we proposes AdPO, a novel adversarial defense strategy for LVLMs based on preference optimization. For the first time, we reframe adversarial training as a preference optimization problem, aiming to enhance the model's preference for generating normal outputs on clean inputs while rejecting the potential misleading outputs for adversarial examples. Notably, AdPO achieves this by solely modifying the image encoder, e.g., CLIP ViT, resulting in superior clean and adversarial performance in a variety of downsream tasks. Considering that training involves large language models (LLMs), the computational cost increases significantly. We validate that training on smaller LVLMs and subsequently transferring to larger models can achieve competitive performance while maintaining efficiency comparable to baseline methods. Our comprehensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed AdPO, which provides a novel perspective for future adversarial defense research.

**Authors**: Zhiming Ma, Peidong Wang, Minhua Huang, Jingpeng Wang, Kai Wu, Xiangzhao Lv, Yachun Pang, Yin Yang, Wenjie Tang, Yuchen Kang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T13:32:22Z

**Summary**: The detection of telecom fraud faces significant challenges due to the lack of high-quality multimodal training data that integrates audio signals with reasoning-oriented textual analysis. To address this gap, we present TeleAntiFraud-28k, the first open-source audio-text slow-thinking dataset specifically designed for automated telecom fraud analysis. Our dataset is constructed through three strategies: (1) Privacy-preserved text-truth sample generation using automatically speech recognition (ASR)-transcribed call recordings (with anonymized original audio), ensuring real-world consistency through text-to-speech (TTS) model regeneration; (2) Semantic enhancement via large language model (LLM)-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR outputs to expand scenario coverage; (3) Multi-agent adversarial synthesis that simulates emerging fraud tactics through predefined communication scenarios and fraud typologies. The generated dataset contains 28,511 rigorously processed speech-text pairs, complete with detailed annotations for fraud reasoning. The dataset is divided into three tasks: scenario classification, fraud detection, fraud type classification. Furthermore, we construct TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a standardized evaluation benchmark comprising proportionally sampled instances from the dataset, to facilitate systematic testing of model performance on telecom fraud detection tasks. We also contribute a production-optimized supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model trained on hybrid real/synthetic data, while open-sourcing the data processing framework to enable community-driven dataset expansion. This work establishes a foundational framework for multimodal anti-fraud research while addressing critical challenges in data privacy and scenario diversity. The project will be released at https://github.com/JimmyMa99/TeleAntiFraud.

### Interpretable Steering of Large Language Models with Feature Guided   Activation Additions
**Authors**: Samuel Soo, Chen Guang, Wesley Teng, Chandrasekaran Balaganesh, Tan Guoxian, Yan Ming

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T13:20:40Z

**Summary**: Effective and reliable control over large language model (LLM) behavior is a significant challenge. While activation steering methods, which add steering vectors to a model's hidden states, are a promising approach, existing techniques often lack precision and interpretability in how they influence model outputs. We introduce Feature Guided Activation Additions (FGAA), a novel activation steering method that leverages insights from Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and Sparse Autoencoder-Targeted Steering (SAE-TS). By operating in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) and employing optimization techniques to select desired SAE features, FGAA constructs precise steering vectors that provide better steering effects while maintaining coherence of steered model outputs. In this regard, evaluations on Gemma-2-2B and Gemma-2-9B models across various steering tasks demonstrate that FGAA outperforms existing steering methods of CAA, SAE decoder steering, and SAE-TS. Our results also highlight important trade-offs between steering scale and general model capabilities that are consistent across all tested steering methods.

### InfiniteICL: Breaking the Limit of Context Window Size via Long   Short-term Memory Transformation
**Authors**: Bowen Cao, Deng Cai, Wai Lam

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T08:53:06Z

**Summary**: In-context learning (ICL) is critical for large language models (LLMs), but its effectiveness is constrained by finite context windows, particularly in ultra-long contexts. To overcome this, we introduce InfiniteICL, a framework that parallels context and parameters in LLMs with short- and long-term memory in human cognitive systems, focusing on transforming temporary context knowledge into permanent parameter updates. This approach significantly reduces memory usage, maintains robust performance across varying input lengths, and theoretically enables infinite context integration through the principles of context knowledge elicitation, selection, and consolidation. Evaluations demonstrate that our method reduces context length by 90% while achieving 103% average performance of full-context prompting across fact recall, grounded reasoning, and skill acquisition tasks. When conducting sequential multi-turn transformations on complex, real-world contexts (with length up to 2M tokens), our approach surpasses full-context prompting while using only 0.4% of the original contexts. These findings highlight InfiniteICL's potential to enhance the scalability and efficiency of LLMs by breaking the limitations of conventional context window sizes.

**Authors**: Hamed Rahimi, Jeanne Cattoni, Meriem Beghili, Mouad Abrini, Mahdi Khoramshahi, Maribel Pino, Mohamed Chetouani

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T13:00:17Z

**Summary**: Personalization in social robotics is critical for fostering effective human-robot interactions, yet systems often face the cold start problem, where initial user preferences or characteristics are unavailable. This paper proposes a novel framework called USER-LLM R1 for a user-aware conversational agent that addresses this challenge through dynamic user profiling and model initiation. Our approach integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning models to iteratively infer user preferences and vision-language models (VLMs) to initialize user profiles from multimodal inputs, enabling personalized interactions from the first encounter. Leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, the system dynamically refines user representations within an inherent CoT process, ensuring contextually relevant and adaptive responses. Evaluations on the ElderlyTech-VQA Bench demonstrate significant improvements in ROUGE-1 (+23.2%), ROUGE-2 (+0.6%), and ROUGE-L (+8%) F1 scores over state-of-the-art baselines, with ablation studies underscoring the impact of reasoning model size on performance. Human evaluations further validate the framework's efficacy, particularly for elderly users, where tailored responses enhance engagement and trust. Ethical considerations, including privacy preservation and bias mitigation, are rigorously discussed and addressed to ensure responsible deployment.

### ToM-RL: Reinforcement Learning Unlocks Theory of Mind in Small LLMs
**Authors**: Yi-Long Lu, Chunhui Zhang, Jiajun Song, Lifeng Fan, Wei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T12:58:42Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), applied during the post-training phase of large language models (LLMs), have significantly enhanced their capabilities in structured reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logical inference. However, the effectiveness of RL in social reasoning, particularly in Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer others' mental states, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that RL methods effectively unlock ToM reasoning capabilities even in small-scale LLMs (0.5B to 7B parameters). Using a modest dataset comprising 3200 questions across diverse scenarios, our RL-trained 7B model achieves 84.50\% accuracy on the Hi-ToM benchmark, surpassing models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-v3 despite significantly fewer parameters. While smaller models ($\leq$3B parameters) suffer from reasoning collapse, larger models (7B parameters) maintain stable performance through consistent belief tracking. Additionally, our RL-based models demonstrate robust generalization to higher-order, out-of-distribution ToM problems, novel textual presentations, and previously unseen datasets. These findings highlight RL's potential to enhance social cognitive reasoning, bridging the gap between structured problem-solving and nuanced social inference in LLMs.

### Satellite Edge Artificial Intelligence with Large Models: Architectures   and Technologies
**Authors**: Yuanming Shi, Jingyang Zhu, Chunxiao Jiang, Linling Kuang, Khaled B. Letaief

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T12:25:57Z

**Summary**: Driven by the growing demand for intelligent remote sensing applications, large artificial intelligence (AI) models pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled datasets and fine-tuned for downstream tasks have significantly improved learning performance for various downstream tasks due to their generalization capabilities. However, many specific downstream tasks, such as extreme weather nowcasting (e.g., downburst and tornado), disaster monitoring, and battlefield surveillance, require real-time data processing. Traditional methods via transferring raw data to ground stations for processing often cause significant issues in terms of latency and trustworthiness. To address these challenges, satellite edge AI provides a paradigm shift from ground-based to on-board data processing by leveraging the integrated communication-and-computation capabilities in space computing power networks (Space-CPN), thereby enhancing the timeliness, effectiveness, and trustworthiness for remote sensing downstream tasks. Moreover, satellite edge large AI model (LAM) involves both the training (i.e., fine-tuning) and inference phases, where a key challenge lies in developing computation task decomposition principles to support scalable LAM deployment in resource-constrained space networks with time-varying topologies. In this article, we first propose a satellite federated fine-tuning architecture to split and deploy the modules of LAM over space and ground networks for efficient LAM fine-tuning. We then introduce a microservice-empowered satellite edge LAM inference architecture that virtualizes LAM components into lightweight microservices tailored for multi-task multimodal inference. Finally, we discuss the future directions for enhancing the efficiency and scalability of satellite edge LAM, including task-oriented communication, brain-inspired computing, and satellite edge AI network optimization.

### Testing Low-Resource Language Support in LLMs Using Language Proficiency   Exams: the Case of Luxembourgish
**Authors**: Cedric Lothritz, Jordi Cabot

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T12:16:14Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an increasingly important tool in research and society at large. While LLMs are regularly used all over the world by experts and lay-people alike, they are predominantly developed with English-speaking users in mind, performing well in English and other wide-spread languages while less-resourced languages such as Luxembourgish are seen as a lower priority. This lack of attention is also reflected in the sparsity of available evaluation tools and datasets. In this study, we investigate the viability of language proficiency exams as such evaluation tools for the Luxembourgish language. We find that large models such as ChatGPT, Claude and DeepSeek-R1 typically achieve high scores, while smaller models show weak performances. We also find that the performances in such language exams can be used to predict performances in other NLP tasks.

### Proposition of Affordance-Driven Environment Recognition Framework Using   Symbol Networks in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Kazuma Arii, Satoshi Kurihara

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T11:48:44Z

**Summary**: In the quest to enable robots to coexist with humans, understanding dynamic situations and selecting appropriate actions based on common sense and affordances are essential. Conventional AI systems face challenges in applying affordance, as it represents implicit knowledge derived from common sense. However, large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities due to their ability to process extensive human knowledge. This study proposes a method for automatic affordance acquisition by leveraging LLM outputs. The process involves generating text using LLMs, reconstructing the output into a symbol network using morphological and dependency analysis, and calculating affordances based on network distances. Experiments using ``apple'' as an example demonstrated the method's ability to extract context-dependent affordances with high explainability. The results suggest that the proposed symbol network, reconstructed from LLM outputs, enables robots to interpret affordances effectively, bridging the gap between symbolized data and human-like situational understanding.

**Authors**: Reo Abe, Akifumi Ito, Kanata Takayasu, Satoshi Kurihara

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T11:42:49Z

**Summary**: Planning methods with high adaptability to dynamic environments are crucial for the development of autonomous and versatile robots. We propose a method for leveraging a large language model (GPT-4o) to automatically generate networks capable of adapting to dynamic environments. The proposed method collects environmental "status," representing conditions and goals, and uses them to generate agents. These agents are interconnected on the basis of specific conditions, resulting in networks that combine flexibility and generality. We conducted evaluation experiments to compare the networks automatically generated with the proposed method with manually constructed ones, confirming the comprehensiveness of the proposed method's networks and their higher generality. This research marks a significant advancement toward the development of versatile planning methods applicable to robotics, autonomous vehicles, smart systems, and other complex environments.

### On-Chain Analysis of Smart Contract Dependency Risks on Ethereum
**Authors**: Monica Jin, Raphina Liu, Martin Monperrus

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T11:20:35Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of smart contract dependencies, analyzing over 41 million contracts and 11 billion interactions on Ethereum up to December 2024. Our results yield four key insights: (1) 59% of contract transactions involve multiple contracts (median of 4 per transaction in 2024) indicating potential smart contract dependency risks; (2) the ecosystem exhibits extreme centralization, with just 11 (0.001%) deployers controlling 20.5 million (50%) of alive contracts, with major risks related to factory contracts and deployer privileges; (3) three most depended-upon contracts are mutable, meaning large parts of the ecosystem rely on contracts that can be altered at any time, which is a significant risk, (4) actual smart contract protocol dependencies are significantly more complex than officially documented, undermining Ethereum's transparency ethos, and creating unnecessary attack surface. Our work provides the first large-scale empirical foundation for understanding smart contract dependency risks, offering crucial insights for developers, users, and security researchers in the blockchain space.

### Open-Qwen2VL: Compute-Efficient Pre-Training of Fully-Open Multimodal   LLMs on Academic Resources
**Authors**: Weizhi Wang, Yu Tian, Linjie Yang, Heng Wang, Xifeng Yan

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T11:17:09Z

**Summary**: The reproduction of state-of-the-art multimodal LLM pre-training faces barriers at every stage of the pipeline, including high-quality data filtering, multimodal data mixture strategies, sequence packing techniques, and training frameworks. We introduce Open-Qwen2VL, a fully open-source 2B-parameter Multimodal Large Language Model pre-trained efficiently on 29M image-text pairs using only 220 A100-40G GPU hours. Our approach employs low-to-high dynamic image resolution and multimodal sequence packing to significantly enhance pre-training efficiency. The training dataset was carefully curated using both MLLM-based filtering techniques (e.g., MLM-Filter) and conventional CLIP-based filtering methods, substantially improving data quality and training efficiency. The Open-Qwen2VL pre-training is conducted on academic level 8xA100-40G GPUs at UCSB on 5B packed multimodal tokens, which is 0.36% of 1.4T multimodal pre-training tokens of Qwen2-VL. The final instruction-tuned Open-Qwen2VL outperforms partially-open state-of-the-art MLLM Qwen2-VL-2B on various multimodal benchmarks of MMBench, SEEDBench, MMstar, and MathVista, indicating the remarkable training efficiency of Open-Qwen2VL. We open-source all aspects of our work, including compute-efficient and data-efficient training details, data filtering methods, sequence packing scripts, pre-training data in WebDataset format, FSDP-based training codebase, and both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints. We redefine "fully open" for multimodal LLMs as the complete release of: 1) the training codebase, 2) detailed data filtering techniques, and 3) all pre-training and supervised fine-tuning data used to develop the model.

### Comment Staytime Prediction with LLM-enhanced Comment Understanding
**Authors**: Changshuo Zhang, Zihan Lin, Shukai Liu, Yongqi Liu, Han Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T11:09:18Z

**Summary**: In modern online streaming platforms, the comments section plays a critical role in enhancing the overall user experience. Understanding user behavior within the comments section is essential for comprehensive user interest modeling. A key factor of user engagement is staytime, which refers to the amount of time that users browse and post comments. Existing watchtime prediction methods struggle to adapt to staytime prediction, overlooking interactions with individual comments and their interrelation. In this paper, we present a micro-video recommendation dataset with video comments (named as KuaiComt) which is collected from Kuaishou platform. correspondingly, we propose a practical framework for comment staytime prediction with LLM-enhanced Comment Understanding (LCU). Our framework leverages the strong text comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to understand textual information of comments, while also incorporating fine-grained comment ranking signals as auxiliary tasks. The framework is two-staged: first, the LLM is fine-tuned using domain-specific tasks to bridge the video and the comments; second, we incorporate the LLM outputs into the prediction model and design two comment ranking auxiliary tasks to better understand user preference. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, showing significant improvements on the task of comment staytime prediction. Additionally, online A/B testing further validates the practical benefits on industrial scenario. Our dataset KuaiComt (https://github.com/lyingCS/KuaiComt.github.io) and code for LCU (https://github.com/lyingCS/LCU) are fully released.

### Building Knowledge from Interactions: An LLM-Based Architecture for   Adaptive Tutoring and Social Reasoning
**Authors**: Luca Garello, Giulia Belgiovine, Gabriele Russo, Francesco Rea, Alessandra Sciutti

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T10:45:41Z

**Summary**: Integrating robotics into everyday scenarios like tutoring or physical training requires robots capable of adaptive, socially engaging, and goal-oriented interactions. While Large Language Models show promise in human-like communication, their standalone use is hindered by memory constraints and contextual incoherence. This work presents a multimodal, cognitively inspired framework that enhances LLM-based autonomous decision-making in social and task-oriented Human-Robot Interaction. Specifically, we develop an LLM-based agent for a robot trainer, balancing social conversation with task guidance and goal-driven motivation. To further enhance autonomy and personalization, we introduce a memory system for selecting, storing and retrieving experiences, facilitating generalized reasoning based on knowledge built across different interactions. A preliminary HRI user study and offline experiments with a synthetic dataset validate our approach, demonstrating the system's ability to manage complex interactions, autonomously drive training tasks, and build and retrieve contextual memories, advancing socially intelligent robotics.

**Authors**: Dean You, Jieyu Jiang, Xiaoxuan Wang, Yushu Du, Zhihang Tan, Wenbo Xu, Hui Wang, Jiapeng Guan, Zhenyuan Wang, Ran Wei, Shuai Zhao, Zhe Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T10:38:25Z

**Summary**: Runahead execution is a technique to mask memory latency caused by irregular memory accesses. By pre-executing the application code during occurrences of long-latency operations and prefetching anticipated cache-missed data into the cache hierarchy, runahead effectively masks memory latency for subsequent cache misses and achieves high prefetching accuracy; however, this technique has been limited to superscalar out-of-order and superscalar in-order cores. For implementation in scalar in-order cores, the challenges of area-/energy-constraint and severe cache contention remain.   Here, we build the first full-stack system featuring runahead, MERE, from SoC and a dedicated ISA to the OS and programming model. Through this deployment, we show that enabling runahead in scalar in-order cores is possible, with minimal area and power overheads, while still achieving high performance. By re-constructing the sequential runahead employing a hardware/software co-design approach, the system can be implemented on a mature processor and SoC. Building on this, an adaptive runahead mechanism is proposed to mitigate the severe cache contention in scalar in-order cores. Combining this, we provide a comprehensive solution for embedded processors managing irregular workloads. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed MERE attains 93.5% of a 2-wide out-of-order core's performance while constraining area and power overheads below 5%, with the adaptive runahead mechanism delivering an additional 20.1% performance gain through mitigating the severe cache contention issues.

### Beyond Text-to-Text: An Overview of Multimodal and Generative Artificial   Intelligence for Education Using Topic Modeling
**Authors**: Ville Heilala, Roberto Araya, Raija Hämäläinen

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T10:19:10Z

**Summary**: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can reshape education and learning. While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT dominate current educational research, multimodal capabilities, such as text-to-speech and text-to-image, are less explored. This study uses topic modeling to map the research landscape of multimodal and generative AI in education. An extensive literature search using Dimensions yielded 4175 articles. Employing a topic modeling approach, latent topics were extracted, resulting in 38 interpretable topics organized into 14 thematic areas. Findings indicate a predominant focus on text-to-text models in educational contexts, with other modalities underexplored, overlooking the broader potential of multimodal approaches. The results suggest a research gap, stressing the importance of more balanced attention across different AI modalities and educational levels. In summary, this research provides an overview of current trends in generative AI for education, underlining opportunities for future exploration of multimodal technologies to fully realize the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in education.

### GPT Adoption and the Impact of Disclosure Policies
**Authors**: Cathy Yang, David Restrepo Amariles, Leo Allen, Aurore Troussel

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T10:09:54Z

**Summary**: Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, have proven effective in content generation and productivity enhancement. However, legal risks associated with these tools lead to adoption variance and concealment of AI use within organizations. This study examines the impact of disclosure on ChatGPT adoption in legal, audit and advisory roles in consulting firms through the lens of agency theory. We conducted a survey experiment to evaluate agency costs in the context of unregulated corporate use of ChatGPT, with a particular focus on how mandatory disclosure influences information asymmetry and misaligned interests. Our findings indicate that in the absence of corporate regulations, such as an AI policy, firms may incur agency costs, which can hinder the full benefits of GPT adoption. While disclosure policies reduce information asymmetry, they do not significantly lower overall agency costs due to managers undervaluing analysts' contributions with GPT use. Finally, we examine the scope of existing regulations in Europe and the United States regarding disclosure requirements, explore the sharing of risk and responsibility within firms, and analyze how incentive mechanisms promote responsible AI adoption.

### Representation Bending for Large Language Model Safety
**Authors**: Ashkan Yousefpour, Taeheon Kim, Ryan S. Kwon, Seungbeen Lee, Wonje Jeung, Seungju Han, Alvin Wan, Harrison Ngan, Youngjae Yu, Jonghyun Choi

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:47:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools, but their inherent safety risks - ranging from harmful content generation to broader societal harms - pose significant challenges. These risks can be amplified by the recent adversarial attacks, fine-tuning vulnerabilities, and the increasing deployment of LLMs in high-stakes environments. Existing safety-enhancing techniques, such as fine-tuning with human feedback or adversarial training, are still vulnerable as they address specific threats and often fail to generalize across unseen attacks, or require manual system-level defenses. This paper introduces RepBend, a novel approach that fundamentally disrupts the representations underlying harmful behaviors in LLMs, offering a scalable solution to enhance (potentially inherent) safety. RepBend brings the idea of activation steering - simple vector arithmetic for steering model's behavior during inference - to loss-based fine-tuning. Through extensive evaluation, RepBend achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior methods such as Circuit Breaker, RMU, and NPO, with up to 95% reduction in attack success rates across diverse jailbreak benchmarks, all with negligible reduction in model usability and general capabilities.

### Induction Heads as an Essential Mechanism for Pattern Matching in   In-context Learning
**Authors**: Joy Crosbie, Ekaterina Shutova

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:40:08Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to learn and perform complex tasks through in-context learning (ICL). However, a comprehensive understanding of its internal mechanisms is still lacking. This paper explores the role of induction heads in a few-shot ICL setting. We analyse two state-of-the-art models, Llama-3-8B and InternLM2-20B on abstract pattern recognition and NLP tasks. Our results show that even a minimal ablation of induction heads leads to ICL performance decreases of up to ~32% for abstract pattern recognition tasks, bringing the performance close to random. For NLP tasks, this ablation substantially decreases the model's ability to benefit from examples, bringing few-shot ICL performance close to that of zero-shot prompts. We further use attention knockout to disable specific induction patterns, and present fine-grained evidence for the role that the induction mechanism plays in ICL.

### Register Always Matters: Analysis of LLM Pretraining Data Through the   Lens of Language Variation
**Authors**: Amanda Myntti, Erik Henriksson, Veronika Laippala, Sampo Pyysalo

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:30:24Z

**Summary**: Pretraining data curation is a cornerstone in Large Language Model (LLM) development, leading to growing research on quality filtering of large web corpora. From statistical quality flags to LLM-based labeling systems, datasets are divided into categories, frequently reducing to a binary: those passing the filters deemed as valuable examples, others discarded as useless or detrimental. However, a more detailed understanding of the contribution of different kinds of texts to model performance is still largely lacking. In this article, we present the first study utilizing registers (also known as genres) - a widely used standard in corpus linguistics to model linguistic variation - to curate pretraining datasets and investigate the effect of register on the performance of LLMs. We perform comparative studies by training models with register classified data and evaluating them using standard benchmarks, and show that the register of pretraining data substantially affects model performance. We uncover surprising relationships between the pretraining material and the resulting models: using the News register results in subpar performance, and on the contrary, including the Opinion class, covering texts such as reviews and opinion blogs, is highly beneficial. While a model trained on the entire unfiltered dataset outperforms those trained on datasets limited to a single register, combining well-performing registers like How-to-Instructions, Informational Description, and Opinion leads to major improvements. Furthermore, analysis of individual benchmark results reveals key differences in the strengths and drawbacks of specific register classes as pretraining data. These findings show that register is an important explainer of model variation and can facilitate more deliberate future data selection practices.

### From Smør-re-brød to Subwords: Training LLMs on Danish, One   Morpheme at a Time
**Authors**: Mikkel Wildner Kildeberg, Emil Allerslev Schledermann, Nicolaj Larsen, Rob van der Goot

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:26:02Z

**Summary**: The best performing transformer-based language models use subword tokenization techniques, such as Byte-Pair-Encoding (BPE). However, these approaches often overlook linguistic principles, such as morphological segmentation, which we believe is fundamental for understanding language-specific word structure. In this study, we leverage an annotated Danish morphological dataset to train a semisupervised model for morphological segmentation, enabling the development of tokenizers optimized for Danish morphology. We evaluate four distinct tokenizers, including two custom morphological tokenizers, by analyzing their performance in morphologically segmenting Danish words. Additionally, we train two generative transformer models, \textit{CerebrasGPT-111M} and \textit{LLaMA-3.2 1B}, using these tokenizers and evaluate their downstream performance. Our findings reveal that our custom-developed tokenizers substantially enhance morphological segmentation, achieving an F1 score of 58.84, compared to 39.28 achieved by a Danish BPE tokenizer. In downstream tasks, models trained with our morphological tokenizers outperform those using BPE tokenizers across different evaluation metrics. These results highlight that incorporating Danish morphological segmentation strategies into tokenizers leads to improved performance in generative transformer models on Danish language

### Context-Aware Toxicity Detection in Multiplayer Games: Integrating   Domain-Adaptive Pretraining and Match Metadata
**Authors**: Adrien Schurger-Foy, Rafal Dariusz Kocielnik, Caglar Gulcehre, R. Michael Alvarez

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:21:41Z

**Summary**: The detrimental effects of toxicity in competitive online video games are widely acknowledged, prompting publishers to monitor player chat conversations. This is challenging due to the context-dependent nature of toxicity, often spread across multiple messages or informed by non-textual interactions. Traditional toxicity detectors focus on isolated messages, missing the broader context needed for accurate moderation. This is especially problematic in video games, where interactions involve specialized slang, abbreviations, and typos, making it difficult for standard models to detect toxicity, especially given its rarity. We adapted RoBERTa LLM to support moderation tailored to video games, integrating both textual and non-textual context. By enhancing pretrained embeddings with metadata and addressing the unique slang and language quirks through domain adaptive pretraining, our method better captures the nuances of player interactions. Using two gaming datasets - from Defense of the Ancients 2 (DOTA 2) and Call of Duty$^\circledR$: Modern Warfare$^\circledR$III (MWIII) we demonstrate which sources of context (metadata, prior interactions...) are most useful, how to best leverage them to boost performance, and the conditions conducive to doing so. This work underscores the importance of context-aware and domain-specific approaches for proactive moderation.

### LightDefense: A Lightweight Uncertainty-Driven Defense against   Jailbreaks via Shifted Token Distribution
**Authors**: Zhuoran Yang, Jie Peng, Zhen Tan, Tianlong Chen, Yanyong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:21:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) face threats from jailbreak prompts. Existing methods for defending against jailbreak attacks are primarily based on auxiliary models. These strategies, however, often require extensive data collection or training. We propose LightDefense, a lightweight defense mechanism targeted at white-box models, which utilizes a safety-oriented direction to adjust the probabilities of tokens in the vocabulary, making safety disclaimers appear among the top tokens after sorting tokens by probability in descending order. We further innovatively leverage LLM's uncertainty about prompts to measure their harmfulness and adaptively adjust defense strength, effectively balancing safety and helpfulness. The effectiveness of LightDefense in defending against 5 attack methods across 2 target LLMs, without compromising helpfulness to benign user queries, highlights its potential as a novel and lightweight defense mechanism, enhancing security of LLMs.

### Adapting Knowledge Prompt Tuning for Enhanced Automated Program Repair
**Authors**: Xuemeng Cai, Lingxiao Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:10:02Z

**Summary**: Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to enhance software reliability by automatically generating bug-fixing patches. Recent work has improved the state-of-the-art of APR by fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as CodeT5, for APR. However, the effectiveness of fine-tuning becomes weakened in data scarcity scenarios, and data scarcity can be a common issue in practice, limiting fine-tuning performance. To alleviate this limitation, this paper adapts prompt tuning for enhanced APR and conducts a comprehensive study to evaluate its effectiveness in data scarcity scenarios, using three LLMs of different sizes and six diverse datasets across four programming languages. Prompt tuning rewrites the input to a model by adding extra prompt tokens and tunes both the model and the prompts on a small dataset. These tokens provide task-specific knowledge that can improve the model for APR, which is especially critical in data scarcity scenarios. Moreover, domain knowledge has proven crucial in many code intelligence tasks, but existing studies fail to leverage domain knowledge during the prompt tuning for APR. To close this gap, we introduce knowledge prompt tuning, an approach that adapts prompt tuning with six distinct types of code- or bug-related domain knowledge for APR. Our work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to adapt and evaluate prompt tuning and the effectiveness of code- or bug-related domain knowledge for APR, particularly under data scarcity settings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that prompt tuning with knowledge generally outperforms fine-tuning under various experimental settings, achieving an average improvement of 87.33% over fine-tuning in data scarcity scenarios.

### Redefining technology for indigenous languages
**Authors**: Silvia Fernandez-Sabido, Laura Peniche-Sabido

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:08:53Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we offer an overview of indigenous languages, identifying the causes of their devaluation and the need for legislation on language rights. We review the technologies used to revitalize these languages, finding that when they come from outside, they often have the opposite effect to what they seek; however, when developed from within communities, they become powerful instruments of expression. We propose that the inclusion of Indigenous knowledge in large language models (LLMs) will enrich the technological landscape, but must be done in a participatory environment that encourages the exchange of knowledge.

### Chain of Correction for Full-text Speech Recognition with Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Zhiyuan Tang, Dong Wang, Zhikai Zhou, Yong Liu, Shen Huang, Shidong Shang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:06:23Z

**Summary**: Full-text error correction with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has gained increased attention due to its potential to correct errors across long contexts and address a broader spectrum of error types, including punctuation restoration and inverse text normalization. Nevertheless, many challenges persist, including issues related to stability, controllability, completeness, and fluency. To mitigate these challenges, this paper proposes the Chain of Correction (CoC) for full-text error correction with LLMs, which corrects errors segment by segment using pre-recognized text as guidance within a regular multi-turn chat format. The CoC also uses pre-recognized full text for context, allowing the model to better grasp global semantics and maintain a comprehensive overview of the entire content. Utilizing the open-sourced full-text error correction dataset ChFT, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to evaluate the performance of the CoC framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the CoC effectively corrects errors in full-text ASR outputs, significantly outperforming baseline and benchmark systems. We further analyze how to set the correction threshold to balance under-correction and over-rephrasing, extrapolate the CoC model on extremely long ASR outputs, and investigate whether other types of information can be employed to guide the error correction process.

### Bench4Merge: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Merging in Realistic Dense   Traffic with Micro-Interactive Vehicles
**Authors**: Zhengming Wang, Junli Wang, Pengfei Li, Zhaohan Li, Chunyang Liu, Bo Zhang, Peng Li, Yilun Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T09:02:05Z

**Summary**: While the capabilities of autonomous driving have advanced rapidly, merging into dense traffic remains a significant challenge, many motion planning methods for this scenario have been proposed but it is hard to evaluate them. Most existing closed-loop simulators rely on rule-based controls for other vehicles, which results in a lack of diversity and randomness, thus failing to accurately assess the motion planning capabilities in highly interactive scenarios. Moreover, traditional evaluation metrics are insufficient for comprehensively evaluating the performance of merging in dense traffic. In response, we proposed a closed-loop evaluation benchmark for assessing motion planning capabilities in merging scenarios. Our approach involves other vehicles trained in large scale datasets with micro-behavioral characteristics that significantly enhance the complexity and diversity. Additionally, we have restructured the evaluation mechanism by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess each autonomous vehicle merging onto the main lane. Extensive experiments and test-vehicle deployment have demonstrated the progressiveness of this benchmark. Through this benchmark, we have obtained an evaluation of existing methods and identified common issues. The simulation environment and evaluation process can be accessed at https://github.com/WZM5853/Bench4Merge.

### PROPHET: An Inferable Future Forecasting Benchmark with Causal   Intervened Likelihood Estimation
**Authors**: Zhengwei Tao, Zhi Jin, Bincheng Li, Xiaoying Bai, Haiyan Zhao, Chengfeng Dou, Xiancai Chen, Jia Li, Linyu Li, Chongyang Tao

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T08:57:42Z

**Summary**: Predicting future events stands as one of the ultimate aspirations of artificial intelligence. Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based systems have shown remarkable potential in forecasting future events, thereby garnering significant interest in the research community. Currently, several benchmarks have been established to evaluate the forecasting capabilities by formalizing the event prediction as a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and reasoning task. In these benchmarks, each prediction question is answered with relevant retrieved news articles. However, because there is no consideration on whether the questions can be supported by valid or sufficient supporting rationales, some of the questions in these benchmarks may be inherently noninferable. To address this issue, we introduce a new benchmark, PROPHET, which comprises inferable forecasting questions paired with relevant news for retrieval. To ensure the inferability of the benchmark, we propose Causal Intervened Likelihood (CIL), a statistical measure that assesses inferability through causal inference. In constructing this benchmark, we first collected recent trend forecasting questions and then filtered the data using CIL, resulting in an inferable benchmark for event prediction. Through extensive experiments, we first demonstrate the validity of CIL and in-depth investigations into event prediction with the aid of CIL. Subsequently, we evaluate several representative prediction systems on PROPHET, drawing valuable insights for future directions.

### MLKV: Efficiently Scaling up Large Embedding Model Training with   Disk-based Key-Value Storage
**Authors**: Yongjun He, Roger Waleffe, Zhichao Han, Johnu George, Binhang Yuan, Zitao Zhang, Yinan Shan, Yang Zhao, Debojyoti Dutta, Theodoros Rekatsinas, Ce Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T08:57:01Z

**Summary**: Many modern machine learning (ML) methods rely on embedding models to learn vector representations (embeddings) for a set of entities (embedding tables). As increasingly diverse ML applications utilize embedding models and embedding tables continue to grow in size and number, there has been a surge in the ad-hoc development of specialized frameworks targeted to train large embedding models for specific tasks. Although the scalability issues that arise in different embedding model training tasks are similar, each of these frameworks independently reinvents and customizes storage components for specific tasks, leading to substantial duplicated engineering efforts in both development and deployment. This paper presents MLKV, an efficient, extensible, and reusable data storage framework designed to address the scalability challenges in embedding model training, specifically data stall and staleness. MLKV augments disk-based key-value storage by democratizing optimizations that were previously exclusive to individual specialized frameworks and provides easy-to-use interfaces for embedding model training tasks. Extensive experiments on open-source workloads, as well as applications in eBay's payment transaction risk detection and seller payment risk detection, show that MLKV outperforms offloading strategies built on top of industrial-strength key-value stores by 1.6-12.6x. MLKV is open-source at https://github.com/llm-db/MLKV.

### Do We Truly Need So Many Samples? Multi-LLM Repeated Sampling   Efficiently Scales Test-Time Compute
**Authors**: Jianhao Chen, Zishuo Xun, Bocheng Zhou, Han Qi, Qiaosheng Zhang, Yang Chen, Wei Hu, Yuzhong Qu, Wanli Ouyang, Shuyue Hu

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T08:55:04Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a simple, effective, and cost-efficient strategy to improve LLM performance by scaling test-time compute. Our strategy builds upon the repeated-sampling-then-voting framework, with a novel twist: incorporating multiple models, even weaker ones, to leverage their complementary strengths that potentially arise from diverse training data and paradigms. By using consistency as a signal, our strategy dynamically switches between models. Theoretical analysis highlights the efficiency and performance advantages of our strategy. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our strategy not only outperforms self-consistency and state-of-the-art multi-agent debate approaches, but also significantly reduces inference costs. Additionally, ModelSwitch requires only a few comparable LLMs to achieve optimal performance and can be extended with verification methods, demonstrating the potential of leveraging multiple LLMs in the generation-verification paradigm.

### Linear Representations of Political Perspective Emerge in Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Junsol Kim, James Evans, Aaron Schein

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T08:53:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate text that realistically reflects a range of different subjective human perspectives. This paper studies how LLMs are seemingly able to reflect more liberal versus more conservative viewpoints among other political perspectives in American politics. We show that LLMs possess linear representations of political perspectives within activation space, wherein more similar perspectives are represented closer together. To do so, we probe the attention heads across the layers of three open transformer-based LLMs (Llama-2-7b-chat, Mistral-7b-instruct, Vicuna-7b). We first prompt models to generate text from the perspectives of different U.S. lawmakers. We then identify sets of attention heads whose activations linearly predict those lawmakers' DW-NOMINATE scores, a widely-used and validated measure of political ideology. We find that highly predictive heads are primarily located in the middle layers, often speculated to encode high-level concepts and tasks. Using probes only trained to predict lawmakers' ideology, we then show that the same probes can predict measures of news outlets' slant from the activations of models prompted to simulate text from those news outlets. These linear probes allow us to visualize, interpret, and monitor ideological stances implicitly adopted by an LLM as it generates open-ended responses. Finally, we demonstrate that by applying linear interventions to these attention heads, we can steer the model outputs toward a more liberal or conservative stance. Overall, our research suggests that LLMs possess a high-level linear representation of American political ideology and that by leveraging recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we can identify, monitor, and steer the subjective perspective underlying generated text.

### Are Autonomous Web Agents Good Testers?
**Authors**: Antoine Chevrot, Alexandre Vernotte, Jean-Rémy Falleri, Xavier Blanc, Bruno Legeard

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T08:48:01Z

**Summary**: Despite advances in automated testing, manual testing remains prevalent due to the high maintenance demands associated with test script fragility-scripts often break with minor changes in application structure. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential alternative by powering Autonomous Web Agents (AWAs) that can autonomously interact with applications. These agents may serve as Autonomous Test Agents (ATAs), potentially reducing the need for maintenance-heavy automated scripts by utilising natural language instructions similar to those used by human testers. This paper investigates the feasibility of adapting AWAs for natural language test case execution and how to evaluate them. We contribute with (1) a benchmark of three offline web applications, and a suite of 113 manual test cases, split between passing and failing cases, to evaluate and compare ATAs performance, (2) SeeAct-ATA and pinATA, two open-source ATA implementations capable of executing test steps, verifying assertions and giving verdicts, and (3) comparative experiments using our benchmark that quantifies our ATAs effectiveness. Finally we also proceed to a qualitative evaluation to identify the limitations of PinATA, our best performing implementation. Our findings reveal that our simple implementation, SeeAct-ATA, does not perform well compared to our more advanced PinATA implementation when executing test cases (50% performance improvement). However, while PinATA obtains around 60% of correct verdict and up to a promising 94% specificity, we identify several limitations that need to be addressed to develop more resilient and reliable ATAs, paving the way for robust, low maintenance test automation.

### An Optimizable Suffix Is Worth A Thousand Templates: Efficient Black-box   Jailbreaking without Affirmative Phrases via LLM as Optimizer
**Authors**: Weipeng Jiang, Zhenting Wang, Juan Zhai, Shiqing Ma, Zhengyu Zhao, Chao Shen

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T08:03:11Z

**Summary**: Despite prior safety alignment efforts, mainstream LLMs can still generate harmful and unethical content when subjected to jailbreaking attacks. Existing jailbreaking methods fall into two main categories: template-based and optimization-based methods. The former requires significant manual effort and domain knowledge, while the latter, exemplified by Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), which seeks to maximize the likelihood of harmful LLM outputs through token-level optimization, also encounters several limitations: requiring white-box access, necessitating pre-constructed affirmative phrase, and suffering from low efficiency. In this paper, we present ECLIPSE, a novel and efficient black-box jailbreaking method utilizing optimizable suffixes. Drawing inspiration from LLMs' powerful generation and optimization capabilities, we employ task prompts to translate jailbreaking goals into natural language instructions. This guides the LLM to generate adversarial suffixes for malicious queries. In particular, a harmfulness scorer provides continuous feedback, enabling LLM self-reflection and iterative optimization to autonomously and efficiently produce effective suffixes. Experimental results demonstrate that ECLIPSE achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 0.92 across three open-source LLMs and GPT-3.5-Turbo, significantly surpassing GCG in 2.4 times. Moreover, ECLIPSE is on par with template-based methods in ASR while offering superior attack efficiency, reducing the average attack overhead by 83%.

**Authors**: Hang Li, Shengyao Zhuang, Bevan Koopman, Guido Zuccon

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T08:02:01Z

**Summary**: Vector Pseudo Relevance Feedback (VPRF) has shown promising results in improving BERT-based dense retrieval systems through iterative refinement of query representations. This paper investigates the generalizability of VPRF to Large Language Model (LLM) based dense retrievers. We introduce LLM-VPRF and evaluate its effectiveness across multiple benchmark datasets, analyzing how different LLMs impact the feedback mechanism. Our results demonstrate that VPRF's benefits successfully extend to LLM architectures, establishing it as a robust technique for enhancing dense retrieval performance regardless of the underlying models. This work bridges the gap between VPRF with traditional BERT-based dense retrievers and modern LLMs, while providing insights into their future directions.

### Deep Graph Reinforcement Learning for UAV-Enabled Multi-User Secure   Communications
**Authors**: Xiao Tang, Kexin Zhao, Chao Shen, Qinghe Du, Yichen Wang, Dusit Niyato, Zhu Han

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T07:57:33Z

**Summary**: While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with flexible mobility are envisioned to enhance physical layer security in wireless communications, the efficient security design that adapts to such high network dynamics is rather challenging. The conventional approaches extended from optimization perspectives are usually quite involved, especially when jointly considering factors in different scales such as deployment and transmission in UAV-related scenarios. In this paper, we address the UAV-enabled multi-user secure communications by proposing a deep graph reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we reinterpret the security beamforming as a graph neural network (GNN) learning task, where mutual interference among users is managed through the message-passing mechanism. Then, the UAV deployment is obtained through soft actor-critic reinforcement learning, where the GNN-based security beamforming is exploited to guide the deployment strategy update. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal security performance and significantly enhances the efficiency of strategy determination. Moreover, the deep graph reinforcement learning framework offers a scalable solution, adaptable to various network scenarios and configurations, establishing a robust basis for information security in UAV-enabled communications.

**Authors**: Yuqing Wang, Tianwei Xiong, Daquan Zhou, Zhijie Lin, Yang Zhao, Bingyi Kang, Jiashi Feng, Xihui Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T07:57:32Z

**Summary**: It is desirable but challenging to generate content-rich long videos in the scale of minutes. Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in generating coherent and long sequences of tokens in the domain of natural language processing, while the exploration of autoregressive LLMs for video generation is limited to generating short videos of several seconds. In this work, we conduct a deep analysis of the challenges that prevent autoregressive LLM-based video generators from generating long videos. Based on the observations and analysis, we propose Loong, a new autoregressive LLM-based video generator that can generate minute-long videos. Specifically, we model the text tokens and video tokens as a unified sequence for autoregressive LLMs and train the model from scratch. We propose progressive short-to-long training with a loss re-weighting scheme to mitigate the loss imbalance problem for long video training. We further investigate inference strategies, including video token re-encoding and sampling strategies, to diminish error accumulation during inference. Our proposed Loong can be trained on 10-second videos and be extended to generate minute-level long videos conditioned on text prompts, as demonstrated by the results. More samples are available at: https://yuqingwang1029.github.io/Loong-video.

### Enabling Systematic Generalization in Abstract Spatial Reasoning through   Meta-Learning for Compositionality
**Authors**: Philipp Mondorf, Shijia Zhou, Monica Riedler, Barbara Plank

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T07:56:39Z

**Summary**: Systematic generalization refers to the capacity to understand and generate novel combinations from known components. Despite recent progress by large language models (LLMs) across various domains, these models often fail to extend their knowledge to novel compositional scenarios, revealing notable limitations in systematic generalization. There has been an ongoing debate about whether neural networks possess the capacity for systematic generalization, with recent studies suggesting that meta-learning approaches designed for compositionality can significantly enhance this ability. However, these insights have largely been confined to linguistic problems, leaving their applicability to other tasks an open question. In this study, we extend the approach of meta-learning for compositionality to the domain of abstract spatial reasoning. To this end, we introduce $\textit{SYGAR}$-a dataset designed to evaluate the capacity of models to systematically generalize from known geometric transformations (e.g., translation, rotation) of two-dimensional objects to novel combinations of these transformations (e.g., translation+rotation). Our results show that a transformer-based encoder-decoder model, trained via meta-learning for compositionality, can systematically generalize to previously unseen transformation compositions, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs, including o3-mini, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, which fail to exhibit similar systematic behavior. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of meta-learning in promoting systematicity beyond linguistic tasks, suggesting a promising direction toward more robust and generalizable models.

### PiCo: Jailbreaking Multimodal Large Language Models via   $\textbf{Pi}$ctorial $\textbf{Co}$de Contextualization
**Authors**: Aofan Liu, Lulu Tang, Ting Pan, Yuguo Yin, Bin Wang, Ao Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T07:54:32Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrate vision and other modalities into Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhance AI capabilities but also introduce new security vulnerabilities. By exploiting the vulnerabilities of the visual modality and the long-tail distribution characteristic of code training data, we present PiCo, a novel jailbreaking framework designed to progressively bypass multi-tiered defense mechanisms in advanced MLLMs. PiCo employs a tier-by-tier jailbreak strategy, using token-level typographic attacks to evade input filtering and embedding harmful intent within programming context instructions to bypass runtime monitoring. To comprehensively assess the impact of attacks, a new evaluation metric is further proposed to assess both the toxicity and helpfulness of model outputs post-attack. By embedding harmful intent within code-style visual instructions, PiCo achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.13% on Gemini-Pro Vision and 52.66% on GPT-4, surpassing previous methods. Experimental results highlight the critical gaps in current defenses, underscoring the need for more robust strategies to secure advanced MLLMs.

### Split Federated Learning for UAV-Enabled Integrated Sensing,   Computation, and Communication
**Authors**: Xiangwang Hou, Jingjing Wang, Zekai Zhang, Jiacheng Wang, Lei Liu, Yong Ren

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T07:53:24Z

**Summary**: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with integrated sensing, computation, and communication (ISCC) capabilities have become key enablers of next-generation wireless networks. Federated edge learning (FEL) leverages UAVs as mobile learning agents to collect data, perform local model updates, and contribute to global model aggregation. However, existing UAV-assisted FEL systems face critical challenges, including excessive computational demands, privacy risks, and inefficient communication, primarily due to the requirement for full-model training on resource-constrained UAVs. To deal with aforementioned challenges, we propose Split Federated Learning for UAV-Enabled ISCC (SFLSCC), a novel framework that integrates split federated learning (SFL) into UAV-assisted FEL. SFLSCC optimally partitions model training between UAVs and edge servers, significantly reducing UAVs' computational burden while preserving data privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis of UAV deployment, split point selection, data sensing volume, and client-side aggregation frequency, deriving closed-form upper bounds for the convergence gap. Based on these insights, we conceive a joint optimization problem to minimize the energy consumption required to achieve a target model accuracy. Given the non-convex nature of the problem, we develop a low-complexity algorithm to efficiently determine UAV deployment, split point selection, and communication frequency. Extensive simulations on a target motion recognition task validate the effectiveness of SFLSCC, demonstrating superior convergence performance and energy efficiency compared to baseline methods.

### Refining Interactions: Enhancing Anisotropy in Graph Neural Networks   with Language Semantics
**Authors**: Zhaoxing Li, Xiaoming Zhang, Haifeng Zhang, Chengxiang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T07:32:45Z

**Summary**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has recently been explored to enhance the capabilities of Text Attribute Graphs (TAGs). Most existing methods feed textual descriptions of the graph structure or neighbouring nodes' text directly into LLMs. However, these approaches often cause LLMs to treat structural information simply as general contextual text, thus limiting their effectiveness in graph-related tasks. In this paper, we introduce LanSAGNN (Language Semantic Anisotropic Graph Neural Network), a framework that extends the concept of anisotropic GNNs to the natural language level. This model leverages LLMs to extract tailor-made semantic information for node pairs, effectively capturing the unique interactions within node relationships. In addition, we propose an efficient dual-layer LLMs finetuning architecture to better align LLMs' outputs with graph tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LanSAGNN significantly enhances existing LLM-based methods without increasing complexity while also exhibiting strong robustness against interference.

### Is Your LLM Outdated? A Deep Look at Temporal Generalization
**Authors**: Chenghao Zhu, Nuo Chen, Yufei Gao, Yunyi Zhang, Prayag Tiwari, Benyou Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T07:20:24Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of benchmarks that consider temporal dynamics, however, there remains a gap in understanding how well these models can generalize across temporal contexts due to the inherent dynamic nature of language and information. This paper introduces the concept of temporal generalization in LLMs, including bias in past and future generalizations. Then we introduce FreshBench, a new evaluation framework that employs fresh text and event prediction for assessing LLMs' temporal adaptability, ensuring the evaluation process free from data leakage and subjective bias. The experiment shows significant temporal biases and a decline in performance over time. Our findings reveal that powerful models, while initially superior, tend to decline more rapidly in future generalization. Additionally, powerful open-source models demonstrate better long-term adaptability compared to their closed-source counterparts. Our code is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/FreshBench.

**Authors**: Yichen Sun, Chenggang Cui, Chuanlin Zhang, Chunyang Gong

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T07:16:06Z

**Summary**: This paper presents an enhanced electric vehicle demand response system based on large language models, aimed at optimizing the application of vehicle-to-grid technology. By leveraging an large language models-driven multi-agent framework to construct user digital twins integrated with multidimensional user profile features, it enables deep simulation and precise prediction of users' charging and discharging decision-making patterns. Additionally, a data- and knowledge-driven dynamic incentive mechanism is proposed, combining a distributed optimization model under network constraints to optimize the grid-user interaction while ensuring both economic viability and security. Simulation results demonstrate that the approach significantly improves load peak-valley regulation and charging/discharging strategies. Experimental validation highlights the system's substantial advantages in load balancing, user satisfaction and grid stability, providing decision-makers with a scalable V2G management tool that promotes the sustainable, synergistic development of vehicle-grid integration.

**Authors**: Athena Wen, Tanush Patil, Ansh Saxena, Yicheng Fu, Sean O'Brien, Kevin Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T07:11:30Z

**Summary**: In an era where AI-driven hiring is transforming recruitment practices, concerns about fairness and bias have become increasingly important. To explore these issues, we introduce a benchmark, FAIRE (Fairness Assessment In Resume Evaluation), to test for racial and gender bias in large language models (LLMs) used to evaluate resumes across different industries. We use two methods-direct scoring and ranking-to measure how model performance changes when resumes are slightly altered to reflect different racial or gender identities. Our findings reveal that while every model exhibits some degree of bias, the magnitude and direction vary considerably. This benchmark provides a clear way to examine these differences and offers valuable insights into the fairness of AI-based hiring tools. It highlights the urgent need for strategies to reduce bias in AI-driven recruitment. Our benchmark code and dataset are open-sourced at our repository: https://github.com/athenawen/FAIRE-Fairness-Assessment-In-Resume-Evaluation.git.

### Channel Estimation for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)
**Authors**: Jian Xiao, Ji Wang, Yuanwei Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T07:10:26Z

**Summary**: Pinching Antennas (PAs) represent a revolutionary flexible antenna technology that leverages dielectric waveguides and electromagnetic coupling to mitigate large-scale path loss. This letter is the first to explore channel estimation for Pinching-Antenna SyStems (PASS), addressing their uniquely ill-conditioned and underdetermined channel characteristics. In particular, two efficient deep learning-based channel estimators are proposed. 1) PAMoE: This estimator incorporates dynamic padding, feature embedding, fusion, and mixture of experts (MoE) modules, which effectively leverage the positional information of PAs and exploit expert diversity. 2) PAformer: This Transformer-style estimator employs the self-attention mechanism to predict channel coefficients in a per-antenna manner, which offers more flexibility to adaptively deal with dynamic numbers of PAs in practical deployment. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed deep learning-based channel estimators outperform conventional methods and exhibit excellent zero-shot learning capabilities, and 2) PAMoE delivers higher channel estimation accuracy via MoE specialization, while PAformer natively handles an arbitrary number of PAs, trading self-attention complexity for superior scalability.

### LLM4SZZ: Enhancing SZZ Algorithm with Context-Enhanced Assessment on   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Lingxiao Tang, Jiakun Liu, Zhongxin Liu, Xiaohu Yang, Lingfeng Bao

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T06:40:57Z

**Summary**: The SZZ algorithm is the dominant technique for identifying bug-inducing commits and serves as a foundation for many software engineering studies, such as bug prediction and static code analysis. Researchers have proposed many variants to enhance the SZZ algorithm's performance since its introduction. The majority of them rely on static techniques or heuristic assumptions, making them easy to implement, but their performance improvements are often limited. Recently, a deep learning-based SZZ algorithm has been introduced to enhance the original SZZ algorithm. However, it requires complex preprocessing and is restricted to a single programming language. Additionally, while it enhances precision, it sacrifices recall. Furthermore, most of variants overlook crucial information, such as commit messages and patch context, and are limited to bug-fixing commits involving deleted lines. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers an opportunity to address these drawbacks. In this study, we investigate the strengths and limitations of LLMs and propose LLM4SZZ, which employs two approaches (i.e., rank-based identification and context-enhanced identification) to handle different types of bug-fixing commits. We determine which approach to adopt based on the LLM's ability to comprehend the bug and identify whether the bug is present in a commit. The context-enhanced identification provides the LLM with more context and requires it to find the bug-inducing commit among a set of candidate commits. In rank-based identification, we ask the LLM to select buggy statements from the bug-fixing commit and rank them based on their relevance to the root cause. Experimental results show that LLM4SZZ outperforms all baselines across three datasets, improving F1-score by 6.9% to 16.0% without significantly sacrificing recall.

### Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model: A New Paradigm for E-commerce   Retrieval
**Authors**: Ming Pang, Chunyuan Yuan, Xiaoyu He, Zheng Fang, Donghao Xie, Fanyi Qu, Xue Jiang, Changping Peng, Zhangang Lin, Zheng Luo, Jingping Shao

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T06:40:09Z

**Summary**: Traditional sparse and dense retrieval methods struggle to leverage general world knowledge and often fail to capture the nuanced features of queries and products. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), industrial search systems have started to employ LLMs to generate identifiers for product retrieval. Commonly used identifiers include (1) static/semantic IDs and (2) product term sets. The first approach requires creating a product ID system from scratch, missing out on the world knowledge embedded within LLMs. While the second approach leverages this general knowledge, the significant difference in word distribution between queries and products means that product-based identifiers often do not align well with user search queries, leading to missed product recalls. Furthermore, when queries contain numerous attributes, these algorithms generate a large number of identifiers, making it difficult to assess their quality, which results in low overall recall efficiency.   To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel e-commerce retrieval paradigm: the Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model (GRAM). GRAM employs joint training on text information from both queries and products to generate shared text identifier codes, effectively bridging the gap between queries and products. This approach not only enhances the connection between queries and products but also improves inference efficiency. The model uses a co-alignment strategy to generate codes optimized for maximizing retrieval efficiency. Additionally, it introduces a query-product scoring mechanism to compare product values across different codes, further boosting retrieval efficiency. Extensive offline and online A/B testing demonstrates that GRAM significantly outperforms traditional models and the latest generative retrieval models, confirming its effectiveness and practicality.

### ToolACE-R: Tool Learning with Adaptive Self-Refinement
**Authors**: Xingshan Zeng, Weiwen Liu, Xu Huang, Zezhong Wang, Lingzhi Wang, Liangyou Li, Yasheng Wang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Ruiming Tang, Qun Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T06:38:56Z

**Summary**: Tool learning, which allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage external tools for solving complex user tasks, has emerged as a promising avenue for extending model capabilities. However, current approaches primarily focus on data synthesis for fine-tuning LLMs to invoke tools effectively, largely ignoring how to fully stimulate the potential of the model. In this paper, we propose ToolACE-R, a novel method that introduces adaptive self-refinement for tool invocations. Our approach features a model-aware iterative training procedure that progressively incorporates more training samples based on the model's evolving capabilities. Additionally, it allows LLMs to iteratively refine their tool calls, optimizing performance without requiring external feedback. To further enhance computational efficiency, we integrate an adaptive mechanism when scaling the inference time, enabling the model to autonomously determine when to stop the refinement process. We conduct extensive experiments across several benchmark datasets, showing that ToolACE-R achieves competitive performance compared to advanced API-based models, even without any refinement. Furthermore, its performance can be further improved efficiently through adaptive self-refinement. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is compatible with base models of various sizes, offering a promising direction for more efficient tool learning.

### Direct Preference Optimization for LLM-Enhanced Recommendation Systems
**Authors**: Chao Sun, Yaobo Liang, Yaming Yang, Shilin Xu, Tianmeng Yang, Yunhai Tong

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T06:22:49Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide range of domains, motivating research into their potential for recommendation systems. Early efforts have leveraged LLMs' rich knowledge and strong generalization capabilities via in-context learning, where recommendation tasks are framed as prompts. However, LLM performance in recommendation scenarios remains limited due to the mismatch between their pretraining objectives and recommendation tasks, as well as the lack of recommendation-specific data during pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose DPO4Rec, a novel framework that integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) into LLM-enhanced recommendation systems. First, we prompt the LLM to infer user preferences from historical interactions, which are then used to augment traditional ID-based sequential recommendation models. Next, we train a reward model based on knowledge-augmented recommendation architectures to assess the quality of LLM-generated reasoning. Using this, we select the highest- and lowest-ranked responses from N samples to construct a dataset for LLM fine-tuning. Finally, we apply a structure alignment strategy via DPO to align the LLM's outputs with desirable recommendation behavior. Extensive experiments show that DPO4Rec significantly improves re-ranking performance over strong baselines, demonstrating enhanced instruction-following capabilities of LLMs in recommendation tasks.

### Making Large Language Models Better Knowledge Miners for Online   Marketing with Progressive Prompting Augmentation
**Authors**: Chunjing Gan, Dan Yang, Binbin Hu, Ziqi Liu, Yue Shen, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jinjie Gu, Jun Zhou, Guannan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T06:20:49Z

**Summary**: Nowadays, the rapid development of mobile economy has promoted the flourishing of online marketing campaigns, whose success greatly hinges on the efficient matching between user preferences and desired marketing campaigns where a well-established Marketing-oriented Knowledge Graph (dubbed as MoKG) could serve as the critical "bridge" for preference propagation. In this paper, we seek to carefully prompt a Large Language Model (LLM) with domain-level knowledge as a better marketing-oriented knowledge miner for marketing-oriented knowledge graph construction, which is however non-trivial, suffering from several inevitable issues in real-world marketing scenarios, i.e., uncontrollable relation generation of LLMs,insufficient prompting ability of a single prompt, the unaffordable deployment cost of LLMs. To this end, we propose PAIR, a novel Progressive prompting Augmented mIning fRamework for harvesting marketing-oriented knowledge graph with LLMs. In particular, we reduce the pure relation generation to an LLM based adaptive relation filtering process through the knowledge-empowered prompting technique. Next, we steer LLMs for entity expansion with progressive prompting augmentation,followed by a reliable aggregation with comprehensive consideration of both self-consistency and semantic relatedness. In terms of online serving, we specialize in a small and white-box PAIR (i.e.,LightPAIR),which is fine-tuned with a high-quality corpus provided by a strong teacher-LLM. Extensive experiments and practical applications in audience targeting verify the effectiveness of the proposed (Light)PAIR.

### Augmenting Multimodal LLMs with Self-Reflective Tokens for   Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering
**Authors**: Federico Cocchi, Nicholas Moratelli, Marcella Cornia, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T06:19:46Z

**Summary**: Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are the natural extension of large language models to handle multimodal inputs, combining text and image data. They have recently garnered attention due to their capability to address complex tasks involving both modalities. However, their effectiveness is limited to the knowledge acquired during training, which restricts their practical utility. In this work, we introduce a novel method to enhance the adaptability of MLLMs by integrating external knowledge sources. Our proposed model, Reflective LLaVA (ReflectiVA), utilizes reflective tokens to dynamically determine the need for external knowledge and predict the relevance of information retrieved from an external database. Tokens are trained following a two-stage two-model training recipe. This ultimately enables the MLLM to manage external knowledge while preserving fluency and performance on tasks where external knowledge is not needed. Through our experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of ReflectiVA for knowledge-based visual question answering, highlighting its superior performance compared to existing methods. Source code and trained models are publicly available at https://aimagelab.github.io/ReflectiVA.

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T05:51:29Z

**Summary**: As digitalization and cloud technologies evolve, the web is becoming increasingly important in the modern society. Autonomous web agents based on large language models (LLMs) hold a great potential in work automation. It is therefore important to accurately measure and monitor the progression of their capabilities. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the current state of web agents. Our results depict a very different picture of the competency of current agents, suggesting over-optimism in previously reported results. This gap can be attributed to shortcomings in existing benchmarks. We introduce Online-Mind2Web, an online evaluation benchmark consisting of 300 diverse and realistic tasks spanning 136 websites. It enables us to evaluate web agents under a setting that approximates how real users use these agents. To facilitate more scalable evaluation and development, we also develop a novel LLM-as-a-Judge automatic evaluation method and show that it can achieve around 85% agreement with human judgment, substantially higher than existing methods. Finally, we present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of current web agents, highlighting both their strengths and limitations to inspire future research.

**Authors**: Lin Zhang, Zhouhong Gu, Suhang Zheng, Tao Wang, Tianyu Li, Hongwei Feng, Yanghua Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T05:33:05Z

**Summary**: This paper presents LITE, an LLM-based evaluation method designed for efficient and flexible assessment of taxonomy quality. To address challenges in large-scale taxonomy evaluation, such as efficiency, fairness, and consistency, LITE adopts a top-down hierarchical evaluation strategy, breaking down the taxonomy into manageable substructures and ensuring result reliability through cross-validation and standardized input formats. LITE also introduces a penalty mechanism to handle extreme cases and provides both quantitative performance analysis and qualitative insights by integrating evaluation metrics closely aligned with task objectives. Experimental results show that LITE demonstrates high reliability in complex evaluation tasks, effectively identifying semantic errors, logical contradictions, and structural flaws in taxonomies, while offering directions for improvement.

**Authors**: Nicholas Roth, Christopher Hidey, Lucas Spangher, William F. Arnold, Chang Ye, Nick Masiewicki, Jinoo Baek, Peter Grabowski, Eugene Ie

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T04:53:06Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel factored agent architecture designed to overcome the limitations of traditional single-agent systems in agentic AI. Our approach decomposes the agent into two specialized components: (1) a large language model (LLM) that serves as a high level planner and in-context learner, which may use dynamically available information in user prompts, (2) a smaller language model which acts as a memorizer of tool format and output. This decoupling addresses prevalent issues in monolithic designs, including malformed, missing, and hallucinated API fields, as well as suboptimal planning in dynamic environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our factored architecture significantly improves planning accuracy and error resilience, while elucidating the inherent trade-off between in-context learning and static memorization. These findings suggest that a factored approach is a promising pathway for developing more robust and adaptable agentic AI systems.

**Authors**: Chen Li, Yinyi Luo, Anudeep Bolimera, Uzair Ahmed, Shri Kiran Srinivasan, Hrishikesh Gokhale, Marios Savvides

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T04:51:45Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models excel in reasoning yet often rely on Chain-of-Thought prompts, limiting performance on tasks demanding more nuanced topological structures. We present SOLAR (Scalable Optimization of Large-scale Architecture for Reasoning), a framework that dynamically optimizes Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and Graph-of-Thought (GoT) topologies to boost accuracy and efficiency. Our Topological-Annotation-Generation (TAG) system automates dataset creation, annotation, and difficulty segmentation, leading to stronger post training and test-time performance. We also propose Topological-Scaling, a curriculum-learning-based approach that adaptively combines post training and inference scaling to each task. On MATH and GSM8K, SOLAR delivers notable gains: +5% accuracy with Topological Tuning, +9% with Topological Rewarding, and +10.02% with Hybrid Scaling, while reducing response length by over 5%, lowering inference latency. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce a multi-task Topological Reward Model (M-TRM) that selects both the optimal reasoning topology and final answer in a single pass, eliminating multiple single-task TRMs. Remarkably, M-TRM also surpasses all single-task TRMs, improving accuracy by +10% and rank correlation by +9%. Overall, SOLAR establishes a new benchmark for scalable, high-precision LLM reasoning and introduces a fully automated, dynamic topology competition mechanism.

### Optimizing Social Media Annotation of HPV Vaccine Skepticism and   Misinformation Using Large Language Models: An Experimental Evaluation of   In-Context Learning and Fine-Tuning Stance Detection Across Multiple Models
**Authors**: Luhang Sun, Varsha Pendyala, Yun-Shiuan Chuang, Shanglin Yang, Jonathan Feldman, Andrew Zhao, Munmun De Choudhury, Sijia Yang, Dhavan Shah

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T04:27:38Z

**Summary**: This paper leverages large-language models (LLMs) to experimentally determine optimal strategies for scaling up social media content annotation for stance detection on HPV vaccine-related tweets. We examine both conventional fine-tuning and emergent in-context learning methods, systematically varying strategies of prompt engineering across widely used LLMs and their variants (e.g., GPT4, Mistral, and Llama3, etc.). Specifically, we varied prompt template design, shot sampling methods, and shot quantity to detect stance on HPV vaccination. Our findings reveal that 1) in general, in-context learning outperforms fine-tuning in stance detection for HPV vaccine social media content; 2) increasing shot quantity does not necessarily enhance performance across models; and 3) different LLMs and their variants present differing sensitivity to in-context learning conditions. We uncovered that the optimal in-context learning configuration for stance detection on HPV vaccine tweets involves six stratified shots paired with detailed contextual prompts. This study highlights the potential and provides an applicable approach for applying LLMs to research on social media stance and skepticism detection.

### GTR: Graph-Table-RAG for Cross-Table Question Answering
**Authors**: Jiaru Zou, Dongqi Fu, Sirui Chen, Xinrui He, Zihao Li, Yada Zhu, Jiawei Han, Jingrui He

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T02:15:30Z

**Summary**: Beyond pure text, a substantial amount of knowledge is stored in tables. In real-world scenarios, user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. GraphRAG has recently attracted much attention for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by organizing external knowledge to address ad-hoc and complex questions, exemplifying a promising direction for cross-table question answering. In this paper, to address the current gap in available data, we first introduce a multi-table benchmark, MutliTableQA, comprising 60k tables and 25k user queries collected from real-world sources. Then, we propose the first Graph-Table-RAG framework, namely GTR, which reorganizes table corpora into a heterogeneous graph, employs a hierarchical coarse-to-fine retrieval process to extract the most relevant tables, and integrates graph-aware prompting for downstream LLMs' tabular reasoning. Extensive experiments show that GTR exhibits superior cross-table question-answering performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency, demonstrating its real-world practical applicability.

### SWE-Search: Enhancing Software Agents with Monte Carlo Tree Search and   Iterative Refinement
**Authors**: Antonis Antoniades, Albert Örwall, Kexun Zhang, Yuxi Xie, Anirudh Goyal, William Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T04:13:19Z

**Summary**: Software engineers operating in complex and dynamic environments must continuously adapt to evolving requirements, learn iteratively from experience, and reconsider their approaches based on new insights. However, current large language model (LLM)-based software agents often follow linear, sequential processes that prevent backtracking and exploration of alternative solutions, limiting their ability to rethink their strategies when initial approaches prove ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose SWE-Search, a multi-agent framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a self-improvement mechanism to enhance software agents' performance on repository-level software tasks. SWE-Search extends traditional MCTS by incorporating a hybrid value function that leverages LLMs for both numerical value estimation and qualitative evaluation. This enables self-feedback loops where agents iteratively refine their strategies based on both quantitative numerical evaluations and qualitative natural language assessments of pursued trajectories. The framework includes a SWE-Agent for adaptive exploration, a Value Agent for iterative feedback, and a Discriminator Agent that facilitates multi-agent debate for collaborative decision-making. Applied to the SWE-bench benchmark, our approach demonstrates a 23% relative improvement in performance across five models compared to standard open-source agents without MCTS. Our analysis reveals how performance scales with increased inference-time compute through deeper search, providing a pathway to improve software agents without requiring larger models or additional training data. This highlights the potential of self-evaluation driven search techniques in complex software engineering environments.

### SimDC: A High-Fidelity Device Simulation Platform for Device-Cloud   Collaborative Computing
**Authors**: Ruiguang Pei, Junjie Wu, Dan Peng, Min Fang, Jianan Zhang, Zhihui Fu, Jun Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T04:07:04Z

**Summary**: The advent of edge intelligence and escalating concerns for data privacy protection have sparked a surge of interest in device-cloud collaborative computing. Large-scale device deployments to validate prototype solutions are often prohibitively expensive and practically challenging, resulting in a pronounced demand for simulation tools that can emulate realworld scenarios. However, existing simulators predominantly rely solely on high-performance servers to emulate edge computing devices, overlooking (1) the discrepancies between virtual computing units and actual heterogeneous computing devices and (2) the simulation of device behaviors in real-world environments. In this paper, we propose a high-fidelity device simulation platform, called SimDC, which uses a hybrid heterogeneous resource and integrates high-performance servers and physical mobile phones. Utilizing this platform, developers can simulate numerous devices for functional testing cost-effectively and capture precise operational responses from varied real devices. To simulate real behaviors of heterogeneous devices, we offer a configurable device behavior traffic controller that dispatches results on devices to the cloud using a user-defined operation strategy. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset show the effectiveness of our simulation platform and its great potential for application. The code is available at https://github.com/opas-lab/olearning-sim.

### APPLS: Evaluating Evaluation Metrics for Plain Language Summarization
**Authors**: Yue Guo, Tal August, Gondy Leroy, Trevor Cohen, Lucy Lu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T04:03:37Z

**Summary**: While there has been significant development of models for Plain Language Summarization (PLS), evaluation remains a challenge. PLS lacks a dedicated assessment metric, and the suitability of text generation evaluation metrics is unclear due to the unique transformations involved (e.g., adding background explanations, removing jargon). To address these questions, our study introduces a granular meta-evaluation testbed, APPLS, designed to evaluate metrics for PLS. We identify four PLS criteria from previous work -- informativeness, simplification, coherence, and faithfulness -- and define a set of perturbations corresponding to these criteria that sensitive metrics should be able to detect. We apply these perturbations to extractive hypotheses for two PLS datasets to form our testbed. Using APPLS, we assess performance of 14 metrics, including automated scores, lexical features, and LLM prompt-based evaluations. Our analysis reveals that while some current metrics show sensitivity to specific criteria, no single method captures all four criteria simultaneously. We therefore recommend a suite of automated metrics be used to capture PLS quality along all relevant criteria. This work contributes the first meta-evaluation testbed for PLS and a comprehensive evaluation of existing metrics. APPLS and our evaluation code is available at https://github.com/LinguisticAnomalies/APPLS.
