**Authors**: Amit Kumar Bhuyan, Hrishikesh Dutta, Subir Biswas

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T05:13:52Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - enabled content management architecture that is suitable for critical content access in communities of users that are communication-isolated during diverse types of disaster scenarios. The proposed architecture leverages a hybrid network of stationary anchor UAVs and mobile Micro-UAVs for ubiquitous content dissemination. The anchor UAVs are equipped with both vertical and lateral communication links, and they serve local users, while the mobile micro-ferrying UAVs extend coverage across communities with increased mobility. The focus is on developing a content dissemination system that dynamically learns optimal caching policies to maximize content availability. The core innovation is an adaptive content dissemination framework based on distributed Federated Multi-Armed Bandit learning. The goal is to optimize UAV content caching decisions based on geo-temporal content popularity and user demand variations. A Selective Caching Algorithm is also introduced to reduce redundant content replication by incorporating inter-UAV information sharing. This method strategically preserves the uniqueness in user preferences while amalgamating the intelligence across a distributed learning system. This approach improves the learning algorithm's ability to adapt to diverse user preferences. Functional verification and performance evaluation confirm the proposed architecture's utility across different network sizes, UAV swarms, and content popularity patterns.

### EXAM: Exploiting Exclusive System-Level Cache in Apple M-Series SoCs for   Enhanced Cache Occupancy Attacks
**Authors**: Tianhong Xu, Aidong Adam Ding, Yunsi Fei

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T00:21:00Z

**Summary**: Cache occupancy attacks exploit the shared nature of cache hierarchies to infer a victim's activities by monitoring overall cache usage, unlike access-driven cache attacks that focus on specific cache lines or sets. There exists some prior work that target the last-level cache (LLC) of Intel processors, which is inclusive of higher-level caches, and L2 caches of ARM systems. In this paper, we target the System-Level Cache (SLC) of Apple M-series SoCs, which is exclusive to higher-level CPU caches. We address the challenges of the exclusiveness and propose a suite of SLC-cache occupancy attacks, the first of its kind, where an adversary can monitor GPU and other CPU cluster activities from their own CPU cluster. We first discover the structure of SLC in Apple M1 SOC and various policies pertaining to access and sharing through reverse engineering. We propose two attacks against websites. One is a coarse-grained fingerprinting attack, recognizing which website is accessed based on their different GPU memory access patterns monitored through the SLC occupancy channel. The other attack is a fine-grained pixel stealing attack, which precisely monitors the GPU memory usage for rendering different pixels, through the SLC occupancy channel. Third, we introduce a novel screen capturing attack which works beyond webpages, with the monitoring granularity of 57 rows of pixels (there are 1600 rows for the screen). This significantly expands the attack surface, allowing the adversary to retrieve any screen display, posing a substantial new threat to system security. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in Apple's M-series SoCs and emphasize the urgent need for effective countermeasures against cache occupancy attacks in heterogeneous computing environments.

**Authors**: Seungheon Shin, Kyle Liddy, Yinxuan Zhu, Chandan Joishi, Brianna A. Klein, Andrew Armstrong, Andrew A. Allerman, Siddharth Rajan

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T23:45:51Z

**Summary**: We report on energy bands and breakdown characteristics of Al2O3 dielectrics on ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructures. Metal-dielectric-semiconductor structures are important to sustain high fields needed for future high-performance UWBG transistors. Using systematic experiments, we determined the fixed charge density (> 1013 cm-2), the dielectric/interface, and electric fields in the oxide of under flat-band conditions in the semiconductor. Low gate-to-drain leakage current of up to 5 x 10-7 A/cm2 were obtained in the metal-oxide-semiconductor structures. In lateral metal-semiconductor-insulator test structures, breakdown voltage exceeding 1 kV was obtained with a channel sheet charge density of 1.27 x 1013 cm-2. The effective peak electric field and average breakdown field were estimated to be > 4.27 MV/cm and 1.99 MV/cm, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of Al2O2 integration for enhancing the breakdown performance of UWBG AlGaN HEMTs.

### ShadowKV: KV Cache in Shadows for High-Throughput Long-Context LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Hanshi Sun, Li-Wen Chang, Wenlei Bao, Size Zheng, Ningxin Zheng, Xin Liu, Harry Dong, Yuejie Chi, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T21:19:19Z

**Summary**: With the widespread deployment of long-context large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing demand for efficient support of high-throughput inference. However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence length, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each token generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs. While various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up inference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to sufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding latency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a high-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key cache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger batch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV employs an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV pairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks, including RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and Qwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\times$ larger batch sizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\times$ on an A100 GPU without sacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite batch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory. The code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/ShadowKV.

### Long-Context Autoregressive Video Modeling with Next-Frame Prediction
**Authors**: Yuchao Gu, Weijia Mao, Mike Zheng Shou

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T15:26:04Z

**Summary**: Long-context autoregressive modeling has significantly advanced language generation, but video generation still struggles to fully utilize extended temporal contexts. To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce Frame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive modeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens (i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous frames, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion transformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context video modeling faces challenges due to visual redundancy. Training on long videos is computationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language tokens. To tackle this issue, we propose balancing locality and long-range dependency through long short-term context modeling. A high-resolution short-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an unlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer tokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a manageable token context length, thereby significantly reducing training time and memory usage. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level KV cache designed to support the long short-term context modeling, which accelerating inference on long video sequences. We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet effective baseline for video autoregressive modeling. The code is released at https://github.com/showlab/FAR.

### In-context KV-Cache Eviction for LLMs via Attention-Gate
**Authors**: Zihao Zeng, Bokai Lin, Tianqi Hou, Hao Zhang, Zhijie Deng

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T03:51:06Z

**Summary**: The KV-Cache technique has become the standard for the inference of large language models (LLMs). Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a bottleneck of the LLM inference system. This paper enables a novel dynamic KV-Cache eviction policy by injecting a lightweight module called Attention-Gate to the model. It accepts the global context as input and yields eviction flags for each token. The self-attention modules in the model proceed according to the flags and cache only a subset of the KV states for next token prediction. The Attention-Gates can yield various flags for different heads and layers and be easily tuned on top of a pre-trained LLM via continual pre-training or supervised fine-tuning. The computational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates can be minimal. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach across multiple scenarios, showing that effective eviction of redundant tokens can not only improve efficiency but also enhance performance.

### Demoting Security via Exploitation of Cache Demote Operation in Intel's   Latest ISA Extension
**Authors**: Taehun Kim, Hyerean Jang, Youngjoo Shin

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T00:38:24Z

**Summary**: ISA extensions are increasingly adopted to boost the performance of specialized workloads without requiring an entire architectural redesign. However, these enhancements can inadvertently expose new attack surfaces in the microarchitecture. In this paper, we investigate Intel's recently introduced cldemote extension, which promotes efficient data sharing by transferring cache lines from upper-level caches to the Last Level Cache (LLC). Despite its performance benefits, we uncover critical properties-unprivileged access, inter-cache state transition, and fault suppression-that render cldemote exploitable for microarchitectural attacks. We propose two new attack primitives, Flush+Demote and Demote+Time, built on our analysis. Flush+Demote constructs a covert channel with a bandwidth of 2.84 Mbps and a bit error rate of 0.018%, while Demote+Time derandomizes the kernel base address in 2.49 ms on Linux. Furthermore, we show that leveraging cldemote accelerates eviction set construction in non-inclusive LLC designs by obviating the need for helper threads or extensive cache conflicts, thereby reducing construction time by 36% yet retaining comparable success rates. Finally, we examine how ISA extensions contribute to broader microarchitectural attacks, identifying five key exploitable characteristics and categorizing four distinct attack types. We also discuss potential countermeasures, highlighting the far-reaching security implications of emerging ISA extensions.

### MOM: Memory-Efficient Offloaded Mini-Sequence Inference for Long Context   Language Models
**Authors**: Junyang Zhang, Tianyi Zhu, Cheng Luo, Anima Anandkumar

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T23:15:09Z

**Summary**: Long-context language models exhibit impressive performance but remain challenging to deploy due to high GPU memory demands during inference. We propose Memory-efficient Offloaded Mini-sequence Inference (MOM), a method that partitions critical layers into smaller "mini-sequences" and integrates seamlessly with KV cache offloading. Experiments on various Llama, Qwen, and Mistral models demonstrate that MOM reduces peak memory usage by over 50\% on average. On Meta-Llama-3.2-8B, MOM extends the maximum context length from 155k to 455k tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU, while keeping outputs identical and not compromising accuracy. MOM also maintains highly competitive throughput due to minimal computational overhead and efficient last-layer processing. Compared to traditional chunked prefill methods, MOM achieves a 35\% greater context length extension. More importantly, our method drastically reduces prefill memory consumption, eliminating it as the longstanding dominant memory bottleneck during inference. This breakthrough fundamentally changes research priorities, redirecting future efforts from prefill-stage optimizations to improving decode-stage residual KV cache efficiency.

### Activated LoRA: Fine-tuned LLMs for Intrinsics
**Authors**: Kristjan Greenewald, Luis Lastras, Thomas Parnell, Vraj Shah, Lucian Popa, Giulio Zizzo, Chulaka Gunasekara, Ambrish Rawat, David Cox

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T18:03:21Z

**Summary**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is highly inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. highly specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We use aLoRA to train a set of intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.

**Authors**: Abhimanyu Rajeshkumar Bambhaniya, Hanjiang Wu, Suvinay Subramanian, Sudarshan Srinivasan, Souvik Kundu, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Midhilesh Elavazhagan, Madhu Kumar, Tushar Krishna

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T17:34:04Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for increasingly sophisticated inference pipelines and hardware platforms. Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.   To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.

**Authors**: Junhao Zhuang, Lingen Li, Xuan Ju, Zhaoyang Zhang, Chun Yuan, Ying Shan

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T16:45:19Z

**Summary**: The comic production industry requires reference-based line art colorization with high accuracy, efficiency, contextual consistency, and flexible control. A comic page often involves diverse characters, objects, and backgrounds, which complicates the coloring process. Despite advancements in diffusion models for image generation, their application in line art colorization remains limited, facing challenges related to handling extensive reference images, time-consuming inference, and flexible control. We investigate the necessity of extensive contextual image guidance on the quality of line art colorization. To address these challenges, we introduce Cobra, an efficient and versatile method that supports color hints and utilizes over 200 reference images while maintaining low latency. Central to Cobra is a Causal Sparse DiT architecture, which leverages specially designed positional encodings, causal sparse attention, and Key-Value Cache to effectively manage long-context references and ensure color identity consistency. Results demonstrate that Cobra achieves accurate line art colorization through extensive contextual reference, significantly enhancing inference speed and interactivity, thereby meeting critical industrial demands. We release our codes and models on our project page: https://zhuang2002.github.io/Cobra/.

**Authors**: Kihyun Kim, Jinwoo Kim, Hyunsun Chung, Myung-Hoon Cha, Hong-Yeon Kim, Youngjae Kim

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T07:02:38Z

**Summary**: LLM inference is essential for applications like text summarization, translation, and data analysis, but the high cost of GPU instances from Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) like AWS is a major burden. This paper proposes InferSave, a cost-efficient VM selection framework for cloud based LLM inference. InferSave optimizes KV cache offloading based on Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and workload charac teristics, estimating GPU memory needs, and recommending cost-effective VM instances. Additionally, the Compute Time Calibration Function (CTCF) improves instance selection accuracy by adjusting for discrepancies between theoretical and actual GPU performance. Experiments on AWS GPU instances show that selecting lower-cost instances without KV cache offloading improves cost efficiency by up to 73.7% for online workloads, while KV cache offloading saves up to 20.19% for offline workloads.

### Efficient Architecture for RISC-V Vector Memory Access
**Authors**: Hongyi Guan, Yichuan Gao, Chenlu Miao, Haoyang Wu, Hang Zhu, Mingfeng Lin, Huayue Liang

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T05:57:08Z

**Summary**: Vector processors frequently suffer from inefficient memory accesses, particularly for strided and segment patterns. While coalescing strided accesses is a natural solution, effectively gathering or scattering elements at fixed strides remains challenging. Naive approaches rely on high-overhead crossbars that remap any byte between memory and registers, leading to physical design issues. Segment operations require row-column transpositions, typically handled using either element-level in-place transposition (degrading performance) or large buffer-based bulk transposition (incurring high area overhead). In this paper, we present EARTH, a novel vector memory access architecture designed to overcome these challenges through shifting-based optimizations. For strided accesses, EARTH integrates specialized shift networks for gathering and scattering elements. After coalescing multiple accesses within the same cache line, data is routed between memory and registers through the shifting network with minimal overhead. For segment operations, EARTH employs a shifted register bank enabling direct column-wise access, eliminating dedicated segment buffers while providing high-performance, in-place bulk transposition. Implemented on FPGA with Chisel HDL based on an open-source RISC-V vector unit, EARTH enhances performance for strided memory accesses, achieving 4x-8x speedups in benchmarks dominated by strided operations. Compared to conventional designs, EARTH reduces hardware area by 9% and power consumption by 41%, significantly advancing both performance and efficiency of vector processors.

### Shared Disk KV Cache Management for Efficient Multi-Instance Inference   in RAG-Powered LLMs
**Authors**: Hyungwoo Lee, Kihyun Kim, Jinwoo Kim, Jungmin So, Myung-Hoon Cha, Hong-Yeon Kim, James J. Kim, Youngjae Kim

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T04:59:18Z

**Summary**: Recent large language models (LLMs) face increasing inference latency as input context length and model size continue to grow. In particular, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which enhances LLM responses by incorporating external knowledge, exacerbates this issue by significantly increasing the number of input tokens. This expansion in token length leads to a substantial rise in computational overhead, particularly during the prefill stage, resulting in prolonged time-to-first-token (TTFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce TTFT by leveraging a disk-based key-value (KV) cache to lessen the computational burden during the prefill stage. We also introduce a disk-based shared KV cache management system, called Shared RAG-DCache, for multi-instance LLM RAG service environments. This system, together with an optimal system configuration, improves both throughput and latency under given resource constraints. Shared RAG-DCache exploits the locality of documents related to user queries in RAG, as well as the queueing delay in LLM inference services. It proactively generates and stores disk KV caches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM instances to enhance inference performance. In experiments on a single host equipped with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU, Shared RAG-DCache achieved a 15~71% increase in throughput and up to a 12~65% reduction in latency, depending on the resource configuration.

### EdgePrompt: A Distributed Key-Value Inference Framework for LLMs in 6G   Networks
**Authors**: Jiahong Ning, Pengyan Zhu, Ce Zheng, Gary Lee, Sumei Sun, Tingting Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T03:07:07Z

**Summary**: As sixth-generation (6G) networks advance, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into 6G infrastructure to enhance network management and intelligence. However, traditional LLMs architecture struggle to meet the stringent latency and security requirements of 6G, especially as the increasing in sequence length leads to greater task complexity. This paper proposes Edge-Prompt, a cloud-edge collaborative framework based on a hierarchical attention splicing mechanism. EdgePrompt employs distributed key-value (KV) pair optimization techniques to accelerate inference and adapt to network conditions. Additionally, to reduce the risk of data leakage, EdgePrompt incorporates a privacy preserving strategy by isolating sensitive information during processing. Experiments on public dataset show that EdgePrompt effectively improves the inference throughput and reduces the latency, which provides a reliable solution for LLMs deployment in 6G environments.

### Engineering MultiQueues: Fast Relaxed Concurrent Priority Queues
**Authors**: Marvin Williams, Peter Sanders

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T22:38:54Z

**Summary**: Priority queues are used in a wide range of applications, including prioritized online scheduling, discrete event simulation, and greedy algorithms. In parallel settings, classical priority queues often become a severe bottleneck, resulting in low throughput. Consequently, there has been significant interest in concurrent priority queues with relaxed semantics. In this article, we present the MultiQueue, a flexible approach to relaxed priority queues that uses multiple internal sequential priority queues. The scalability of the MultiQueue is enhanced by buffering elements, batching operations on the internal queues, and optimizing access patterns for high cache locality. We investigate the complementary quality criteria of rank error, which measures how close deleted elements are to the global minimum, and delay, which quantifies how many smaller elements were deleted before a given element. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the MultiQueue outperforms competing approaches across several benchmarks. This includes shortest-path and branch-and-bound benchmarks that resemble real applications. Moreover, the MultiQueue can be configured easily to balance throughput and quality according to the application's requirements. We employ a seemingly paradoxical technique of wait-free locking that might be of broader interest for converting sequential data structures into relaxed concurrent data structures.

### Optimizing LLM Inference: Fluid-Guided Online Scheduling with Memory   Constraints
**Authors**: Ruicheng Ao, Gan Luo, David Simchi-Levi, Xinshang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T16:00:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are indispensable in today's applications, but their inference procedure -- generating responses by processing text in segments and using a memory-heavy Key-Value (KV) cache -- demands significant computational resources, particularly under memory constraints. This paper formulates LLM inference optimization as a multi-stage online scheduling problem where sequential prompt arrivals and KV cache growth render conventional scheduling ineffective. We develop a fluid dynamics approximation to provide a tractable benchmark that guides algorithm design. Building on this, we propose the Waiting for Accumulated Inference Threshold (WAIT) algorithm, which uses multiple thresholds to schedule incoming prompts optimally when output lengths are known, and extend it to Nested WAIT for cases with unknown output lengths. Theoretical analysis shows that both algorithms achieve near-optimal performance against the fluid benchmark in heavy traffic conditions, balancing throughput, latency, and Time to First Token (TTFT). Experiments with the Llama-7B model on an A100 GPU using both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate improved throughput and reduced latency relative to established baselines like vLLM and Sarathi. This work bridges operations research and machine learning, offering a rigorous framework for the efficient deployment of LLMs under memory constraints.

### Performant Automatic BLAS Offloading on Unified Memory Architecture with   OpenMP First-Touch Style Data Movement
**Authors**: Junjie Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T15:40:25Z

**Summary**: BLAS is a fundamental building block of advanced linear algebra libraries and many modern scientific computing applications. GPUs are known for their strong arithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations. However, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for large, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While various tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often impractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The advent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the NVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of memory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in conventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative application developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary work demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends the framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a novel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory coherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement policy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU programming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing codes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool intercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code modifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple quantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising speedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was achieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T15:37:58Z

**Summary**: Porting codes to GPU often requires major efforts. While several tools exist for automatically offload numerical libraries such as BLAS and LAPACK, they often prove impractical due to the high cost of mandatory data transfer. The new unified memory architecture in NVIDIA Grace-Hopper allows high bandwidth cache-coherent memory access of all memory from both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating bottleneck faced in conventional architecture. This breakthrough opens up new avenues for application development and porting strategies. In this study, we introduce a new tool for automatic BLAS offload, the tool leverages the high speed cache coherent NVLink C2C interconnect in Grace-Hopper, and enables performant GPU offload for BLAS heavy applications with no code changes or recompilation. The tool was tested on two quantum chemistry or physics codes, great performance benefits were observed.

### Slice+Slice Baby: Generating Last-Level Cache Eviction Sets in the Blink   of an Eye
**Authors**: Bradley Morgan, Gal Horowitz, Sioli O'Connell, Stephan van Schaik, Chitchanok Chuengsatiansup, Daniel Genkin, Olaf Maennel, Paul Montague, Eyal Ronen, Yuval Yarom

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T14:11:38Z

**Summary**: An essential step for mounting cache attacks is finding eviction sets, collections of memory locations that contend on cache space. On Intel processors, one of the main challenges for identifying contending addresses is the sliced cache design, where the processor hashes the physical address to determine where in the cache a memory location is stored. While past works have demonstrated that the hash function can be reversed, they also showed that it depends on physical address bits that the adversary does not know.   In this work, we make three main contributions to the art of finding eviction sets. We first exploit microarchitectural races to compare memory access times and identify the cache slice to which an address maps. We then use the known hash function to both reduce the error rate in our slice identification method and to reduce the work by extrapolating slice mappings to untested memory addresses. Finally, we show how to propagate information on eviction sets across different page offsets for the hitherto unexplored case of non-linear hash functions.   Our contributions allow for entire LLC eviction set generation in 0.7 seconds on the Intel i7-9850H and 1.6 seconds on the i9-10900K, both using non-linear functions. This represents a significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art techniques taking 9x and 10x longer, respectively.

### Morphing-based Compression for Data-centric ML Pipelines
**Authors**: Sebastian Baunsgaard, Matthias Boehm

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T11:02:34Z

**Summary**: Data-centric ML pipelines extend traditional machine learning (ML) pipelines -- of feature transformations and ML model training -- by outer loops for data cleaning, augmentation, and feature engineering to create high-quality input data. Existing lossless matrix compression applies lightweight compression schemes to numeric matrices and performs linear algebra operations such as matrix-vector multiplications directly on the compressed representation but struggles to efficiently rediscover structural data redundancy. Compressed operations are effective at fitting data in available memory, reducing I/O across the storage-memory-cache hierarchy, and improving instruction parallelism. The applied data cleaning, augmentation, and feature transformations provide a rich source of information about data characteristics such as distinct items, column sparsity, and column correlations. In this paper, we introduce BWARE -- an extension of AWARE for workload-aware lossless matrix compression -- that pushes compression through feature transformations and engineering to leverage information about structural transformations. Besides compressed feature transformations, we introduce a novel technique for lightweight morphing of a compressed representation into workload-optimized compressed representations without decompression. BWARE shows substantial end-to-end runtime improvements, reducing the execution time for training data-centric ML pipelines from days to hours.

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T15:34:26Z

**Summary**: AlayaDB is a cutting-edge vector database system natively architected for efficient and effective long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) at AlayaDB AI. Specifically, it decouples the KV cache and attention computation from the LLM inference systems, and encapsulates them into a novel vector database system. For the Model as a Service providers (MaaS), AlayaDB consumes fewer hardware resources and offers higher generation quality for various workloads with different kinds of Service Level Objectives (SLOs), when comparing with the existing alternative solutions (e.g., KV cache disaggregation, retrieval-based sparse attention). The crux of AlayaDB is that it abstracts the attention computation and cache management for LLM inference into a query processing procedure, and optimizes the performance via a native query optimizer. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AlayaDB via (i) three use cases from our industry partners, and (ii) extensive experimental results on LLM inference benchmarks.

### Shield Bash: Abusing Defensive Coherence State Retrieval to Break Timing   Obfuscation
**Authors**: Kartik Ramkrishnan, Antonia Zhai, Stephen McCamant, Pen Chung Yew

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T15:27:32Z

**Summary**: Microarchitectural attacks are a significant concern, leading to many hardware-based defense proposals. However, different defenses target different classes of attacks, and their impact on each other has not been fully considered. To raise awareness of this problem, we study an interaction between two state-of-the art defenses in this paper, timing obfuscations of remote cache lines (TORC) and delaying speculative changes to remote cache lines (DSRC). TORC mitigates cache-hit based attacks and DSRC mitigates speculative coherence state change attacks.   We observe that DSRC enables coherence information to be retrieved into the processor core, where it is out of the reach of timing obfuscations to protect. This creates an unforeseen consequence that redo operations can be triggered within the core to detect the presence or absence of remote cache lines, which constitutes a security vulnerability. We demonstrate that a new covert channel attack is possible using this vulnerability. We propose two ways to mitigate the attack, whose performance varies depending on an application's cache usage. One way is to never send remote exclusive coherence state (E) information to the core even if it is created. The other way is to never create a remote E state, which is responsible for triggering redos.   We demonstrate the timing difference caused by this microarchitectural defense assumption violation using GEM5 simulations. Performance evaluation on SPECrate 2017 and PARSEC benchmarks of the two fixes show less than 32\% average overhead across both sets of benchmarks. The repair which prevented the creation of remote E state had less than 2.8% average overhead.

### A New Paradigm in IBR Modeling for Power Flow and Short Circuit Analysis
**Authors**: Zahid Javid, Firdous Ul Nazir, Wentao Zhu, Diptargha Chakravorty, Ahmed Aboushady, Mohamed Galeela

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T12:34:20Z

**Summary**: The fault characteristics of inverter-based resources (IBRs) are different from conventional synchronous generators. The fault response of IBRs is non-linear due to saturation states and mainly determined by fault ride through (FRT) strategies of the associated voltage source converter (VSC). This results in prohibitively large solution times for power flows considering these short circuit characteristics, especially when the power system states change fast due to uncertainty in IBR generations. To overcome this, a phasor-domain steady state (SS) short circuit (SC) solver for IBR dominated power systems is proposed in this paper, and subsequently the developed IBR models are incorporated with a novel Jacobian-based Power Flow (PF) solver. In this multiphase PF solver, any power system components can be modeled by considering their original non-linear or linear mathematical representations. Moreover, two novel FRT strategies are proposed to fully utilize the converter capacity and to comply with IEEE-2800 2022 std and German grid code. The results are compared with the Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulation on the IEEE 34 test network and the 120 kV EPRI benchmark system. The developed IBR sequence domain PF model demonstrates more accurate behavior compared to the classical IBR generator model. The error in calculating the short circuit current with the proposed SC solver is less than 3%, while achieving significant speed improvements of three order of magnitudes.

### Diversity in Network-Friendly Recommendations
**Authors**: Evangelia Tzimpimpaki, Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T11:20:56Z

**Summary**: In recent years, the Internet has been dominated by content-rich platforms, employing recommendation systems to provide users with more appealing content (e.g., videos in YouTube, movies in Netflix). While traditional content recommendations are oblivious to network conditions, the paradigm of Network-Friendly Recommendations (NFR) has recently emerged, favoring content that improves network performance (e.g. cached near the user), while still being appealing to the user. However, NFR algorithms sometimes achieve their goal by shrinking the pool of content recommended to users. The undesirable side-effect is reduced content diversity, a phenomenon known as ``content/filter bubble''. This reduced diversity is problematic for both users, who are prevented from exploring a broader range of content, and content creators (e.g. YouTubers) whose content may be recommended less frequently, leading to perceived unfairness. In this paper, we first investigate - using real data and state-of-the-art NFR schemes - the extent of this phenomenon. We then formulate a ``Diverse-NFR'' optimization problem (i.e., network-friendly recommendations with - sufficient - content diversity), and through a series of transformation steps, we manage to reduce it to a linear program that can be solved fast and optimally. Our findings show that Diverse-NFR can achieve high network gains (comparable to non-diverse NFR) while maintaining diversity constraints. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that incorporates diversity issues into network-friendly recommendation algorithms.

### On Precomputation and Caching in Information Retrieval Experiments with   Pipeline Architectures
**Authors**: Sean MacAvaney, Craig Macdonald

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T08:51:35Z

**Summary**: Modern information retrieval systems often rely on multiple components executed in a pipeline. In a research setting, this can lead to substantial redundant computations (e.g., retrieving the same query multiple times for evaluating different downstream rerankers). To overcome this, researchers take cached "result" files as inputs, which represent the output of another pipeline. However, these result files can be brittle and can cause a disconnect between the conceptual design of the pipeline and its logical implementation. To overcome both the redundancy problem (when executing complete pipelines) and the disconnect problem (when relying on intermediate result files), we describe our recent efforts to improve the caching capabilities in the open-source PyTerrier IR platform. We focus on two main directions: (1) automatic implicit caching of common pipeline prefixes when comparing systems and (2) explicit caching of operations through a new extension package, pyterrier-caching. These approaches allow for the best of both worlds: pipelines can be fully expressed end-to-end, while also avoiding redundant computations between pipelines.

### Secrecy and Privacy in Multi-Access Combinatorial Topology
**Authors**: Mallikharjuna Chinnapadamala, B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T07:30:03Z

**Summary**: In this work, we consider the multi-access combinatorial topology with $C$ caches where each user accesses a unique set of $r$ caches. For this setup, we consider secrecy, where each user should not know anything about the files it did not request, and demand privacy, where each user's demand must be kept private from other non-colluding users. We propose a scheme satisfying both conditions and derive a lower bound based on cut-set arguments. Also, we prove that our scheme is optimal when $r\geq C-1$, and it is order-optimal when the cache memory size $M$ is greater than or equal to a certain threshold for $r<C-1$. When $r=1$, in most of the memory region, our scheme achieves the same rate as the one given by the secretive scheme for the dedicated cache setup by Ravindrakumar et al. ( 'Private Coded Caching,' in \textit{IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security}, 2018), while satisfying both secrecy and demand privacy conditions.

### KeepKV: Eliminating Output Perturbation in KV Cache Compression for   Efficient LLMs Inference
**Authors**: Yuxuan Tian, Zihan Wang, Yebo Peng, Aomufei Yuan, Zhiming Wang, Bairen Yi, Xin Liu, Yong Cui, Tong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T06:58:00Z

**Summary**: Efficient inference of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by an ever-growing key-value (KV) cache, making KV cache compression a critical research direction. Traditional methods selectively evict less important KV cache entries based on attention scores or position heuristics, which leads to information loss and hallucinations. Recently, merging-based strategies have been explored to retain more information by merging KV pairs that would be discarded; however, these existing approaches inevitably introduce inconsistencies in attention distributions before and after merging, causing output perturbation and degraded generation quality. To overcome this challenge, we propose KeepKV, a novel adaptive KV cache merging method designed to eliminate output perturbation while preserving performance under strict memory constraints. KeepKV introduces the Electoral Votes mechanism that records merging history and adaptively adjusts attention scores. Moreover, it further leverages a novel Zero Inference-Perturbation Merging methods, keeping attention consistency and compensating for attention loss resulting from cache merging. KeepKV successfully retains essential context information within a significantly compressed cache. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLM architectures demonstrate that KeepKV substantially reduces memory usage, enhances inference throughput by more than 2x and keeps superior generation quality even with 10% KV cache budgets.

### Plato: Plan to Efficiently Decode for Large Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Shuowei Jin, Xueshen Liu, Yongji Wu, Haizhong Zheng, Qingzhao Zhang, Atul Prakash, Matthew Lentz, Danyang Zhuo, Feng Qian, Z. Morley Mao

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T14:17:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language tasks, but their inference incurs substantial computational and memory overhead. To improve efficiency, parallel decoding methods like Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT) decompose prompts into sub-problems for concurrent processing. However, these methods significantly compromise answer quality by treating semantically linked sub-problems as independent. We propose Plato, a novel approach that co-designs algorithms and systems for semantic-aware parallel decoding. Plato leverages LLMs to organize sub-problems into a dependency graph based on logical and causal relationships, enabling concurrent decoding of non-dependent nodes while preserving answer coherence and quality. To further enhance efficiency, Plato pipelines planning and node decoding stages, implements a global context cache, and carefully structures node inference prompts to maximize key-value cache reuse and minimize overhead. Our evaluations show that Plato improves throughput by 68% over autoregressive decoding while achieving a 40% net win rate in answer quality. Compared to SoT, Plato demonstrates a remarkable 90% quality net-win rate. Ablation studies reveal that our pipeline design improves speedup by 29%, while our KV cache reuse optimization reduces overhead by 75%.

### Efficient LLM Serving on Hybrid Real-time and Best-effort Requests
**Authors**: Wan Borui, Zhao Juntao, Jiang Chenyu, Guo Chuanxiong, Wu Chuan

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T14:16:57Z

**Summary**: Recent breakthroughs in large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled various generative tasks on a single model. Real-world services (e.g., OpenAI's ChatGPT [27]) powered by an LLM often concurrently support latency-critical requests for interactive applications (e.g., question-answering systems, referred to as real-time or RT requests) and throughput-oriented requests for back-of-house processing (e.g., documents batch processing [28], referred to best-effort or BE requests), with complex hybrid inference workloads to the underlying model. State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM serving systems dedicate machines to each type of request, towards either low inference latency or high serving throughput, respectively. This practice simplifies request scheduling and management but suffers from poor resource utilization. We propose BROS, a hybrid LLM serving system that aims to collocate RT/BE requests, meeting RT requests' latency requirements while maintaining BE requests' throughput. BROS formulates the problem of hybrid RT/BE request scheduling and solves it with a dynamic priority-based algorithm. BROS designs a bidirectional KV cache management mechanism, allowing RT requests to share KV memory with BE requests to remove the scheduling restrictions caused by insufficient KV memory and improve utilization. Extensive experiments validate that BROS achieves a good trade-off when serving hybrid RT and BE requests. It significantly reduces the latency of RT requests (up to 74.20%), improving their fine-grained service level objectives (SLOs) attainments (up to 36.38x), with negligible throughput reduction for BE requests, showing significant advantages over SOTA systems like vLLM and TGI.

### Block-Attention for Efficient Prefilling
**Authors**: Dongyang Ma, Yan Wang, Lan Tian

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T14:02:47Z

**Summary**: We introduce Block-attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Traditional approaches often encode the entire context in an auto-regressive manner. Instead, Block-attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each block independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during inference. The implementation of Block-attention involves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-attention mechanism. Experiments on 11 diverse benchmarks, including RAG, ICL, and general domains, demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block-attention model not only achieves performance comparable to that of full-attention models, but can also seamlessly switch between the block and full attention modes without any performance loss. Notably, Block-attention significantly reduces the time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared to the full-attention models, the TTFT and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7% and 99.8%, respectively. Additionally, in Appendix A, we elaborate on how Block-attention is applied in Game AI scenario and the substantial potential benefits it entails. We strongly suggest researchers in the gaming field not to overlook this section.

### AB-Cache: Training-Free Acceleration of Diffusion Models via   Adams-Bashforth Cached Feature Reuse
**Authors**: Zichao Yu, Zhen Zou, Guojiang Shao, Chengwei Zhang, Shengze Xu, Jie Huang, Feng Zhao, Xiaodong Cun, Wenyi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T08:29:58Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in generative tasks, yet their iterative denoising process results in slow inference, limiting their practicality. While existing acceleration methods exploit the well-known U-shaped similarity pattern between adjacent steps through caching mechanisms, they lack theoretical foundation and rely on simplistic computation reuse, often leading to performance degradation. In this work, we provide a theoretical understanding by analyzing the denoising process through the second-order Adams-Bashforth method, revealing a linear relationship between the outputs of consecutive steps. This analysis explains why the outputs of adjacent steps exhibit a U-shaped pattern. Furthermore, extending Adams-Bashforth method to higher order, we propose a novel caching-based acceleration approach for diffusion models, instead of directly reusing cached results, with a truncation error bound of only \(O(h^k)\) where $h$ is the step size. Extensive validation across diverse image and video diffusion models (including HunyuanVideo and FLUX.1-dev) with various schedulers demonstrates our method's effectiveness in achieving nearly $3\times$ speedup while maintaining original performance levels, offering a practical real-time solution without compromising generation quality.

### Sub-nanosecond in-plane magnetization switching induced by field-like   spin-orbit torques from ferromagnets
**Authors**: Hanying Zhang, Ziqian Cui, Baiqing Jiang, Yuan Wang, C. Bi

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T04:46:02Z

**Summary**: Spin-orbit torques (SOTs) generated in SOT-material/ferromagnet structures are classified as damping-like (DL) and field-like (FL) torques for current-driven magnetization switching. It is well known that both DL- and FL-SOTs originate from the SOT-material and DL-SOT dominates the current-driven switching process while FL-SOT contributes limitedly, resulting in an incubation time (several nanoseconds) during collinear magnetization switching with the spin polarization because of the DL attributes. Here we report a FL-SOT originated from the ferromagnet, different from the origin of DL-SOT, and demonstrate that it dominates the collinear magnetization switching. We show that the FL-SOT and resultant collinear switching can be modulated, one order of magnitude and sign reversal, by controlling the ferromagnet. Because of no incubation time and higher charge-to-spin efficiencies in the FL switching, we further show that the switching time can be down to 200 ps with one order lower critical switching current density compared to DL switching. These results indicate that the FL switching may provide a practical solution for magnetic memory in speed-priority cache applications.

### Head-Aware KV Cache Compression for Efficient Visual Autoregressive   Modeling
**Authors**: Ziran Qin, Youru Lv, Mingbao Lin, Zeren Zhang, Danping Zou, Weiyao Lin

**Updated**: 2025-04-12T15:42:17Z

**Summary**: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have emerged as a powerful approach for multi-modal content creation, offering high efficiency and quality across diverse multimedia applications. However, they face significant memory bottlenecks due to extensive KV cache accumulation during inference. Existing KV cache compression techniques for large language models are suboptimal for VAR models due to, as we identify in this paper, two distinct categories of attention heads in VAR models: Structural Heads, which preserve spatial coherence through diagonal attention patterns, and Contextual Heads, which maintain semantic consistency through vertical attention patterns. These differences render single-strategy KV compression techniques ineffective for VAR models. To address this, we propose HACK, a training-free Head-Aware Compression method for KV cache. HACK allocates asymmetric cache budgets and employs pattern-specific compression strategies tailored to the essential characteristics of each head category. Experiments on Infinity-2B, Infinity-8B, and VAR-d30 demonstrate its effectiveness in text-to-image and class-conditional generation tasks. HACK can hack down up to 50\% and 70\% of cache with minimal performance degradation for VAR-d30 and Infinity-8B, respectively. Even with 70\% and 90\% KV cache compression in VAR-d30 and Infinity-8B, HACK still maintains high-quality generation while reducing memory usage by 44.2\% and 58.9\%, respectively.

### WF-VAE: Enhancing Video VAE by Wavelet-Driven Energy Flow for Latent   Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Zongjian Li, Bin Lin, Yang Ye, Liuhan Chen, Xinhua Cheng, Shenghai Yuan, Li Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-04-11T12:31:07Z

**Summary**: Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional latent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly, we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache, which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference. Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and 4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/WF-VAE.

### Scaling Up On-Device LLMs via Active-Weight Swapping Between DRAM and   Flash
**Authors**: Fucheng Jia, Zewen Wu, Shiqi Jiang, Huiqiang Jiang, Qianxi Zhang, Yuqing Yang, Yunxin Liu, Ju Ren, Deyu Zhang, Ting Cao

**Updated**: 2025-04-11T09:26:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed on mobile devices, but the limited DRAM capacity constrains the deployable model size. This paper introduces ActiveFlow, the first LLM inference framework that can achieve adaptive DRAM usage for modern LLMs (not ReLU-based), enabling the scaling up of deployable model sizes. The framework is based on the novel concept of active weight DRAM-flash swapping and incorporates three novel techniques: (1) Cross-layer active weights preloading. It uses the activations from the current layer to predict the active weights of several subsequent layers, enabling computation and data loading to overlap, as well as facilitating large I/O transfers. (2) Sparsity-aware self-distillation. It adjusts the active weights to align with the dense-model output distribution, compensating for approximations introduced by contextual sparsity. (3) Active weight DRAM-flash swapping pipeline. It orchestrates the DRAM space allocation among the hot weight cache, preloaded active weights, and computation-involved weights based on available memory. Results show ActiveFlow achieves the performance-cost Pareto frontier compared to existing efficiency optimization methods.

### II-NVM: Enhancing Map Accuracy and Consistency with Normal   Vector-Assisted Mapping
**Authors**: Chengwei Zhao, Yixuan Li, Yina Jian, Jie Xu, Linji Wang, Yongxin Ma, Xinglai Jin

**Updated**: 2025-04-11T02:10:02Z

**Summary**: SLAM technology plays a crucial role in indoor mapping and localization. A common challenge in indoor environments is the "double-sided mapping issue", where closely positioned walls, doors, and other surfaces are mistakenly identified as a single plane, significantly hindering map accuracy and consistency. To address this issue this paper introduces a SLAM approach that ensures accurate mapping using normal vector consistency. We enhance the voxel map structure to store both point cloud data and normal vector information, enabling the system to evaluate consistency during nearest neighbor searches and map updates. This process distinguishes between the front and back sides of surfaces, preventing incorrect point-to-plane constraints. Moreover, we implement an adaptive radius KD-tree search method that dynamically adjusts the search radius based on the local density of the point cloud, thereby enhancing the accuracy of normal vector calculations. To further improve realtime performance and storage efficiency, we incorporate a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache strategy, which facilitates efficient incremental updates of the voxel map. The code is released as open-source and validated in both simulated environments and real indoor scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach effectively resolves the "double-sided mapping issue" and significantly improves mapping precision. Additionally, we have developed and open-sourced the first simulation and real world dataset specifically tailored for the "double-sided mapping issue".

### Boosting Universal LLM Reward Design through Heuristic Reward   Observation Space Evolution
**Authors**: Zen Kit Heng, Zimeng Zhao, Tianhao Wu, Yuanfei Wang, Mingdong Wu, Yangang Wang, Hao Dong

**Updated**: 2025-04-11T02:05:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising tools for automated reinforcement learning (RL) reward design, owing to their robust capabilities in commonsense reasoning and code generation. By engaging in dialogues with RL agents, LLMs construct a Reward Observation Space (ROS) by selecting relevant environment states and defining their internal operations. However, existing frameworks have not effectively leveraged historical exploration data or manual task descriptions to iteratively evolve this space. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic framework that enhances LLM-driven reward design by evolving the ROS through a table-based exploration caching mechanism and a text-code reconciliation strategy. Our framework introduces a state execution table, which tracks the historical usage and success rates of environment states, overcoming the Markovian constraint typically found in LLM dialogues and facilitating more effective exploration. Furthermore, we reconcile user-provided task descriptions with expert-defined success criteria using structured prompts, ensuring alignment in reward design objectives. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark RL tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed framework. Code and video demos are available at jingjjjjjie.github.io/LLM2Reward.

**Authors**: Georgeta Bordea, Stephane Campinas, Matteo Catena, Renaud Delbru

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T14:52:03Z

**Summary**: Investigative workflows require interactive exploratory analysis on large heterogeneous knowledge graphs. Current databases show limitations in enabling such task. This paper discusses the architecture of Siren Federate, a system that efficiently supports exploratory graph analysis by bridging document-oriented, relational and graph models. Technical contributions include distributed join algorithms, adaptive query planning, query plan folding, semantic caching, and semi-join decomposition for path query. Semi-join decomposition addresses the exponential growth of intermediate results in path-based queries. Experiments show that Siren Federate exhibits low latency and scales well with the amount of data, the number of users, and the number of computing nodes.

**Summary**: Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers are integral to program analysis techniques like concolic and symbolic execution, where they help assess the satisfiability of logical formulae to explore execution paths of the program under test. However, frequent solver invocations are still the main performance bottleneck of these techniques. One way to mitigate this challenge is through optimizations such as caching and reusing solver results. While current methods typically focus on reusing results from fully equivalent or closely related formulas, they often miss broader opportunities for reuse. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Cache-a-lot, that extends the reuse of unsatisfiable (unsat) results by systematically considering all possible variable substitutions. This enables more extensive reuse of results, thereby reducing the number of SMT solver invocations and improving the overall efficiency of concolic and symbolic execution. Our evaluation, conducted against the state-of-the-art Utopia solution using two benchmark sets, shows significant improvements, particularly with more complex formulas. Our method achieves up to 74% unsat core reuse, compared to Utopia's 41%, and significant increase in the time savings. These results demonstrate that, despite the additional computational complexity, the broader reuse of unsat results significantly enhances performance, offering valuable advancements for formal verification and program analysis.

### Apt-Serve: Adaptive Request Scheduling on Hybrid Cache for Scalable LLM   Inference Serving
**Authors**: Shihong Gao, Xin Zhang, Yanyan Shen, Lei Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T06:51:23Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) inference serving systems are essential to various LLM-based applications. As demand for LLM services continues to grow, scaling these systems to handle high request rates while meeting latency Service-Level Objectives (SLOs), referred to as effective throughput, becomes critical. However, existing systems often struggle to improve effective throughput, primarily due to a significant decline in Time To First Token (TTFT) SLO attainment. We identify two major causes of this bottleneck: (1) memory-intensive KV cache that limits batch size expansion under GPU memory constraints, and (2) rigid batch composition enforced by the default First-Come-First-Serve scheduling policy. In this paper, we introduce Apt-Serve, a scalable framework designed to enhance effective throughput in LLM inference serving. Apt-Serve features a new hybrid cache scheme that combines KV cache with a memory-efficient hidden cache for reusable input hidden state vectors, allowing large batch sizes and improving request concurrency. Based on the hybrid cache, Apt-Serve employs an adaptive runtime scheduling mechanism that dynamically optimizes batch composition. We formally define the adaptive scheduling optimization problem and propose an efficient algorithm with theoretical guarantees. Extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets and LLMs ranging from 13B to 66B parameters demonstrate that Apt-Serve achieves up to 8.8x improvement in effective throughput compared to the state-of-the-art inference serving systems.

### UniCAIM: A Unified CAM/CIM Architecture with Static-Dynamic KV Cache   Pruning for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Weikai Xu, Wenxuan Zeng, Qianqian Huang, Meng Li, Ru Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T06:13:30Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in various natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, the high memory and computation cost induced by the KV cache limits the inference efficiency, especially for long input sequences. Compute-in-memory (CIM)-based accelerators have been proposed for LLM acceleration with KV cache pruning. However, as existing accelerators only support static pruning with a fixed pattern or dynamic pruning with primitive implementations, they suffer from either high accuracy degradation or low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a ferroelectric FET (FeFET)-based unified content addressable memory (CAM) and CIM architecture, dubbed as UniCAIM. UniCAIM features simultaneous support for static and dynamic pruning with 3 computation modes: 1) in the CAM mode, UniCAIM enables approximate similarity measurement in O(1) time for dynamic KV cache pruning with high energy efficiency; 2) in the charge-domain CIM mode, static pruning can be supported based on accumulative similarity score, which is much more flexible compared to fixed patterns; 3) in the current-domain mode, exact attention computation can be conducted with a subset of selected KV cache. We further propose a novel CAM/CIM cell design that leverages the multi-level characteristics of FeFETs for signed multibit storage of the KV cache and in-place attention computation. With extensive experimental results, we demonstrate UniCAIM can reduce the area-energy-delay product (AEDP) by 8.2-831x over the state-ofthe-art CIM-based LLM accelerators at the circuit level, along with high accuracy comparable with dense attention at the application level, showing its great potential for efficient long-context LLM inference.

### Marconi: Prefix Caching for the Era of Hybrid LLMs
**Authors**: Rui Pan, Zhuang Wang, Zhen Jia, Can Karakus, Luca Zancato, Tri Dao, Yida Wang, Ravi Netravali

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T05:06:29Z

**Summary**: Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention layers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have gained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model serving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of complementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip redundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place state updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for partial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits; the effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which yield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that supports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its novel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential cache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their reuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the compute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse workloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\times$ higher token hit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix caching systems.

### MAGNUS: Generating Data Locality to Accelerate Sparse Matrix-Matrix   Multiplication on CPUs
**Authors**: Jordi Wolfson-Pou, Jan Laukemann, Fabrizio Petrini

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T21:47:31Z

**Summary**: Sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a critical operation in many applications. Current multithreaded implementations are based on Gustavson's algorithm and often perform poorly on large matrices due to limited cache reuse by the accumulators. We present MAGNUS (Matrix Algebra for Gigantic NUmerical Systems), a novel algorithm to maximize data locality in SpGEMM. To generate locality, MAGNUS reorders the intermediate product into discrete cache-friendly chunks using a two-level hierarchical approach. The accumulator is applied to each chunk, where the chunk size is chosen such that the accumulator is cache-efficient. MAGNUS is input- and system-aware: based on the matrix characteristics and target system specifications, the optimal number of chunks is computed by minimizing the storage cost of the necessary data structures. MAGNUS allows for a hybrid accumulation strategy in which each chunk uses a different accumulator based on an input threshold. We consider two accumulators: an AVX-512 vectorized bitonic sorting algorithm and classical dense accumulation. An OpenMP implementation of MAGNUS is compared with several baselines, including Intel MKL, for a variety of different matrices on three Intel architectures. For matrices from the SuiteSparse collection, MAGNUS is faster than all the baselines in most cases and is often an order of magnitude faster than at least one baseline. For massive random matrices, MAGNUS scales to the largest matrix sizes, while the baselines do not. Furthermore, MAGNUS is close to the optimal bound for these matrices, regardless of the matrix size, structure, and density.

### Tensor Product Attention Is All You Need
**Authors**: Yifan Zhang, Yifeng Liu, Huizhuo Yuan, Zhen Qin, Yang Yuan, Quanquan Gu, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T20:51:08Z

**Summary**: Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, significantly shrinking KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components (contextual factorization) and seamlessly integrating with RoPE, TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation of language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 exceeds the performance of standard Transformer baselines including MHA, MQA, GQA, and MLA across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of renowned evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency enables the processing of significantly longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models. The code is available at https://github.com/tensorgi/T6.

### Hogwild! Inference: Parallel LLM Generation via Concurrent Attention
**Authors**: Gleb Rodionov, Roman Garipov, Alina Shutova, George Yakushev, Vage Egiazarian, Anton Sinitsin, Denis Kuznedelev, Dan Alistarh

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T17:56:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through advanced reasoning, long-form content generation, and tool use. Solving these tasks often involves long inference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to expedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks, exploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown that LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation frameworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks may not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their applicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM "workers" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated attention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our approach allows the instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy for the problem at hand, all the while "seeing" each other's partial progress in the concurrent cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a parallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in parallel with the same attention cache, with "instant" access to each other's generated tokens. Hogwild! inference takes advantage of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware utilization. We find that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference with shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning.

### Saliency-driven Dynamic Token Pruning for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yao Tao, Yehui Tang, Yun Wang, Mingjian Zhu, Hailin Hu, Yunhe Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T14:36:19Z

**Summary**: Despite the recent success of large language models (LLMs), LLMs are particularly challenging in long-sequence inference scenarios due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism. Inspired by the interpretability theory of feature attribution in neural network models, we observe that not all tokens have the same contribution. Based on this observation, we propose a novel token pruning framework, namely Saliency-driven Dynamic Token Pruning (SDTP), to gradually and dynamically prune redundant tokens based on the input context. Specifically, a lightweight saliency-driven prediction module is designed to estimate the importance score of each token with its hidden state, which is added to different layers of the LLM to hierarchically prune redundant tokens. Furthermore, a ranking-based optimization strategy is proposed to minimize the ranking divergence of the saliency score and the predicted importance score. Extensive experiments have shown that our framework is generalizable to various models and datasets. By hierarchically pruning 65\% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 33\% $\sim$ 47\% FLOPs and achieves speedup up to 1.75$\times$ during inference, while maintaining comparable performance. We further demonstrate that SDTP can be combined with KV cache compression method for further compression.

### Introducing the Arm-membench Throughput Benchmark
**Authors**: Cyrill Burth, Markus Velten, Robert Schöne

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T12:07:26Z

**Summary**: Application performance of modern day processors is often limited by the memory subsystem rather than actual compute capabilities. Therefore, data throughput specifications play a key role in modeling application performance and determining possible bottlenecks. However, while peak instruction throughputs and bandwidths for local caches are often documented, the achievable throughput can also depend on the relation between memory access and compute instructions. In this paper, we present an Arm version of the well established x86-membench throughput benchmark, which we have adapted to support all current SIMD extensions of the Armv8 instruction set architecture. We describe aspects of the Armv8 ISA that need to be considered in the portable design of this benchmark. We use the benchmark to analyze the memory subsystem at a fine spatial granularity and to unveil microarchitectural details of three processors: Fujitsu A64FX, Ampere Altra and Cavium ThunderX2. Based on the resulting performance information, we show that instruction fetch and decoder widths become a potential bottleneck for cache-bandwidth-sensitive workloads due to the load-store concept of the Arm ISA.

### Optimizing LLM Queries in Relational Data Analytics Workloads
**Authors**: Shu Liu, Asim Biswal, Amog Kamsetty, Audrey Cheng, Luis Gaspar Schroeder, Liana Patel, Shiyi Cao, Xiangxi Mo, Ion Stoica, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Matei Zaharia

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T10:23:39Z

**Summary**: Batch data analytics is a growing application for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs enable users to perform a wide range of natural language tasks, such as classification, entity extraction, and translation, over large datasets. However, LLM inference is highly costly and slow: for example, an NVIDIA L4 GPU running Llama3-8B can only process 6 KB of text per second, taking about a day to handle 15 GB of data; processing a similar amount of data costs around $10K on OpenAI's GPT-4o. In this paper, we propose novel techniques that can significantly reduce the cost of LLM calls for relational data analytics workloads. Our key contribution is developing efficient algorithms for reordering the rows and the fields within each row of an input table to maximize key-value (KV) cache reuse when performing LLM serving. As such, our approach can be easily applied to existing analytics systems and serving platforms. Our evaluation shows that our solution can yield up to 3.4x improvement in job completion time on a benchmark of diverse LLM-based queries using Llama 3 models. Our solution also achieves a 32% cost savings under OpenAI and Anthropic pricing models.

### MemoRAG: Boosting Long Context Processing with Global Memory-Enhanced   Retrieval Augmentation
**Authors**: Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang, Kelong Mao, Defu Lian, Zhicheng Dou, Tiejun Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T09:09:37Z

**Summary**: Processing long contexts presents a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs). While recent advancements allow LLMs to handle much longer contexts than before (e.g., 32K or 128K tokens), it is computationally expensive and can still be insufficient for many applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is considered a promising strategy to address this problem. However, conventional RAG methods face inherent limitations because of two underlying requirements: 1) explicitly stated queries, and 2) well-structured knowledge. These conditions, however, do not hold in general long-context processing tasks.   In this work, we propose MemoRAG, a novel RAG framework empowered by global memory-augmented retrieval. MemoRAG features a dual-system architecture. First, it employs a light but long-range system to create a global memory of the long context. Once a task is presented, it generates draft answers, providing useful clues for the retrieval tools to locate relevant information within the long context. Second, it leverages an expensive but expressive system, which generates the final answer based on the retrieved information. Building upon this fundamental framework, we realize the memory module in the form of KV compression, and reinforce its memorization and cluing capacity from the Generation quality's Feedback (a.k.a. RLGF). In our experiments, MemoRAG achieves superior performances across a variety of long-context evaluation tasks, not only complex scenarios where traditional RAG methods struggle, but also simpler ones where RAG is typically applied.

### Dynamic Content Caching with Waiting Costs via Restless Multi-Armed   Bandits
**Authors**: Ankita Koley, Chandramani Singh

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T07:55:43Z

**Summary**: We consider a system with a local cache connected to a backend server and an end user population. A set of contents are stored at the the server where they continuously get updated. The local cache keeps copies, potentially stale, of a subset of the contents. The users make content requests to the local cache which either can serve the local version if available or can fetch a fresh version or can wait for additional requests before fetching and serving a fresh version. Serving a stale version of a content incurs an age-of-version(AoV) dependent ageing cost, fetching it from the server incurs a fetching cost, and making a request wait incurs a per unit time waiting cost. We focus on the optimal actions subject to the cache capacity constraint at each decision epoch, aiming at minimizing the long term average cost. We pose the problem as a Restless Multi-armed Bandit(RMAB) Problem and propose a Whittle index based policy which is known to be asymptotically optimal. We explicitly characterize the Whittle indices. We numerically evaluate the proposed policy and also compare it to a greedy policy. We show that it is close to the optimal policy and substantially outperforms the exising policies.

### GastCoCo: Graph Storage and Coroutine-Based Prefetch Co-Design for   Dynamic Graph Processing
**Authors**: Hongfu Li, Qian Tao, Song Yu, Shufeng Gong, Yanfeng Zhang, Feng Yao, Wenyuan Yu, Ge Yu, Jingren Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T03:49:16Z

**Summary**: An efficient data structure is fundamental to meeting the growing demands in dynamic graph processing. However, the dual requirements for graph computation efficiency (with contiguous structures) and graph update efficiency (with linked list-like structures) present a conflict in the design principles of graph structures. After experimental studies of existing state-of-the-art dynamic graph structures, we observe that the overhead of cache misses accounts for a major portion of the graph computation time. This paper presents GastCoCo, a system with graph storage and coroutine-based prefetch co-design. By employing software prefetching via stackless coroutines and introducing a prefetch-friendly data structure CBList, GastCoCo significantly alleviates the performance degradation caused by cache misses. Our results show that GastCoCo outperforms state-of-the-art graph storage systems by 1.3x - 180x in graph updates and 1.4x - 41.1x in graph computation.

### SPIRe: Boosting LLM Inference Throughput with Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Sanjit Neelam, Daniel Heinlein, Vaclav Cvicek, Akshay Mishra, Reiner Pope

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T20:39:20Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding (SD) has been shown to reduce the latency of autoregressive decoding (AD) by 2-3x for small batch sizes. However, increasing throughput and therefore reducing the cost per token requires decoding with large batch sizes. Recent work shows that SD can accelerate decoding with large batch sizes too if the context is sufficiently long and the draft model's KV cache is sparse. We introduce SPIRe, a draft model that combines static sparse attention, pruned initialization, and feedback memory to increase the modeled throughput of speculative decoding by over 100% compared to speculation with a much smaller draft model and by over 35% compared to the strong baseline of sparse self-speculation. Our approach is particularly effective when context lengths vary significantly across requests.

### Unifying Autoregressive and Diffusion-Based Sequence Generation
**Authors**: Nima Fathi, Torsten Scholak, Pierre-André Noël

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T20:32:10Z

**Summary**: We present significant extensions to diffusion-based sequence generation models, blurring the line with autoregressive language models. We introduce hyperschedules, which assign distinct noise schedules to individual token positions, generalizing both autoregressive models (e.g., GPT) and conventional diffusion models (e.g., SEDD, MDLM) as special cases. Second, we propose two hybrid token-wise noising processes that interpolate between absorbing and uniform processes, enabling the model to fix past mistakes, and we introduce a novel inference algorithm that leverages this new feature in a simplified context inspired from MDLM. To support efficient training and inference, we design attention masks compatible with KV-caching. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art perplexity and generate diverse, high-quality sequences across standard benchmarks, suggesting a promising path for autoregressive diffusion-based sequence generation.

### Walking on Spheres and Talking to Neighbors: Variance Reduction for   Laplace's Equation
**Authors**: Michael Czekanski, Benjamin Faber, Margaret Fairborn, Adelle Wright, David Bindel

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T19:26:41Z

**Summary**: Walk on Spheres algorithms leverage properties of Brownian Motion to create Monte Carlo estimates of solutions to a class of elliptic partial differential equations. We propose a new caching strategy which leverages the continuity of paths of Brownian Motion. In the case of Laplace's equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, our algorithm has improved asymptotic runtime compared to previous approaches. Until recently, estimates were constructed pointwise and did not use the relationship between solutions at nearby points within a domain. Instead, our results are achieved by passing information from a cache of fixed size. We also provide bounds on the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its performance on example problems of increasing complexity.

### GPU-accelerated Evolutionary Many-objective Optimization Using   Tensorized NSGA-III
**Authors**: Hao Li, Zhenyu Liang, Ran Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T14:09:23Z

**Summary**: NSGA-III is one of the most widely adopted algorithms for tackling many-objective optimization problems. However, its CPU-based design severely limits scalability and computational efficiency. To address the limitations, we propose {TensorNSGA-III}, a fully tensorized implementation of NSGA-III that leverages GPU parallelism for large-scale many-objective optimization. Unlike conventional GPU-accelerated evolutionary algorithms that rely on heuristic approximations to improve efficiency, TensorNSGA-III maintains the exact selection and variation mechanisms of NSGA-III while achieving significant acceleration. By reformulating the selection process with tensorized data structures and an optimized caching strategy, our approach effectively eliminates computational bottlenecks inherent in traditional CPU-based and na\"ive GPU implementations. Experimental results on widely used numerical benchmarks show that TensorNSGA-III achieves speedups of up to $3629\times$ over the CPU version of NSGA-III. Additionally, we validate its effectiveness in multiobjective robotic control tasks, where it discovers diverse and high-quality behavioral solutions. Furthermore, we investigate the critical role of large population sizes in many-objective optimization and demonstrate the scalability of TensorNSGA-III in such scenarios.

### Unifying KV Cache Compression for Large Language Models with LeanKV
**Authors**: Yanqi Zhang, Yuwei Hu, Runyuan Zhao, John C. S. Lui, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T14:05:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance but incur significant serving costs due to their substantial memory requirements, with the key-value (KV) cache being a primary bottleneck. Existing KV cache compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, apply uniform treatment to both keys and values, and discard unimportant tokens entirely, overlooking the fine-grained differences in significance of various components within the KV cache. To address these limitations, we introduce LeanKV, a framework that advances KV cache compression by exploiting three levels of differentiation in the KV cache: (1) the differing impact of keys and values on attention computation, (2) the varying importance of tokens, and (3) the diverse dynamic sparsity patterns across attention heads. At the core of LeanKV is an on-GPU memory manager that compacts fragmented free memory list into contiguous regions in parallel, effectively translating sparsity in the KV cache into performance gains. We evaluate LeanKV on several mainstream models, including the recent "thinking model". LeanKV is able to compress the KV cache by $2.7\times$ to $5.7\times$ with near-lossless accuracy on complex workloads requiring sophisticated reasoning and long-generation capabilities, and enhances throughput by $1.9\times$ to $5.4\times$.

### Graph Federated Learning Based Proactive Content Caching in Edge   Computing
**Authors**: Rui Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T12:46:45Z

**Summary**: With the rapid growth of mobile data traffic and the increasing prevalence of video streaming, proactive content caching in edge computing has become crucial for reducing latency and alleviating network congestion. However, traditional caching strategies such as FIFO, LRU, and LFU fail to effectively predict future content popularity, while existing proactive caching approaches often require users to upload data to a central server, raising concerns regarding privacy and scalability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Graph Federated Learning-based Proactive Content Caching (GFPCC) scheme that enhances caching efficiency while preserving user privacy. The proposed approach integrates federated learning and graph neural networks, enabling users to locally train Light Graph Convolutional Networks (LightGCN) to capture user-item relationships and predict content popularity. Instead of sharing raw data, only the trained model parameters are transmitted to the central server, where a federated averaging algorithm aggregates updates, refines the global model, and selects the most popular files for proactive caching. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets, such as MovieLens, demonstrate that GFPCC outperforms baseline caching algorithms by achieving higher cache efficiency through more accurate content popularity predictions. Moreover, the federated learning framework strengthens privacy protection while maintaining efficient model training; however, scalability remains a challenge in large-scale networks with dynamic user preferences.

### HybriMoE: Hybrid CPU-GPU Scheduling and Cache Management for Efficient   MoE Inference
**Authors**: Shuzhang Zhong, Yanfan Sun, Ling Liang, Runsheng Wang, Ru Huang, Meng Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T10:47:37Z

**Summary**: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has demonstrated significant advantages as it enables to increase the model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. However, the large MoE model size still introduces substantial memory demands, which usually requires expert offloading on resource-constrained platforms and incurs significant overhead. Hybrid CPU-GPU inference has been proposed to leverage CPU computation to reduce expert loading overhead but faces major challenges: on one hand, the expert activation patterns of MoE models are highly unstable, rendering the fixed mapping strategies in existing works inefficient; on the other hand, the hybrid CPU-GPU schedule for MoE is inherently complex due to the diverse expert sizes, structures, uneven workload distribution, etc. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose HybriMoE, a hybrid CPU-GPU inference framework that improves resource utilization through a novel CPU-GPU scheduling and cache management system. HybriMoE introduces (i) a dynamic intra-layer scheduling strategy to balance workloads across CPU and GPU, (ii) an impact-driven inter-layer prefetching algorithm, and (iii) a score-based caching algorithm to mitigate expert activation instability. We implement HybriMoE on top of the kTransformers framework and evaluate it on three widely used MoE-based LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that HybriMoE achieves an average speedup of 1.33$\times$ in the prefill stage and 1.70$\times$ in the decode stage compared to state-of-the-art hybrid MoE inference framework. Our code is available at: https://github.com/PKU-SEC-Lab/HybriMoE.

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit pronounced memory-bound characteristics during inference due to High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) bandwidth constraints. In this paper, we propose an L2 Cache-oriented asynchronous KV Cache prefetching method to break through the memory bandwidth bottleneck in LLM inference through computation-load overlap. By strategically scheduling idle memory bandwidth during active computation windows, our method proactively prefetches required KV Cache into GPU L2 cache, enabling high-speed L2 cache hits for subsequent accesses and effectively hiding HBM access latency within computational cycles. Extensive experiments on NVIDIA H20 GPUs demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 2.15x improvement in attention kernel efficiency and up to 1.97x end-to-end throughput enhancement, surpassing state-of-the-art baseline FlashAttention-3. Notably, our solution maintains orthogonality to existing optimization techniques and can be integrated with current inference frameworks, providing a scalable latency-hiding solution for next-generation LLM inference engines.

### Low-Complexity AoI-Optimal Status Update Control with Partial Battery   State Information in Energy Harvesting IoT Networks
**Authors**: Hao Wu, Shengtian Yang, Jun Chen, Chao Chen, Anding Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T08:40:36Z

**Summary**: For a two-hop IoT system consisting of multiple energy harvesting sensors, a cache-enabled edge node, and multiple monitors, the status update control at the edge node, which has partial battery state information (pBSI) of the sensors, is formulated as a pBSI problem. The concept of inferred pBSI is introduced to reduce the noiseless single-sensor pBSI problem to a Markov decision process with a moderate state-space size, enabling the optimal policy to be obtained through a value iteration algorithm. A lower bound on the expected time-average on-demand age of information performance is established for the general single-sensor status update problem. For the single-sensor pBSI problem, a semi-closed-form policy called the current-next (CN) policy is proposed, along with an efficient post-update value iteration algorithm with a per-iteration time complexity proportional to the square of the battery capacity. A weighted-update-gain-competition (WUGC) approach is further leveraged to extend the CN policy to the multi-sensor case. Numerical results in the single-sensor case demonstrate the near-optimal performance of the CN policy across various energy arrival processes. Simulations for an IoT system with $100$ sensors reveal that the WUGC-CN policy outperforms the maximum-age-first policy and the random-scheduling-based CN policy under Bernoulli energy arrival processes.

### CVA6-VMRT: A Modular Approach Towards Time-Predictable Virtual Memory in   a 64-bit Application Class RISC-V Processor
**Authors**: Christopher Reinwardt, Robert Balas, Alessandro Ottaviano, Angelo Garofalo, Luca Benini

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T06:38:27Z

**Summary**: The increasing complexity of autonomous systems has driven a shift to integrated heterogeneous SoCs with real-time and safety demands. Ensuring deterministic WCETs and low-latency for critical tasks requires minimizing interference on shared resources like virtual memory. Existing techniques, such as software coloring and memory replication, introduce significant area and performance overhead, especially with virtualized memory where address translation adds latency uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose CVA6-VMRT, an extension of the open-source RISC-V CVA6 core, adding hardware support for predictability in virtual memory access with minimal area overhead. CVA6-VMRT features dynamically partitioned Translation Look-aside Buffers (TLBs) and hybrid L1 cache/scratchpad memory (SPM) functionality. It allows fine-grained per-thread control of resources, enabling the operating system to manage TLB replacements, including static overwrites, to ensure single-cycle address translation for critical memory regions. Additionally, CVA6-VMRT enables runtime partitioning of data and instruction caches into cache and SPM sections, providing low and predictable access times for critical data without impacting other accesses. In a virtualized setting, CVA6-VMRT enhances execution time determinism for critical guests by 94% during interference from non-critical guests, with minimal impact on their average absolute execution time compared to isolated execution of the critical guests only. This interference-aware behaviour is achieved with just a 4% area overhead and no timing penalty compared to the baseline CVA6 core.

### SR-LIO++: Efficient LiDAR-Inertial Odometry and Quantized Mapping with   Sweep Reconstruction
**Authors**: Zikang Yuan, Ruiye Ming, Chengwei Zhao, Yonghao Tan, Pingcheng Dong, Hongcheng Luo, Yuzhong Jiao, Xin Yang, Kwang-Ting Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T05:27:15Z

**Summary**: Addressing the inherent low acquisition frequency limitation of 3D LiDAR to achieve high-frequency output has become a critical research focus in the LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) domain. To ensure real-time performance, frequency-enhanced LIO systems must process each sweep within significantly reduced timeframe, which presents substantial challenges for deployment on low-computational-power platforms. To address these limitations, we introduce SR-LIO++, an innovative LIO system capable of achieving doubled output frequency relative to input frequency on resource-constrained hardware platforms, including the Raspberry Pi 4B. Our system employs a sweep reconstruction methodology to enhance LiDAR sweep frequency, generating high-frequency reconstructed sweeps. Building upon this foundation, we propose a caching mechanism for intermediate results (i.e., surface parameters) of the most recent segments, effectively minimizing redundant processing of common segments in adjacent reconstructed sweeps. This method decouples processing time from the traditionally linear dependence on reconstructed sweep frequency. Furthermore, we present a quantized map point management based on index table mapping, significantly reducing memory usage by converting global 3D point storage from 64-bit double precision to 8-bit char representation. This method also converts the computationally intensive Euclidean distance calculations in nearest neighbor searches from 64-bit double precision to 16-bit short and 32-bit integer formats, significantly reducing both memory and computational cost. Extensive experimental evaluations across three distinct computing platforms and four public datasets demonstrate that SR-LIO++ maintains state-of-the-art accuracy while substantially enhancing efficiency. Notably, our system successfully achieves 20Hz state output on Raspberry Pi 4B hardware.

### MILLION: Mastering Long-Context LLM Inference Via Outlier-Immunized KV   Product Quantization
**Authors**: Zongwu Wang, Peng Xu, Fangxin Liu, Yiwei Hu, Qingxiao Sun, Gezi Li, Cheng Li, Xuan Wang, Li Jiang, Haibing Guan

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T04:34:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized for complex tasks requiring longer context lengths, with some models supporting up to 128K or 1M tokens. This trend, however, presents significant challenges in inference speed and memory management. Quantization emerges as a promising approach to address the widening gap between LLM size and memory capacity. However, traditional quantization schemes often yield suboptimal compression results for KV caches due to two key factors: i) On-the-fly quantization and de-quantization, causing significant performance overhead; ii) Prevalence of outliers in KV values, challenging low-bitwidth uniform quantization. To this end, we propose MILLION, a novel quantization framework achieving low-bitwidth KV cache through product quantization. First, we conduct a thorough analysis of KV cache distribution, revealing the limitations of existing quantization schemes. Second, we introduce a non-uniform quantization algorithm based on product quantization, which efficiently compresses data while preserving accuracy. Third, we develop a high-performance GPU inference framework with efficient attention kernel and pipeline design for MILLION that leverages sparse computation and asynchronous quantization, significantly enhancing inference speed. Comprehensive evaluation results demonstrate that MILLION can achieve 4 bits quantization with trivial perplexity and accuracy loss, and achieve 2.09x end-to-end performance gains at 32K context length. Code is released at https://github.com/ZongwuWang/MILLION.

### Lattice: Learning to Efficiently Compress the Memory
**Authors**: Mahdi Karami, Vahab Mirrokni

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T03:48:43Z

**Summary**: Attention mechanisms have revolutionized sequence learning but suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This paper introduces Lattice, a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) mechanism that leverages the inherent low-rank structure of K-V matrices to efficiently compress the cache into a fixed number of memory slots, achieving sub-quadratic complexity. We formulate this compression as an online optimization problem and derive a dynamic memory update rule based on a single gradient descent step. The resulting recurrence features a state- and input-dependent gating mechanism, offering an interpretable memory update process. The core innovation is the orthogonal update: each memory slot is updated exclusively with information orthogonal to its current state hence incorporation of only novel, non-redundant data, which minimizes the interference with previously stored information. The experimental results show that Lattice achieves the best perplexity compared to all baselines across diverse context lengths, with performance improvement becoming more pronounced as the context length increases.

### ARCANE: Adaptive RISC-V Cache Architecture for Near-memory Extensions
**Authors**: Vincenzo Petrolo, Flavia Guella, Michele Caon, Pasquale Davide Schiavone, Guido Masera, Maurizio Martina

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T22:48:33Z

**Summary**: Modern data-driven applications expose limitations of von Neumann architectures - extensive data movement, low throughput, and poor energy efficiency. Accelerators improve performance but lack flexibility and require data transfers. Existing compute in- and near-memory solutions mitigate these issues but face usability challenges due to data placement constraints. We propose a novel cache architecture that doubles as a tightly-coupled compute-near-memory coprocessor. Our RISC-V cache controller executes custom instructions from the host CPU using vector operations dispatched to near-memory vector processing units within the cache memory subsystem. This architecture abstracts memory synchronization and data mapping from application software while offering software-based Instruction Set Architecture extensibility. Our implementation shows $30\times$ to $84\times$ performance improvement when operating on 8-bit data over the same system with a traditional cache when executing a worst-case 32-bit CNN workload, with only $41.3\%$ area overhead.

### LLM meets ML: Data-efficient Anomaly Detection on Unseen Unstable Logs
**Authors**: Fatemeh Hadadi, Qinghua Xu, Domenico Bianculli, Lionel Briand

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T20:52:04Z

**Summary**: Most log-based anomaly detectors assume logs are stable, though logs are often unstable due to software or environmental changes. Anomaly detection on unstable logs (ULAD) is therefore a more realistic, yet under-investigated challenge. Current approaches predominantly employ machine learning (ML) models, which often require extensive labeled data for training. To mitigate data insufficiency, we propose FlexLog, a novel hybrid approach for ULAD that combines ML models -- decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and a feedforward neural network -- with a Large Language Model (Mistral) through ensemble learning. FlexLog also incorporates a cache and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further enhance efficiency and effectiveness. To evaluate FlexLog, we configured four datasets for ULAD, namely ADFA-U, LOGEVOL-U, SynHDFS-U, and SYNEVOL-U. FlexLog outperforms all baselines by at least 1.2 percentage points in F1 score while using 62.87 percentage points less labeled data. When trained on the same amount of data as the baselines, FlexLog achieves up to a 13 percentage points increase in F1 score on ADFA-U across varying training dataset sizes. Additionally, FlexLog maintains inference time under one second per log sequence, making it suitable for most applications except latency-sensitive systems. Further analysis reveals the positive impact of FlexLog's key components: cache, RAG and ensemble learning.

### State Tuning: State-based Test-Time Scaling on RWKV-7
**Authors**: Liu Xiao, Li Zhiyuan, Lin Yueyu

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:04:30Z

**Summary**: Test-time scaling has emerged as a prominent research direction in machine learning, enabling models to enhance their expressive capabilities during inference.Transformers, renowned for striking a delicate balance between efficiency and expressiveness, have benefited from test-time scaling techniques that leverage an expanding key-value (KV) cache to significantly improve performance.In this paper, we introduce a novel state-based approach to test-time scaling, which we term state tuning, tailored to the RNN-based RWKV-7 model.By exploiting the unique strengths of RWKV-7, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the target task without altering the model's pre-trained weights. Our approach centers on three key innovations. First, we develop an observer framework that allows a smaller model to replicate and learn the state dynamics of the RWKV-7 model. Second, we employ a kernel method to dynamically upscale the state size, enhancing the model's capacity to capture intricate patterns. Third, we integrate Decorrelated Backpropagation (DBP) to optimize the upscaled state matrix, thereby improving convergence and expressivity. By tuning only the state matrix, we demonstrate that a smaller model can outperform larger models on the given task. This method preserves the efficiency of the original RWKV-7 architecture while harnessing the power of test-time scaling to deliver superior results. Our findings underscore the potential of state tuning as an effective strategy for advancing model performance in resource-constrained settings.

### Quantization Hurts Reasoning? An Empirical Study on Quantized Reasoning   Models
**Authors**: Ruikang Liu, Yuxuan Sun, Manyi Zhang, Haoli Bai, Xianzhi Yu, Tiezheng Yu, Chun Yuan, Lu Hou

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T08:22:45Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex tasks, but their extended chain-of-thought reasoning process increases inference overhead. While quantization has been widely adopted to reduce the inference cost of large language models, its impact on reasoning models remains understudied. In this study, we conduct the first systematic study on quantized reasoning models, evaluating the open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Distilled Qwen and LLaMA families ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters, and QwQ-32B. Our investigation covers weight, KV cache, and activation quantization using state-of-the-art algorithms at varying bit-widths, with extensive evaluation across mathematical (AIME, MATH-500), scientific (GPQA), and programming (LiveCodeBench) reasoning benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while lossless quantization can be achieved with W8A8 or W4A16 quantization, lower bit-widths introduce significant accuracy risks. We further identify model size, model origin, and task difficulty as critical determinants of performance. Contrary to expectations, quantized models do not exhibit increased output lengths. In addition, strategically scaling the model sizes or reasoning steps can effectively enhance the performance. All quantized models and codes will be open-sourced in https://github.com/ruikangliu/Quantized-Reasoning-Models.

### Semantic Parsing with Candidate Expressions for Knowledge Base Question   Answering
**Authors**: Daehwan Nam, Gary Geunbae Lee

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T06:27:48Z

**Summary**: Semantic parsers convert natural language to logical forms, which can be evaluated on knowledge bases (KBs) to produce denotations. Recent semantic parsers have been developed with sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) pre-trained language models (PLMs) or large language models, where the models treat logical forms as sequences of tokens. For syntactic and semantic validity, the semantic parsers use grammars that enable constrained decoding. However, the grammars lack the ability to utilize large information of KBs, although logical forms contain representations of KB elements, such as entities or relations. In this work, we propose a grammar augmented with candidate expressions for semantic parsing on a large KB with a seq2seq PLM. The grammar defines actions as production rules, and our semantic parser predicts actions during inference under the constraints by types and candidate expressions. We apply the grammar to knowledge base question answering, where the constraints by candidate expressions assist a semantic parser to generate valid KB elements. We also introduce two special rules, sub-type inference and union types, and a mask caching algorithm. In particular, sub-type inference and the mask caching algorithm greatly increase the decoding speed of our semantic parser. We experimented on two benchmarks, KQA Pro and Overnight, where the constraints by candidate expressions increased the accuracy of our semantic parser, whether it was trained with strong supervision or weak supervision. In addition, our semantic parser had a fast decoding speed in the experiments.

### LagKV: Lag-Relative Information of the KV Cache Tells Which Tokens Are   Important
**Authors**: Manlai Liang, JiaMing Zhang, Xiong Li, Jinlong Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T03:22:15Z

**Summary**: The increasing size of the Key-Value (KV) cache during the Large Language Models long-context inference is the main obstacle for its balance between the deployment cost and task accuracy. To reduce the KV cache size in such scenarios, most previous efforts leveraged on the attention weight to evict non-critical cache tokens. But there is a trade-off in those methods, they usually require major modifiation of the inference infrastructure and significant computation overhead. Base on the fact that the Large Lanuage models are autoregresssive models, we propose {\it LagKV}, a KV allocation strategy only relying on straight forward comparison among KV themself. It is a totally attention free method which offers easy integration to the main stream inference platform and comparable performance comparing to other complicated KV compression methods. Results on LongBench and PasskeyRetrieval show that, our approach achieves nearly zero loss when the ratio is $2\times$ and $\approx 90\%$ of the original model performance for $8\times$. Especially in the 64-digit passkey retrieval task, our mehod outperforms the attention weight based method $H_2O$ over $60\%$ with same compression ratios. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/AI-Lab-China-Merchants-Bank/LagKV}.

### FastVAR: Linear Visual Autoregressive Modeling via Cached Token Pruning
**Authors**: Hang Guo, Yawei Li, Taolin Zhang, Jiangshan Wang, Tao Dai, Shu-Tao Xia, Luca Benini

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T01:35:39Z

**Summary**: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling has gained popularity for its shift towards next-scale prediction. However, existing VAR paradigms process the entire token map at each scale step, leading to the complexity and runtime scaling dramatically with image resolution. To address this challenge, we propose FastVAR, a post-training acceleration method for efficient resolution scaling with VARs. Our key finding is that the majority of latency arises from the large-scale step where most tokens have already converged. Leveraging this observation, we develop the cached token pruning strategy that only forwards pivotal tokens for scale-specific modeling while using cached tokens from previous scale steps to restore the pruned slots. This significantly reduces the number of forwarded tokens and improves the efficiency at larger resolutions. Experiments show the proposed FastVAR can further speedup FlashAttention-accelerated VAR by 2.7$\times$ with negligible performance drop of <1%. We further extend FastVAR to zero-shot generation of higher resolution images. In particular, FastVAR can generate one 2K image with 15GB memory footprints in 1.5s on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code is available at https://github.com/csguoh/FastVAR.

### ZSMerge: Zero-Shot KV Cache Compression for Memory-Efficient   Long-Context LLMs
**Authors**: Xin Liu, Pei Liu, Guoming Tang

**Updated**: 2025-04-06T12:20:25Z

**Summary**: The linear growth of key-value (KV) cache memory and quadratic computational in attention mechanisms complexity pose significant bottlenecks for large language models (LLMs) in long-context processing. While existing KV cache optimization methods address these challenges through token pruning or feature merging, they often incur irreversible information loss or require costly parameter retraining. To this end, we propose ZSMerge, a dynamic KV cache compression framework designed for efficient cache management, featuring three key operations: (1) fine-grained memory allocation guided by multi-dimensional token importance metrics at head-level granularity, (2) a residual merging mechanism that preserves critical context through compensated attention scoring, and (3) a zero-shot adaptation mechanism compatible with diverse LLM architectures without requiring retraining. ZSMerge significantly enhances memory efficiency and inference speed with negligible performance degradation across LLMs. When applied to LLaMA2-7B, it demonstrates a 20:1 compression ratio for key-value cache retention (reducing memory footprint to 5\% of baseline) while sustaining comparable generation quality, coupled with triple throughput gains at extreme 54k-token contexts that eliminate out-of-memory failures. The code is available at https://github.com/SusCom-Lab/ZSMerge.

### Learning Cache Coherence Traffic for NoC Routing Design
**Authors**: Guochu Xiong, Xiangzhong Luo, Weichen Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-05T00:59:52Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of multi-core systems highlights the need for efficient Network-on-Chip (NoC) design to ensure seamless communication. Cache coherence, essential for data consistency, substantially reduces task computation time by enabling data sharing among caches. As a result, routing serves two roles: facilitating data sharing (influenced by topology) and managing NoC-level communication. However, cache coherence is often overlooked in routing, causing mismatches between design expectations and evaluation outcomes. Two main challenges are the lack of specialized tools to assess cache coherence's impact and the neglect of topology selection in routing. In this work, we propose a cache coherence-aware routing approach with integrated topology selection, guided by our Cache Coherence Traffic Analyzer (CCTA). Our method achieves up to 10.52% lower packet latency, 55.51% faster execution time, and 49.02% total energy savings, underscoring the critical role of cache coherence in NoC design and enabling effective co-design.

**Authors**: Huda Ibeid, Vikram Narayana, Jeongnim Kim, Anthony Nguyen, Vitali Morozov, Ye Luo

**Updated**: 2025-04-04T17:56:44Z

**Summary**: The Aurora supercomputer is an exascale-class system designed to tackle some of the most demanding computational workloads. Equipped with both High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and DDR memory, it provides unique trade-offs in performance, latency, and capacity. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the memory systems on the Aurora supercomputer, with a focus on evaluating the trade-offs between HBM and DDR memory systems. We explore how different memory configurations, including memory modes (Flat and Cache) and clustering modes (Quad and SNC4), influence key system performance metrics such as memory bandwidth, latency, CPU-GPU PCIe bandwidth, and MPI communication bandwidth. Additionally, we examine the performance of three representative HPC applications -- HACC, QMCPACK, and BFS -- each illustrating the impact of memory configurations on performance. By using microbenchmarks and application-level analysis, we provide insights into how to select the optimal memory system and configuration to maximize performance based on the application characteristics. The findings presented in this paper offer guidance for users of the Aurora system and similar exascale systems.

### Adaptive Semantic Prompt Caching with VectorQ
**Authors**: Luis Gaspar Schroeder, Shu Liu, Alejandro Cuadron, Mark Zhao, Stephan Krusche, Alfons Kemper, Matei Zaharia, Joseph E. Gonzalez

**Updated**: 2025-04-04T16:51:15Z

**Summary**: Semantic prompt caches reduce the latency and cost of large language model (LLM) inference by reusing cached LLM-generated responses for semantically similar prompts. Vector similarity metrics assign a numerical score to quantify the similarity between an embedded prompt and its nearest neighbor in the cache. Existing systems rely on a static threshold to classify whether the similarity score is sufficiently high to result in a cache hit. We show that this one-size-fits-all threshold is insufficient across different embeddings. We propose VectorQ, an online framework with a threshold convergence guarantee to learn embedding-specific threshold regions that adapt to the uncertainty of an embedding. Through evaluations on a combination of three diverse datasets, we show that VectorQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems across all static thresholds, achieving up to 26x increases in cache hit rate and error rate reductions up to 74%.

### Performance Modeling of Data Storage Systems using Generative Models
**Authors**: Abdalaziz Rashid Al-Maeeni, Aziz Temirkhanov, Artem Ryzhikov, Mikhail Hushchyn

**Updated**: 2025-04-04T15:30:20Z

**Summary**: High-precision modeling of systems is one of the main areas of industrial data analysis. Models of systems, their digital twins, are used to predict their behavior under various conditions. We have developed several models of a storage system using machine learning-based generative models. The system consists of several components: hard disk drive (HDD) and solid-state drive (SSD) storage pools with different RAID schemes and cache. Each storage component is represented by a probabilistic model that describes the probability distribution of the component performance in terms of IOPS and latency, depending on their configuration and external data load parameters. The results of the experiments demonstrate the errors of 4-10 % for IOPS and 3-16 % for latency predictions depending on the components and models of the system. The predictions show up to 0.99 Pearson correlation with Little's law, which can be used for unsupervised reliability checks of the models. In addition, we present novel data sets that can be used for benchmarking regression algorithms, conditional generative models, and uncertainty estimation methods in machine learning.

### Optimistic Learning for Communication Networks
**Authors**: George Iosifidis, Naram Mhaisen, Douglas J. Leith

**Updated**: 2025-04-04T14:55:27Z

**Summary**: AI/ML-based tools are at the forefront of resource management solutions for communication networks. Deep learning, in particular, is highly effective in facilitating fast and high-performing decision-making whenever representative training data is available to build offline accurate models. Conversely, online learning solutions do not require training and enable adaptive decisions based on runtime observations, alas are often overly conservative. This extensive tutorial proposes the use of optimistic learning (OpL) as a decision engine for resource management frameworks in modern communication systems. When properly designed, such solutions can achieve fast and high-performing decisions -- comparable to offline-trained models -- while preserving the robustness and performance guarantees of the respective online learning approaches. We introduce the fundamental concepts, algorithms and results of OpL, discuss the roots of this theory and present different approaches to defining and achieving optimism. We proceed to showcase how OpL can enhance resource management in communication networks for several key problems such as caching, edge computing, network slicing, and workload assignment in decentralized O-RAN platforms. Finally, we discuss the open challenges that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of this new resource management approach.

### EVOS: Efficient Implicit Neural Training via EVOlutionary Selector
**Authors**: Weixiang Zhang, Shuzhao Xie, Chengwei Ren, Siyi Xie, Chen Tang, Shijia Ge, Mingzi Wang, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-04T13:27:49Z

**Summary**: We propose EVOlutionary Selector (EVOS), an efficient training paradigm for accelerating Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Unlike conventional INR training that feeds all samples through the neural network in each iteration, our approach restricts training to strategically selected points, reducing computational overhead by eliminating redundant forward passes. Specifically, we treat each sample as an individual in an evolutionary process, where only those fittest ones survive and merit inclusion in training, adaptively evolving with the neural network dynamics. While this is conceptually similar to Evolutionary Algorithms, their distinct objectives (selection for acceleration vs. iterative solution optimization) require a fundamental redefinition of evolutionary mechanisms for our context. In response, we design sparse fitness evaluation, frequency-guided crossover, and augmented unbiased mutation to comprise EVOS. These components respectively guide sample selection with reduced computational cost, enhance performance through frequency-domain balance, and mitigate selection bias from cached evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves approximately 48%-66% reduction in training time while ensuring superior convergence without additional cost, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.

**Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video generation. However, the computational intensity remains a significant challenge for practical applications. While feature caching has been proposed to reduce the computational burden of diffusion models, existing methods typically overlook the heterogeneous significance of individual blocks, resulting in suboptimal reuse and degraded output quality. To this end, we address this gap by introducing ProfilingDiT, a novel adaptive caching strategy that explicitly disentangles foreground and background-focused blocks. Through a systematic analysis of attention distributions in diffusion models, we reveal a key observation: 1) Most layers exhibit a consistent preference for either foreground or background regions. 2) Predicted noise shows low inter-step similarity initially, which stabilizes as denoising progresses. This finding inspires us to formulate a selective caching strategy that preserves full computation for dynamic foreground elements while efficiently caching static background features. Our approach substantially reduces computational overhead while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant acceleration (e.g., 2.01 times speedup for Wan2.1) while maintaining visual fidelity across comprehensive quality metrics, establishing a viable method for efficient video generation.

### CacheBlend: Fast Large Language Model Serving for RAG with Cached   Knowledge Fusion
**Authors**: Jiayi Yao, Hanchen Li, Yuhan Liu, Siddhant Ray, Yihua Cheng, Qizheng Zhang, Kuntai Du, Shan Lu, Junchen Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T22:49:22Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often incorporate multiple text chunks in their inputs to provide the necessary contexts. To speed up the prefill of the long LLM inputs, one can pre-compute the KV cache of a text and re-use the KV cache when the context is reused as the prefix of another LLM input. However, the reused text chunks are not always the input prefix, which makes precomputed KV caches not directly usable since they ignore the text's cross-attention with the preceding texts. Thus, the benefits of reusing KV caches remain largely unrealized.   This paper tackles just one challenge: when an LLM input contains multiple text chunks, how to quickly combine their precomputed KV caches in order to achieve the same generation quality as the expensive full prefill (i.e., without reusing KV cache)? This challenge naturally arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where the input is supplemented with multiple retrieved texts as the context. We present CacheBlend, a scheme that reuses the precomputed KV caches, regardless prefix or not, and selectively recomputes the KV values of a small subset of tokens to partially update each reused KV cache. In the meantime, the small extra delay for recomputing some tokens can be pipelined with the retrieval of KV caches within the same job, allowing CacheBlend to store KV caches in slower devices with more storage capacity while retrieving them without increasing the inference delay. By comparing CacheBlend with the state-of-the-art KV cache reusing schemes on three open-source LLMs of various sizes and four popular benchmark datasets of different tasks, we show that CacheBlend reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 2.2-3.3x and increases the inference throughput by 2.8-5x from full KV recompute without compromising generation quality. The code is available at https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

### LLM Library Learning Fails: A LEGO-Prover Case Study
**Authors**: Ian Berlot-Attwell, Frank Rudzicz, Xujie Si

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T21:53:51Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in the coding, reasoning, and tool-using abilities of LLMs have spurred interest in library learning (i.e., online learning through the creation, storage, and retrieval of reusable and composable functions, knowledge, checklists, or lemmas). Such systems often promise improved task performance through the automatic creation of broadly applicable tools, as well as superior computational performance through the caching of reasoning (i.e., the storage of generated tools). However, we find strong reason to be skeptical. We perform a deep dive into one such system, LEGO-Prover, which purports to learn reusable lemmas for mathematical reasoning. We find no evidence of the direct reuse of learned lemmas, and find evidence against the soft reuse of learned lemmas (i.e., reuse by modifying relevant examples). Crucially, we find that LEGO-Prover does not in fact improve over the simple baseline of prompting the model - the improvements in task accuracy vanish once computational cost is accounted for. Our findings suggest that serious misconceptions exist as to the effectiveness of these techniques, that a serious re-examination of the state of LLM-based library learning is required, and that we require much stronger standards for evaluation including behavioural analysis and ensuring that an equal computational budget is used for baselines.

### Localized Definitions and Distributed Reasoning: A Proof-of-Concept   Mechanistic Interpretability Study via Activation Patching
**Authors**: Nooshin Bahador

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T18:54:50Z

**Summary**: This study investigates the localization of knowledge representation in fine-tuned GPT-2 models using Causal Layer Attribution via Activation Patching (CLAP), a method that identifies critical neural layers responsible for correct answer generation. The model was fine-tuned on 9,958 PubMed abstracts (epilepsy: 20,595 mentions, EEG: 11,674 mentions, seizure: 13,921 mentions) using two configurations with validation loss monitoring for early stopping. CLAP involved (1) caching clean (correct answer) and corrupted (incorrect answer) activations, (2) computing logit difference to quantify model preference, and (3) patching corrupted activations with clean ones to assess recovery. Results revealed three findings: First, patching the first feedforward layer recovered 56% of correct preference, demonstrating that associative knowledge is distributed across multiple layers. Second, patching the final output layer completely restored accuracy (100% recovery), indicating that definitional knowledge is localised. The stronger clean logit difference for definitional questions further supports this localized representation. Third, minimal recovery from convolutional layer patching (13.6%) suggests low-level features contribute marginally to high-level reasoning. Statistical analysis confirmed significant layer-specific effects (p<0.01). These findings demonstrate that factual knowledge is more localized and associative knowledge depends on distributed representations. We also showed that editing efficacy depends on task type. Our findings not only reconcile conflicting observations about localization in model editing but also emphasize on using task-adaptive techniques for reliable, interpretable updates.

### Improved Compact Genetic Algorithms with Efficient Caching
**Authors**: Prasanta Dutta, Anirban Mukhopadhyay

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T18:47:26Z

**Summary**: Compact Genetic Algorithms (cGAs) are condensed variants of classical Genetic Algorithms (GAs) that use a probability vector representation of the population instead of the complete population. cGAs have been shown to significantly reduce the number of function evaluations required while producing outcomes similar to those of classical GAs. However, cGAs have a tendency to repeatedly generate the same chromosomes as they approach convergence, resulting in unnecessary evaluations of identical chromosomes. This article introduces the concept of caching in cGAs as a means of avoiding redundant evaluations of the same chromosomes. Our proposed approach operates equivalently to cGAs, but enhances the algorithm's time efficiency by reducing the number of function evaluations. We also present a data structure for efficient cache maintenance to ensure low overhead. The proposed caching approach has an asymptotically constant time complexity on average. The proposed method further generalizes the caching mechanism with higher selection pressure for elitism-based cGAs. We conduct a rigorous analysis based on experiments on benchmark optimization problems using two well-known cache replacement strategies. The results demonstrate that caching significantly reduces the number of function evaluations required while maintaining the same level of performance accuracy.

### HyperRAG: Enhancing Quality-Efficiency Tradeoffs in Retrieval-Augmented   Generation with Reranker KV-Cache Reuse
**Authors**: Yuwei An, Yihua Cheng, Seo Jin Park, Junchen Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T17:08:42Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge into the generation process. A key component of RAG pipelines is the reranker, which selects the most relevant documents from a pool of retrieved candidates and significantly improves the quality of the generated responses. While rerankers refine the selection of retrieved documents in RAG pipelines, they introduce computational challenges that hinder high throughput and low latency. To address this problem, we propose HyperRAG, a system that optimizes the trade-off between quality and efficiency in RAG pipelines by leveraging KV-cache reuse for efficient reranker inference. By reusing document-side KV-cache, HyperRAG achieves both high-quality generation and system-level efficiency. To fully realize the benefits of KV-cache reuse, HyperRAG incorporates a range of system-level optimizations designed to enhance efficiency and scalability. Experiments show that HyperRAG achieves a 2 - 3 throughput improvement with decoder-only rerankers while also delivering higher downstream performance compared with traditional RAG service.

### Efficient LLM Inference using Dynamic Input Pruning and Cache-Aware   Masking
**Authors**: Marco Federici, Davide Belli, Mart van Baalen, Amir Jalalirad, Andrii Skliar, Bence Major, Markus Nagel, Paul Whatmough

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T13:28:51Z

**Summary**: While mobile devices provide ever more compute power, improvements in DRAM bandwidth are much slower. This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM) token generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to leverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce effective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU instead of ReLU, which results in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU activations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns are difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To circumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a predictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with minimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain some performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel cache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation magnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on mobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and throughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP achieves a 46\% reduction in memory and 40\% increase in throughput with $<$ 0.1 loss in perplexity when compared to streaming the dense model from Flash. The open source code for HW simulator, methods, and experiments in this paper is available at https://github.com/Qualcomm-AI-research/dynamic-sparsity .

### Cognitive Memory in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Lianlei Shan, Shixian Luo, Zezhou Zhu, Yu Yuan, Yong Wu

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T09:58:19Z

**Summary**: This paper examines memory mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing their importance for context-rich responses, reduced hallucinations, and improved efficiency. It categorizes memory into sensory, short-term, and long-term, with sensory memory corresponding to input prompts, short-term memory processing immediate context, and long-term memory implemented via external databases or structures. The text-based memory section covers acquisition (selection and summarization), management (updating, accessing, storing, and resolving conflicts), and utilization (full-text search, SQL queries, semantic search). The KV cache-based memory section discusses selection methods (regularity-based summarization, score-based approaches, special token embeddings) and compression techniques (low-rank compression, KV merging, multimodal compression), along with management strategies like offloading and shared attention mechanisms. Parameter-based memory methods (LoRA, TTT, MoE) transform memories into model parameters to enhance efficiency, while hidden-state-based memory approaches (chunk mechanisms, recurrent transformers, Mamba model) improve long-text processing by combining RNN hidden states with current methods. Overall, the paper offers a comprehensive analysis of LLM memory mechanisms, highlighting their significance and future research directions.

### FlowKV: A Disaggregated Inference Framework with Low-Latency KV Cache   Transfer and Load-Aware Scheduling
**Authors**: Weiqing Li, Guochao Jiang, Xiangyong Ding, Zhangcheng Tao, Chuzhan Hao, Chenfeng Xu, Yuewei Zhang, Hao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T08:58:05Z

**Summary**: Disaggregated inference has become an essential framework that separates the prefill (P) and decode (D) stages in large language model inference to improve throughput. However, the KV cache transfer faces significant delays between prefill and decode nodes. The block-wise calling method and discontinuous KV cache memory allocation increase the number of calls to the transmission kernel. Additionally, existing frameworks often fix the roles of P and D nodes, leading to computational imbalances. In this paper, we propose FlowKV, a novel disaggregated inference framework, which reduces the average transmission latency of KV cache by 96%, from 0.944s to 0.053s, almost eliminating the transfer time relative to the total request latency by optimizing the KV cache transfer. FlowKV introduces the Load-Aware Scheduler for balanced request scheduling and flexible PD node allocation. This design maximizes hardware resource utilization, achieving peak system throughput across various scenarios, including normal, computational imbalance, and extreme overload conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowKV significantly accelerates inference by 15.2%-48.9% on LongBench dataset compared to the baseline and supports applications with heterogeneous GPUs.

**Authors**: Waris Gill, Justin Cechmanek, Tyler Hutcherson, Srijith Rajamohan, Jen Agarwal, Muhammad Ali Gulzar, Manvinder Singh, Benoit Dion

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T04:27:02Z

**Summary**: This report investigates enhancing semantic caching effectiveness by employing specialized, fine-tuned embedding models. Semantic caching relies on embedding similarity rather than exact key matching, presenting unique challenges in balancing precision, query latency, and computational efficiency. We propose leveraging smaller, domain-specific embedding models, fine-tuned with targeted real-world and synthetically generated datasets. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that compact embedding models fine-tuned for just one epoch on specialized datasets significantly surpass both state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary alternatives in precision and recall. Moreover, we introduce a novel synthetic data generation pipeline for the semantic cache that mitigates the challenge of limited domain-specific annotated data, further boosting embedding performance. Our approach effectively balances computational overhead and accuracy, establishing a viable and efficient strategy for practical semantic caching implementations.

**Authors**: Helen Mayer, James Richards

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T02:24:21Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of distributed caching algorithms employed in modern distributed systems. We evaluate various caching strategies including Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU), Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC), and Time-Aware Least Recently Used (TLRU) against metrics such as hit ratio, latency reduction, memory overhead, and scalability. Our analysis reveals that while traditional algorithms like LRU remain prevalent, hybrid approaches incorporating machine learning techniques demonstrate superior performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we analyze implementation patterns across different distributed architectures and provide recommendations for algorithm selection based on specific workload characteristics.

### Scaling Test-Time Inference with Policy-Optimized, Dynamic   Retrieval-Augmented Generation via KV Caching and Decoding
**Authors**: Sakhinana Sagar Srinivas, Venkataramana Runkana

**Updated**: 2025-04-03T01:23:22Z

**Summary**: We present a comprehensive framework for enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems through dynamic retrieval strategies and reinforcement fine-tuning. This approach significantly improves large language models on knowledge-intensive tasks, including opendomain question answering and complex reasoning. Our framework integrates two complementary techniques: Policy-Optimized RetrievalAugmented Generation (PORAG), which optimizes the use of retrieved information, and Adaptive Token-Layer Attention Scoring (ATLAS), which dynamically determines retrieval timing and content based on contextual needs. Together, these techniques enhance both the utilization and relevance of retrieved content, improving factual accuracy and response quality. Designed as a lightweight solution compatible with any Transformer-based LLM without requiring additional training, our framework excels in knowledge-intensive tasks, boosting output accuracy in RAG settings. We further propose CRITIC, a novel method to selectively compress key-value caches by token importance, mitigating memory bottlenecks in long-context applications. The framework also incorporates test-time scaling techniques to dynamically balance reasoning depth and computational resources, alongside optimized decoding strategies for faster inference. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our framework reduces hallucinations, strengthens domain-specific reasoning, and achieves significant efficiency and scalability gains over traditional RAG systems. This integrated approach advances the development of robust, efficient, and scalable RAG systems across diverse applications.

### A Pilot Study on Tunable Precision Emulation via Automatic BLAS   Offloading
**Authors**: Hang Liu, Junjie Li, Yinzhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T18:51:53Z

**Summary**: This study explores the use of automatic BLAS offloading and INT8-based emulation for accelerating traditional HPC workloads on modern GPU architectures. Through the use of low-bitwidth integer units and cache-coherent Unified Memory Architecture, we emulate double-precision matrix multiplications in the MuST application without code changes. We find that accuracy depends on both arithmetic precision and the properties of the operator, which can be dealt with through tunable precision emulation. Unlike traditional mixed-precision approaches, this method preserves original algorithms while optimizing hardware utilization. We showcases the potential of improving accuracy and performance at the same time. This work highlights the potential of AI-driven hardware to transform HPC, advocating for adaptive precision strategies in future scientific computing.

### MERE: Hardware-Software Co-Design for Masking Cache Miss Latency in   Embedded Processors
**Authors**: Dean You, Jieyu Jiang, Xiaoxuan Wang, Yushu Du, Zhihang Tan, Wenbo Xu, Hui Wang, Jiapeng Guan, Zhenyuan Wang, Ran Wei, Shuai Zhao, Zhe Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T10:38:25Z

**Summary**: Runahead execution is a technique to mask memory latency caused by irregular memory accesses. By pre-executing the application code during occurrences of long-latency operations and prefetching anticipated cache-missed data into the cache hierarchy, runahead effectively masks memory latency for subsequent cache misses and achieves high prefetching accuracy; however, this technique has been limited to superscalar out-of-order and superscalar in-order cores. For implementation in scalar in-order cores, the challenges of area-/energy-constraint and severe cache contention remain.   Here, we build the first full-stack system featuring runahead, MERE, from SoC and a dedicated ISA to the OS and programming model. Through this deployment, we show that enabling runahead in scalar in-order cores is possible, with minimal area and power overheads, while still achieving high performance. By re-constructing the sequential runahead employing a hardware/software co-design approach, the system can be implemented on a mature processor and SoC. Building on this, an adaptive runahead mechanism is proposed to mitigate the severe cache contention in scalar in-order cores. Combining this, we provide a comprehensive solution for embedded processors managing irregular workloads. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed MERE attains 93.5% of a 2-wide out-of-order core's performance while constraining area and power overheads below 5%, with the adaptive runahead mechanism delivering an additional 20.1% performance gain through mitigating the severe cache contention issues.

### Hexa-MoE: Efficient and Heterogeneous-aware Training for   Mixture-of-Experts
**Authors**: Shuqing Luo, Jie Peng, Pingzhi Li, Hanrui Wang, Tianlong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T04:57:15Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a practical approach to scale up parameters for the Transformer model to achieve better generalization while maintaining a sub-linear increase in computation overhead. Current MoE models are mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it usually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy communication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore developing a \texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \texttt{EX}pert \texttt{A}llocation framework, \textbf{\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing efficiency. It contains two components: ($1$) \textit{Expert-Specific Operators}. We replace the typical general matrix multiplication or grouped matrix multiplication interfaces with our operators, which allows the computing to be performed in an in-place manner with \textbf{ZERO} redundancy. ($2$) \textit{Adaptive Data- and Model-Centric Configurations} for different workload scales. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline-shared cache on each device to tackle the heavy memory consumption in the existing data-centric MoE library. Comprehensive experiments on the Swin-MoE benchmark consistently reveal the effectiveness of our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} framework, i.e., reducing $10\%\sim48\%$ memory consumption and achieving $0.5\sim4.3\times$ speed up compared to current state-of-the-art MoE libraries. Furthermore, we examine our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} with heterogeneous devices for both data- and model-centric settings. Promising results show that employing optimal parallel configuration with \texttt{HEXA-MoE} on heterogeneous devices can substantially minimize overall latency. Codes are available at https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/HEXA-MoE.

### MagicDec: Breaking the Latency-Throughput Tradeoff for Long Context   Generation with Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Jian Chen, Zhuoming Chen, Vashisth Tiwari, Ruihang Lai, Jinyuan Shi, Ian En-Hsu Yen, Avner May, Tianqi Chen, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-02T01:58:38Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency losslessly, but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy SD more effectively for high throughput inference. We leverage draft model with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck, which scales with both sequence length and batch size. Additionally, we propose a theoretical model to select the optimal drafting strategy for maximum speedup. Our work highlights the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2.51x speedup for Llama3.1-8B when serving batch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on various types of hardware and tasks.

### Beyond Quacking: Deep Integration of Language Models and RAG into DuckDB
**Authors**: Anas Dorbani, Sunny Yasser, Jimmy Lin, Amine Mhedhbi

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T19:48:17Z

**Summary**: Knowledge-intensive analytical applications retrieve context from both structured tabular data and unstructured, text-free documents for effective decision-making. Large language models (LLMs) have made it significantly easier to prototype such retrieval and reasoning data pipelines. However, implementing these pipelines efficiently still demands significant effort and has several challenges. This often involves orchestrating heterogeneous data systems, managing data movement, and handling low-level implementation details, e.g., LLM context management.   To address these challenges, we introduce FlockMTL: an extension for DBMSs that deeply integrates LLM capabilities and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FlockMTL includes model-driven scalar and aggregate functions, enabling chained predictions through tuple-level mappings and reductions. Drawing inspiration from the relational model, FlockMTL incorporates: (i) cost-based optimizations, which seamlessly apply techniques such as batching and caching; and (ii) resource independence, enabled through novel SQL DDL abstractions: PROMPT and MODEL, introduced as first-class schema objects alongside TABLE. FlockMTL streamlines the development of knowledge-intensive analytical applications, and its optimizations ease the implementation burden.

### Fundamentals of Caching Layered Data objects
**Authors**: Agrim Bari, Gustavo de Veciana, George Kesidis

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T18:21:43Z

**Summary**: The effective management of large amounts of data processed or required by today's cloud or edge computing systems remains a fundamental challenge. This paper focuses on cache management for applications where data objects can be stored in layered representations. In such representations, each additional data layer enhances the "quality" of the object's version but comes with an incremental cost of memory space. This layered approach proves beneficial in various scenarios, including the delivery of zoomable maps, video coding, future Virtual Reality gaming, and layered neural network models where additional data layers improve inference accuracy. In systems where users or devices demand different versions of a data object, layered representations offer flexibility for caching policies to achieve improved hit rates.   In this paper, we explore the performance of various traditionally studied caching policies, such as Belady, LRU, and LFU, both with and without layering. To this end, we develop an asymptotically accurate analytical model for Layered LRU (LLRU). We study how the performance of LLRU is impacted by factors such as the number of layers, the popularity of different objects and layers, and overheads associated with storing layered representations. For instance, we show that, for LLRU, more layers are not always beneficial and indeed performance depends in subtle ways on the popularity and size profiles of layers.

### Surfactants Screen Slide Electrification
**Authors**: Xiaomei Li, Zhongyuan Ni, Xiaoteng Zhou, Lisa S. Bauer, Diego Diaz, Gabriele Schäfer, Hans-Jürgen Butt

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T18:00:48Z

**Summary**: Water drops spontaneously accumulate charges when they move on hydrophobic dielectric surfaces by slide electrification. On the one hand, slide electrification generates electricity with possible applications on tiny devices. On the other hand, the potential of up to 1 KV generated by slide electrification alters wetting and drop motion. Therefore, it is important to know the factors that affect slide electrification. To find out how surfactants affect slide electrification, we measured drop charges of aqueous drops containing cationic CTAB, anionic SDS and neutral C8E3 sliding on different hydrophobic surfaces. The result is: addition of surfactant significantly reduces the spontaneous charging of moving water drops. Based on zeta potential measurements, confocal microscopy of deposited surface-active dyes and drop impact studies, we propose that several factors contribute to this suppression of charge separation: (1) Surfactants tend to lower the contact angles, which reduces charge separation. (2) Surfactant adsorption at the solid-liquid interface can reduce the density of primary ions, particularly for anionic surfactants. (3) Anionic and neutral surfactants are mostly transferred to the liquid-air interface at the rear of the sliding drop, retaining primary ions within the drop. (4) Deposited cationic surfactant directly reduces the charge of the drop.

### MergeVQ: A Unified Framework for Visual Generation and Representation   with Disentangled Token Merging and Quantization
**Authors**: Siyuan Li, Luyuan Zhang, Zedong Wang, Juanxi Tian, Cheng Tan, Zicheng Liu, Chang Yu, Qingsong Xie, Haonan Lu, Haoqian Wang, Zhen Lei

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T17:39:19Z

**Summary**: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with Vector Quantization (VQ) has achieved great success in both self-supervised pre-training and image generation. However, most existing methods struggle to address the trade-off in shared latent space for generation quality vs. representation learning and efficiency. To push the limits of this paradigm, we propose MergeVQ, which incorporates token merging techniques into VQ-based generative models to bridge the gap between image generation and visual representation learning in a unified architecture. During pre-training, MergeVQ decouples top-k semantics from latent space with the token merge module after self-attention blocks in the encoder for subsequent Look-up Free Quantization (LFQ) and global alignment and recovers their fine-grained details through cross-attention in the decoder for reconstruction. As for the second-stage generation, we introduce MergeAR, which performs KV Cache compression for efficient raster-order prediction.

### SentenceKV: Efficient LLM Inference via Sentence-Level Semantic KV   Caching
**Authors**: Yuxuan Zhu, Ali Falahati, David H. Yang, Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri

**Updated**: 2025-04-01T17:08:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models face significant computational and memory challenges when processing long contexts. During inference, efficient management of the key-value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate activations for autoregressive generation, is critical to reducing memory overhead and improving computational efficiency. Traditional token-level efficient KV caching methods overlook semantic information, treating tokens independently without considering their semantic relationships. Meanwhile, existing semantic-preserving KV cache management approaches often suffer from substantial memory usage and high time-to-first-token. To address these limitations, we propose SentenceKV, a novel sentence-level semantic KV caching approach designed to enhance inference efficiency while preserving semantic coherence. During prefilling, SentenceKV groups tokens based on sentence-level semantic similarity, compressing sentence representations into concise semantic vectors stored directly on the GPU, while individual KV pairs are offloaded to CPU. During decoding, SentenceKV generates tokens by selectively retrieving semantically relevant sentence-level KV entries, leveraging the semantic similarity between the prefilling-stage semantic vectors and decoding-stage queries. This ensures efficient and contextually accurate predictions, minimizing the loading of redundant or irrelevant data into GPU memory and significantly reducing memory overhead while maintaining stable inference latency, even for extremely long contexts. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including PG-19, LongBench, and Needle-In-A-Haystack demonstrate that SentenceKV significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and memory usage, without compromising model accuracy.

## Keyword: LLM Inference 
 ### Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in   LLMs Beyond the Base Model?
**Authors**: Yang Yue, Zhiqi Chen, Rui Lu, Andrew Zhao, Zhaokai Wang, Yang Yue, Shiji Song, Gao Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T17:59:56Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in mathematics and programming tasks. It is widely believed that RLVR enables LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities that exceed corresponding base models' capacity. In this study, however, we critically re-examines this assumption by measuring the pass@\textit{k} metric with large values of \textit{k} to explore the reasoning capability boundary of the models across a wide range of model families and benchmarks. Surprisingly, the RL does \emph{not}, in fact, elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RL-trained models outperform their base models at smaller values of $k$ (\eg, $k$=1), base models can achieve a comparable or even higher pass@$k$ score compared to their RL counterparts at large $k$ values. The reasoning paths generated by RL-trained models are already included in the base models' sampling distribution, suggesting that most reasoning abilities manifested in RL-trained models are already obtained by base models. Further analysis shows that RL training boosts the performance by biasing the model's output distribution toward paths that are more likely to yield rewards, therefore sampling correct responses more efficiently. But this also results in a narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. Similar results are observed in visual reasoning tasks trained with RLVR. Moreover, we find that distillation can genuinely introduce new knowledge into the model, different from RLVR. These findings underscore a critical limitation of RLVR in advancing LLM reasoning abilities which requires us to fundamentally rethink the impact of RL training in reasoning LLMs and the need of a better paradigm.

### Science Hierarchography: Hierarchical Organization of Science Literature
**Authors**: Muhan Gao, Jash Shah, Weiqi Wang, Daniel Khashabi

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T17:59:29Z

**Summary**: Scientific knowledge is growing rapidly, making it challenging to track progress and high-level conceptual links across broad disciplines. While existing tools like citation networks and search engines make it easy to access a few related papers, they fundamentally lack the flexible abstraction needed to represent the density of activity in various scientific subfields. We motivate SCIENCE HIERARCHOGRAPHY, the goal of organizing scientific literature into a high-quality hierarchical structure that allows for the categorization of scientific work across varying levels of abstraction, from very broad fields to very specific studies. Such a representation can provide insights into which fields are well-explored and which are under-explored. To achieve the goals of SCIENCE HIERARCHOGRAPHY, we develop a range of algorithms. Our primary approach combines fast embedding-based clustering with LLM-based prompting to balance the computational efficiency of embedding methods with the semantic precision offered by LLM prompting. We demonstrate that this approach offers the best trade-off between quality and speed compared to methods that heavily rely on LLM prompting, such as iterative tree construction with LLMs. To better reflect the interdisciplinary and multifaceted nature of research papers, our hierarchy captures multiple dimensions of categorization beyond simple topic labels. We evaluate the utility of our framework by assessing how effectively an LLM-based agent can locate target papers using the hierarchy. Results show that this structured approach enhances interpretability, supports trend discovery, and offers an alternative pathway for exploring scientific literature beyond traditional search methods.

**Authors**: Junjie Yang, Junhao Song, Xudong Han, Ziqian Bi, Tianyang Wang, Chia Xin Liang, Xinyuan Song, Yichao Zhang, Qian Niu, Benji Peng, Keyu Chen, Ming Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T17:54:33Z

**Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a technique for transferring knowledge from complex teacher models to simpler student models, significantly enhancing model efficiency and accuracy. It has demonstrated substantial advancements in various applications including image classification, object detection, language modeling, text classification, and sentiment analysis. Recent innovations in KD methods, such as attention-based approaches, block-wise logit distillation, and decoupling distillation, have notably improved student model performance. These techniques focus on stimulus complexity, attention mechanisms, and global information capture to optimize knowledge transfer. In addition, KD has proven effective in compressing large language models while preserving accuracy, reducing computational overhead, and improving inference speed. This survey synthesizes the latest literature, highlighting key findings, contributions, and future directions in knowledge distillation to provide insights for researchers and practitioners on its evolving role in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

### Not All Rollouts are Useful: Down-Sampling Rollouts in LLM Reinforcement   Learning
**Authors**: Yixuan Even Xu, Yash Savani, Fei Fang, Zico Kolter

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T17:49:55Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models, but faces a fundamental asymmetry in computation and memory requirements: inference is embarrassingly parallel with a minimal memory footprint, while policy updates require extensive synchronization and are memory-intensive. To address this asymmetry, we introduce PODS (Policy Optimization with Down-Sampling), a framework that strategically decouples these phases by generating numerous rollouts in parallel but updating only on an informative subset. Within this framework, we develop max-variance down-sampling, a theoretically motivated method that selects rollouts with maximally diverse reward signals. We prove that this approach has an efficient algorithmic solution, and empirically demonstrate that GRPO with PODS using max-variance down-sampling achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on the GSM8K benchmark.

### Analyzing LLMs' Knowledge Boundary Cognition Across Languages Through   the Lens of Internal Representations
**Authors**: Chenghao Xiao, Hou Pong Chan, Hao Zhang, Mahani Aljunied, Lidong Bing, Noura Al Moubayed, Yu Rong

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T17:44:12Z

**Summary**: While understanding the knowledge boundaries of LLMs is crucial to prevent hallucination, research on knowledge boundaries of LLMs has predominantly focused on English. In this work, we present the first study to analyze how LLMs recognize knowledge boundaries across different languages by probing their internal representations when processing known and unknown questions in multiple languages. Our empirical studies reveal three key findings: 1) LLMs' perceptions of knowledge boundaries are encoded in the middle to middle-upper layers across different languages. 2) Language differences in knowledge boundary perception follow a linear structure, which motivates our proposal of a training-free alignment method that effectively transfers knowledge boundary perception ability across languages, thereby helping reduce hallucination risk in low-resource languages; 3) Fine-tuning on bilingual question pair translation further enhances LLMs' recognition of knowledge boundaries across languages. Given the absence of standard testbeds for cross-lingual knowledge boundary analysis, we construct a multilingual evaluation suite comprising three representative types of knowledge boundary data. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/LLM-Multilingual-Knowledge-Boundaries.

### NRGBoost: Energy-Based Generative Boosted Trees
**Authors**: João Bravo

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T17:36:25Z

**Summary**: Despite the rise to dominance of deep learning in unstructured data domains, tree-based methods such as Random Forests (RF) and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) are still the workhorses for handling discriminative tasks on tabular data. We explore generative extensions of these popular algorithms with a focus on explicitly modeling the data density (up to a normalization constant), thus enabling other applications besides sampling. As our main contribution we propose an energy-based generative boosting algorithm that is analogous to the second-order boosting implemented in popular libraries like XGBoost. We show that, despite producing a generative model capable of handling inference tasks over any input variable, our proposed algorithm can achieve similar discriminative performance to GBDT on a number of real world tabular datasets, outperforming alternative generative approaches. At the same time, we show that it is also competitive with neural-network-based models for sampling. Code is available at https://github.com/ajoo/nrgboost.

### High-Resolution Frame Interpolation with Patch-based Cascaded Diffusion
**Authors**: Junhwa Hur, Charles Herrmann, Saurabh Saxena, Janne Kontkanen, Wei-Sheng Lai, Yichang Shih, Michael Rubinstein, David J. Fleet, Deqing Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T17:32:22Z

**Summary**: Despite the recent progress, existing frame interpolation methods still struggle with processing extremely high resolution input and handling challenging cases such as repetitive textures, thin objects, and large motion. To address these issues, we introduce a patch-based cascaded pixel diffusion model for high resolution frame interpolation, HIFI, that excels in these scenarios while achieving competitive performance on standard benchmarks. Cascades, which generate a series of images from low to high resolution, can help significantly with large or complex motion that require both global context for a coarse solution and detailed context for high resolution output. However, contrary to prior work on cascaded diffusion models which perform diffusion on increasingly large resolutions, we use a single model that always performs diffusion at the same resolution and upsamples by processing patches of the inputs and the prior solution. At inference time, this drastically reduces memory usage and allows a single model, solving both frame interpolation (base model's task) and spatial up-sampling, saving training cost as well. HIFI excels at high-resolution images and complex repeated textures that require global context, achieving comparable or state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks (Vimeo, Xiph, X-Test, and SEPE-8K). We further introduce a new dataset, LaMoR, that focuses on particularly challenging cases, and HIFI significantly outperforms other baselines.

### A-MEM: Agentic Memory for LLM Agents
**Authors**: Wujiang Xu, Kai Mei, Hang Gao, Juntao Tan, Zujie Liang, Yongfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T17:26:57Z

**Summary**: While large language model (LLM) agents can effectively use external tools for complex real-world tasks, they require memory systems to leverage historical experiences. Current memory systems enable basic storage and retrieval but lack sophisticated memory organization, despite recent attempts to incorporate graph databases. Moreover, these systems' fixed operations and structures limit their adaptability across diverse tasks. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel agentic memory system for LLM agents that can dynamically organize memories in an agentic way. Following the basic principles of the Zettelkasten method, we designed our memory system to create interconnected knowledge networks through dynamic indexing and linking. When a new memory is added, we generate a comprehensive note containing multiple structured attributes, including contextual descriptions, keywords, and tags. The system then analyzes historical memories to identify relevant connections, establishing links where meaningful similarities exist. Additionally, this process enables memory evolution - as new memories are integrated, they can trigger updates to the contextual representations and attributes of existing historical memories, allowing the memory network to continuously refine its understanding. Our approach combines the structured organization principles of Zettelkasten with the flexibility of agent-driven decision making, allowing for more adaptive and context-aware memory management. Empirical experiments on six foundation models show superior improvement against existing SOTA baselines. The source code for evaluating performance is available at https://github.com/WujiangXu/AgenticMemory, while the source code of agentic memory system is available at https://github.com/agiresearch/A-mem.

### Imitation Learning with Precisely Labeled Human Demonstrations
**Authors**: Yilong Song

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T17:12:00Z

**Summary**: Within the imitation learning paradigm, training generalist robots requires large-scale datasets obtainable only through diverse curation. Due to the relative ease to collect, human demonstrations constitute a valuable addition when incorporated appropriately. However, existing methods utilizing human demonstrations face challenges in inferring precise actions, ameliorating embodiment gaps, and fusing with frontier generalist robot training pipelines. In this work, building on prior studies that demonstrate the viability of using hand-held grippers for efficient data collection, we leverage the user's control over the gripper's appearance--specifically by assigning it a unique, easily segmentable color--to enable simple and reliable application of the RANSAC and ICP registration method for precise end-effector pose estimation. We show in simulation that precisely labeled human demonstrations on their own allow policies to reach on average 88.1% of the performance of using robot demonstrations, and boost policy performance when combined with robot demonstrations, despite the inherent embodiment gap.

### From Token to Line: Enhancing Code Generation with a Long-Term   Perspective
**Authors**: Tingwei Lu, Yangning Li, Liyuan Wang, Binghuai Lin, Jiwei Tang, Wanshi Xu, Hai-Tao Zheng, Yinghui Li, Bingxu An, Zhao Wei, Yong Xu

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T17:03:01Z

**Summary**: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly promoted the development of code generation task, sparking a surge in pertinent literature. Current research is hindered by redundant generation results and a tendency to overfit local patterns in the short term. Although existing studies attempt to alleviate the issue by adopting a multi-token prediction strategy, there remains limited focus on choosing the appropriate processing length for generations. By analyzing the attention between tokens during the generation process of LLMs, it can be observed that the high spikes of the attention scores typically appear at the end of lines. This insight suggests that it is reasonable to treat each line of code as a fundamental processing unit and generate them sequentially. Inspired by this, we propose the \textbf{LSR-MCTS} algorithm, which leverages MCTS to determine the code line-by-line and select the optimal path. Further, we integrate a self-refine mechanism at each node to enhance diversity and generate higher-quality programs through error correction. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analyses on three public coding benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art performance approaches.

### SysCaps: Language Interfaces for Simulation Surrogates of Complex   Systems
**Authors**: Patrick Emami, Zhaonan Li, Saumya Sinha, Truc Nguyen

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T16:49:44Z

**Summary**: Surrogate models are used to predict the behavior of complex energy systems that are too expensive to simulate with traditional numerical methods. Our work introduces the use of language descriptions, which we call ``system captions'' or SysCaps, to interface with such surrogates. We argue that interacting with surrogates through text, particularly natural language, makes these models more accessible for both experts and non-experts. We introduce a lightweight multimodal text and timeseries regression model and a training pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality captions from simulation metadata. Our experiments on two real-world simulators of buildings and wind farms show that our SysCaps-augmented surrogates have better accuracy on held-out systems than traditional methods while enjoying new generalization abilities, such as handling semantically related descriptions of the same test system. Additional experiments also highlight the potential of SysCaps to unlock language-driven design space exploration and to regularize training through prompt augmentation.

### Learning Through Retrospection: Improving Trajectory Prediction for   Automated Driving with Error Feedback
**Authors**: Steffen Hagedorn, Aron Distelzweig, Marcel Hallgarten, Alexandru P. Condurache

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T16:35:12Z

**Summary**: In automated driving, predicting trajectories of surrounding vehicles supports reasoning about scene dynamics and enables safe planning for the ego vehicle. However, existing models handle predictions as an instantaneous task of forecasting future trajectories based on observed information. As time proceeds, the next prediction is made independently of the previous one, which means that the model cannot correct its errors during inference and will repeat them. To alleviate this problem and better leverage temporal data, we propose a novel retrospection technique. Through training on closed-loop rollouts the model learns to use aggregated feedback. Given new observations it reflects on previous predictions and analyzes its errors to improve the quality of subsequent predictions. Thus, the model can learn to correct systematic errors during inference. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse demonstrate a considerable decrease in minimum Average Displacement Error of up to 31.9% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline without retrospection. We further showcase the robustness of our technique by demonstrating a better handling of out-of-distribution scenarios with undetected road-users.

### BadApex: Backdoor Attack Based on Adaptive Optimization Mechanism of   Black-box Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhengxian Wu, Juan Wen, Wanli Peng, Ziwei Zhang, Yinghan Zhou, Yiming Xue

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T16:22:41Z

**Summary**: Previous insertion-based and paraphrase-based backdoors have achieved great success in attack efficacy, but they ignore the text quality and semantic consistency between poisoned and clean texts. Although recent studies introduce LLMs to generate poisoned texts and improve the stealthiness, semantic consistency, and text quality, their hand-crafted prompts rely on expert experiences, facing significant challenges in prompt adaptability and attack performance after defenses. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack based on adaptive optimization mechanism of black-box large language models (BadApex), which leverages a black-box LLM to generate poisoned text through a refined prompt. Specifically, an Adaptive Optimization Mechanism is designed to refine an initial prompt iteratively using the generation and modification agents. The generation agent generates the poisoned text based on the initial prompt. Then the modification agent evaluates the quality of the poisoned text and refines a new prompt. After several iterations of the above process, the refined prompt is used to generate poisoned texts through LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three dataset with six backdoor attacks and two defenses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadApex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. It improves prompt adaptability, semantic consistency, and text quality. Furthermore, when two defense methods are applied, the average attack success rate (ASR) still up to 96.75%.

### DP2Unlearning: An Efficient and Guaranteed Unlearning Framework for LLMs
**Authors**: Tamim Al Mahmud, Najeeb Jebreel, Josep Domingo-Ferrer, David Sanchez

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T16:22:20Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized language processing tasks but have also brought ethical and legal issues. LLMs have a tendency to memorize potentially private or copyrighted information present in the training data, which might then be delivered to end users at inference time. When this happens, a naive solution is to retrain the model from scratch after excluding the undesired data. Although this guarantees that the target data have been forgotten, it is also prohibitively expensive for LLMs. Approximate unlearning offers a more efficient alternative, as it consists of ex post modifications of the trained model itself to prevent undesirable results, but it lacks forgetting guarantees because it relies solely on empirical evidence. In this work, we present DP2Unlearning, a novel LLM unlearning framework that offers formal forgetting guarantees at a significantly lower cost than retraining from scratch on the data to be retained. DP2Unlearning involves training LLMs on textual data protected using {\epsilon}-differential privacy (DP), which later enables efficient unlearning with the guarantees against disclosure associated with the chosen {\epsilon}. Our experiments demonstrate that DP2Unlearning achieves similar model performance post-unlearning, compared to an LLM retraining from scratch on retained data -- the gold standard exact unlearning -- but at approximately half the unlearning cost. In addition, with a reasonable computational cost, it outperforms approximate unlearning methods at both preserving the utility of the model post-unlearning and effectively forgetting the targeted information.

### Detecting Malicious Source Code in PyPI Packages with LLMs: Does RAG   Come in Handy?
**Authors**: Motunrayo Ibiyo, Thinakone Louangdy, Phuong T. Nguyen, Claudio Di Sipio, Davide Di Ruscio

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T16:11:59Z

**Summary**: Malicious software packages in open-source ecosystems, such as PyPI, pose growing security risks. Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, these packages are intentionally designed to deceive users, making detection challenging due to evolving attack methods and the lack of structured datasets. In this work, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and few-shot learning for detecting malicious source code. We fine-tune LLMs on curated datasets and integrate YARA rules, GitHub Security Advisories, and malicious code snippets with the aim of enhancing classification accuracy. We came across a counterintuitive outcome: While RAG is expected to boost up the prediction performance, it fails in the performed evaluation, obtaining a mediocre accuracy. In contrast, few-shot learning is more effective as it significantly improves the detection of malicious code, achieving 97% accuracy and 95% balanced accuracy, outperforming traditional RAG approaches. Thus, future work should expand structured knowledge bases, refine retrieval models, and explore hybrid AI-driven cybersecurity solutions.

### Modeling L1 Influence on L2 Pronunciation: An MFCC-Based Framework for   Explainable Machine Learning and Pedagogical Feedback
**Authors**: Peyman Jahanbin

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T16:04:22Z

**Summary**: This study investigates the extent to which Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) capture first language (L1) transfer in extended second language (L2) English speech. Speech samples from Mandarin and American English L1 speakers were extracted from the GMU Speech Accent Archive, converted to WAV format, and processed to obtain thirteen MFCCs per speaker. A multi-method analytic framework combining inferential statistics (t-tests, MANOVA, Canonical Discriminant Analysis) and machine learning (Random Forest classification) identified MFCC-1 (broadband energy), MFCC-2 (first formant region), and MFCC-5 (voicing and fricative energy) as the most discriminative features for distinguishing L1 backgrounds. A reduced-feature model using these MFCCs significantly outperformed the full-feature model, as confirmed by McNemar's test and non-overlapping confidence intervals. The findings empirically support the Perceptual Assimilation Model for L2 (PAM-L2) and the Speech Learning Model (SLM), demonstrating that L1-conditioned variation in L2 speech is both perceptually grounded and acoustically quantifiable. Methodologically, the study contributes to applied linguistics and explainable AI by proposing a transparent, data-efficient pipeline for L2 pronunciation modeling. The results also offer pedagogical implications for ESL/EFL instruction by highlighting L1-specific features that can inform intelligibility-oriented instruction, curriculum design, and speech assessment tools.

### Algorithms for mean-field variational inference via polyhedral   optimization in the Wasserstein space
**Authors**: Yiheng Jiang, Sinho Chewi, Aram-Alexandre Pooladian

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T15:55:11Z

**Summary**: We develop a theory of finite-dimensional polyhedral subsets over the Wasserstein space and optimization of functionals over them via first-order methods. Our main application is to the problem of mean-field variational inference, which seeks to approximate a distribution $\pi$ over $\mathbb{R}^d$ by a product measure $\pi^\star$. When $\pi$ is strongly log-concave and log-smooth, we provide (1) approximation rates certifying that $\pi^\star$ is close to the minimizer $\pi^\star_\diamond$ of the KL divergence over a \emph{polyhedral} set $\mathcal{P}_\diamond$, and (2) an algorithm for minimizing $\text{KL}(\cdot\|\pi)$ over $\mathcal{P}_\diamond$ based on accelerated gradient descent over $\R^d$. As a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain the first end-to-end analysis for gradient-based algorithms for MFVI.

**Authors**: Christoph Schuhmann, Gollam Rabby, Ameya Prabhu, Tawsif Ahmed, Andreas Hochlehnert, Huu Nguyen, Nick Akinci, Ludwig Schmidt, Robert Kaczmarczyk, Sören Auer, Jenia Jitsev, Matthias Bethge

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T15:48:01Z

**Summary**: Paywalls, licenses and copyright rules often restrict the broad dissemination and reuse of scientific knowledge. We take the position that it is both legally and technically feasible to extract the scientific knowledge in scholarly texts. Current methods, like text embeddings, fail to reliably preserve factual content, and simple paraphrasing may not be legally sound. We propose a new idea for the community to adopt: convert scholarly documents into knowledge preserving, but style agnostic representations we term Knowledge Units using LLMs. These units use structured data capturing entities, attributes and relationships without stylistic content. We provide evidence that Knowledge Units (1) form a legally defensible framework for sharing knowledge from copyrighted research texts, based on legal analyses of German copyright law and U.S. Fair Use doctrine, and (2) preserve most (~95\%) factual knowledge from original text, measured by MCQ performance on facts from the original copyrighted text across four research domains. Freeing scientific knowledge from copyright promises transformative benefits for scientific research and education by allowing language models to reuse important facts from copyrighted text. To support this, we share open-source tools for converting research documents into Knowledge Units. Overall, our work posits the feasibility of democratizing access to scientific knowledge while respecting copyright.

### Understanding Epistemic Language with a Language-augmented Bayesian   Theory of Mind
**Authors**: Lance Ying, Tan Zhi-Xuan, Lionel Wong, Vikash Mansinghka, Joshua B. Tenenbaum

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T15:31:32Z

**Summary**: How do people understand and evaluate claims about others' beliefs, even though these beliefs cannot be directly observed? In this paper, we introduce a cognitive model of epistemic language interpretation, grounded in Bayesian inferences about other agents' goals, beliefs, and intentions: a language-augmented Bayesian theory-of-mind (LaBToM). By translating natural language into an epistemic ``language-of-thought'' with grammar-constrained LLM decoding, then evaluating these translations against the inferences produced by inverting a generative model of rational action and perception, LaBToM captures graded plausibility judgments of epistemic claims. We validate our model in an experiment where participants watch an agent navigate a maze to find keys hidden in boxes needed to reach their goal, then rate sentences about the agent's beliefs. In contrast with multimodal LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini Pro) and ablated models, our model correlates highly with human judgments for a wide range of expressions, including modal language, uncertainty expressions, knowledge claims, likelihood comparisons, and attributions of false belief.

### A Bayesian nonparametric approach to mediation and spillover effects   with multiple mediators in cluster-randomized trials
**Authors**: Yuki Ohnishi, Fan Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T15:30:04Z

**Summary**: Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) with multiple unstructured mediators present significant methodological challenges for causal inference due to within-cluster correlation, interference among units, and the complexity introduced by multiple mediators. Existing causal mediation methods often fall short in simultaneously addressing these complexities, particularly in disentangling mediator-specific effects under interference that are central to studying complex mechanisms. To address this gap, we propose new causal estimands for spillover mediation effects that differentiate the roles of each individual's own mediator and the spillover effects resulting from interactions among individuals within the same cluster. We establish identification results for each estimand and, to flexibly model the complex data structures inherent in CRTs, we develop a new Bayesian nonparametric prior -- the Nested Dependent Dirichlet Process Mixture -- designed for flexibly capture the outcome and mediator surfaces at different levels. We conduct extensive simulations across various scenarios to evaluate the frequentist performance of our methods, compare them with a Bayesian parametric counterpart and illustrate our new methods in an analysis of a completed CRT.

### Observation of gyroscopic coupling in a non-spinning levitated   ferromagnet
**Authors**: F. Ahrens, A. Vinante

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T15:18:08Z

**Summary**: A non-spinning permanent ferromagnet is predicted to behave as a gyroscope at sufficiently low frequencies, which can be seen as a manifestation of the Einstein-de Haas effect. This yet unexplored regime has been recently proposed for ultrasensitive precession-based magnetometry and for atomic-like quantum stabilization of a levitated nanomagnet in a static field. Here, we observe signatures of gyroscopic effects in the rotational dynamics of a non-spinning permanent ferromagnet levitated in a superconducting trap. Specifically, we detect spin-rotation coupling between different librational modes, in good agreement with theoretical predictions. From our measurements, we can infer both the intrinsic angular momentum of the levitated magnet and its gyromagnetic $g$-factor.

### When is Task Vector Provably Effective for Model Editing? A   Generalization Analysis of Nonlinear Transformers
**Authors**: Hongkang Li, Yihua Zhang, Shuai Zhang, Meng Wang, Sijia Liu, Pin-Yu Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T15:14:13Z

**Summary**: Task arithmetic refers to editing the pre-trained model by adding a weighted sum of task vectors, each of which is the weight update from the pre-trained model to fine-tuned models for certain tasks. This approach recently gained attention as a computationally efficient inference method for model editing, e.g., multi-task learning, forgetting, and out-of-domain generalization capabilities. However, the theoretical understanding of why task vectors can execute various conceptual operations remains limited, due to the highly non-convexity of training Transformer-based models. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of the generalization guarantees of task vector methods on nonlinear Transformers. We consider a conceptual learning setting, where each task is a binary classification problem based on a discriminative pattern. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of task addition in simultaneously learning a set of irrelevant or aligned tasks, as well as the success of task negation in unlearning one task from irrelevant or contradictory tasks. Moreover, we prove the proper selection of linear coefficients for task arithmetic to achieve guaranteed generalization to out-of-domain tasks. All of our theoretical results hold for both dense-weight parameters and their low-rank approximations. Although established in a conceptual setting, our theoretical findings were validated on a practical machine unlearning task using the large language model Phi-1.5 (1.3B).

### LimitNet: Progressive, Content-Aware Image Offloading for Extremely Weak   Devices & Networks
**Authors**: Ali Hojjat, Janek Haberer, Tayyaba Zainab, Olaf Landsiedel

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T15:04:53Z

**Summary**: IoT devices have limited hardware capabilities and are often deployed in remote areas. Consequently, advanced vision models surpass such devices' processing and storage capabilities, requiring offloading of such tasks to the cloud. However, remote areas often rely on LPWANs technology with limited bandwidth, high packet loss rates, and extremely low duty cycles, which makes fast offloading for time-sensitive inference challenging. Today's approaches, which are deployable on weak devices, generate a non-progressive bit stream, and therefore, their decoding quality suffers strongly when data is only partially available on the cloud at a deadline due to limited bandwidth or packet losses.   In this paper, we introduce LimitNet, a progressive, content-aware image compression model designed for extremely weak devices and networks. LimitNet's lightweight progressive encoder prioritizes critical data during transmission based on the content of the image, which gives the cloud the opportunity to run inference even with partial data availability.   Experimental results demonstrate that LimitNet, on average, compared to SOTA, achieves 14.01 p.p. (percentage point) higher accuracy on ImageNet1000, 18.01 pp on CIFAR100, and 0.1 higher mAP@0.5 on COCO. Also, on average, LimitNet saves 61.24% bandwidth on ImageNet1000, 83.68% on CIFAR100, and 42.25% on the COCO dataset compared to SOTA, while it only has 4% more encoding time compared to JPEG (with a fixed quality) on STM32F7 (Cortex-M7).

### Dynamic Regularized CBDT: Variance-Calibrated Causal Boosting for   Interpretable Heterogeneous Treatment Effects
**Authors**: Yichen Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T15:02:06Z

**Summary**: Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in high-stakes applications demands models that simultaneously optimize precision, interpretability, and calibration. Many existing tree-based causal inference techniques, however, exhibit high estimation errors when applied to observational data because they struggle to capture complex interactions among factors and rely on static regularization schemes. In this work, we propose Dynamic Regularized Causal Boosted Decision Trees (CBDT), a novel framework that integrates variance regularization and average treatment effect calibration into the loss function of gradient boosted decision trees. Our approach dynamically updates the regularization parameters using gradient statistics to better balance the bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets and real-world clinical data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves estimation accuracy while maintaining reliable coverage of true treatment effects. In an intensive care unit patient triage study, the method successfully identified clinically actionable rules and achieved high accuracy in treatment effect estimation. The results validate that dynamic regularization can effectively tighten error bounds and enhance both predictive performance and model interpretability.

### Controlled Territory and Conflict Tracking (CONTACT): (Geo-)Mapping   Occupied Territory from Open Source Intelligence
**Authors**: Paul K. Mandal, Cole Leo, Connor Hurley

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T14:57:07Z

**Summary**: Open-source intelligence provides a stream of unstructured textual data that can inform assessments of territorial control. We present CONTACT, a framework for territorial control prediction using large language models (LLMs) and minimal supervision. We evaluate two approaches: SetFit, an embedding-based few-shot classifier, and a prompt tuning method applied to BLOOMZ-560m, a multilingual generative LLM. Our model is trained on a small hand-labeled dataset of news articles covering ISIS activity in Syria and Iraq, using prompt-conditioned extraction of control-relevant signals such as military operations, casualties, and location references. We show that the BLOOMZ-based model outperforms the SetFit baseline, and that prompt-based supervision improves generalization in low-resource settings. CONTACT demonstrates that LLMs fine-tuned using few-shot methods can reduce annotation burdens and support structured inference from open-ended OSINT streams. Our code is available at https://github.com/PaulKMandal/CONTACT/.

### AgentHarm: A Benchmark for Measuring Harmfulness of LLM Agents
**Authors**: Maksym Andriushchenko, Alexandra Souly, Mateusz Dziemian, Derek Duenas, Maxwell Lin, Justin Wang, Dan Hendrycks, Andy Zou, Zico Kolter, Matt Fredrikson, Eric Winsor, Jerome Wynne, Yarin Gal, Xander Davies

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T14:30:31Z

**Summary**: The robustness of LLMs to jailbreak attacks, where users design prompts to circumvent safety measures and misuse model capabilities, has been studied primarily for LLMs acting as simple chatbots. Meanwhile, LLM agents -- which use external tools and can execute multi-stage tasks -- may pose a greater risk if misused, but their robustness remains underexplored. To facilitate research on LLM agent misuse, we propose a new benchmark called AgentHarm. The benchmark includes a diverse set of 110 explicitly malicious agent tasks (440 with augmentations), covering 11 harm categories including fraud, cybercrime, and harassment. In addition to measuring whether models refuse harmful agentic requests, scoring well on AgentHarm requires jailbroken agents to maintain their capabilities following an attack to complete a multi-step task. We evaluate a range of leading LLMs, and find (1) leading LLMs are surprisingly compliant with malicious agent requests without jailbreaking, (2) simple universal jailbreak templates can be adapted to effectively jailbreak agents, and (3) these jailbreaks enable coherent and malicious multi-step agent behavior and retain model capabilities. To enable simple and reliable evaluation of attacks and defenses for LLM-based agents, we publicly release AgentHarm at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai-safety-institute/AgentHarm.

### OpenDeception: Benchmarking and Investigating AI Deceptive Behaviors via   Open-ended Interaction Simulation
**Authors**: Yichen Wu, Xudong Pan, Geng Hong, Min Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T14:11:27Z

**Summary**: As the general capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve and agent applications become more widespread, the underlying deception risks urgently require systematic evaluation and effective oversight. Unlike existing evaluation which uses simulated games or presents limited choices, we introduce OpenDeception, a novel deception evaluation framework with an open-ended scenario dataset. OpenDeception jointly evaluates both the deception intention and capabilities of LLM-based agents by inspecting their internal reasoning process. Specifically, we construct five types of common use cases where LLMs intensively interact with the user, each consisting of ten diverse, concrete scenarios from the real world. To avoid ethical concerns and costs of high-risk deceptive interactions with human testers, we propose to simulate the multi-turn dialogue via agent simulation. Extensive evaluation of eleven mainstream LLMs on OpenDeception highlights the urgent need to address deception risks and security concerns in LLM-based agents: the deception intention ratio across the models exceeds 80%, while the deception success rate surpasses 50%. Furthermore, we observe that LLMs with stronger capabilities do exhibit a higher risk of deception, which calls for more alignment efforts on inhibiting deceptive behaviors.

### Inverse Inference on Cooperative Control of Networked Dynamical Systems
**Authors**: Yushan Li, Jianping He, Dimos V. Dimarogonas

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T14:02:29Z

**Summary**: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancement of understanding the control mechanism of networked dynamical systems (NDSs), which are governed by components such as nodal dynamics and topology. This paper reveals that the critical components in continuous-time state feedback cooperative control of NDSs can be inferred merely from discrete observations. In particular, we advocate a bi-level inference framework to estimate the global closed-loop system and extract the components, respectively. The novelty lies in bridging the gap from discrete observations to the continuous-time model and effectively decoupling the concerned components. Specifically, in the first level, we design a causality-based estimator for the discrete-time closed-loop system matrix, which can achieve asymptotically unbiased performance when the NDS is stable. In the second level, we introduce a matrix logarithm based method to recover the continuous-time counterpart matrix, providing new sampling period guarantees and establishing the recovery error bound. By utilizing graph properties of the NDS, we develop least square based procedures to decouple the concerned components with up to a scalar ambiguity. Furthermore, we employ inverse optimal control techniques to reconstruct the objective function driving the control process, deriving necessary conditions for the solutions. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### A Theory of LLM Sampling: Part Descriptive and Part Prescriptive
**Authors**: Sarath Sivaprasad, Pramod Kaushik, Sahar Abdelnabi, Mario Fritz

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T14:01:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in autonomous decision-making, where they sample options from vast action spaces. However, the heuristics that guide this sampling process remain under-explored. We study this sampling behavior and show that this underlying heuristics resembles that of human decision-making: comprising a descriptive component (reflecting statistical norm) and a prescriptive component (implicit ideal encoded in the LLM) of a concept. We show that this deviation of a sample from the statistical norm towards a prescriptive component consistently appears in concepts across diverse real-world domains like public health, and economic trends. To further illustrate the theory, we demonstrate that concept prototypes in LLMs are affected by prescriptive norms, similar to the concept of normality in humans. Through case studies and comparison with human studies, we illustrate that in real-world applications, the shift of samples toward an ideal value in LLMs' outputs can result in significantly biased decision-making, raising ethical concerns.

### Exploring Multimodal Prompt for Visualization Authoring with Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Zhen Wen, Luoxuan Weng, Yinghao Tang, Runjin Zhang, Yuxin Liu, Bo Pan, Minfeng Zhu, Wei Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T14:00:55Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in automating the process of visualization authoring through simple natural language utterances. However, instructing LLMs using natural language is limited in precision and expressiveness for conveying visualization intent, leading to misinterpretation and time-consuming iterations. To address these limitations, we conduct an empirical study to understand how LLMs interpret ambiguous or incomplete text prompts in the context of visualization authoring, and the conditions making LLMs misinterpret user intent. Informed by the findings, we introduce visual prompts as a complementary input modality to text prompts, which help clarify user intent and improve LLMs' interpretation abilities. To explore the potential of multimodal prompting in visualization authoring, we design VisPilot, which enables users to easily create visualizations using multimodal prompts, including text, sketches, and direct manipulations on existing visualizations. Through two case studies and a controlled user study, we demonstrate that VisPilot provides a more intuitive way to create visualizations without affecting the overall task efficiency compared to text-only prompting approaches. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of text and visual prompts in different visualization tasks. Our findings highlight the importance of multimodal prompting in improving the usability of LLMs for visualization authoring. We discuss design implications for future visualization systems and provide insights into how multimodal prompts can enhance human-AI collaboration in creative visualization tasks.

### Intelligent Interaction Strategies for Context-Aware Cognitive   Augmentation
**Authors**: Xiangrong, Zhu, Yuan Xu, Tianjian Liu, Jingwei Sun, Yu Zhang, Xin Tong

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T13:35:21Z

**Summary**: Human cognition is constrained by processing limitations, leading to cognitive overload and inefficiencies in knowledge synthesis and decision-making. Large Language Models (LLMs) present an opportunity for cognitive augmentation, but their current reactive nature limits their real-world applicability. This position paper explores the potential of context-aware cognitive augmentation, where LLMs dynamically adapt to users' cognitive states and task environments to provide appropriate support. Through a think-aloud study in an exhibition setting, we examine how individuals interact with multi-modal information and identify key cognitive challenges in structuring, retrieving, and applying knowledge. Our findings highlight the need for AI-driven cognitive support systems that integrate real-time contextual awareness, personalized reasoning assistance, and socially adaptive interactions. We propose a framework for AI augmentation that seamlessly transitions between real-time cognitive support and post-experience knowledge organization, contributing to the design of more effective human-centered AI systems.

### Navigating Unmeasured Confounding in Quantitative Sociology: A   Sensitivity Framework
**Authors**: Cheng Lin, Jose M. Pena, Adel Daoud

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T13:18:34Z

**Summary**: Unmeasured confounding remains a critical challenge in causal inference for the social sciences. This paper proposes a sensitivity analysis framework to systematically evaluate how unmeasured confounders influence statistical inference in sociology. Given these sensitivity analysis methods, we introduce a five-step workflow that integrates sensitivity analysis into research design rather than treating it as a post-hoc robustness check. Using the Blau and Duncan (1967) study as an empirical example, we demonstrate how different sensitivity methods provide complementary insights. By extending existing frameworks, we show how sensitivity analysis enhances causal transparency, offering a practical tool for assessing uncertainty in observational research. Our approach contributes to a more rigorous application of causal inference in sociology, bridging gaps between theory, identification strategies, and statistical modeling.

### Revisiting Uncertainty Quantification Evaluation in Language Models:   Spurious Interactions with Response Length Bias Results
**Authors**: Andrea Santilli, Adam Golinski, Michael Kirchhof, Federico Danieli, Arno Blaas, Miao Xiong, Luca Zappella, Sinead Williamson

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T13:13:42Z

**Summary**: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in Language Models (LMs) is crucial for improving their safety and reliability. Evaluations often use performance metrics like AUROC to assess how well UQ methods (e.g., negative sequence probabilities) correlate with task correctness functions (e.g., ROUGE-L). In this paper, we show that commonly used correctness functions bias UQ evaluations by inflating the performance of certain UQ methods. We evaluate 7 correctness functions -- from lexical-based and embedding-based metrics to LLM-as-a-judge approaches -- across 4 datasets x 4 models x 6 UQ methods. Our analysis reveals that length biases in the errors of these correctness functions distort UQ assessments by interacting with length biases in UQ methods. We identify LLM-as-a-judge approaches as among the least length-biased choices and hence a potential solution to mitigate these biases.

### The Comparative Trap: Pairwise Comparisons Amplifies Biased Preferences   of LLM Evaluators
**Authors**: Hawon Jeong, ChaeHun Park, Jimin Hong, Hojoon Lee, Jaegul Choo

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T13:12:42Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators for natural language generation tasks, ensuring unbiased assessments is essential. However, LLM evaluators often display biased preferences, such as favoring verbosity and authoritative tones. Our empirical analysis reveals that these biases are exacerbated in pairwise evaluation, where LLMs directly compare two outputs and easily prioritize superficial attributes. In contrast, pointwise evaluation, which assesses outputs independently, is less susceptible to such bias because each output is judged in isolation. To address the limitations of the pairwise evaluation, we introduce a novel evaluation method, PRePair, which integrates pointwise reasoning within a pairwise framework. PRePair effectively alleviates biased preference, improving performance on the adversarial benchmark (LLMBar) while outperforming pointwise evaluation on the standard benchmark (MT-Bench).

### Can Tool-augmented Large Language Models be Aware of Incomplete   Conditions?
**Authors**: Seungbin Yang, ChaeHun Park, Taehee Kim, Jaegul Choo

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T13:07:08Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in integrating large language models (LLMs) with tools have allowed the models to interact with real-world environments. However, these tool-augmented LLMs often encounter incomplete scenarios when users provide partial information or the necessary tools are unavailable. Recognizing and managing such scenarios is crucial for LLMs to ensure their reliability, but this exploration remains understudied. This study examines whether LLMs can identify incomplete conditions and appropriately determine when to refrain from using tools. To this end, we address a dataset by manipulating instances from two datasets by removing necessary tools or essential information for tool invocation. Our experiments show that LLMs often struggle to identify the absence of information required to utilize specific tools and recognize the absence of appropriate tools. We further analyze model behaviors in different environments and compare their performance against humans. Our research can contribute to advancing reliable LLMs by addressing common scenarios during interactions between humans and LLMs. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

**Summary**: This paper presents a hopeful perspective on the potentially dramatic impacts of Large Language Models on how we children learn and how they will expect to interact with technology. We review the effects of LLMs on education so far, and make the case that these effects are minor compared to the upcoming changes that are occurring. We present a small scenario and self-ethnographic study demonstrating the effects of these changes, and define five significant considerations that interactive systems designers will have to accommodate in the future.

### Modeling Bounded Count Environmental Data Using a Contaminated   Beta-Binomial Regression Model
**Authors**: Arnoldus F. Otto, Antonio Punzo, Johannes T. Ferreira, Andriëtte Bekker, Salvatorie D. Tomarchio, Cristina Tortora

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T12:52:50Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates two environmental applications related to climate change, where observations consist of bounded counts. The binomial and beta-binomial (BB) models are commonly used for bounded count data, with the BB model offering the advantage of accounting for potential overdispersion. However, extreme observations in real-world applications may hinder the performance of the BB model and lead to misleading inferences. To address this issue, we propose the contaminated beta-binomial (cBB) distribution (cBB-D), which provides the necessary flexibility to accommodate extreme observations. The cBB model accounts for overdispersion and extreme values while maintaining the mean and variance properties of the BB distribution. The availability of covariates that improve inference about the mean of the bounded count variable motivates the further proposal of the cBB regression model (cBB-RM). Different versions of the cBB-RM model - where none, some, or all of the cBB parameters are regressed on available covariates - are fitted to the datasets.

### Reducing nuisance prior sensitivity via non-linear reparameterization,   with application to EFT analyses of large-scale structure
**Authors**: S. Paradiso, M. Bonici, M. Chen, W. J. Percival, G. D'Amico, H. Zhang, G. McGee

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T12:50:30Z

**Summary**: Many physical models contain nuisance parameters that quantify unknown properties of an experiment that are not of primary relevance. Typically, these cannot be measured except by fitting the models to the data from the experiment, requiring simultaneous measurement of interesting parameters that are our target of inference and nuisance terms that are not directly of interest. A recent example of this is fitting Effective Field Theory (EFT) models to large-scale structure (LSS) data to make cosmological inferences. These models have a large number of nuisance parameters that are typically correlated with cosmological parameters in the posterior, leading to strong dependence on the nuisance parameter priors. We introduce a reparametrization method that leverages Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to decorrelate nuisance parameters from the parameters of interest in the likelihood, even in the presence of non-linear relationships. This reparametrization forms a natural basis within which to define priors that are independent between nuisance and target parameters: the separation means that the marginal posterior for cosmological parameters does not depend on simple priors placed on nuisance terms. In application to EFT models using LSS data, we demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to robust cosmological inference.

### Do Prompt Patterns Affect Code Quality? A First Empirical Assessment of   ChatGPT-Generated Code
**Authors**: Antonio Della Porta, Stefano Lambiase, Fabio Palomba

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T12:37:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed software development, especially in code generation. However, their inconsistent performance, prone to hallucinations and quality issues, complicates program comprehension and hinders maintainability. Research indicates that prompt engineering-the practice of designing inputs to direct LLMs toward generating relevant outputs-may help address these challenges. In this regard, researchers have introduced prompt patterns, structured templates intended to guide users in formulating their requests. However, the influence of prompt patterns on code quality has yet to be thoroughly investigated. An improved understanding of this relationship would be essential to advancing our collective knowledge on how to effectively use LLMs for code generation, thereby enhancing their understandability in contemporary software development. This paper empirically investigates the impact of prompt patterns on code quality, specifically maintainability, security, and reliability, using the Dev-GPT dataset. Results show that Zero-Shot prompting is most common, followed by Zero-Shot with Chain-of-Thought and Few-Shot. Analysis of 7583 code files across quality metrics revealed minimal issues, with Kruskal-Wallis tests indicating no significant differences among patterns, suggesting that prompt structure may not substantially impact these quality metrics in ChatGPT-assisted code generation.

### Is In-Context Learning Sufficient for Instruction Following in LLMs?
**Authors**: Hao Zhao, Maksym Andriushchenko, Francesco Croce, Nicolas Flammarion

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T12:31:18Z

**Summary**: In-context learning (ICL) allows LLMs to learn from examples without changing their weights: this is a particularly promising capability for long-context LLMs that can potentially learn from many examples. Recently, Lin et al. (2024) proposed URIAL, a method using only three in-context examples to align base LLMs, achieving non-trivial instruction following performance. In this work, we show that, while effective, ICL alignment with URIAL still underperforms compared to instruction fine-tuning on the established benchmark MT-Bench, especially with more capable base LLMs. We then uncover the most relevant elements for successful in-context alignment, finding the crucial role of the decoding parameters. Based on these insights, we show that the approach of URIAL can indeed be improved by adding high-quality, potentially carefully selected via greedy search, demonstrations in context, getting closer to the performance of instruct models. Finally, we provide the first, to our knowledge, systematic comparison of ICL and instruction fine-tuning (IFT) for instruction following in the low data regime, where ICL can be a viable alternative to IFT. Overall, our work advances the understanding of ICL as an alignment technique and its relationship to IFT. We provide our code at https://github.com/tml-epfl/icl-alignment.

### Lightweight LiDAR-Camera 3D Dynamic Object Detection and Multi-Class   Trajectory Prediction
**Authors**: Yushen He, Lei Zhao, Tianchen Deng, Zipeng Fang, Weidong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T11:59:34Z

**Summary**: Service mobile robots are often required to avoid dynamic objects while performing their tasks, but they usually have only limited computational resources. So we present a lightweight multi-modal framework for 3D object detection and trajectory prediction. Our system synergistically integrates LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians, vehicles, and riders in 3D space. The framework proposes two novel modules: 1) a Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) for object detection with high accuracy and acceptable amount of computation, and 2) a Reference Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse trajectory prediction of mult-class objects with flexible trajectory lengths. Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate superior performance over existing methods across detection (+2.03% in mAP) and trajectory prediction (-0.408m in minADE5 of pedestrians) metrics. Remarkably, the system exhibits exceptional deployability - when implemented on a wheelchair robot with an entry-level NVIDIA 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.2 fps. To facilitate reproducibility and practical deployment, we release the related code of the method at https://github.com/TossherO/3D_Perception and its ROS inference version at https://github.com/TossherO/ros_packages.

### Efficient Parameter Adaptation for Multi-Modal Medical Image   Segmentation and Prognosis
**Authors**: Numan Saeed, Shahad Hardan, Muhammad Ridzuan, Nada Saadi, Karthik Nandakumar, Mohammad Yaqub

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T11:52:21Z

**Summary**: Cancer detection and prognosis relies heavily on medical imaging, particularly CT and PET scans. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown promise in tumor segmentation by fusing information from these modalities. However, a critical bottleneck exists: the dependency on CT-PET data concurrently for training and inference, posing a challenge due to the limited availability of PET scans. Hence, there is a clear need for a flexible and efficient framework that can be trained with the widely available CT scans and can be still adapted for PET scans when they become available. In this work, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-modal adaptation (PEMMA) framework for lightweight upgrading of a transformer-based segmentation model trained only on CT scans such that it can be efficiently adapted for use with PET scans when they become available. This framework is further extended to perform prognosis task maintaining the same efficient cross-modal fine-tuning approach. The proposed approach is tested with two well-known segementation backbones, namely UNETR and Swin UNETR. Our approach offers two main advantages. Firstly, we leverage the inherent modularity of the transformer architecture and perform low-rank adaptation (LoRA) as well as decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) of the attention weights to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation. Secondly, by minimizing cross-modal entanglement, PEMMA allows updates using only one modality without causing catastrophic forgetting in the other. Our method achieves comparable performance to early fusion, but with only 8% of the trainable parameters, and demonstrates a significant +28% Dice score improvement on PET scans when trained with a single modality. Furthermore, in prognosis, our method improves the concordance index by +10% when adapting a CT-pretrained model to include PET scans, and by +23% when adapting for both PET and EHR data.

### Exploring the Potential for Large Language Models to Demonstrate   Rational Probabilistic Beliefs
**Authors**: Gabriel Freedman, Francesca Toni

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T11:50:30Z

**Summary**: Advances in the general capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have led to their use for information retrieval, and as components in automated decision systems. A faithful representation of probabilistic reasoning in these models may be essential to ensure trustworthy, explainable and effective performance in these tasks. Despite previous work suggesting that LLMs can perform complex reasoning and well-calibrated uncertainty quantification, we find that current versions of this class of model lack the ability to provide rational and coherent representations of probabilistic beliefs. To demonstrate this, we introduce a novel dataset of claims with indeterminate truth values and apply a number of well-established techniques for uncertainty quantification to measure the ability of LLM's to adhere to fundamental properties of probabilistic reasoning.

### Simulating Before Planning: Constructing Intrinsic User World Model for   User-Tailored Dialogue Policy Planning
**Authors**: Tao He, Lizi Liao, Ming Liu, Bing Qin

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T11:48:55Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in dialogue policy planning have emphasized optimizing system agent policies to achieve predefined goals, focusing on strategy design, trajectory acquisition, and efficient training paradigms. However, these approaches often overlook the critical role of user characteristics, which are essential in real-world scenarios like conversational search and recommendation, where interactions must adapt to individual user traits such as personality, preferences, and goals. To address this gap, we first conduct a comprehensive study utilizing task-specific user personas to systematically assess dialogue policy planning under diverse user behaviors. By leveraging realistic user profiles for different tasks, our study reveals significant limitations in existing approaches, highlighting the need for user-tailored dialogue policy planning. Building on this foundation, we present the User-Tailored Dialogue Policy Planning (UDP) framework, which incorporates an Intrinsic User World Model to model user traits and feedback. UDP operates in three stages: (1) User Persona Portraying, using a diffusion model to dynamically infer user profiles; (2) User Feedback Anticipating, leveraging a Brownian Bridge-inspired anticipator to predict user reactions; and (3) User-Tailored Policy Planning, integrating these insights to optimize response strategies. To ensure robust performance, we further propose an active learning approach that prioritizes challenging user personas during training. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks, including collaborative and non-collaborative settings, demonstrate the effectiveness of UDP in learning user-specific dialogue strategies. Results validate the protocol's utility and highlight UDP's robustness, adaptability, and potential to advance user-centric dialogue systems.

### Argumentative Large Language Models for Explainable and Contestable   Claim Verification
**Authors**: Gabriel Freedman, Adam Dejl, Deniz Gorur, Xiang Yin, Antonio Rago, Francesca Toni

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T11:20:24Z

**Summary**: The profusion of knowledge encoded in large language models (LLMs) and their ability to apply this knowledge zero-shot in a range of settings makes them promising candidates for use in decision-making. However, they are currently limited by their inability to provide outputs which can be faithfully explained and effectively contested to correct mistakes. In this paper, we attempt to reconcile these strengths and weaknesses by introducing \emph{argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs)}, a method for augmenting LLMs with argumentative reasoning. Concretely, ArgLLMs construct argumentation frameworks, which then serve as the basis for formal reasoning in support of decision-making. The interpretable nature of these argumentation frameworks and formal reasoning means that any decision made by ArgLLMs may be explained and contested. We evaluate ArgLLMs' performance experimentally in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, in the context of the decision-making task of claim verification. We also define novel properties to characterise contestability and assess ArgLLMs formally in terms of these properties.

### Remedy: Learning Machine Translation Evaluation from Human Preferences   with Reward Modeling
**Authors**: Shaomu Tan, Christof Monz

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T11:11:14Z

**Summary**: A key challenge in MT evaluation is the inherent noise and inconsistency of human ratings. Regression-based neural metrics struggle with this noise, while prompting LLMs shows promise at system-level evaluation but performs poorly at segment level. In this work, we propose ReMedy, a novel MT metric framework that reformulates translation evaluation as a reward modeling task. Instead of regressing on imperfect human ratings directly, ReMedy learns relative translation quality using pairwise preference data, resulting in a more reliable evaluation. In extensive experiments across WMT22-24 shared tasks (39 language pairs, 111 MT systems), ReMedy achieves state-of-the-art performance at both segment- and system-level evaluation. Specifically, ReMedy-9B surpasses larger WMT winners and massive closed LLMs such as MetricX-13B, XCOMET-Ensemble, GEMBA-GPT-4, PaLM-540B, and finetuned PaLM2. Further analyses demonstrate that ReMedy delivers superior capability in detecting translation errors and evaluating low-quality translations.

### Divergent LLM Adoption and Heterogeneous Convergence Paths in Research   Writing
**Authors**: Cong William Lin, Wu Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T11:09:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are reshaping content creation and academic writing. This study investigates the impact of AI-assisted generative revisions on research manuscripts, focusing on heterogeneous adoption patterns and their influence on writing convergence. Leveraging a dataset of over 627,000 academic papers from arXiv, we develop a novel classification framework by fine-tuning prompt- and discipline-specific large language models to detect the style of ChatGPT-revised texts. Our findings reveal substantial disparities in LLM adoption across academic disciplines, gender, native language status, and career stage, alongside a rapid evolution in scholarly writing styles. Moreover, LLM usage enhances clarity, conciseness, and adherence to formal writing conventions, with improvements varying by revision type. Finally, a difference-in-differences analysis shows that while LLMs drive convergence in academic writing, early adopters, male researchers, non-native speakers, and junior scholars exhibit the most pronounced stylistic shifts, aligning their writing more closely with that of established researchers.

**Authors**: Dawid Kopeć, Wojciech Kozłowski, Maciej Wizerkaniuk, Dawid Krutul, Jan Kocoń, Maciej Zięba

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:55:24Z

**Summary**: In this work, we present SupResDiffGAN, a novel hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models for super-resolution tasks. By leveraging latent space representations and reducing the number of diffusion steps, SupResDiffGAN achieves significantly faster inference times than other diffusion-based super-resolution models while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. To prevent discriminator overfitting, we propose adaptive noise corruption, ensuring a stable balance between the generator and the discriminator during training. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms traditional diffusion models such as SR3 and I$^2$SB in efficiency and image quality. This work bridges the performance gap between diffusion- and GAN-based methods, laying the foundation for real-time applications of diffusion models in high-resolution image generation.

### Visual Intention Grounding for Egocentric Assistants
**Authors**: Pengzhan Sun, Junbin Xiao, Tze Ho Elden Tse, Yicong Li, Arjun Akula, Angela Yao

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:54:52Z

**Summary**: Visual grounding associates textual descriptions with objects in an image. Conventional methods target third-person image inputs and named object queries. In applications such as AI assistants, the perspective shifts -- inputs are egocentric, and objects may be referred to implicitly through needs and intentions. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoIntention, the first dataset for egocentric visual intention grounding. EgoIntention challenges multimodal LLMs to 1) understand and ignore unintended contextual objects and 2) reason about uncommon object functionalities. Benchmark results show that current models misidentify context objects and lack affordance understanding in egocentric views. We also propose Reason-to-Ground (RoG) instruction tuning; it enables hybrid training with normal descriptions and egocentric intentions with a chained intention reasoning and object grounding mechanism. RoG significantly outperforms naive finetuning and hybrid training on EgoIntention, while maintaining or slightly improving naive description grounding. This advancement enables unified visual grounding for egocentric and exocentric visual inputs while handling explicit object queries and implicit human intentions.

### Compile Scene Graphs with Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Zuyao Chen, Jinlin Wu, Zhen Lei, Marc Pollefeys, Chang Wen Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:46:22Z

**Summary**: Next token prediction is the fundamental principle for training large language models (LLMs), and reinforcement learning (RL) further enhances their reasoning performance. As an effective way to model language, image, video, and other modalities, the use of LLMs for end-to-end extraction of structured visual representations, such as scene graphs, remains underexplored. It requires the model to accurately produce a set of objects and relationship triplets, rather than generating text token by token. To achieve this, we introduce R1-SGG, a multimodal LLM (M-LLM) initially trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the scene graph dataset and subsequently refined using reinforcement learning to enhance its ability to generate scene graphs in an end-to-end manner. The SFT follows a conventional prompt-response paradigm, while RL requires the design of effective reward signals. Given the structured nature of scene graphs, we design a graph-centric reward function that integrates node-level rewards, edge-level rewards, and a format consistency reward. Our experiments demonstrate that rule-based RL substantially enhances model performance in the SGG task, achieving a zero failure rate--unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which struggles to generalize effectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/gpt4vision/R1-SGG.

### Long-context Non-factoid Question Answering in Indic Languages
**Authors**: Ritwik Mishra, Rajiv Ratn Shah, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:43:21Z

**Summary**: Question Answering (QA) tasks, which involve extracting answers from a given context, are relatively straightforward for modern Large Language Models (LLMs) when the context is short. However, long contexts pose challenges due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. This challenge is compounded in Indic languages, which are often low-resource. This study explores context-shortening techniques, including Open Information Extraction (OIE), coreference resolution, Answer Paragraph Selection (APS), and their combinations, to improve QA performance. Compared to the baseline of unshortened (long) contexts, our experiments on four Indic languages (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu) demonstrate that context-shortening techniques yield an average improvement of 4\% in semantic scores and 47\% in token-level scores when evaluated on three popular LLMs without fine-tuning. Furthermore, with fine-tuning, we achieve an average increase of 2\% in both semantic and token-level scores. Additionally, context-shortening reduces computational overhead. Explainability techniques like LIME and SHAP reveal that when the APS model confidently identifies the paragraph containing the answer, nearly all tokens within the selected text receive high relevance scores. However, the study also highlights the limitations of LLM-based QA systems in addressing non-factoid questions, particularly those requiring reasoning or debate. Moreover, verbalizing OIE-generated triples does not enhance system performance. These findings emphasize the potential of context-shortening techniques to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM-based QA systems, especially for low-resource languages. The source code and resources are available at https://github.com/ritwikmishra/IndicGenQA.

### Speedup Chip Yield Analysis by Improved Quantum Bayesian Inference
**Authors**: Zi-Ming Li, Zeji Li, Tie-Fu Li, Yu-xi Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:39:43Z

**Summary**: The semiconductor chip manufacturing process is complex and lengthy, and potential errors arise at every stage. Each wafer contains numerous chips, and wafer bin maps can be generated after chip testing. By analyzing the defect patterns on these wafer bin maps, the steps in the manufacturing process where errors occurred can be inferred. In this letter, we propose an improved quantum Bayesian inference to accelerate the identification of error patterns on wafer bin maps, thereby assisting in chip yield analysis. We outline the algorithm for error identification and detail the implementation of improved quantum Bayesian inference. Our results demonstrate the speed advantage of quantum computation over classical algorithms with a real-world problem, highlighting the practical significance of quantum computation.

### Evaluation Report on MCP Servers
**Authors**: Zhiling Luo, Xiaorong Shi, Xuanrui Lin, Jinyang Gao

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:39:23Z

**Summary**: With the rise of LLMs, a large number of Model Context Protocol (MCP) services have emerged since the end of 2024. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of MCP servers have not been well studied. To study these questions, we propose an evaluation framework, called MCPBench. We selected several widely used MCP server and conducted an experimental evaluation on their accuracy, time, and token usage. Our experiments showed that the most effective MCP, Bing Web Search, achieved an accuracy of 64%. Importantly, we found that the accuracy of MCP servers can be substantially enhanced by involving declarative interface. This research paves the way for further investigations into optimized MCP implementations, ultimately leading to better AI-driven applications and data retrieval solutions.

### Prompt-Based Cost-Effective Evaluation and Operation of ChatGPT as a   Computer Programming Teaching Assistant
**Authors**: Marc Ballestero-Ribó, Daniel Ortiz-Martínez

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:35:50Z

**Summary**: The dream of achieving a student-teacher ratio of 1:1 is closer than ever thanks to the emergence of large language models (LLMs). One potential application of these models in the educational field would be to provide feedback to students in university introductory programming courses, so that a student struggling to solve a basic implementation problem could seek help from an LLM available 24/7. This article focuses on studying three aspects related to such an application. First, the performance of two well-known models, GPT-3.5T and GPT-4T, in providing feedback to students is evaluated. The empirical results showed that GPT-4T performs much better than GPT-3.5T, however, it is not yet ready for use in a real-world scenario. This is due to the possibility of generating incorrect information that potential users may not always be able to detect. Second, the article proposes a carefully designed prompt using in-context learning techniques that allows automating important parts of the evaluation process, as well as providing a lower bound for the fraction of feedbacks containing incorrect information, saving time and effort. This was possible because the resulting feedback has a programmatically analyzable structure that incorporates diagnostic information about the LLM's performance in solving the requested task. Third, the article also suggests a possible strategy for implementing a practical learning tool based on LLMs, which is rooted on the proposed prompting techniques. This strategy opens up a whole range of interesting possibilities from a pedagogical perspective.

### Entropic Time Schedulers for Generative Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Dejan Stancevic, Luca Ambrogioni

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:35:19Z

**Summary**: The practical performance of generative diffusion models depends on the appropriate choice of the noise scheduling function, which can also be equivalently expressed as a time reparameterization. In this paper, we present a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater improvements in the few NFEs regime.

### Variational Stochastic Gradient Descent for Deep Neural Networks
**Authors**: Haotian Chen, Anna Kuzina, Babak Esmaeili, Jakub M Tomczak

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:32:24Z

**Summary**: Current state-of-the-art optimizers are adaptive gradient-based optimization methods such as Adam. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in formulating gradient-based optimizers in a probabilistic framework for better modeling the uncertainty of the gradients. Here, we propose to combine both approaches, resulting in the Variational Stochastic Gradient Descent (VSGD) optimizer. We model gradient updates as a probabilistic model and utilize stochastic variational inference (SVI) to derive an efficient and effective update rule. Further, we show how our VSGD method relates to other adaptive gradient-based optimizers like Adam. Lastly, we carry out experiments on two image classification datasets and four deep neural network architectures, where we show that VSGD outperforms Adam and SGD.

### Can LLMs assist with Ambiguity? A Quantitative Evaluation of various   Large Language Models on Word Sense Disambiguation
**Authors**: T. G. D. K. Sumanathilaka, Nicholas Micallef, Julian Hough

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:26:12Z

**Summary**: Ambiguous words are often found in modern digital communications. Lexical ambiguity challenges traditional Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) methods, due to limited data. Consequently, the efficiency of translation, information retrieval, and question-answering systems is hindered by these limitations. This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve WSD using a novel approach combining a systematic prompt augmentation mechanism with a knowledge base (KB) consisting of different sense interpretations. The proposed method incorporates a human-in-loop approach for prompt augmentation where prompt is supported by Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, synonyms of ambiguous words, aspect-based sense filtering and few-shot prompting to guide the LLM. By utilizing a few-shot Chain of Thought (COT) prompting-based approach, this work demonstrates a substantial improvement in performance. The evaluation was conducted using FEWS test data and sense tags. This research advances accurate word interpretation in social media and digital communication.

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:14:51Z

**Summary**: The recent advances in Legal Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of legal research and practice by automating tasks, enhancing research precision, and supporting complex decision-making processes. However, effectively adapting LLMs to the legal domain remains challenging due to the complexity of legal reasoning, the need for precise interpretation of specialized language, and the potential for hallucinations. This paper examines the efficacy of Domain-Adaptive Continual Pre-Training (DACP) in improving the legal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Through a series of experiments on legal reasoning tasks within the Taiwanese legal framework, we demonstrate that while DACP enhances domain-specific knowledge, it does not uniformly improve performance across all legal tasks. We discuss the trade-offs involved in DACP, particularly its impact on model generalization and performance in prompt-based tasks, and propose directions for future research to optimize domain adaptation strategies in legal AI.

### Improving Generalization in Intent Detection: GRPO with Reward-Based   Curriculum Sampling
**Authors**: Zihao Feng, Xiaoxue Wang, Ziwei Bai, Donghang Su, Bowen Wu, Qun Yu, Baoxun Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:52:12Z

**Summary**: Intent detection, a critical component in task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, faces significant challenges in adapting to the rapid influx of integrable tools with complex interrelationships. Existing approaches, such as zero-shot reformulations and LLM-based dynamic recognition, struggle with performance degradation when encountering unseen intents, leading to erroneous task routing. To enhance the model's generalization performance on unseen tasks, we employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) combined with a Reward-based Curriculum Sampling (RCS) during Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training in intent detection tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained models substantially outperform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baselines in generalization. Besides, the introduction of the RCS, significantly bolsters the effectiveness of RL in intent detection by focusing the model on challenging cases during training. Moreover, incorporating Chain-of-Thought (COT) processes in RL notably improves generalization in complex intent detection tasks, underscoring the importance of thought in challenging scenarios. This work advances the generalization of intent detection tasks, offering practical insights for deploying adaptable dialogue systems.

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:46:32Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in video generation have been driven by diffusion models and autoregressive frameworks, yet critical challenges persist in harmonizing prompt adherence, visual quality, motion dynamics, and duration: compromises in motion dynamics to enhance temporal visual quality, constrained video duration (5-10 seconds) to prioritize resolution, and inadequate shot-aware generation stemming from general-purpose MLLMs' inability to interpret cinematic grammar, such as shot composition, actor expressions, and camera motions. These intertwined limitations hinder realistic long-form synthesis and professional film-style generation. To address these limitations, we propose SkyReels-V2, an Infinite-length Film Generative Model, that synergizes Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), Multi-stage Pretraining, Reinforcement Learning, and Diffusion Forcing Framework. Firstly, we design a comprehensive structural representation of video that combines the general descriptions by the Multi-modal LLM and the detailed shot language by sub-expert models. Aided with human annotation, we then train a unified Video Captioner, named SkyCaptioner-V1, to efficiently label the video data. Secondly, we establish progressive-resolution pretraining for the fundamental video generation, followed by a four-stage post-training enhancement: Initial concept-balanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) improves baseline quality; Motion-specific Reinforcement Learning (RL) training with human-annotated and synthetic distortion data addresses dynamic artifacts; Our diffusion forcing framework with non-decreasing noise schedules enables long-video synthesis in an efficient search space; Final high-quality SFT refines visual fidelity.

### Towards End-to-End Network Intent Management with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Lam Dinh, Sihem Cherrared, Xiaofeng Huang, Fabrice Guillemin

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:41:35Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are likely to play a key role in Intent-Based Networking (IBN) as they show remarkable performance in interpreting human language as well as code generation, enabling the translation of high-level intents expressed by humans into low-level network configurations. In this paper, we leverage closed-source language models (i.e., Google Gemini 1.5 pro, ChatGPT-4) and open-source models (i.e., LLama, Mistral) to investigate their capacity to generate E2E network configurations for radio access networks (RANs) and core networks in 5G/6G mobile networks. We introduce a novel performance metrics, known as FEACI, to quantitatively assess the format (F), explainability (E), accuracy (A), cost (C), and inference time (I) of the generated answer; existing general metrics are unable to capture these features. The results of our study demonstrate that open-source models can achieve comparable or even superior translation performance compared with the closed-source models requiring costly hardware setup and not accessible to all users.

### Haptic Perception via the Dynamics of Flexible Body Inspired by an   Ostrich's Neck
**Authors**: Kazashi Nakano, Katsuma Inoue, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Kohei Nakajima

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:38:56Z

**Summary**: In biological systems, both skin sensitivity and body flexibility play crucial roles in haptic perception. Fully soft robots often suffer from structural fragility and delayed sensory processing, limiting their practical functionality. The musculoskeletal system combines the adaptability of soft materials with the durability of rigid-body robots. It also leverages morphological computation, where the morphological structures contribute to information processing, for dynamic and adaptive behaviors. This study focuses on the pecking behaviors of birds, which enables precise haptic perception through the musculoskeletal system of their flexible neck. Physical reservoir computing is applied to flexible structures inspired by an ostrich neck to analyze the relationship between haptic perception and physical characteristics. Experiments with both a physical robot and simulations reveal that, with appropriate viscoelasticity, the flexible structure can discriminate object softness and retain that information through behavior. Drawing on these findings and anatomical insights from the ostrich neck, a haptic perception system is proposed that exhibits both separability and behavioral memory in flexible structures, enabling rapid learning and real-time inference. The results demonstrate that through the dynamics of flexible structures, diverse functions can emerge beyond their original design as manipulators.

### RAG Without the Lag: Interactive Debugging for Retrieval-Augmented   Generation Pipelines
**Authors**: Quentin Romero Lauro, Shreya Shankar, Sepanta Zeighami, Aditya Parameswaran

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:38:49Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines have become the de-facto approach for building AI assistants with access to external, domain-specific knowledge. Given a user query, RAG pipelines typically first retrieve (R) relevant information from external sources, before invoking a Large Language Model (LLM), augmented (A) with this information, to generate (G) responses. Modern RAG pipelines frequently chain multiple retrieval and generation components, in any order. However, developing effective RAG pipelines is challenging because retrieval and generation components are intertwined, making it hard to identify which component(s) cause errors in the eventual output. The parameters with the greatest impact on output quality often require hours of pre-processing after each change, creating prohibitively slow feedback cycles. To address these challenges, we present RAGGY, a developer tool that combines a Python library of composable RAG primitives with an interactive interface for real-time debugging. We contribute the design and implementation of RAGGY, insights into expert debugging patterns through a qualitative study with 12 engineers, and design implications for future RAG tools that better align with developers' natural workflows.

### Learning when to rank: Estimation of partial rankings from sparse, noisy   comparisons
**Authors**: Sebastian Morel-Balbi, Alec Kirkley

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:26:21Z

**Summary**: A common task arising in various domains is that of ranking items based on the outcomes of pairwise comparisons, from ranking players and teams in sports to ranking products or brands in marketing studies and recommendation systems. Statistical inference-based methods such as the Bradley-Terry model, which extract rankings based on an underlying generative model of the comparison outcomes, have emerged as flexible and powerful tools to tackle the task of ranking in empirical data. In situations with limited and/or noisy comparisons, it is often challenging to confidently distinguish the performance of different items based on the evidence available in the data. However, existing inference-based ranking methods overwhelmingly choose to assign each item to a unique rank or score, suggesting a meaningful distinction when there is none. Here, we address this problem by developing a principled Bayesian methodology for learning partial rankings -- rankings with ties -- that distinguishes among the ranks of different items only when there is sufficient evidence available in the data. Our framework is adaptable to any statistical ranking method in which the outcomes of pairwise observations depend on the ranks or scores of the items being compared. We develop a fast agglomerative algorithm to perform Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference of partial rankings under our framework and examine the performance of our method on a variety of real and synthetic network datasets, finding that it frequently gives a more parsimonious summary of the data than traditional ranking, particularly when observations are sparse.

### Token-Level Density-Based Uncertainty Quantification Methods for   Eliciting Truthfulness of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Artem Vazhentsev, Lyudmila Rvanova, Ivan Lazichny, Alexander Panchenko, Maxim Panov, Timothy Baldwin, Artem Shelmanov

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:21:41Z

**Summary**: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a prominent approach for eliciting truthful answers from large language models (LLMs). To date, information-based and consistency-based UQ have been the dominant UQ methods for text generation via LLMs. Density-based methods, despite being very effective for UQ in text classification with encoder-based models, have not been very successful with generative LLMs. In this work, we adapt Mahalanobis Distance (MD) - a well-established UQ technique in classification tasks - for text generation and introduce a new supervised UQ method. Our method extracts token embeddings from multiple layers of LLMs, computes MD scores for each token, and uses linear regression trained on these features to provide robust uncertainty scores. Through extensive experiments on eleven datasets, we demonstrate that our approach substantially improves over existing UQ methods, providing accurate and computationally efficient uncertainty scores for both sequence-level selective generation and claim-level fact-checking tasks. Our method also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-domain data, making it suitable for a wide range of LLM-based applications.

**Authors**: Gustavo Penha, Alice Wang, Martin Achenbach, Kristen Sheets, Sahitya Mantravadi, Remi Galvez, Nico Guetta-Jeanrenaud, Divya Narayanan, Ofeliya Kalaydzhyan, Hugues Bouchard

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:12:46Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we propose a pipeline to generate contextualized list recommendations with descriptive shelves in the domain of audiobooks. By creating several shelves for topics the user has an affinity to, e.g. Uplifting Women's Fiction, we can help them explore their recommendations according to their interests and at the same time recommend a diverse set of items. To do so, we use Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich each item's metadata based on a taxonomy created for this domain. Then we create diverse descriptive shelves for each user. A/B tests show improvements in user engagement and audiobook discovery metrics, demonstrating benefits for users and content creators.

### Bayesian continual learning and forgetting in neural networks
**Authors**: Djohan Bonnet, Kellian Cottart, Tifenn Hirtzlin, Tarcisius Januel, Thomas Dalgaty, Elisa Vianello, Damien Querlioz

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:11:34Z

**Summary**: Biological synapses effortlessly balance memory retention and flexibility, yet artificial neural networks still struggle with the extremes of catastrophic forgetting and catastrophic remembering. Here, we introduce Metaplasticity from Synaptic Uncertainty (MESU), a Bayesian framework that updates network parameters according their uncertainty. This approach allows a principled combination of learning and forgetting that ensures that critical knowledge is preserved while unused or outdated information is gradually released. Unlike standard Bayesian approaches -- which risk becoming overly constrained, and popular continual-learning methods that rely on explicit task boundaries, MESU seamlessly adapts to streaming data. It further provides reliable epistemic uncertainty estimates, allowing out-of-distribution detection, the only computational cost being to sample the weights multiple times to provide proper output statistics. Experiments on image-classification benchmarks demonstrate that MESU mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while maintaining plasticity for new tasks. When training 200 sequential permuted MNIST tasks, MESU outperforms established continual learning techniques in terms of accuracy, capability to learn additional tasks, and out-of-distribution data detection. Additionally, due to its non-reliance on task boundaries, MESU outperforms conventional learning techniques on the incremental training of CIFAR-100 tasks consistently in a wide range of scenarios. Our results unify ideas from metaplasticity, Bayesian inference, and Hessian-based regularization, offering a biologically-inspired pathway to robust, perpetual learning.

### MR-MAGIC: Robust Causal Inference Using Many Weak Genetic Interactions
**Authors**: Di Zhang, Minhao Yao, Zhonghua Liu, Baoluo Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:06:26Z

**Summary**: Mendelian randomization (MR) studies commonly use genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects of exposures on outcomes. However, the presence of invalid instruments-even when numerous-can lead to biased causal estimates. We propose a novel identification strategy that remains valid even when all candidate instruments are invalid by leveraging genetic interactions that collectively explain substantial exposure variation. Recognizing that individual interaction effects may be weak, we develop MR-MAGIC (Mendelian Randomization with MAny weak Genetic Interactions for Causality), a robust method that simultaneously addresses instrument invalidity and improves estimation efficiency. MR-MAGIC provides consistent and asymptotically normal estimates under a many-weak-interactions asymptotic framework. Comprehensive simulations and applications to UK Biobank data demonstrate that MR-MAGIC outperforms conventional MR methods in practice, offering reliable causal inference when standard approaches fail.

### MoFO: Momentum-Filtered Optimizer for Mitigating Forgetting in LLM   Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Yupeng Chen, Senmiao Wang, Yushun Zhang, Zhihang Lin, Haozhe Zhang, Weijian Sun, Tian Ding, Ruoyu Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:04:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks. Typically, LLMs are first pre-trained on large corpora and subsequently fine-tuned on task-specific datasets. However, during fine-tuning, LLMs may forget some knowledge acquired in the pre-training stage, leading to a decline in general capabilities. Existing approaches to mitigate forgetting often rely on access to pre-training data, which may be unavailable in many real-world scenarios--such as fine-tuning checkpoint-only open-source LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a new fine-tuning algorithm termed Momentum-Filtered Optimizer (MoFO). MoFO is an extension of greedy block coordinate descent (BCD) methods: in each iteration, MoFO only updates the model parameters with the largest momentum magnitudes, while keeping all other parameters fixed. MoFO achieves similar fine-tuning performance to the default fine-tuning algorithm while effectively mitigating knowledge forgetting. We validate MoFO through rigorous convergence analysis and extensive experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating forgetting without pre-training data.

### DETAM: Defending LLMs Against Jailbreak Attacks via Targeted Attention   Modification
**Authors**: Yu Li, Han Jiang, Zhihua Wei

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:02:12Z

**Summary**: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), jailbreak attacks have become an increasingly pressing safety concern. While safety-aligned LLMs can effectively defend against normal harmful queries, they remain vulnerable to such attacks. Existing defense methods primarily rely on fine-tuning or input modification, which often suffer from limited generalization and reduced utility. To address this, we introduce DETAM, a finetuning-free defense approach that improves the defensive capabilities against jailbreak attacks of LLMs via targeted attention modification. Specifically, we analyze the differences in attention scores between successful and unsuccessful defenses to identify the attention heads sensitive to jailbreak attacks. During inference, we reallocate attention to emphasize the user's core intention, minimizing interference from attack tokens. Our experimental results demonstrate that DETAM outperforms various baselines in jailbreak defense and exhibits robust generalization across different attacks and models, maintaining its effectiveness even on in-the-wild jailbreak data. Furthermore, in evaluating the model's utility, we incorporated over-defense datasets, which further validate the superior performance of our approach. The code will be released immediately upon acceptance.

### Zero-Shot Industrial Anomaly Segmentation with Image-Aware Prompt   Generation
**Authors**: SoYoung Park, Hyewon Lee, Mingyu Choi, Seunghoon Han, Jong-Ryul Lee, Sungsu Lim, Tae-Ho Kim

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T08:58:40Z

**Summary**: Anomaly segmentation is essential for industrial quality, maintenance, and stability. Existing text-guided zero-shot anomaly segmentation models are effective but rely on fixed prompts, limiting adaptability in diverse industrial scenarios. This highlights the need for flexible, context-aware prompting strategies. We propose Image-Aware Prompt Anomaly Segmentation (IAP-AS), which enhances anomaly segmentation by generating dynamic, context-aware prompts using an image tagging model and a large language model (LLM). IAP-AS extracts object attributes from images to generate context-aware prompts, improving adaptability and generalization in dynamic and unstructured industrial environments. In our experiments, IAP-AS improves the F1-max metric by up to 10%, demonstrating superior adaptability and generalization. It provides a scalable solution for anomaly segmentation across industries

### Integrating LLMs for Grading and Appeal Resolution in Computer Science   Education
**Authors**: I. Aytutuldu, O. Yol, Y. S. Akgul

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T08:49:45Z

**Summary**: This study explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the grading and appeal resolution process in computer science education. We introduce AI-PAT, an AI-powered assessment tool that leverages LLMs to evaluate computer science exams, generate feedback, and address student appeals. AI-PAT was used to assess over 850 exam submissions and handle 185 appeal cases. Our multi-model comparison (ChatGPT, Gemini) reveals strong correlations between model outputs, though significant variability persists depending on configuration and prompt design. Human graders, while internally consistent, showed notable inter-rater disagreement, further highlighting subjectivity in manual evaluation. The appeal process led to grade changes in 74% of cases, indicating the need for continued refinement of AI evaluation strategies. While students appreciated the speed and detail of AI feedback, survey responses revealed trust and fairness concerns. We conclude that AI-PAT offers scalable benefits for formative assessment and feedback, but must be accompanied by transparent grading rubrics, human oversight, and appeal mechanisms to ensure equitable outcomes.

### GaGA: Towards Interactive Global Geolocation Assistant
**Authors**: Zhiyang Dou, Zipeng Wang, Xumeng Han, Guorong Li, Zhipei Huang, Zhenjun Han

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T08:47:39Z

**Summary**: Global geolocation, which seeks to predict the geographical location of images captured anywhere in the world, is one of the most challenging tasks in the field of computer vision. In this paper, we introduce an innovative interactive global geolocation assistant named GaGA, built upon the flourishing large vision-language models (LVLMs). GaGA uncovers geographical clues within images and combines them with the extensive world knowledge embedded in LVLMs to determine the geolocations while also providing justifications and explanations for the prediction results. We further designed a novel interactive geolocation method that surpasses traditional static inference approaches. It allows users to intervene, correct, or provide clues for the predictions, making the model more flexible and practical. The development of GaGA relies on the newly proposed Multi-modal Global Geolocation (MG-Geo) dataset, a comprehensive collection of 5 million high-quality image-text pairs. GaGA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GWS15k dataset, improving accuracy by 4.57% at the country level and 2.92% at the city level, setting a new benchmark. These advancements represent a significant leap forward in developing highly accurate, interactive geolocation systems with global applicability.

### Finding Flawed Fictions: Evaluating Complex Reasoning in Language Models   via Plot Hole Detection
**Authors**: Kabir Ahuja, Melanie Sclar, Yulia Tsvetkov

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T08:44:04Z

**Summary**: Stories are a fundamental aspect of human experience. Engaging deeply with stories and spotting plot holes -- inconsistencies in a storyline that break the internal logic or rules of a story's world -- requires nuanced reasoning skills, including tracking entities and events and their interplay, abstract thinking, pragmatic narrative understanding, commonsense and social reasoning, and theory of mind. As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate, interpret, and modify text, rigorously assessing their narrative consistency and deeper language understanding becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on surface-level comprehension. In this work, we propose plot hole detection in stories as a proxy to evaluate language understanding and reasoning in LLMs. We introduce FlawedFictionsMaker, a novel algorithm to controllably and carefully synthesize plot holes in human-written stories. Using this algorithm, we construct a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' plot hole detection abilities in stories -- FlawedFictions -- , which is robust to contamination, with human filtering ensuring high quality. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle in accurately solving FlawedFictions regardless of the reasoning effort allowed, with performance significantly degrading as story length increases. Finally, we show that LLM-based story summarization and story generation are prone to introducing plot holes, with more than 50% and 100% increases in plot hole detection rates with respect to human-written originals.

**Authors**: Guanrou Yang, Chen Yang, Qian Chen, Ziyang Ma, Wenxi Chen, Wen Wang, Tianrui Wang, Yifan Yang, Zhikang Niu, Wenrui Liu, Fan Yu, Zhihao Du, Zhifu Gao, ShiLiang Zhang, Xie Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T08:18:11Z

**Summary**: Human speech goes beyond the mere transfer of information; it is a profound exchange of emotions and a connection between individuals. While Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling the emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose EmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained freestyle natural language emotion control, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme tokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) and chain-of-modality (CoM) techniques. Besides, we introduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring expressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language descriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English EmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese Secap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability of existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human perceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and Gemini to assess emotional speech. Demo samples are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EmoVoice-DF55. Dataset, code, and checkpoints will be released.

### StaICC: Standardized Evaluation for Classification Task in In-context   Learning
**Authors**: Hakaze Cho, Naoya Inoue

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T08:09:26Z

**Summary**: Classification tasks are widely investigated in the In-Context Learning (ICL) paradigm. However, current efforts are evaluated on disjoint benchmarks and settings, while their performances are significantly influenced by some trivial variables, such as prompt templates, data sampling, instructions, etc., which leads to significant inconsistencies in the results reported across various literature, preventing fair comparison or meta-analysis across different papers. Therefore, this paper proposes a standardized and easy-to-use evaluation toolkit (StaICC) for in-context classification. Including, for the normal classification task, we provide StaICC-Normal, selecting 10 widely used datasets, and generating prompts with a fixed form, to mitigate the variance among the experiment implementations. To enrich the usage of our benchmark, we also provide a sub-benchmark StaICC-Diag for diagnosing ICL from several aspects, aiming for a more robust inference processing.

### Towards Robust Alignment of Language Models: Distributionally   Robustifying Direct Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Junkang Wu, Yuexiang Xie, Zhengyi Yang, Jiancan Wu, Jiawei Chen, Jinyang Gao, Bolin Ding, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T08:05:53Z

**Summary**: This study addresses the challenge of noise in training datasets for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. We categorize noise into pointwise noise, which includes low-quality data points, and pairwise noise, which encompasses erroneous data pair associations that affect preference rankings. Utilizing Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), we enhance DPO's resilience to these types of noise. Our theoretical insights reveal that DPO inherently embeds DRO principles, conferring robustness to pointwise noise, with the regularization coefficient $\beta$ playing a critical role in its noise resistance. Extending this framework, we introduce Distributionally Robustifying DPO (Dr. DPO), which integrates pairwise robustness by optimizing against worst-case pairwise scenarios. The novel hyperparameter $\beta'$ in Dr. DPO allows for fine-tuned control over data pair reliability, providing a strategic balance between exploration and exploitation in noisy training environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Dr. DPO substantially improves the quality of generated text and response accuracy in preference datasets, showcasing enhanced performance in both noisy and noise-free settings. The code is available at https://github.com/junkangwu/Dr_DPO.

### SciLitLLM: How to Adapt LLMs for Scientific Literature Understanding
**Authors**: Sihang Li, Jin Huang, Jiaxi Zhuang, Yaorui Shi, Xiaochen Cai, Mingjun Xu, Xiang Wang, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke, Hengxing Cai

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:56:16Z

**Summary**: Scientific literature understanding is crucial for extracting targeted information and garnering insights, thereby significantly advancing scientific discovery. Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they face challenges in scientific literature understanding, primarily due to (1) a lack of scientific knowledge and (2) unfamiliarity with specialized scientific tasks.   To develop an LLM specialized in scientific literature understanding, we propose a hybrid strategy that integrates continual pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to simultaneously infuse scientific domain knowledge and enhance instruction-following capabilities for domain-specific tasks.cIn this process, we identify two key challenges: (1) constructing high-quality CPT corpora, and (2) generating diverse SFT instructions. We address these challenges through a meticulous pipeline, including PDF text extraction, parsing content error correction, quality filtering, and synthetic instruction creation. Applying this strategy, we present a suite of LLMs: SciLitLLM, specialized in scientific literature understanding. These models demonstrate promising performance on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.   Our contributions are threefold: (1) We present an effective framework that integrates CPT and SFT to adapt LLMs to scientific literature understanding, which can also be easily adapted to other domains. (2) We propose an LLM-based synthesis method to generate diverse and high-quality scientific instructions, resulting in a new instruction set -- SciLitIns -- for supervised fine-tuning in less-represented scientific domains. (3) SciLitLLM achieves promising performance improvements on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.

### CoT-RAG: Integrating Chain of Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation   to Enhance Reasoning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Feiyang Li, Peng Fang, Zhan Shi, Arijit Khan, Fang Wang, Dan Feng, Weihao Wang, Xin Zhang, Yongjian Cui

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:55:09Z

**Summary**: While chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning improves the performance of large language models (LLMs) in complex tasks, it still has two main challenges: the low reliability of relying solely on LLMs to generate reasoning chains and the interference of natural language reasoning chains on the inference logic of LLMs. To address these issues, we propose CoT-RAG, a novel reasoning framework with three key designs: (i) Knowledge Graph-driven CoT Generation, featuring knowledge graphs to modulate reasoning chain generation of LLMs, thereby enhancing reasoning credibility; (ii) Learnable Knowledge Case-aware RAG, which incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into knowledge graphs to retrieve relevant sub-cases and sub-descriptions, providing LLMs with learnable information; (iii) Pseudo-Program Prompting Execution, which encourages LLMs to execute reasoning tasks in pseudo-programs with greater logical rigor. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on nine public datasets, covering three reasoning problems. Compared with the-state-of-the-art methods, CoT-RAG exhibits a significant accuracy improvement, ranging from 4.0% to 23.0%. Furthermore, testing on four domain-specific datasets, CoT-RAG shows remarkable accuracy and efficient execution, highlighting its strong practical applicability and scalability.

### Large Language Models are Good Multi-lingual Learners : When LLMs Meet   Cross-lingual Prompts
**Authors**: Teng Wang, Zhenqi He, Wing-Yin Yu, Xiaojin Fu, Xiongwei Han

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:50:08Z

**Summary**: With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), generating rule-based data for real-world applications has become more accessible. Due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language and the complexity of rule sets, especially in long contexts, LLMs often struggle to follow all specified rules, frequently omitting at least one. To enhance the reasoning and understanding of LLMs on long and complex contexts, we propose a novel prompting strategy Multi-Lingual Prompt, namely MLPrompt, which automatically translates the error-prone rule that an LLM struggles to follow into another language, thus drawing greater attention to it. Experimental results on public datasets across various tasks have shown MLPrompt can outperform state-of-the-art prompting methods such as Chain of Thought, Tree of Thought, and Self-Consistency. Additionally, we introduce a framework integrating MLPrompt with an auto-checking mechanism for structured data generation, with a specific case study in text-to-MIP instances. Further, we extend the proposed framework for text-to-SQL to demonstrate its generation ability towards structured data synthesis.

### AgentCF++: Memory-enhanced LLM-based Agents for Popularity-aware   Cross-domain Recommendations
**Authors**: Jiahao Liu, Shengkang Gu, Dongsheng Li, Guangping Zhang, Mingzhe Han, Hansu Gu, Peng Zhang, Tun Lu, Li Shang, Ning Gu

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:48:48Z

**Summary**: LLM-based user agents, which simulate user interaction behavior, are emerging as a promising approach to enhancing recommender systems. In real-world scenarios, users' interactions often exhibit cross-domain characteristics and are influenced by others. However, the memory design in current methods causes user agents to introduce significant irrelevant information during decision-making in cross-domain scenarios and makes them unable to recognize the influence of other users' interactions, such as popularity factors. To tackle this issue, we propose a dual-layer memory architecture combined with a two-step fusion mechanism. This design avoids irrelevant information during decision-making while ensuring effective integration of cross-domain preferences. We also introduce the concepts of interest groups and group-shared memory to better capture the influence of popularity factors on users with similar interests. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of AgentCF++. Our code is available at https://github.com/jhliu0807/AgentCF-plus.

### PennyLang: Pioneering LLM-Based Quantum Code Generation with a Novel   PennyLane-Centric Dataset
**Authors**: Abdul Basit, Nouhaila Innan, Haider Asif, Minghao Shao, Muhammad Kashif, Alberto Marchisio, Muhammad Shafique

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:46:25Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer remarkable capabilities in code generation, natural language processing, and domain-specific reasoning. However, their application in quantum software development remains underexplored, particularly for PennyLane-a leading framework for hybrid quantum-classical computing. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, high-quality dataset comprising 3,347 PennyLane-specific quantum code samples and contextual descriptions, specifically curated to support LLM training and fine-tuning for quantum code assistance. Our contributions are threefold: (1) the automatic construction and open-source release of a comprehensive PennyLane dataset derived from textbooks, official documentation, and open-source repositories; (2) a structured methodology for data curation, annotation, and formatting to enhance LLM usability and relevance; and (3) a rigorous evaluation of code generation capabilities using both baseline Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a GraphRAG-enhanced pipeline. Using the PennyLang framework, we demonstrate that GraphRAG, when applied to a GPT-4o Mini model, substantially outperforms standard prompting and baseline RAG. Accuracy improves from 20.5% (without RAG) to 58.2% with GraphRAG, showcasing its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving code correctness in quantum programming tasks. Compared to prior efforts focused largely on Qiskit, our work expands LLM-based assistance to the PennyLane ecosystem, contributing practical tools and reproducible methodologies for advancing AI-assisted quantum software development.

### Improving LLM-powered Recommendations with Personalized Information
**Authors**: Jiahao Liu, Xueshuo Yan, Dongsheng Li, Guangping Zhang, Hansu Gu, Peng Zhang, Tun Lu, Li Shang, Ning Gu

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:45:55Z

**Summary**: Due to the lack of explicit reasoning modeling, existing LLM-powered recommendations fail to leverage LLMs' reasoning capabilities effectively. In this paper, we propose a pipeline called CoT-Rec, which integrates two key Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes -- user preference analysis and item perception analysis -- into LLM-powered recommendations, thereby enhancing the utilization of LLMs' reasoning abilities. CoT-Rec consists of two stages: (1) personalized information extraction, where user preferences and item perception are extracted, and (2) personalized information utilization, where this information is incorporated into the LLM-powered recommendation process. Experimental results demonstrate that CoT-Rec shows potential for improving LLM-powered recommendations. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/jhliu0807/CoT-Rec.

### Exponential rate of epidemic spreading on complex networks
**Authors**: Samuel Cure, Florian G. Pflug, Simone Pigolotti

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:31:11Z

**Summary**: The initial phase of an epidemic is often characterized by an exponential increase in the number of infected individuals. In this paper, we predict the exponential spreading rate of an epidemic on a complex network. We first find an expression of the reproduction number for a network, based on the degree distribution, the network assortativity, and the level of clustering. We then connect this reproduction number and the disease infectiousness to the spreading rate. Our result holds for a broad range of networks, apart from networks with very broad degree distribution, where no clear exponential regime is present. Our theory bridges the gap between classic epidemiology and the theory of complex networks, with broad implications for model inference and policy making.

### Bayesian Model Averaging in Causal Instrumental Variable Models
**Authors**: Gregor Steiner, Mark Steel

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:18:51Z

**Summary**: Instrumental variables are a popular tool to infer causal effects under unobserved confounding, but choosing suitable instruments is challenging in practice. We propose gIVBMA, a Bayesian model averaging procedure that addresses this challenge by averaging across different sets of instrumental variables and covariates in a structural equation model. Our approach extends previous work through a scale-invariant prior structure and accommodates non-Gaussian outcomes and treatments, offering greater flexibility than existing methods. The computational strategy uses conditional Bayes factors to update models separately for the outcome and treatments. We prove that this model selection procedure is consistent. By explicitly accounting for model uncertainty, gIVBMA allows instruments and covariates to switch roles and provides robustness against invalid instruments. In simulation experiments, gIVBMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate its usefulness in two empirical applications: the effects of malaria and institutions on income per capita and the returns to schooling. A software implementation of gIVBMA is available in Julia.

### Adversarial Style Augmentation via Large Language Model for Robust Fake   News Detection
**Authors**: Sungwon Park, Sungwon Han, Xing Xie, Jae-Gil Lee, Meeyoung Cha

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:15:33Z

**Summary**: The spread of fake news harms individuals and presents a critical social challenge that must be addressed. Although numerous algorithmic and insightful features have been developed to detect fake news, many of these features can be manipulated with style-conversion attacks, especially with the emergence of advanced language models, making it more difficult to differentiate from genuine news. This study proposes adversarial style augmentation, AdStyle, designed to train a fake news detector that remains robust against various style-conversion attacks. The primary mechanism involves the strategic use of LLMs to automatically generate a diverse and coherent array of style-conversion attack prompts, enhancing the generation of particularly challenging prompts for the detector. Experiments indicate that our augmentation strategy significantly improves robustness and detection performance when evaluated on fake news benchmark datasets.

### Large Language Models for Validating Network Protocol Parsers
**Authors**: Mingwei Zheng, Danning Xie, Xiangyu Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:09:56Z

**Summary**: Network protocol parsers are essential for enabling correct and secure communication between devices. Bugs in these parsers can introduce critical vulnerabilities, including memory corruption, information leakage, and denial-of-service attacks. An intuitive way to assess parser correctness is to compare the implementation with its official protocol standard. However, this comparison is challenging because protocol standards are typically written in natural language, whereas implementations are in source code. Existing methods like model checking, fuzzing, and differential testing have been used to find parsing bugs, but they either require significant manual effort or ignore the protocol standards, limiting their ability to detect semantic violations. To enable more automated validation of parser implementations against protocol standards, we propose PARVAL, a multi-agent framework built on large language models (LLMs). PARVAL leverages the capabilities of LLMs to understand both natural language and code. It transforms both protocol standards and their implementations into a unified intermediate representation, referred to as format specifications, and performs a differential comparison to uncover inconsistencies. We evaluate PARVAL on the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol. Our experiments demonstrate that PARVAL successfully identifies inconsistencies between the implementation and its RFC standard, achieving a low false positive rate of 5.6%. PARVAL uncovers seven unique bugs, including five previously unknown issues.

### NeuroNAS: Enhancing Efficiency of Neuromorphic In-Memory Computing for   Intelligent Mobile Agents through Hardware-Aware Spiking Neural Architecture   Search
**Authors**: Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, Muhammad Shafique

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:00:39Z

**Summary**: Intelligent mobile agents (e.g., UGVs and UAVs) typically demand low power/energy consumption when solving their machine learning (ML)-based tasks, since they are usually powered by portable batteries with limited capacity. A potential solution is employing neuromorphic computing with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which leverages event-based computation to enable ultra-low power/energy ML algorithms. To maximize the performance efficiency of SNN inference, the In-Memory Computing (IMC)-based hardware accelerators with emerging device technologies (e.g., RRAM) can be employed. However, SNN models are typically developed without considering constraints from the application and the underlying IMC hardware, thereby hindering SNNs from reaching their full potential in performance and efficiency. To address this, we propose NeuroNAS, a novel framework for developing energyefficient neuromorphic IMC for intelligent mobile agents using hardware-aware spiking neural architecture search (NAS), i.e., by quickly finding an SNN architecture that offers high accuracy under the given constraints (e.g., memory, area, latency, and energy consumption). Its key steps include: optimizing SNN operations to enable efficient NAS, employing quantization to minimize the memory footprint, developing an SNN architecture that facilitates an effective learning, and devising a systematic hardware-aware search algorithm to meet the constraints. Compared to the state-of-the-art techniques, NeuroNAS quickly finds SNN architectures (with 8bit weight precision) that maintain high accuracy by up to 6.6x search time speed-ups, while achieving up to 92% area savings, 1.2x latency improvements, 84% energy savings across different datasets (i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet-200); while the state-of-the-art fail to meet all constraints at once.

### Unified Parameter-Efficient Unlearning for LLMs
**Authors**: Chenlu Ding, Jiancan Wu, Yancheng Yuan, Jinda Lu, Kai Zhang, Alex Su, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T06:58:12Z

**Summary**: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, enabling advanced understanding and reasoning capabilities across a variety of tasks. Fine-tuning these models for specific domains, particularly through Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies like LoRA, has become a prevalent practice due to its efficiency. However, this raises significant privacy and security concerns, as models may inadvertently retain and disseminate sensitive or undesirable information. To address these issues, we introduce a novel instance-wise unlearning framework, LLMEraser, which systematically categorizes unlearning tasks and applies precise parameter adjustments using influence functions. Unlike traditional unlearning techniques that are often limited in scope and require extensive retraining, LLMEraser is designed to handle a broad spectrum of unlearning tasks without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LLMEraser excels in efficiently managing various unlearning scenarios while maintaining the overall integrity and efficacy of the models.

### Continuous-time filtering in Lie groups: estimation via the Fr{é}chet   mean of solutions to stochastic differential equations
**Authors**: Magalie Bénéfice, Marc Arnaudon, Audrey Giremus

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T06:45:30Z

**Summary**: We compute the Fr\'echet mean $\mathscr{E}_t$ of the solution $X_{t}$ to a continuous-time stochastic differential equation in a Lie group. It provides an estimator with minimal variance of $X_{t}$. We use it in the context of Kalman filtering and more precisely to infer rotation matrices. In this paper, we focus on the prediction step between two consecutive observations. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our assumptions on the model are minimal.

### Prejudge-Before-Think: Enhancing Large Language Models at Test-Time by   Process Prejudge Reasoning
**Authors**: Jianing Wang, Jin Jiang, Yang Liu, Mengdi Zhang, Xunliang Cai

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T06:42:30Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a new \emph{process prejudge} strategy in LLM reasoning to demonstrate that bootstrapping with process prejudge allows the LLM to adaptively anticipate the errors encountered when advancing the subsequent reasoning steps, similar to people sometimes pausing to think about what mistakes may occur and how to avoid them, rather than relying solely on trial and error. Specifically, we define a prejudge node in the rationale, which represents a reasoning step, with at least one step that follows the prejudge node that has no paths toward the correct answer. To synthesize the prejudge reasoning process, we present an automated reasoning framework with a dynamic tree-searching strategy. This framework requires only one LLM to perform answer judging, response critiquing, prejudge generation, and thought completion. Furthermore, we develop a two-phase training mechanism with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to further enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Experimental results from competition-level complex reasoning demonstrate that our method can teach the model to prejudge before thinking and significantly enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs. Code and data is released at https://github.com/wjn1996/Prejudge-Before-Think.

### Monitor and Recover: A Paradigm for Future Research on Distribution   Shift in Learning-Enabled Cyber-Physical Systems
**Authors**: Vivian Lin, Insup Lee

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T05:48:35Z

**Summary**: With the known vulnerability of neural networks to distribution shift, maintaining reliability in learning-enabled cyber-physical systems poses a salient challenge. In response, many existing methods adopt a detect and abstain methodology, aiming to detect distribution shift at inference time so that the learning-enabled component can abstain from decision-making. This approach, however, has limited use in real-world applications. We instead propose a monitor and recover paradigm as a promising direction for future research. This philosophy emphasizes 1) robust safety monitoring instead of distribution shift detection and 2) distribution shift recovery instead of abstention. We discuss two examples from our recent work.

### LLM Sensitivity Evaluation Framework for Clinical Diagnosis
**Authors**: Chenwei Yan, Xiangling Fu, Yuxuan Xiong, Tianyi Wang, Siu Cheung Hui, Ji Wu, Xien Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T05:35:11Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various domains. However, for clinical diagnosis, higher expectations are required for LLM's reliability and sensitivity: thinking like physicians and remaining sensitive to key medical information that affects diagnostic reasoning, as subtle variations can lead to different diagnosis results. Yet, existing works focus mainly on investigating the sensitivity of LLMs to irrelevant context and overlook the importance of key information. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs, i.e. GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, Claude3 and LLaMA2-7b, to key medical information by introducing different perturbation strategies. The evaluation results highlight the limitations of current LLMs in remaining sensitive to key medical information for diagnostic decision-making. The evolution of LLMs must focus on improving their reliability, enhancing their ability to be sensitive to key information, and effectively utilizing this information. These improvements will enhance human trust in LLMs and facilitate their practical application in real-world scenarios. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/chenwei23333/DiagnosisQA.

### Everything You Wanted to Know About LLM-based Vulnerability Detection   But Were Afraid to Ask
**Authors**: Yue Li, Xiao Li, Hao Wu, Minghui Xu, Yue Zhang, Xiuzhen Cheng, Fengyuan Xu, Sheng Zhong

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T05:32:47Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models are a promising tool for automated vulnerability detection, thanks to their success in code generation and repair. However, despite widespread adoption, a critical question remains: Are LLMs truly effective at detecting real-world vulnerabilities? Current evaluations, which often assess models on isolated functions or files, ignore the broader execution and data-flow context essential for understanding vulnerabilities. This oversight leads to two types of misleading outcomes: incorrect conclusions and flawed rationales, collectively undermining the reliability of prior assessments. Therefore, in this paper, we challenge three widely held community beliefs: that LLMs are (i) unreliable, (ii) insensitive to code patches, and (iii) performance-plateaued across model scales. We argue that these beliefs are artifacts of context-deprived evaluations. To address this, we propose CORRECT (Context-Rich Reasoning Evaluation of Code with Trust), a new evaluation framework that systematically incorporates contextual information into LLM-based vulnerability detection. We construct a context-rich dataset of 2,000 vulnerable-patched program pairs spanning 99 CWEs and evaluate 13 LLMs across four model families. Our framework elicits both binary predictions and natural-language rationales, which are further validated using LLM-as-a-judge techniques. Our findings overturn existing misconceptions. When provided with sufficient context, SOTA LLMs achieve significantly improved performance (e.g., 0.7 F1-score on key CWEs), with 0.8 precision. We show that most false positives stem from reasoning errors rather than misclassification, and that while model and test-time scaling improve performance, they introduce diminishing returns and trade-offs in recall. Finally, we uncover new flaws in current LLM-based detection systems, such as limited generalization and overthinking biases.

### CodeVisionary: An Agent-based Framework for Evaluating Large Language   Models in Code Generation
**Authors**: Xinchen Wang, Pengfei Gao, Chao Peng, Ruida Hu, Cuiyun Gao

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T05:26:32Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, underscoring the critical need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation. Existing evaluation approaches fall into three categories, including human-centered, metric-based, and LLM-based. Considering that human-centered approaches are labour-intensive and metric-based ones overly rely on reference answers, LLM-based approaches are gaining increasing attention due to their stronger contextual understanding capabilities and superior efficiency. However, the performance of LLM-based approaches remains limited due to: (1) lack of multisource domain knowledge, and (2) insufficient comprehension of complex code.   To mitigate the limitations, we propose CodeVisionary, the first LLM-based agent framework for evaluating LLMs in code generation. CodeVisionary consists of two stages: (1) Multiscore knowledge analysis stage, which aims to gather multisource and comprehensive domain knowledge by formulating and executing a stepwise evaluation plan. (2) Negotiation-based scoring stage, which involves multiple judges engaging in discussions to better comprehend the complex code and reach a consensus on the evaluation score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeVisionary achieves the best performance for evaluating LLMs in code generation, outperforming the best baseline methods with average improvements of 0.202, 0.139, and 0.117 in Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall-Tau coefficients, respectively. Besides, CodeVisionary provides detailed evaluation reports, which assist developers in identifying shortcomings and making improvements. The resources of CodeVisionary are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CodeVisionary.

### From Large to Super-Tiny: End-to-End Optimization for Cost-Efficient   LLMs
**Authors**: Jiliang Ni, Jiachen Pu, Zhongyi Yang, Kun Zhou, Hui Wang, Xiaoliang Xiao, Dakui Wang, Xin Li, Jingfeng Luo, Conggang Hu

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T05:25:22Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence by optimizing traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines, improving performance and generalization. This has spurred their integration into various systems. Many NLP systems, including ours, employ a "one-stage" pipeline directly incorporating LLMs. While effective, this approach incurs substantial costs and latency due to the need for large model parameters to achieve satisfactory outcomes. This paper introduces a three-stage cost-efficient end-to-end LLM deployment pipeline-including prototyping, knowledge transfer, and model compression-to tackle the cost-performance dilemma in LLM-based frameworks. Our approach yields a super tiny model optimized for cost and performance in online systems, simplifying the system architecture. Initially, by transforming complex tasks into a function call-based LLM-driven pipeline, an optimal performance prototype system is constructed to produce high-quality data as a teacher model. The second stage combine techniques like rejection fine-tuning, reinforcement learning and knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge to a smaller 0.5B student model, delivering effective performance at minimal cost. The final stage applies quantization and pruning to extremely compress model to 0.4B, achieving ultra-low latency and cost. The framework's modular design and cross-domain capabilities suggest potential applicability in other NLP areas.

### HMPE:HeatMap Embedding for Efficient Transformer-Based Small Object   Detection
**Authors**: YangChen Zeng

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T05:24:08Z

**Summary**: Current Transformer-based methods for small object detection continue emerging, yet they have still exhibited significant shortcomings. This paper introduces HeatMap Position Embedding (HMPE), a novel Transformer Optimization technique that enhances object detection performance by dynamically integrating positional encoding with semantic detection information through heatmap-guided adaptive learning.We also innovatively visualize the HMPE method, offering clear visualization of embedded information for parameter fine-tuning.We then create Multi-Scale ObjectBox-Heatmap Fusion Encoder (MOHFE) and HeatMap Induced High-Quality Queries for Decoder (HIDQ) modules. These are designed for the encoder and decoder, respectively, to generate high-quality queries and reduce background noise queries.Using both heatmap embedding and Linear-Snake Conv(LSConv) feature engineering, we enhance the embedding of massively diverse small object categories and reduced the decoder multihead layers, thereby accelerating both inference and training.In the generalization experiments, our approach outperforme the baseline mAP by 1.9% on the small object dataset (NWPU VHR-10) and by 1.2% on the general dataset (PASCAL VOC). By employing HMPE-enhanced embedding, we are able to reduce the number of decoder layers from eight to a minimum of three, significantly decreasing both inference and training costs.

### Efficient Estimation under Multiple Missing Patterns via Balancing   Weights
**Authors**: Jianing Dong, Raymond K. W. Wong, Kwun Chuen Gary Chan

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T05:19:19Z

**Summary**: As one of the most commonly seen data challenges, missing data, in particular, multiple, non-monotone missing patterns, complicates estimation and inference due to the fact that missingness mechanisms are often not missing at random, and conventional methods cannot be applied. Pattern graphs have recently been proposed as a tool to systematically relate various observed patterns in the sample. We extend its scope to the estimation of parameters defined by moment equations, including common regression models, via solving weighted estimating equations with weights constructed using a sequential balancing approach. These novel weights are carefully crafted to address the instability issue of the straightforward approach based on local balancing. We derive the efficiency bound for the model parameters and show that our proposed method, albeit relatively simple, is asymptotically efficient. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method, and real-data applications illustrate how the results are robust to the choice of identification assumptions.

### If LLMs Would Just Look: Simple Line-by-line Checking Improves   Vulnerability Localization
**Authors**: Yue Li, Xiao Li, Hao Wu, Yue Zhang, Xiuzhen Cheng, Yating Liu, Fengyuan Xu, Sheng Zhong

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T04:46:00Z

**Summary**: The rapid expansion of software systems and the growing number of reported vulnerabilities have emphasized the importance of accurately identifying vulnerable code segments. Traditional methods for vulnerability localization, such as manual code audits or rule-based tools, are often time-consuming and limited in scope, typically focusing on specific programming languages or types of vulnerabilities. In recent years, the introduction of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT and LLaMA has opened new possibilities for automating vulnerability detection. However, while LLMs show promise in this area, they face challenges, particularly in maintaining accuracy over longer code contexts. This paper introduces LOVA, a novel framework leveraging the self-attention mechanisms inherent in LLMs to enhance vulnerability localization. Our key insight is that self-attention mechanisms assign varying importance to different parts of the input, making it possible to track how much attention the model focuses on specific lines of code. In the context of vulnerability localization, the hypothesis is that vulnerable lines of code will naturally attract higher attention weights because they have a greater influence on the model's output. By systematically tracking changes in attention weights and focusing on specific lines of code, LOVA improves the precision of identifying vulnerable lines across various programming languages. Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate that LOVA significantly outperforms existing LLM-based approaches, achieving up to a 5.3x improvement in F1-scores. LOVA also demonstrated strong scalability, with up to a 14.6x improvement in smart contract vulnerability localization across languages like C, Python, Java, and Solidity. Its robustness was proven through consistent performance across different LLM architectures.

### Chain-of-Thought Textual Reasoning for Few-shot Temporal Action   Localization
**Authors**: Hongwei Ji, Wulian Yun, Mengshi Qi, Huadong Ma

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T04:35:35Z

**Summary**: Traditional temporal action localization (TAL) methods rely on large amounts of detailed annotated data, whereas few-shot TAL reduces this dependence by using only a few training samples to identify unseen action categories. However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark.

## Keyword: LLM Deployment 
 ### Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in   LLMs Beyond the Base Model?
**Authors**: Yang Yue, Zhiqi Chen, Rui Lu, Andrew Zhao, Zhaokai Wang, Yang Yue, Shiji Song, Gao Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T17:59:56Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in mathematics and programming tasks. It is widely believed that RLVR enables LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities that exceed corresponding base models' capacity. In this study, however, we critically re-examines this assumption by measuring the pass@\textit{k} metric with large values of \textit{k} to explore the reasoning capability boundary of the models across a wide range of model families and benchmarks. Surprisingly, the RL does \emph{not}, in fact, elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RL-trained models outperform their base models at smaller values of $k$ (\eg, $k$=1), base models can achieve a comparable or even higher pass@$k$ score compared to their RL counterparts at large $k$ values. The reasoning paths generated by RL-trained models are already included in the base models' sampling distribution, suggesting that most reasoning abilities manifested in RL-trained models are already obtained by base models. Further analysis shows that RL training boosts the performance by biasing the model's output distribution toward paths that are more likely to yield rewards, therefore sampling correct responses more efficiently. But this also results in a narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. Similar results are observed in visual reasoning tasks trained with RLVR. Moreover, we find that distillation can genuinely introduce new knowledge into the model, different from RLVR. These findings underscore a critical limitation of RLVR in advancing LLM reasoning abilities which requires us to fundamentally rethink the impact of RL training in reasoning LLMs and the need of a better paradigm.

### Science Hierarchography: Hierarchical Organization of Science Literature
**Authors**: Muhan Gao, Jash Shah, Weiqi Wang, Daniel Khashabi

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T17:59:29Z

**Summary**: Scientific knowledge is growing rapidly, making it challenging to track progress and high-level conceptual links across broad disciplines. While existing tools like citation networks and search engines make it easy to access a few related papers, they fundamentally lack the flexible abstraction needed to represent the density of activity in various scientific subfields. We motivate SCIENCE HIERARCHOGRAPHY, the goal of organizing scientific literature into a high-quality hierarchical structure that allows for the categorization of scientific work across varying levels of abstraction, from very broad fields to very specific studies. Such a representation can provide insights into which fields are well-explored and which are under-explored. To achieve the goals of SCIENCE HIERARCHOGRAPHY, we develop a range of algorithms. Our primary approach combines fast embedding-based clustering with LLM-based prompting to balance the computational efficiency of embedding methods with the semantic precision offered by LLM prompting. We demonstrate that this approach offers the best trade-off between quality and speed compared to methods that heavily rely on LLM prompting, such as iterative tree construction with LLMs. To better reflect the interdisciplinary and multifaceted nature of research papers, our hierarchy captures multiple dimensions of categorization beyond simple topic labels. We evaluate the utility of our framework by assessing how effectively an LLM-based agent can locate target papers using the hierarchy. Results show that this structured approach enhances interpretability, supports trend discovery, and offers an alternative pathway for exploring scientific literature beyond traditional search methods.

### Not All Rollouts are Useful: Down-Sampling Rollouts in LLM Reinforcement   Learning
**Authors**: Yixuan Even Xu, Yash Savani, Fei Fang, Zico Kolter

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T17:49:55Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models, but faces a fundamental asymmetry in computation and memory requirements: inference is embarrassingly parallel with a minimal memory footprint, while policy updates require extensive synchronization and are memory-intensive. To address this asymmetry, we introduce PODS (Policy Optimization with Down-Sampling), a framework that strategically decouples these phases by generating numerous rollouts in parallel but updating only on an informative subset. Within this framework, we develop max-variance down-sampling, a theoretically motivated method that selects rollouts with maximally diverse reward signals. We prove that this approach has an efficient algorithmic solution, and empirically demonstrate that GRPO with PODS using max-variance down-sampling achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on the GSM8K benchmark.

**Summary**: While understanding the knowledge boundaries of LLMs is crucial to prevent hallucination, research on knowledge boundaries of LLMs has predominantly focused on English. In this work, we present the first study to analyze how LLMs recognize knowledge boundaries across different languages by probing their internal representations when processing known and unknown questions in multiple languages. Our empirical studies reveal three key findings: 1) LLMs' perceptions of knowledge boundaries are encoded in the middle to middle-upper layers across different languages. 2) Language differences in knowledge boundary perception follow a linear structure, which motivates our proposal of a training-free alignment method that effectively transfers knowledge boundary perception ability across languages, thereby helping reduce hallucination risk in low-resource languages; 3) Fine-tuning on bilingual question pair translation further enhances LLMs' recognition of knowledge boundaries across languages. Given the absence of standard testbeds for cross-lingual knowledge boundary analysis, we construct a multilingual evaluation suite comprising three representative types of knowledge boundary data. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/LLM-Multilingual-Knowledge-Boundaries.

### A-MEM: Agentic Memory for LLM Agents
**Authors**: Wujiang Xu, Kai Mei, Hang Gao, Juntao Tan, Zujie Liang, Yongfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T17:26:57Z

**Summary**: While large language model (LLM) agents can effectively use external tools for complex real-world tasks, they require memory systems to leverage historical experiences. Current memory systems enable basic storage and retrieval but lack sophisticated memory organization, despite recent attempts to incorporate graph databases. Moreover, these systems' fixed operations and structures limit their adaptability across diverse tasks. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel agentic memory system for LLM agents that can dynamically organize memories in an agentic way. Following the basic principles of the Zettelkasten method, we designed our memory system to create interconnected knowledge networks through dynamic indexing and linking. When a new memory is added, we generate a comprehensive note containing multiple structured attributes, including contextual descriptions, keywords, and tags. The system then analyzes historical memories to identify relevant connections, establishing links where meaningful similarities exist. Additionally, this process enables memory evolution - as new memories are integrated, they can trigger updates to the contextual representations and attributes of existing historical memories, allowing the memory network to continuously refine its understanding. Our approach combines the structured organization principles of Zettelkasten with the flexibility of agent-driven decision making, allowing for more adaptive and context-aware memory management. Empirical experiments on six foundation models show superior improvement against existing SOTA baselines. The source code for evaluating performance is available at https://github.com/WujiangXu/AgenticMemory, while the source code of agentic memory system is available at https://github.com/agiresearch/A-mem.

### DiffOG: Differentiable Policy Trajectory Optimization with   Generalizability
**Authors**: Zhengtong Xu, Zichen Miao, Qiang Qiu, Zhe Zhang, Yu She

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T17:20:27Z

**Summary**: Imitation learning-based visuomotor policies excel at manipulation tasks but often produce suboptimal action trajectories compared to model-based methods. Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. Visuomotor policies enhanced by DiffOG generate smoother, constraint-compliant action trajectories in a more interpretable way. DiffOG exhibits strong generalization capabilities and high flexibility. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.

**Authors**: Guangyi Liu, Pengxiang Zhao, Liang Liu, Zhiming Chen, Yuxiang Chai, Shuai Ren, Hao Wang, Shibo He, Wenchao Meng

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T17:13:34Z

**Summary**: Mobile GUI agents show promise in automating tasks but face generalization challenges in diverse real-world scenarios. Traditional approaches using pre-training or fine-tuning with massive datasets struggle with the diversity of mobile applications and user-specific tasks. We propose enhancing mobile GUI agent capabilities through human demonstrations, focusing on improving performance in unseen scenarios rather than pursuing universal generalization through larger datasets. To realize this paradigm, we introduce LearnGUI, the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed for studying demonstration-based learning in mobile GUI agents, comprising 2,252 offline tasks and 101 online tasks with high-quality human demonstrations. We further develop LearnAct, a sophisticated multi-agent framework that automatically extracts knowledge from demonstrations to enhance task completion. This framework integrates three specialized agents: DemoParser for knowledge extraction, KnowSeeker for relevant knowledge retrieval, and ActExecutor for demonstration-enhanced task execution. Our experimental results show significant performance gains in both offline and online evaluations. In offline assessments, a single demonstration improves model performance, increasing Gemini-1.5-Pro's accuracy from 19.3% to 51.7%. In online evaluations, our framework enhances UI-TARS-7B-SFT's task success rate from 18.1% to 32.8%. LearnAct framework and LearnGUI benchmark establish demonstration-based learning as a promising direction for more adaptable, personalized, and deployable mobile GUI agents.

### From Token to Line: Enhancing Code Generation with a Long-Term   Perspective
**Authors**: Tingwei Lu, Yangning Li, Liyuan Wang, Binghuai Lin, Jiwei Tang, Wanshi Xu, Hai-Tao Zheng, Yinghui Li, Bingxu An, Zhao Wei, Yong Xu

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T17:03:01Z

**Summary**: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly promoted the development of code generation task, sparking a surge in pertinent literature. Current research is hindered by redundant generation results and a tendency to overfit local patterns in the short term. Although existing studies attempt to alleviate the issue by adopting a multi-token prediction strategy, there remains limited focus on choosing the appropriate processing length for generations. By analyzing the attention between tokens during the generation process of LLMs, it can be observed that the high spikes of the attention scores typically appear at the end of lines. This insight suggests that it is reasonable to treat each line of code as a fundamental processing unit and generate them sequentially. Inspired by this, we propose the \textbf{LSR-MCTS} algorithm, which leverages MCTS to determine the code line-by-line and select the optimal path. Further, we integrate a self-refine mechanism at each node to enhance diversity and generate higher-quality programs through error correction. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analyses on three public coding benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art performance approaches.

### SysCaps: Language Interfaces for Simulation Surrogates of Complex   Systems
**Authors**: Patrick Emami, Zhaonan Li, Saumya Sinha, Truc Nguyen

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T16:49:44Z

**Summary**: Surrogate models are used to predict the behavior of complex energy systems that are too expensive to simulate with traditional numerical methods. Our work introduces the use of language descriptions, which we call ``system captions'' or SysCaps, to interface with such surrogates. We argue that interacting with surrogates through text, particularly natural language, makes these models more accessible for both experts and non-experts. We introduce a lightweight multimodal text and timeseries regression model and a training pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality captions from simulation metadata. Our experiments on two real-world simulators of buildings and wind farms show that our SysCaps-augmented surrogates have better accuracy on held-out systems than traditional methods while enjoying new generalization abilities, such as handling semantically related descriptions of the same test system. Additional experiments also highlight the potential of SysCaps to unlock language-driven design space exploration and to regularize training through prompt augmentation.

**Authors**: Takuya Sera, Yusuke Hamano

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T16:48:30Z

**Summary**: ChatNekoHacker is a real-time conversational agent system that strengthens fan engagement for musicians. It integrates Amazon Bedrock Agents for autonomous dialogue, Unity for immersive 3D livestream sets, and VOICEVOX for high quality Japanese text-to-speech, enabling two virtual personas to represent the music duo Neko Hacker. In a one-hour YouTube Live with 30 participants, we evaluated the impact of the system. Regression analysis showed that agent interaction significantly elevated fan interest, with perceived fun as the dominant predictor. The participants also expressed a stronger intention to listen to the duo's music and attend future concerts. These findings highlight entertaining, interactive broadcasts as pivotal to cultivating fandom. Our work offers actionable insights for the deployment of conversational agents in entertainment while pointing to next steps: broader response diversity, lower latency, and tighter fact-checking to curb potential misinformation.

### The Binary and Ternary Quantization Can Improve Feature Discrimination
**Authors**: Weizhi Lu, Mingrui Chen, Weiyu Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T16:44:12Z

**Summary**: In machine learning, quantization is widely used to simplify data representation and facilitate algorithm deployment on hardware. Given the fundamental role of classification in machine learning, it is crucial to investigate the impact of quantization on classification. Current research primarily focuses on quantization errors, operating under the premise that higher quantization errors generally result in lower classification performance. However, this premise lacks a solid theoretical foundation and often contradicts empirical findings. For instance, certain extremely low bit-width quantization methods, such as $\{0,1\}$-binary quantization and $\{0, \pm1\}$-ternary quantization, can achieve comparable or even superior classification accuracy compared to the original non-quantized data, despite exhibiting high quantization errors. To more accurately evaluate classification performance, we propose to directly investigate the feature discrimination of quantized data, instead of analyzing its quantization error. Interestingly, it is found that both binary and ternary quantization methods can improve, rather than degrade, the feature discrimination of the original data. This remarkable performance is validated through classification experiments across various data types, including images, speech, and texts.

### BadApex: Backdoor Attack Based on Adaptive Optimization Mechanism of   Black-box Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhengxian Wu, Juan Wen, Wanli Peng, Ziwei Zhang, Yinghan Zhou, Yiming Xue

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T16:22:41Z

**Summary**: Previous insertion-based and paraphrase-based backdoors have achieved great success in attack efficacy, but they ignore the text quality and semantic consistency between poisoned and clean texts. Although recent studies introduce LLMs to generate poisoned texts and improve the stealthiness, semantic consistency, and text quality, their hand-crafted prompts rely on expert experiences, facing significant challenges in prompt adaptability and attack performance after defenses. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack based on adaptive optimization mechanism of black-box large language models (BadApex), which leverages a black-box LLM to generate poisoned text through a refined prompt. Specifically, an Adaptive Optimization Mechanism is designed to refine an initial prompt iteratively using the generation and modification agents. The generation agent generates the poisoned text based on the initial prompt. Then the modification agent evaluates the quality of the poisoned text and refines a new prompt. After several iterations of the above process, the refined prompt is used to generate poisoned texts through LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three dataset with six backdoor attacks and two defenses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadApex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. It improves prompt adaptability, semantic consistency, and text quality. Furthermore, when two defense methods are applied, the average attack success rate (ASR) still up to 96.75%.

### DP2Unlearning: An Efficient and Guaranteed Unlearning Framework for LLMs
**Authors**: Tamim Al Mahmud, Najeeb Jebreel, Josep Domingo-Ferrer, David Sanchez

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T16:22:20Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized language processing tasks but have also brought ethical and legal issues. LLMs have a tendency to memorize potentially private or copyrighted information present in the training data, which might then be delivered to end users at inference time. When this happens, a naive solution is to retrain the model from scratch after excluding the undesired data. Although this guarantees that the target data have been forgotten, it is also prohibitively expensive for LLMs. Approximate unlearning offers a more efficient alternative, as it consists of ex post modifications of the trained model itself to prevent undesirable results, but it lacks forgetting guarantees because it relies solely on empirical evidence. In this work, we present DP2Unlearning, a novel LLM unlearning framework that offers formal forgetting guarantees at a significantly lower cost than retraining from scratch on the data to be retained. DP2Unlearning involves training LLMs on textual data protected using {\epsilon}-differential privacy (DP), which later enables efficient unlearning with the guarantees against disclosure associated with the chosen {\epsilon}. Our experiments demonstrate that DP2Unlearning achieves similar model performance post-unlearning, compared to an LLM retraining from scratch on retained data -- the gold standard exact unlearning -- but at approximately half the unlearning cost. In addition, with a reasonable computational cost, it outperforms approximate unlearning methods at both preserving the utility of the model post-unlearning and effectively forgetting the targeted information.

### Detecting Malicious Source Code in PyPI Packages with LLMs: Does RAG   Come in Handy?
**Authors**: Motunrayo Ibiyo, Thinakone Louangdy, Phuong T. Nguyen, Claudio Di Sipio, Davide Di Ruscio

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T16:11:59Z

**Summary**: Malicious software packages in open-source ecosystems, such as PyPI, pose growing security risks. Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, these packages are intentionally designed to deceive users, making detection challenging due to evolving attack methods and the lack of structured datasets. In this work, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and few-shot learning for detecting malicious source code. We fine-tune LLMs on curated datasets and integrate YARA rules, GitHub Security Advisories, and malicious code snippets with the aim of enhancing classification accuracy. We came across a counterintuitive outcome: While RAG is expected to boost up the prediction performance, it fails in the performed evaluation, obtaining a mediocre accuracy. In contrast, few-shot learning is more effective as it significantly improves the detection of malicious code, achieving 97% accuracy and 95% balanced accuracy, outperforming traditional RAG approaches. Thus, future work should expand structured knowledge bases, refine retrieval models, and explore hybrid AI-driven cybersecurity solutions.

### Project Alexandria: Towards Freeing Scientific Knowledge from Copyright   Burdens via LLMs
**Authors**: Christoph Schuhmann, Gollam Rabby, Ameya Prabhu, Tawsif Ahmed, Andreas Hochlehnert, Huu Nguyen, Nick Akinci, Ludwig Schmidt, Robert Kaczmarczyk, Sören Auer, Jenia Jitsev, Matthias Bethge

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T15:48:01Z

**Summary**: Paywalls, licenses and copyright rules often restrict the broad dissemination and reuse of scientific knowledge. We take the position that it is both legally and technically feasible to extract the scientific knowledge in scholarly texts. Current methods, like text embeddings, fail to reliably preserve factual content, and simple paraphrasing may not be legally sound. We propose a new idea for the community to adopt: convert scholarly documents into knowledge preserving, but style agnostic representations we term Knowledge Units using LLMs. These units use structured data capturing entities, attributes and relationships without stylistic content. We provide evidence that Knowledge Units (1) form a legally defensible framework for sharing knowledge from copyrighted research texts, based on legal analyses of German copyright law and U.S. Fair Use doctrine, and (2) preserve most (~95\%) factual knowledge from original text, measured by MCQ performance on facts from the original copyrighted text across four research domains. Freeing scientific knowledge from copyright promises transformative benefits for scientific research and education by allowing language models to reuse important facts from copyrighted text. To support this, we share open-source tools for converting research documents into Knowledge Units. Overall, our work posits the feasibility of democratizing access to scientific knowledge while respecting copyright.

### Towards Accurate and Interpretable Neuroblastoma Diagnosis via   Contrastive Multi-scale Pathological Image Analysis
**Authors**: Zhu Zhu, Shuo Jiang, Jingyuan Zheng, Yawen Li, Yifei Chen, Manli Zhao, Weizhong Gu, Feiwei Qin, Jinhu Wang, Gang Yu

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T15:39:46Z

**Summary**: Neuroblastoma, adrenal-derived, is among the most common pediatric solid malignancies, characterized by significant clinical heterogeneity. Timely and accurate pathological diagnosis from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images is critical for patient prognosis. However, current diagnostic practices primarily rely on subjective manual examination by pathologists, leading to inconsistent accuracy. Existing automated whole slide image classification methods encounter challenges such as poor interpretability, limited feature extraction capabilities, and high computational costs, restricting their practical clinical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose CMSwinKAN, a contrastive-learning-based multi-scale feature fusion model tailored for pathological image classification, which enhances the Swin Transformer architecture by integrating a Kernel Activation Network within its multilayer perceptron and classification head modules, significantly improving both interpretability and accuracy. By fusing multi-scale features and leveraging contrastive learning strategies, CMSwinKAN mimics clinicians' comprehensive approach, effectively capturing global and local tissue characteristics. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic soft voting mechanism guided by clinical insights to seamlessly bridge patch-level predictions to whole slide image-level classifications. We validate CMSwinKAN on the PpNTs dataset, which was collaboratively established with our partner hospital and the publicly accessible BreakHis dataset. Results demonstrate that CMSwinKAN performs better than existing state-of-the-art pathology-specific models pre-trained on large datasets. Our source code is available at https://github.com/JSLiam94/CMSwinKAN.

### Understanding Epistemic Language with a Language-augmented Bayesian   Theory of Mind
**Authors**: Lance Ying, Tan Zhi-Xuan, Lionel Wong, Vikash Mansinghka, Joshua B. Tenenbaum

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T15:31:32Z

**Summary**: How do people understand and evaluate claims about others' beliefs, even though these beliefs cannot be directly observed? In this paper, we introduce a cognitive model of epistemic language interpretation, grounded in Bayesian inferences about other agents' goals, beliefs, and intentions: a language-augmented Bayesian theory-of-mind (LaBToM). By translating natural language into an epistemic ``language-of-thought'' with grammar-constrained LLM decoding, then evaluating these translations against the inferences produced by inverting a generative model of rational action and perception, LaBToM captures graded plausibility judgments of epistemic claims. We validate our model in an experiment where participants watch an agent navigate a maze to find keys hidden in boxes needed to reach their goal, then rate sentences about the agent's beliefs. In contrast with multimodal LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini Pro) and ablated models, our model correlates highly with human judgments for a wide range of expressions, including modal language, uncertainty expressions, knowledge claims, likelihood comparisons, and attributions of false belief.

### LimitNet: Progressive, Content-Aware Image Offloading for Extremely Weak   Devices & Networks
**Authors**: Ali Hojjat, Janek Haberer, Tayyaba Zainab, Olaf Landsiedel

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T15:04:53Z

**Summary**: IoT devices have limited hardware capabilities and are often deployed in remote areas. Consequently, advanced vision models surpass such devices' processing and storage capabilities, requiring offloading of such tasks to the cloud. However, remote areas often rely on LPWANs technology with limited bandwidth, high packet loss rates, and extremely low duty cycles, which makes fast offloading for time-sensitive inference challenging. Today's approaches, which are deployable on weak devices, generate a non-progressive bit stream, and therefore, their decoding quality suffers strongly when data is only partially available on the cloud at a deadline due to limited bandwidth or packet losses.   In this paper, we introduce LimitNet, a progressive, content-aware image compression model designed for extremely weak devices and networks. LimitNet's lightweight progressive encoder prioritizes critical data during transmission based on the content of the image, which gives the cloud the opportunity to run inference even with partial data availability.   Experimental results demonstrate that LimitNet, on average, compared to SOTA, achieves 14.01 p.p. (percentage point) higher accuracy on ImageNet1000, 18.01 pp on CIFAR100, and 0.1 higher mAP@0.5 on COCO. Also, on average, LimitNet saves 61.24% bandwidth on ImageNet1000, 83.68% on CIFAR100, and 42.25% on the COCO dataset compared to SOTA, while it only has 4% more encoding time compared to JPEG (with a fixed quality) on STM32F7 (Cortex-M7).

### Controlled Territory and Conflict Tracking (CONTACT): (Geo-)Mapping   Occupied Territory from Open Source Intelligence
**Authors**: Paul K. Mandal, Cole Leo, Connor Hurley

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T14:57:07Z

**Summary**: Open-source intelligence provides a stream of unstructured textual data that can inform assessments of territorial control. We present CONTACT, a framework for territorial control prediction using large language models (LLMs) and minimal supervision. We evaluate two approaches: SetFit, an embedding-based few-shot classifier, and a prompt tuning method applied to BLOOMZ-560m, a multilingual generative LLM. Our model is trained on a small hand-labeled dataset of news articles covering ISIS activity in Syria and Iraq, using prompt-conditioned extraction of control-relevant signals such as military operations, casualties, and location references. We show that the BLOOMZ-based model outperforms the SetFit baseline, and that prompt-based supervision improves generalization in low-resource settings. CONTACT demonstrates that LLMs fine-tuned using few-shot methods can reduce annotation burdens and support structured inference from open-ended OSINT streams. Our code is available at https://github.com/PaulKMandal/CONTACT/.

### Human-aligned Deep Learning: Explainability, Causality, and Biological   Inspiration
**Authors**: Gianluca Carloni

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T14:40:58Z

**Summary**: This work aligns deep learning (DL) with human reasoning capabilities and needs to enable more efficient, interpretable, and robust image classification. We approach this from three perspectives: explainability, causality, and biological vision. Introduction and background open this work before diving into operative chapters. First, we assess neural networks' visualization techniques for medical images and validate an explainable-by-design method for breast mass classification. A comprehensive review at the intersection of XAI and causality follows, where we introduce a general scaffold to organize past and future research, laying the groundwork for our second perspective. In the causality direction, we propose novel modules that exploit feature co-occurrence in medical images, leading to more effective and explainable predictions. We further introduce CROCODILE, a general framework that integrates causal concepts, contrastive learning, feature disentanglement, and prior knowledge to enhance generalization. Lastly, we explore biological vision, examining how humans recognize objects, and propose CoCoReco, a connectivity-inspired network with context-aware attention mechanisms. Overall, our key findings include: (i) simple activation maximization lacks insight for medical imaging DL models; (ii) prototypical-part learning is effective and radiologically aligned; (iii) XAI and causal ML are deeply connected; (iv) weak causal signals can be leveraged without a priori information to improve performance and interpretability; (v) our framework generalizes across medical domains and out-of-distribution data; (vi) incorporating biological circuit motifs improves human-aligned recognition. This work contributes toward human-aligned DL and highlights pathways to bridge the gap between research and clinical adoption, with implications for improved trust, diagnostic accuracy, and safe deployment.

### AgentHarm: A Benchmark for Measuring Harmfulness of LLM Agents
**Authors**: Maksym Andriushchenko, Alexandra Souly, Mateusz Dziemian, Derek Duenas, Maxwell Lin, Justin Wang, Dan Hendrycks, Andy Zou, Zico Kolter, Matt Fredrikson, Eric Winsor, Jerome Wynne, Yarin Gal, Xander Davies

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T14:30:31Z

**Summary**: The robustness of LLMs to jailbreak attacks, where users design prompts to circumvent safety measures and misuse model capabilities, has been studied primarily for LLMs acting as simple chatbots. Meanwhile, LLM agents -- which use external tools and can execute multi-stage tasks -- may pose a greater risk if misused, but their robustness remains underexplored. To facilitate research on LLM agent misuse, we propose a new benchmark called AgentHarm. The benchmark includes a diverse set of 110 explicitly malicious agent tasks (440 with augmentations), covering 11 harm categories including fraud, cybercrime, and harassment. In addition to measuring whether models refuse harmful agentic requests, scoring well on AgentHarm requires jailbroken agents to maintain their capabilities following an attack to complete a multi-step task. We evaluate a range of leading LLMs, and find (1) leading LLMs are surprisingly compliant with malicious agent requests without jailbreaking, (2) simple universal jailbreak templates can be adapted to effectively jailbreak agents, and (3) these jailbreaks enable coherent and malicious multi-step agent behavior and retain model capabilities. To enable simple and reliable evaluation of attacks and defenses for LLM-based agents, we publicly release AgentHarm at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai-safety-institute/AgentHarm.

### OpenDeception: Benchmarking and Investigating AI Deceptive Behaviors via   Open-ended Interaction Simulation
**Authors**: Yichen Wu, Xudong Pan, Geng Hong, Min Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T14:11:27Z

**Summary**: As the general capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve and agent applications become more widespread, the underlying deception risks urgently require systematic evaluation and effective oversight. Unlike existing evaluation which uses simulated games or presents limited choices, we introduce OpenDeception, a novel deception evaluation framework with an open-ended scenario dataset. OpenDeception jointly evaluates both the deception intention and capabilities of LLM-based agents by inspecting their internal reasoning process. Specifically, we construct five types of common use cases where LLMs intensively interact with the user, each consisting of ten diverse, concrete scenarios from the real world. To avoid ethical concerns and costs of high-risk deceptive interactions with human testers, we propose to simulate the multi-turn dialogue via agent simulation. Extensive evaluation of eleven mainstream LLMs on OpenDeception highlights the urgent need to address deception risks and security concerns in LLM-based agents: the deception intention ratio across the models exceeds 80%, while the deception success rate surpasses 50%. Furthermore, we observe that LLMs with stronger capabilities do exhibit a higher risk of deception, which calls for more alignment efforts on inhibiting deceptive behaviors.

### A Theory of LLM Sampling: Part Descriptive and Part Prescriptive
**Authors**: Sarath Sivaprasad, Pramod Kaushik, Sahar Abdelnabi, Mario Fritz

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T14:01:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in autonomous decision-making, where they sample options from vast action spaces. However, the heuristics that guide this sampling process remain under-explored. We study this sampling behavior and show that this underlying heuristics resembles that of human decision-making: comprising a descriptive component (reflecting statistical norm) and a prescriptive component (implicit ideal encoded in the LLM) of a concept. We show that this deviation of a sample from the statistical norm towards a prescriptive component consistently appears in concepts across diverse real-world domains like public health, and economic trends. To further illustrate the theory, we demonstrate that concept prototypes in LLMs are affected by prescriptive norms, similar to the concept of normality in humans. Through case studies and comparison with human studies, we illustrate that in real-world applications, the shift of samples toward an ideal value in LLMs' outputs can result in significantly biased decision-making, raising ethical concerns.

### Exploring Multimodal Prompt for Visualization Authoring with Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Zhen Wen, Luoxuan Weng, Yinghao Tang, Runjin Zhang, Yuxin Liu, Bo Pan, Minfeng Zhu, Wei Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T14:00:55Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in automating the process of visualization authoring through simple natural language utterances. However, instructing LLMs using natural language is limited in precision and expressiveness for conveying visualization intent, leading to misinterpretation and time-consuming iterations. To address these limitations, we conduct an empirical study to understand how LLMs interpret ambiguous or incomplete text prompts in the context of visualization authoring, and the conditions making LLMs misinterpret user intent. Informed by the findings, we introduce visual prompts as a complementary input modality to text prompts, which help clarify user intent and improve LLMs' interpretation abilities. To explore the potential of multimodal prompting in visualization authoring, we design VisPilot, which enables users to easily create visualizations using multimodal prompts, including text, sketches, and direct manipulations on existing visualizations. Through two case studies and a controlled user study, we demonstrate that VisPilot provides a more intuitive way to create visualizations without affecting the overall task efficiency compared to text-only prompting approaches. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of text and visual prompts in different visualization tasks. Our findings highlight the importance of multimodal prompting in improving the usability of LLMs for visualization authoring. We discuss design implications for future visualization systems and provide insights into how multimodal prompts can enhance human-AI collaboration in creative visualization tasks.

**Authors**: Xiangrong, Zhu, Yuan Xu, Tianjian Liu, Jingwei Sun, Yu Zhang, Xin Tong

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T13:35:21Z

**Summary**: Human cognition is constrained by processing limitations, leading to cognitive overload and inefficiencies in knowledge synthesis and decision-making. Large Language Models (LLMs) present an opportunity for cognitive augmentation, but their current reactive nature limits their real-world applicability. This position paper explores the potential of context-aware cognitive augmentation, where LLMs dynamically adapt to users' cognitive states and task environments to provide appropriate support. Through a think-aloud study in an exhibition setting, we examine how individuals interact with multi-modal information and identify key cognitive challenges in structuring, retrieving, and applying knowledge. Our findings highlight the need for AI-driven cognitive support systems that integrate real-time contextual awareness, personalized reasoning assistance, and socially adaptive interactions. We propose a framework for AI augmentation that seamlessly transitions between real-time cognitive support and post-experience knowledge organization, contributing to the design of more effective human-centered AI systems.

### Revisiting Uncertainty Quantification Evaluation in Language Models:   Spurious Interactions with Response Length Bias Results
**Authors**: Andrea Santilli, Adam Golinski, Michael Kirchhof, Federico Danieli, Arno Blaas, Miao Xiong, Luca Zappella, Sinead Williamson

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T13:13:42Z

**Summary**: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in Language Models (LMs) is crucial for improving their safety and reliability. Evaluations often use performance metrics like AUROC to assess how well UQ methods (e.g., negative sequence probabilities) correlate with task correctness functions (e.g., ROUGE-L). In this paper, we show that commonly used correctness functions bias UQ evaluations by inflating the performance of certain UQ methods. We evaluate 7 correctness functions -- from lexical-based and embedding-based metrics to LLM-as-a-judge approaches -- across 4 datasets x 4 models x 6 UQ methods. Our analysis reveals that length biases in the errors of these correctness functions distort UQ assessments by interacting with length biases in UQ methods. We identify LLM-as-a-judge approaches as among the least length-biased choices and hence a potential solution to mitigate these biases.

### The Comparative Trap: Pairwise Comparisons Amplifies Biased Preferences   of LLM Evaluators
**Authors**: Hawon Jeong, ChaeHun Park, Jimin Hong, Hojoon Lee, Jaegul Choo

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T13:12:42Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators for natural language generation tasks, ensuring unbiased assessments is essential. However, LLM evaluators often display biased preferences, such as favoring verbosity and authoritative tones. Our empirical analysis reveals that these biases are exacerbated in pairwise evaluation, where LLMs directly compare two outputs and easily prioritize superficial attributes. In contrast, pointwise evaluation, which assesses outputs independently, is less susceptible to such bias because each output is judged in isolation. To address the limitations of the pairwise evaluation, we introduce a novel evaluation method, PRePair, which integrates pointwise reasoning within a pairwise framework. PRePair effectively alleviates biased preference, improving performance on the adversarial benchmark (LLMBar) while outperforming pointwise evaluation on the standard benchmark (MT-Bench).

### Can Tool-augmented Large Language Models be Aware of Incomplete   Conditions?
**Authors**: Seungbin Yang, ChaeHun Park, Taehee Kim, Jaegul Choo

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T13:07:08Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in integrating large language models (LLMs) with tools have allowed the models to interact with real-world environments. However, these tool-augmented LLMs often encounter incomplete scenarios when users provide partial information or the necessary tools are unavailable. Recognizing and managing such scenarios is crucial for LLMs to ensure their reliability, but this exploration remains understudied. This study examines whether LLMs can identify incomplete conditions and appropriately determine when to refrain from using tools. To this end, we address a dataset by manipulating instances from two datasets by removing necessary tools or essential information for tool invocation. Our experiments show that LLMs often struggle to identify the absence of information required to utilize specific tools and recognize the absence of appropriate tools. We further analyze model behaviors in different environments and compare their performance against humans. Our research can contribute to advancing reliable LLMs by addressing common scenarios during interactions between humans and LLMs. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

### Large Language Models Will Change The Way Children Think About   Technology And Impact Every Interaction Paradigm
**Authors**: Russell Beale

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T13:01:27Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a hopeful perspective on the potentially dramatic impacts of Large Language Models on how we children learn and how they will expect to interact with technology. We review the effects of LLMs on education so far, and make the case that these effects are minor compared to the upcoming changes that are occurring. We present a small scenario and self-ethnographic study demonstrating the effects of these changes, and define five significant considerations that interactive systems designers will have to accommodate in the future.

### Do Prompt Patterns Affect Code Quality? A First Empirical Assessment of   ChatGPT-Generated Code
**Authors**: Antonio Della Porta, Stefano Lambiase, Fabio Palomba

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T12:37:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed software development, especially in code generation. However, their inconsistent performance, prone to hallucinations and quality issues, complicates program comprehension and hinders maintainability. Research indicates that prompt engineering-the practice of designing inputs to direct LLMs toward generating relevant outputs-may help address these challenges. In this regard, researchers have introduced prompt patterns, structured templates intended to guide users in formulating their requests. However, the influence of prompt patterns on code quality has yet to be thoroughly investigated. An improved understanding of this relationship would be essential to advancing our collective knowledge on how to effectively use LLMs for code generation, thereby enhancing their understandability in contemporary software development. This paper empirically investigates the impact of prompt patterns on code quality, specifically maintainability, security, and reliability, using the Dev-GPT dataset. Results show that Zero-Shot prompting is most common, followed by Zero-Shot with Chain-of-Thought and Few-Shot. Analysis of 7583 code files across quality metrics revealed minimal issues, with Kruskal-Wallis tests indicating no significant differences among patterns, suggesting that prompt structure may not substantially impact these quality metrics in ChatGPT-assisted code generation.

### Is In-Context Learning Sufficient for Instruction Following in LLMs?
**Authors**: Hao Zhao, Maksym Andriushchenko, Francesco Croce, Nicolas Flammarion

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T12:31:18Z

**Summary**: In-context learning (ICL) allows LLMs to learn from examples without changing their weights: this is a particularly promising capability for long-context LLMs that can potentially learn from many examples. Recently, Lin et al. (2024) proposed URIAL, a method using only three in-context examples to align base LLMs, achieving non-trivial instruction following performance. In this work, we show that, while effective, ICL alignment with URIAL still underperforms compared to instruction fine-tuning on the established benchmark MT-Bench, especially with more capable base LLMs. We then uncover the most relevant elements for successful in-context alignment, finding the crucial role of the decoding parameters. Based on these insights, we show that the approach of URIAL can indeed be improved by adding high-quality, potentially carefully selected via greedy search, demonstrations in context, getting closer to the performance of instruct models. Finally, we provide the first, to our knowledge, systematic comparison of ICL and instruction fine-tuning (IFT) for instruction following in the low data regime, where ICL can be a viable alternative to IFT. Overall, our work advances the understanding of ICL as an alignment technique and its relationship to IFT. We provide our code at https://github.com/tml-epfl/icl-alignment.

### Lightweight LiDAR-Camera 3D Dynamic Object Detection and Multi-Class   Trajectory Prediction
**Authors**: Yushen He, Lei Zhao, Tianchen Deng, Zipeng Fang, Weidong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T11:59:34Z

**Summary**: Service mobile robots are often required to avoid dynamic objects while performing their tasks, but they usually have only limited computational resources. So we present a lightweight multi-modal framework for 3D object detection and trajectory prediction. Our system synergistically integrates LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians, vehicles, and riders in 3D space. The framework proposes two novel modules: 1) a Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) for object detection with high accuracy and acceptable amount of computation, and 2) a Reference Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse trajectory prediction of mult-class objects with flexible trajectory lengths. Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate superior performance over existing methods across detection (+2.03% in mAP) and trajectory prediction (-0.408m in minADE5 of pedestrians) metrics. Remarkably, the system exhibits exceptional deployability - when implemented on a wheelchair robot with an entry-level NVIDIA 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.2 fps. To facilitate reproducibility and practical deployment, we release the related code of the method at https://github.com/TossherO/3D_Perception and its ROS inference version at https://github.com/TossherO/ros_packages.

### Exploring the Potential for Large Language Models to Demonstrate   Rational Probabilistic Beliefs
**Authors**: Gabriel Freedman, Francesca Toni

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T11:50:30Z

**Summary**: Advances in the general capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have led to their use for information retrieval, and as components in automated decision systems. A faithful representation of probabilistic reasoning in these models may be essential to ensure trustworthy, explainable and effective performance in these tasks. Despite previous work suggesting that LLMs can perform complex reasoning and well-calibrated uncertainty quantification, we find that current versions of this class of model lack the ability to provide rational and coherent representations of probabilistic beliefs. To demonstrate this, we introduce a novel dataset of claims with indeterminate truth values and apply a number of well-established techniques for uncertainty quantification to measure the ability of LLM's to adhere to fundamental properties of probabilistic reasoning.

### Argumentative Large Language Models for Explainable and Contestable   Claim Verification
**Authors**: Gabriel Freedman, Adam Dejl, Deniz Gorur, Xiang Yin, Antonio Rago, Francesca Toni

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T11:20:24Z

**Summary**: The profusion of knowledge encoded in large language models (LLMs) and their ability to apply this knowledge zero-shot in a range of settings makes them promising candidates for use in decision-making. However, they are currently limited by their inability to provide outputs which can be faithfully explained and effectively contested to correct mistakes. In this paper, we attempt to reconcile these strengths and weaknesses by introducing \emph{argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs)}, a method for augmenting LLMs with argumentative reasoning. Concretely, ArgLLMs construct argumentation frameworks, which then serve as the basis for formal reasoning in support of decision-making. The interpretable nature of these argumentation frameworks and formal reasoning means that any decision made by ArgLLMs may be explained and contested. We evaluate ArgLLMs' performance experimentally in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, in the context of the decision-making task of claim verification. We also define novel properties to characterise contestability and assess ArgLLMs formally in terms of these properties.

### Remedy: Learning Machine Translation Evaluation from Human Preferences   with Reward Modeling
**Authors**: Shaomu Tan, Christof Monz

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T11:11:14Z

**Summary**: A key challenge in MT evaluation is the inherent noise and inconsistency of human ratings. Regression-based neural metrics struggle with this noise, while prompting LLMs shows promise at system-level evaluation but performs poorly at segment level. In this work, we propose ReMedy, a novel MT metric framework that reformulates translation evaluation as a reward modeling task. Instead of regressing on imperfect human ratings directly, ReMedy learns relative translation quality using pairwise preference data, resulting in a more reliable evaluation. In extensive experiments across WMT22-24 shared tasks (39 language pairs, 111 MT systems), ReMedy achieves state-of-the-art performance at both segment- and system-level evaluation. Specifically, ReMedy-9B surpasses larger WMT winners and massive closed LLMs such as MetricX-13B, XCOMET-Ensemble, GEMBA-GPT-4, PaLM-540B, and finetuned PaLM2. Further analyses demonstrate that ReMedy delivers superior capability in detecting translation errors and evaluating low-quality translations.

### Divergent LLM Adoption and Heterogeneous Convergence Paths in Research   Writing
**Authors**: Cong William Lin, Wu Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T11:09:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are reshaping content creation and academic writing. This study investigates the impact of AI-assisted generative revisions on research manuscripts, focusing on heterogeneous adoption patterns and their influence on writing convergence. Leveraging a dataset of over 627,000 academic papers from arXiv, we develop a novel classification framework by fine-tuning prompt- and discipline-specific large language models to detect the style of ChatGPT-revised texts. Our findings reveal substantial disparities in LLM adoption across academic disciplines, gender, native language status, and career stage, alongside a rapid evolution in scholarly writing styles. Moreover, LLM usage enhances clarity, conciseness, and adherence to formal writing conventions, with improvements varying by revision type. Finally, a difference-in-differences analysis shows that while LLMs drive convergence in academic writing, early adopters, male researchers, non-native speakers, and junior scholars exhibit the most pronounced stylistic shifts, aligning their writing more closely with that of established researchers.

### Visual Intention Grounding for Egocentric Assistants
**Authors**: Pengzhan Sun, Junbin Xiao, Tze Ho Elden Tse, Yicong Li, Arjun Akula, Angela Yao

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:54:52Z

**Summary**: Visual grounding associates textual descriptions with objects in an image. Conventional methods target third-person image inputs and named object queries. In applications such as AI assistants, the perspective shifts -- inputs are egocentric, and objects may be referred to implicitly through needs and intentions. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoIntention, the first dataset for egocentric visual intention grounding. EgoIntention challenges multimodal LLMs to 1) understand and ignore unintended contextual objects and 2) reason about uncommon object functionalities. Benchmark results show that current models misidentify context objects and lack affordance understanding in egocentric views. We also propose Reason-to-Ground (RoG) instruction tuning; it enables hybrid training with normal descriptions and egocentric intentions with a chained intention reasoning and object grounding mechanism. RoG significantly outperforms naive finetuning and hybrid training on EgoIntention, while maintaining or slightly improving naive description grounding. This advancement enables unified visual grounding for egocentric and exocentric visual inputs while handling explicit object queries and implicit human intentions.

### Robust Humanoid Walking on Compliant and Uneven Terrain with Deep   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Rohan P. Singh, Mitsuharu Morisawa, Mehdi Benallegue, Zhaoming Xie, Fumio Kanehiro

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:49:07Z

**Summary**: For the deployment of legged robots in real-world environments, it is essential to develop robust locomotion control methods for challenging terrains that may exhibit unexpected deformability and irregularity. In this paper, we explore the application of sim-to-real deep reinforcement learning (RL) for the design of bipedal locomotion controllers for humanoid robots on compliant and uneven terrains. Our key contribution is to show that a simple training curriculum for exposing the RL agent to randomized terrains in simulation can achieve robust walking on a real humanoid robot using only proprioceptive feedback. We train an end-to-end bipedal locomotion policy using the proposed approach, and show extensive real-robot demonstration on the HRP-5P humanoid over several difficult terrains inside and outside the lab environment. Further, we argue that the robustness of a bipedal walking policy can be improved if the robot is allowed to exhibit aperiodic motion with variable stepping frequency. We propose a new control policy to enable modification of the observed clock signal, leading to adaptive gait frequencies depending on the terrain and command velocity. Through simulation experiments, we show the effectiveness of this policy specifically for walking over challenging terrains by controlling swing and stance durations. The code for training and evaluation is available online at https://github.com/rohanpsingh/LearningHumanoidWalking. Demo video is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgfNzGAkk2Q.

### Compile Scene Graphs with Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Zuyao Chen, Jinlin Wu, Zhen Lei, Marc Pollefeys, Chang Wen Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:46:22Z

**Summary**: Next token prediction is the fundamental principle for training large language models (LLMs), and reinforcement learning (RL) further enhances their reasoning performance. As an effective way to model language, image, video, and other modalities, the use of LLMs for end-to-end extraction of structured visual representations, such as scene graphs, remains underexplored. It requires the model to accurately produce a set of objects and relationship triplets, rather than generating text token by token. To achieve this, we introduce R1-SGG, a multimodal LLM (M-LLM) initially trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the scene graph dataset and subsequently refined using reinforcement learning to enhance its ability to generate scene graphs in an end-to-end manner. The SFT follows a conventional prompt-response paradigm, while RL requires the design of effective reward signals. Given the structured nature of scene graphs, we design a graph-centric reward function that integrates node-level rewards, edge-level rewards, and a format consistency reward. Our experiments demonstrate that rule-based RL substantially enhances model performance in the SGG task, achieving a zero failure rate--unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which struggles to generalize effectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/gpt4vision/R1-SGG.

### Long-context Non-factoid Question Answering in Indic Languages
**Authors**: Ritwik Mishra, Rajiv Ratn Shah, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:43:21Z

**Summary**: Question Answering (QA) tasks, which involve extracting answers from a given context, are relatively straightforward for modern Large Language Models (LLMs) when the context is short. However, long contexts pose challenges due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. This challenge is compounded in Indic languages, which are often low-resource. This study explores context-shortening techniques, including Open Information Extraction (OIE), coreference resolution, Answer Paragraph Selection (APS), and their combinations, to improve QA performance. Compared to the baseline of unshortened (long) contexts, our experiments on four Indic languages (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu) demonstrate that context-shortening techniques yield an average improvement of 4\% in semantic scores and 47\% in token-level scores when evaluated on three popular LLMs without fine-tuning. Furthermore, with fine-tuning, we achieve an average increase of 2\% in both semantic and token-level scores. Additionally, context-shortening reduces computational overhead. Explainability techniques like LIME and SHAP reveal that when the APS model confidently identifies the paragraph containing the answer, nearly all tokens within the selected text receive high relevance scores. However, the study also highlights the limitations of LLM-based QA systems in addressing non-factoid questions, particularly those requiring reasoning or debate. Moreover, verbalizing OIE-generated triples does not enhance system performance. These findings emphasize the potential of context-shortening techniques to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM-based QA systems, especially for low-resource languages. The source code and resources are available at https://github.com/ritwikmishra/IndicGenQA.

### Evaluation Report on MCP Servers
**Authors**: Zhiling Luo, Xiaorong Shi, Xuanrui Lin, Jinyang Gao

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:39:23Z

**Summary**: With the rise of LLMs, a large number of Model Context Protocol (MCP) services have emerged since the end of 2024. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of MCP servers have not been well studied. To study these questions, we propose an evaluation framework, called MCPBench. We selected several widely used MCP server and conducted an experimental evaluation on their accuracy, time, and token usage. Our experiments showed that the most effective MCP, Bing Web Search, achieved an accuracy of 64%. Importantly, we found that the accuracy of MCP servers can be substantially enhanced by involving declarative interface. This research paves the way for further investigations into optimized MCP implementations, ultimately leading to better AI-driven applications and data retrieval solutions.

### Prompt-Based Cost-Effective Evaluation and Operation of ChatGPT as a   Computer Programming Teaching Assistant
**Authors**: Marc Ballestero-Ribó, Daniel Ortiz-Martínez

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:35:50Z

**Summary**: The dream of achieving a student-teacher ratio of 1:1 is closer than ever thanks to the emergence of large language models (LLMs). One potential application of these models in the educational field would be to provide feedback to students in university introductory programming courses, so that a student struggling to solve a basic implementation problem could seek help from an LLM available 24/7. This article focuses on studying three aspects related to such an application. First, the performance of two well-known models, GPT-3.5T and GPT-4T, in providing feedback to students is evaluated. The empirical results showed that GPT-4T performs much better than GPT-3.5T, however, it is not yet ready for use in a real-world scenario. This is due to the possibility of generating incorrect information that potential users may not always be able to detect. Second, the article proposes a carefully designed prompt using in-context learning techniques that allows automating important parts of the evaluation process, as well as providing a lower bound for the fraction of feedbacks containing incorrect information, saving time and effort. This was possible because the resulting feedback has a programmatically analyzable structure that incorporates diagnostic information about the LLM's performance in solving the requested task. Third, the article also suggests a possible strategy for implementing a practical learning tool based on LLMs, which is rooted on the proposed prompting techniques. This strategy opens up a whole range of interesting possibilities from a pedagogical perspective.

### Can LLMs assist with Ambiguity? A Quantitative Evaluation of various   Large Language Models on Word Sense Disambiguation
**Authors**: T. G. D. K. Sumanathilaka, Nicholas Micallef, Julian Hough

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:26:12Z

**Summary**: Ambiguous words are often found in modern digital communications. Lexical ambiguity challenges traditional Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) methods, due to limited data. Consequently, the efficiency of translation, information retrieval, and question-answering systems is hindered by these limitations. This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve WSD using a novel approach combining a systematic prompt augmentation mechanism with a knowledge base (KB) consisting of different sense interpretations. The proposed method incorporates a human-in-loop approach for prompt augmentation where prompt is supported by Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, synonyms of ambiguous words, aspect-based sense filtering and few-shot prompting to guide the LLM. By utilizing a few-shot Chain of Thought (COT) prompting-based approach, this work demonstrates a substantial improvement in performance. The evaluation was conducted using FEWS test data and sense tags. This research advances accurate word interpretation in social media and digital communication.

### FocusTrack: A Self-Adaptive Local Sampling Algorithm for Efficient   Anti-UAV Tracking
**Authors**: Ying Wang, Tingfa Xu, Jianan Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T10:18:07Z

**Summary**: Anti-UAV tracking poses significant challenges, including small target sizes, abrupt camera motion, and cluttered infrared backgrounds. Existing tracking paradigms can be broadly categorized into global- and local-based methods. Global-based trackers, such as SiamDT, achieve high accuracy by scanning the entire field of view but suffer from excessive computational overhead, limiting real-world deployment. In contrast, local-based methods, including OSTrack and ROMTrack, efficiently restrict the search region but struggle when targets undergo significant displacements due to abrupt camera motion. Through preliminary experiments, it is evident that a local tracker, when paired with adaptive search region adjustment, can significantly enhance tracking accuracy, narrowing the gap between local and global trackers. To address this challenge, we propose FocusTrack, a novel framework that dynamically refines the search region and strengthens feature representations, achieving an optimal balance between computational efficiency and tracking accuracy. Specifically, our Search Region Adjustment (SRA) strategy estimates the target presence probability and adaptively adjusts the field of view, ensuring the target remains within focus. Furthermore, to counteract feature degradation caused by varying search regions, the Attention-to-Mask (ATM) module is proposed. This module integrates hierarchical information, enriching the target representations with fine-grained details. Experimental results demonstrate that FocusTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, obtaining 67.7% AUC on AntiUAV and 62.8% AUC on AntiUAV410, outperforming the baseline tracker by 8.5% and 9.1% AUC, respectively. In terms of efficiency, FocusTrack surpasses global-based trackers, requiring only 30G MACs and achieving 143 fps with FocusTrack (SRA) and 44 fps with the full version, both enabling real-time tracking.

**Summary**: The recent advances in Legal Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of legal research and practice by automating tasks, enhancing research precision, and supporting complex decision-making processes. However, effectively adapting LLMs to the legal domain remains challenging due to the complexity of legal reasoning, the need for precise interpretation of specialized language, and the potential for hallucinations. This paper examines the efficacy of Domain-Adaptive Continual Pre-Training (DACP) in improving the legal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Through a series of experiments on legal reasoning tasks within the Taiwanese legal framework, we demonstrate that while DACP enhances domain-specific knowledge, it does not uniformly improve performance across all legal tasks. We discuss the trade-offs involved in DACP, particularly its impact on model generalization and performance in prompt-based tasks, and propose directions for future research to optimize domain adaptation strategies in legal AI.

**Authors**: Zihao Feng, Xiaoxue Wang, Ziwei Bai, Donghang Su, Bowen Wu, Qun Yu, Baoxun Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:52:12Z

**Summary**: Intent detection, a critical component in task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, faces significant challenges in adapting to the rapid influx of integrable tools with complex interrelationships. Existing approaches, such as zero-shot reformulations and LLM-based dynamic recognition, struggle with performance degradation when encountering unseen intents, leading to erroneous task routing. To enhance the model's generalization performance on unseen tasks, we employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) combined with a Reward-based Curriculum Sampling (RCS) during Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training in intent detection tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained models substantially outperform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baselines in generalization. Besides, the introduction of the RCS, significantly bolsters the effectiveness of RL in intent detection by focusing the model on challenging cases during training. Moreover, incorporating Chain-of-Thought (COT) processes in RL notably improves generalization in complex intent detection tasks, underscoring the importance of thought in challenging scenarios. This work advances the generalization of intent detection tasks, offering practical insights for deploying adaptable dialogue systems.

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:46:32Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in video generation have been driven by diffusion models and autoregressive frameworks, yet critical challenges persist in harmonizing prompt adherence, visual quality, motion dynamics, and duration: compromises in motion dynamics to enhance temporal visual quality, constrained video duration (5-10 seconds) to prioritize resolution, and inadequate shot-aware generation stemming from general-purpose MLLMs' inability to interpret cinematic grammar, such as shot composition, actor expressions, and camera motions. These intertwined limitations hinder realistic long-form synthesis and professional film-style generation. To address these limitations, we propose SkyReels-V2, an Infinite-length Film Generative Model, that synergizes Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), Multi-stage Pretraining, Reinforcement Learning, and Diffusion Forcing Framework. Firstly, we design a comprehensive structural representation of video that combines the general descriptions by the Multi-modal LLM and the detailed shot language by sub-expert models. Aided with human annotation, we then train a unified Video Captioner, named SkyCaptioner-V1, to efficiently label the video data. Secondly, we establish progressive-resolution pretraining for the fundamental video generation, followed by a four-stage post-training enhancement: Initial concept-balanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) improves baseline quality; Motion-specific Reinforcement Learning (RL) training with human-annotated and synthetic distortion data addresses dynamic artifacts; Our diffusion forcing framework with non-decreasing noise schedules enables long-video synthesis in an efficient search space; Final high-quality SFT refines visual fidelity. All the code and models are available at https://github.com/SkyworkAI/SkyReels-V2.

### Towards End-to-End Network Intent Management with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Lam Dinh, Sihem Cherrared, Xiaofeng Huang, Fabrice Guillemin

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:41:35Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are likely to play a key role in Intent-Based Networking (IBN) as they show remarkable performance in interpreting human language as well as code generation, enabling the translation of high-level intents expressed by humans into low-level network configurations. In this paper, we leverage closed-source language models (i.e., Google Gemini 1.5 pro, ChatGPT-4) and open-source models (i.e., LLama, Mistral) to investigate their capacity to generate E2E network configurations for radio access networks (RANs) and core networks in 5G/6G mobile networks. We introduce a novel performance metrics, known as FEACI, to quantitatively assess the format (F), explainability (E), accuracy (A), cost (C), and inference time (I) of the generated answer; existing general metrics are unable to capture these features. The results of our study demonstrate that open-source models can achieve comparable or even superior translation performance compared with the closed-source models requiring costly hardware setup and not accessible to all users.

### RAG Without the Lag: Interactive Debugging for Retrieval-Augmented   Generation Pipelines
**Authors**: Quentin Romero Lauro, Shreya Shankar, Sepanta Zeighami, Aditya Parameswaran

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:38:49Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines have become the de-facto approach for building AI assistants with access to external, domain-specific knowledge. Given a user query, RAG pipelines typically first retrieve (R) relevant information from external sources, before invoking a Large Language Model (LLM), augmented (A) with this information, to generate (G) responses. Modern RAG pipelines frequently chain multiple retrieval and generation components, in any order. However, developing effective RAG pipelines is challenging because retrieval and generation components are intertwined, making it hard to identify which component(s) cause errors in the eventual output. The parameters with the greatest impact on output quality often require hours of pre-processing after each change, creating prohibitively slow feedback cycles. To address these challenges, we present RAGGY, a developer tool that combines a Python library of composable RAG primitives with an interactive interface for real-time debugging. We contribute the design and implementation of RAGGY, insights into expert debugging patterns through a qualitative study with 12 engineers, and design implications for future RAG tools that better align with developers' natural workflows.

### Token-Level Density-Based Uncertainty Quantification Methods for   Eliciting Truthfulness of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Artem Vazhentsev, Lyudmila Rvanova, Ivan Lazichny, Alexander Panchenko, Maxim Panov, Timothy Baldwin, Artem Shelmanov

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:21:41Z

**Summary**: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a prominent approach for eliciting truthful answers from large language models (LLMs). To date, information-based and consistency-based UQ have been the dominant UQ methods for text generation via LLMs. Density-based methods, despite being very effective for UQ in text classification with encoder-based models, have not been very successful with generative LLMs. In this work, we adapt Mahalanobis Distance (MD) - a well-established UQ technique in classification tasks - for text generation and introduce a new supervised UQ method. Our method extracts token embeddings from multiple layers of LLMs, computes MD scores for each token, and uses linear regression trained on these features to provide robust uncertainty scores. Through extensive experiments on eleven datasets, we demonstrate that our approach substantially improves over existing UQ methods, providing accurate and computationally efficient uncertainty scores for both sequence-level selective generation and claim-level fact-checking tasks. Our method also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-domain data, making it suitable for a wide range of LLM-based applications.

### MAAM: A Lightweight Multi-Agent Aggregation Module for Efficient Image   Classification Based on the MindSpore Framework
**Authors**: Zhenkai Qin, Feng Zhu, Huan Zeng, Xunyi Nong

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:19:07Z

**Summary**: The demand for lightweight models in image classification tasks under resource-constrained environments necessitates a balance between computational efficiency and robust feature representation. Traditional attention mechanisms, despite their strong feature modeling capability, often struggle with high computational complexity and structural rigidity, limiting their applicability in scenarios with limited computational resources (e.g., edge devices or real-time systems). To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Aggregation Module (MAAM), a lightweight attention architecture integrated with the MindSpore framework. MAAM employs three parallel agent branches with independently parameterized operations to extract heterogeneous features, adaptively fused via learnable scalar weights, and refined through a convolutional compression layer. Leveraging MindSpore's dynamic computational graph and operator fusion, MAAM achieves 87.0% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly outperforming conventional CNN (58.3%) and MLP (49.6%) models, while improving training efficiency by 30%. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of agent attention (accuracy drops to 32.0% if removed) and compression modules (25.5% if omitted), validating their necessity for maintaining discriminative feature learning. The framework's hardware acceleration capabilities and minimal memory footprint further demonstrate its practicality, offering a deployable solution for image classification in resource-constrained scenarios without compromising accuracy.

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:12:46Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we propose a pipeline to generate contextualized list recommendations with descriptive shelves in the domain of audiobooks. By creating several shelves for topics the user has an affinity to, e.g. Uplifting Women's Fiction, we can help them explore their recommendations according to their interests and at the same time recommend a diverse set of items. To do so, we use Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich each item's metadata based on a taxonomy created for this domain. Then we create diverse descriptive shelves for each user. A/B tests show improvements in user engagement and audiobook discovery metrics, demonstrating benefits for users and content creators.

### MoFO: Momentum-Filtered Optimizer for Mitigating Forgetting in LLM   Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Yupeng Chen, Senmiao Wang, Yushun Zhang, Zhihang Lin, Haozhe Zhang, Weijian Sun, Tian Ding, Ruoyu Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:04:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks. Typically, LLMs are first pre-trained on large corpora and subsequently fine-tuned on task-specific datasets. However, during fine-tuning, LLMs may forget some knowledge acquired in the pre-training stage, leading to a decline in general capabilities. Existing approaches to mitigate forgetting often rely on access to pre-training data, which may be unavailable in many real-world scenarios--such as fine-tuning checkpoint-only open-source LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a new fine-tuning algorithm termed Momentum-Filtered Optimizer (MoFO). MoFO is an extension of greedy block coordinate descent (BCD) methods: in each iteration, MoFO only updates the model parameters with the largest momentum magnitudes, while keeping all other parameters fixed. MoFO achieves similar fine-tuning performance to the default fine-tuning algorithm while effectively mitigating knowledge forgetting. We validate MoFO through rigorous convergence analysis and extensive experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating forgetting without pre-training data.

### DETAM: Defending LLMs Against Jailbreak Attacks via Targeted Attention   Modification
**Authors**: Yu Li, Han Jiang, Zhihua Wei

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T09:02:12Z

**Summary**: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), jailbreak attacks have become an increasingly pressing safety concern. While safety-aligned LLMs can effectively defend against normal harmful queries, they remain vulnerable to such attacks. Existing defense methods primarily rely on fine-tuning or input modification, which often suffer from limited generalization and reduced utility. To address this, we introduce DETAM, a finetuning-free defense approach that improves the defensive capabilities against jailbreak attacks of LLMs via targeted attention modification. Specifically, we analyze the differences in attention scores between successful and unsuccessful defenses to identify the attention heads sensitive to jailbreak attacks. During inference, we reallocate attention to emphasize the user's core intention, minimizing interference from attack tokens. Our experimental results demonstrate that DETAM outperforms various baselines in jailbreak defense and exhibits robust generalization across different attacks and models, maintaining its effectiveness even on in-the-wild jailbreak data. Furthermore, in evaluating the model's utility, we incorporated over-defense datasets, which further validate the superior performance of our approach. The code will be released immediately upon acceptance.

**Authors**: SoYoung Park, Hyewon Lee, Mingyu Choi, Seunghoon Han, Jong-Ryul Lee, Sungsu Lim, Tae-Ho Kim

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T08:58:40Z

**Summary**: Anomaly segmentation is essential for industrial quality, maintenance, and stability. Existing text-guided zero-shot anomaly segmentation models are effective but rely on fixed prompts, limiting adaptability in diverse industrial scenarios. This highlights the need for flexible, context-aware prompting strategies. We propose Image-Aware Prompt Anomaly Segmentation (IAP-AS), which enhances anomaly segmentation by generating dynamic, context-aware prompts using an image tagging model and a large language model (LLM). IAP-AS extracts object attributes from images to generate context-aware prompts, improving adaptability and generalization in dynamic and unstructured industrial environments. In our experiments, IAP-AS improves the F1-max metric by up to 10%, demonstrating superior adaptability and generalization. It provides a scalable solution for anomaly segmentation across industries

### Integrating LLMs for Grading and Appeal Resolution in Computer Science   Education
**Authors**: I. Aytutuldu, O. Yol, Y. S. Akgul

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T08:49:45Z

**Summary**: This study explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the grading and appeal resolution process in computer science education. We introduce AI-PAT, an AI-powered assessment tool that leverages LLMs to evaluate computer science exams, generate feedback, and address student appeals. AI-PAT was used to assess over 850 exam submissions and handle 185 appeal cases. Our multi-model comparison (ChatGPT, Gemini) reveals strong correlations between model outputs, though significant variability persists depending on configuration and prompt design. Human graders, while internally consistent, showed notable inter-rater disagreement, further highlighting subjectivity in manual evaluation. The appeal process led to grade changes in 74% of cases, indicating the need for continued refinement of AI evaluation strategies. While students appreciated the speed and detail of AI feedback, survey responses revealed trust and fairness concerns. We conclude that AI-PAT offers scalable benefits for formative assessment and feedback, but must be accompanied by transparent grading rubrics, human oversight, and appeal mechanisms to ensure equitable outcomes.

### Finding Flawed Fictions: Evaluating Complex Reasoning in Language Models   via Plot Hole Detection
**Authors**: Kabir Ahuja, Melanie Sclar, Yulia Tsvetkov

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T08:44:04Z

**Summary**: Stories are a fundamental aspect of human experience. Engaging deeply with stories and spotting plot holes -- inconsistencies in a storyline that break the internal logic or rules of a story's world -- requires nuanced reasoning skills, including tracking entities and events and their interplay, abstract thinking, pragmatic narrative understanding, commonsense and social reasoning, and theory of mind. As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate, interpret, and modify text, rigorously assessing their narrative consistency and deeper language understanding becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on surface-level comprehension. In this work, we propose plot hole detection in stories as a proxy to evaluate language understanding and reasoning in LLMs. We introduce FlawedFictionsMaker, a novel algorithm to controllably and carefully synthesize plot holes in human-written stories. Using this algorithm, we construct a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' plot hole detection abilities in stories -- FlawedFictions -- , which is robust to contamination, with human filtering ensuring high quality. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle in accurately solving FlawedFictions regardless of the reasoning effort allowed, with performance significantly degrading as story length increases. Finally, we show that LLM-based story summarization and story generation are prone to introducing plot holes, with more than 50% and 100% increases in plot hole detection rates with respect to human-written originals.

**Authors**: Guanrou Yang, Chen Yang, Qian Chen, Ziyang Ma, Wenxi Chen, Wen Wang, Tianrui Wang, Yifan Yang, Zhikang Niu, Wenrui Liu, Fan Yu, Zhihao Du, Zhifu Gao, ShiLiang Zhang, Xie Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T08:18:11Z

**Summary**: Human speech goes beyond the mere transfer of information; it is a profound exchange of emotions and a connection between individuals. While Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling the emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose EmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained freestyle natural language emotion control, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme tokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) and chain-of-modality (CoM) techniques. Besides, we introduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring expressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language descriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English EmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese Secap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability of existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human perceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and Gemini to assess emotional speech. Demo samples are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EmoVoice-DF55. Dataset, code, and checkpoints will be released.

### Towards Robust Alignment of Language Models: Distributionally   Robustifying Direct Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Junkang Wu, Yuexiang Xie, Zhengyi Yang, Jiancan Wu, Jiawei Chen, Jinyang Gao, Bolin Ding, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T08:05:53Z

**Summary**: This study addresses the challenge of noise in training datasets for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. We categorize noise into pointwise noise, which includes low-quality data points, and pairwise noise, which encompasses erroneous data pair associations that affect preference rankings. Utilizing Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), we enhance DPO's resilience to these types of noise. Our theoretical insights reveal that DPO inherently embeds DRO principles, conferring robustness to pointwise noise, with the regularization coefficient $\beta$ playing a critical role in its noise resistance. Extending this framework, we introduce Distributionally Robustifying DPO (Dr. DPO), which integrates pairwise robustness by optimizing against worst-case pairwise scenarios. The novel hyperparameter $\beta'$ in Dr. DPO allows for fine-tuned control over data pair reliability, providing a strategic balance between exploration and exploitation in noisy training environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Dr. DPO substantially improves the quality of generated text and response accuracy in preference datasets, showcasing enhanced performance in both noisy and noise-free settings. The code is available at https://github.com/junkangwu/Dr_DPO.

### SciLitLLM: How to Adapt LLMs for Scientific Literature Understanding
**Authors**: Sihang Li, Jin Huang, Jiaxi Zhuang, Yaorui Shi, Xiaochen Cai, Mingjun Xu, Xiang Wang, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke, Hengxing Cai

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:56:16Z

**Summary**: Scientific literature understanding is crucial for extracting targeted information and garnering insights, thereby significantly advancing scientific discovery. Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they face challenges in scientific literature understanding, primarily due to (1) a lack of scientific knowledge and (2) unfamiliarity with specialized scientific tasks.   To develop an LLM specialized in scientific literature understanding, we propose a hybrid strategy that integrates continual pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to simultaneously infuse scientific domain knowledge and enhance instruction-following capabilities for domain-specific tasks.cIn this process, we identify two key challenges: (1) constructing high-quality CPT corpora, and (2) generating diverse SFT instructions. We address these challenges through a meticulous pipeline, including PDF text extraction, parsing content error correction, quality filtering, and synthetic instruction creation. Applying this strategy, we present a suite of LLMs: SciLitLLM, specialized in scientific literature understanding. These models demonstrate promising performance on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.   Our contributions are threefold: (1) We present an effective framework that integrates CPT and SFT to adapt LLMs to scientific literature understanding, which can also be easily adapted to other domains. (2) We propose an LLM-based synthesis method to generate diverse and high-quality scientific instructions, resulting in a new instruction set -- SciLitIns -- for supervised fine-tuning in less-represented scientific domains. (3) SciLitLLM achieves promising performance improvements on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.

### CoT-RAG: Integrating Chain of Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation   to Enhance Reasoning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Feiyang Li, Peng Fang, Zhan Shi, Arijit Khan, Fang Wang, Dan Feng, Weihao Wang, Xin Zhang, Yongjian Cui

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:55:09Z

**Summary**: While chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning improves the performance of large language models (LLMs) in complex tasks, it still has two main challenges: the low reliability of relying solely on LLMs to generate reasoning chains and the interference of natural language reasoning chains on the inference logic of LLMs. To address these issues, we propose CoT-RAG, a novel reasoning framework with three key designs: (i) Knowledge Graph-driven CoT Generation, featuring knowledge graphs to modulate reasoning chain generation of LLMs, thereby enhancing reasoning credibility; (ii) Learnable Knowledge Case-aware RAG, which incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into knowledge graphs to retrieve relevant sub-cases and sub-descriptions, providing LLMs with learnable information; (iii) Pseudo-Program Prompting Execution, which encourages LLMs to execute reasoning tasks in pseudo-programs with greater logical rigor. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on nine public datasets, covering three reasoning problems. Compared with the-state-of-the-art methods, CoT-RAG exhibits a significant accuracy improvement, ranging from 4.0% to 23.0%. Furthermore, testing on four domain-specific datasets, CoT-RAG shows remarkable accuracy and efficient execution, highlighting its strong practical applicability and scalability.

### Large Language Models are Good Multi-lingual Learners : When LLMs Meet   Cross-lingual Prompts
**Authors**: Teng Wang, Zhenqi He, Wing-Yin Yu, Xiaojin Fu, Xiongwei Han

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:50:08Z

**Summary**: With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), generating rule-based data for real-world applications has become more accessible. Due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language and the complexity of rule sets, especially in long contexts, LLMs often struggle to follow all specified rules, frequently omitting at least one. To enhance the reasoning and understanding of LLMs on long and complex contexts, we propose a novel prompting strategy Multi-Lingual Prompt, namely MLPrompt, which automatically translates the error-prone rule that an LLM struggles to follow into another language, thus drawing greater attention to it. Experimental results on public datasets across various tasks have shown MLPrompt can outperform state-of-the-art prompting methods such as Chain of Thought, Tree of Thought, and Self-Consistency. Additionally, we introduce a framework integrating MLPrompt with an auto-checking mechanism for structured data generation, with a specific case study in text-to-MIP instances. Further, we extend the proposed framework for text-to-SQL to demonstrate its generation ability towards structured data synthesis.

### AgentCF++: Memory-enhanced LLM-based Agents for Popularity-aware   Cross-domain Recommendations
**Authors**: Jiahao Liu, Shengkang Gu, Dongsheng Li, Guangping Zhang, Mingzhe Han, Hansu Gu, Peng Zhang, Tun Lu, Li Shang, Ning Gu

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:48:48Z

**Summary**: LLM-based user agents, which simulate user interaction behavior, are emerging as a promising approach to enhancing recommender systems. In real-world scenarios, users' interactions often exhibit cross-domain characteristics and are influenced by others. However, the memory design in current methods causes user agents to introduce significant irrelevant information during decision-making in cross-domain scenarios and makes them unable to recognize the influence of other users' interactions, such as popularity factors. To tackle this issue, we propose a dual-layer memory architecture combined with a two-step fusion mechanism. This design avoids irrelevant information during decision-making while ensuring effective integration of cross-domain preferences. We also introduce the concepts of interest groups and group-shared memory to better capture the influence of popularity factors on users with similar interests. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of AgentCF++. Our code is available at https://github.com/jhliu0807/AgentCF-plus.

### PennyLang: Pioneering LLM-Based Quantum Code Generation with a Novel   PennyLane-Centric Dataset
**Authors**: Abdul Basit, Nouhaila Innan, Haider Asif, Minghao Shao, Muhammad Kashif, Alberto Marchisio, Muhammad Shafique

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:46:25Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer remarkable capabilities in code generation, natural language processing, and domain-specific reasoning. However, their application in quantum software development remains underexplored, particularly for PennyLane-a leading framework for hybrid quantum-classical computing. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, high-quality dataset comprising 3,347 PennyLane-specific quantum code samples and contextual descriptions, specifically curated to support LLM training and fine-tuning for quantum code assistance. Our contributions are threefold: (1) the automatic construction and open-source release of a comprehensive PennyLane dataset derived from textbooks, official documentation, and open-source repositories; (2) a structured methodology for data curation, annotation, and formatting to enhance LLM usability and relevance; and (3) a rigorous evaluation of code generation capabilities using both baseline Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a GraphRAG-enhanced pipeline. Using the PennyLang framework, we demonstrate that GraphRAG, when applied to a GPT-4o Mini model, substantially outperforms standard prompting and baseline RAG. Accuracy improves from 20.5% (without RAG) to 58.2% with GraphRAG, showcasing its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving code correctness in quantum programming tasks. Compared to prior efforts focused largely on Qiskit, our work expands LLM-based assistance to the PennyLane ecosystem, contributing practical tools and reproducible methodologies for advancing AI-assisted quantum software development.

### Improving LLM-powered Recommendations with Personalized Information
**Authors**: Jiahao Liu, Xueshuo Yan, Dongsheng Li, Guangping Zhang, Hansu Gu, Peng Zhang, Tun Lu, Li Shang, Ning Gu

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:45:55Z

**Summary**: Due to the lack of explicit reasoning modeling, existing LLM-powered recommendations fail to leverage LLMs' reasoning capabilities effectively. In this paper, we propose a pipeline called CoT-Rec, which integrates two key Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes -- user preference analysis and item perception analysis -- into LLM-powered recommendations, thereby enhancing the utilization of LLMs' reasoning abilities. CoT-Rec consists of two stages: (1) personalized information extraction, where user preferences and item perception are extracted, and (2) personalized information utilization, where this information is incorporated into the LLM-powered recommendation process. Experimental results demonstrate that CoT-Rec shows potential for improving LLM-powered recommendations. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/jhliu0807/CoT-Rec.

### Joint Power and Bit Allocation for Precoded Massive MIMO Channels
**Authors**: Shuiyin Liu, Amin Sakzad

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:22:09Z

**Summary**: This work addresses the joint optimization of power and bit allocation in precoded large-scale n x n MIMO systems with discrete input alphabets, specifically QAM constellations. We propose an adaptive QAM scheme that maintains a fixed gap to the Gaussian-input capacity for a given n. A key finding is that, under the proposed scheme, the mercury/waterfilling (MWF) solution reduces analytically to the classical water-filling (WF) policy. Furthermore, the adaptive QAM configuration can be precomputed under the large-system assumption, enabling the replacement of full SVD with truncated SVD and yielding substantial computational savings. To support practical deployment, we develop a bit-allocation algorithm that meets a target transmission data rate while minimizing the overall decoding error rate and preserving computational complexity at O(n log n). Simulation results confirm that the proposed truncated SVD precoding, paired with the joint power and bit allocation, achieves superior decoding performance relative to conventional approaches, while operating at significantly lower complexity.

### Adversarial Style Augmentation via Large Language Model for Robust Fake   News Detection
**Authors**: Sungwon Park, Sungwon Han, Xing Xie, Jae-Gil Lee, Meeyoung Cha

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:15:33Z

**Summary**: The spread of fake news harms individuals and presents a critical social challenge that must be addressed. Although numerous algorithmic and insightful features have been developed to detect fake news, many of these features can be manipulated with style-conversion attacks, especially with the emergence of advanced language models, making it more difficult to differentiate from genuine news. This study proposes adversarial style augmentation, AdStyle, designed to train a fake news detector that remains robust against various style-conversion attacks. The primary mechanism involves the strategic use of LLMs to automatically generate a diverse and coherent array of style-conversion attack prompts, enhancing the generation of particularly challenging prompts for the detector. Experiments indicate that our augmentation strategy significantly improves robustness and detection performance when evaluated on fake news benchmark datasets.

### Optimizing Electric Vehicle Charging Station Locations: A Data-driven   System with Multi-source Fusion
**Authors**: Lihuan Li, Du Yin, Hao Xue, David Lillo-Trynes, Flora Salim

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:10:48Z

**Summary**: With the growing electric vehicles (EVs) charging demand, urban planners face the challenges of providing charging infrastructure at optimal locations. For example, range anxiety during long-distance travel and the inadequate distribution of residential charging stations are the major issues many cities face. To achieve reasonable estimation and deployment of the charging demand, we develop a data-driven system based on existing EV trips in New South Wales (NSW) state, Australia, incorporating multiple factors that enhance the geographical feasibility of recommended charging stations. Our system integrates data sources including EV trip data, geographical data such as route data and Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries, as well as features like fire and flood risks, and Points of Interest (POIs). We visualize our results to intuitively demonstrate the findings from our data-driven, multi-source fusion system, and evaluate them through case studies. The outcome of this work can provide a platform for discussion to develop new insights that could be used to give guidance on where to position future EV charging stations.

### Large Language Models for Validating Network Protocol Parsers
**Authors**: Mingwei Zheng, Danning Xie, Xiangyu Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T07:09:56Z

**Summary**: Network protocol parsers are essential for enabling correct and secure communication between devices. Bugs in these parsers can introduce critical vulnerabilities, including memory corruption, information leakage, and denial-of-service attacks. An intuitive way to assess parser correctness is to compare the implementation with its official protocol standard. However, this comparison is challenging because protocol standards are typically written in natural language, whereas implementations are in source code. Existing methods like model checking, fuzzing, and differential testing have been used to find parsing bugs, but they either require significant manual effort or ignore the protocol standards, limiting their ability to detect semantic violations. To enable more automated validation of parser implementations against protocol standards, we propose PARVAL, a multi-agent framework built on large language models (LLMs). PARVAL leverages the capabilities of LLMs to understand both natural language and code. It transforms both protocol standards and their implementations into a unified intermediate representation, referred to as format specifications, and performs a differential comparison to uncover inconsistencies. We evaluate PARVAL on the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol. Our experiments demonstrate that PARVAL successfully identifies inconsistencies between the implementation and its RFC standard, achieving a low false positive rate of 5.6%. PARVAL uncovers seven unique bugs, including five previously unknown issues.

### Unified Parameter-Efficient Unlearning for LLMs
**Authors**: Chenlu Ding, Jiancan Wu, Yancheng Yuan, Jinda Lu, Kai Zhang, Alex Su, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T06:58:12Z

**Summary**: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, enabling advanced understanding and reasoning capabilities across a variety of tasks. Fine-tuning these models for specific domains, particularly through Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies like LoRA, has become a prevalent practice due to its efficiency. However, this raises significant privacy and security concerns, as models may inadvertently retain and disseminate sensitive or undesirable information. To address these issues, we introduce a novel instance-wise unlearning framework, LLMEraser, which systematically categorizes unlearning tasks and applies precise parameter adjustments using influence functions. Unlike traditional unlearning techniques that are often limited in scope and require extensive retraining, LLMEraser is designed to handle a broad spectrum of unlearning tasks without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LLMEraser excels in efficiently managing various unlearning scenarios while maintaining the overall integrity and efficacy of the models.

### Prejudge-Before-Think: Enhancing Large Language Models at Test-Time by   Process Prejudge Reasoning
**Authors**: Jianing Wang, Jin Jiang, Yang Liu, Mengdi Zhang, Xunliang Cai

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T06:42:30Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a new \emph{process prejudge} strategy in LLM reasoning to demonstrate that bootstrapping with process prejudge allows the LLM to adaptively anticipate the errors encountered when advancing the subsequent reasoning steps, similar to people sometimes pausing to think about what mistakes may occur and how to avoid them, rather than relying solely on trial and error. Specifically, we define a prejudge node in the rationale, which represents a reasoning step, with at least one step that follows the prejudge node that has no paths toward the correct answer. To synthesize the prejudge reasoning process, we present an automated reasoning framework with a dynamic tree-searching strategy. This framework requires only one LLM to perform answer judging, response critiquing, prejudge generation, and thought completion. Furthermore, we develop a two-phase training mechanism with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to further enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Experimental results from competition-level complex reasoning demonstrate that our method can teach the model to prejudge before thinking and significantly enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs. Code and data is released at https://github.com/wjn1996/Prejudge-Before-Think.

### Cross-cultural Deployment of Autonomous Vehicles Using Data-light   Inverse Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Hongliang Lu, Shuqi Shen, Junjie Yang, Chao Lu, Xinhu Zheng, Hai Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T05:59:29Z

**Summary**: More than the adherence to specific traffic regulations, driving culture touches upon a more implicit part - an informal, conventional, collective behavioral pattern followed by drivers - that varies across countries, regions, and even cities. Such cultural divergence has become one of the biggest challenges in deploying autonomous vehicles (AVs) across diverse regions today. The current emergence of data-driven methods has shown a potential solution to enable culture-compatible driving through learning from data, but what if some underdeveloped regions cannot provide sufficient local data to inform driving culture? This issue is particularly significant for a broader global AV market. Here, we propose a cross-cultural deployment scheme for AVs, called data-light inverse reinforcement learning, designed to re-calibrate culture-specific AVs and assimilate them into other cultures. First, we report the divergence in driving cultures through a comprehensive comparative analysis of naturalistic driving datasets on highways from three countries: Germany, China, and the USA. Then, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme by testing the expeditious cross-cultural deployment across these three countries, with cumulative testing mileage of over 56084 km. The performance is particularly advantageous when cross-cultural deployment is carried out without affluent local data. Results show that we can reduce the dependence on local data by a margin of 98.67% at best. This study is expected to bring a broader, fairer AV global market, particularly in those regions that lack enough local data to develop culture-compatible AVs.

### LLM Sensitivity Evaluation Framework for Clinical Diagnosis
**Authors**: Chenwei Yan, Xiangling Fu, Yuxuan Xiong, Tianyi Wang, Siu Cheung Hui, Ji Wu, Xien Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T05:35:11Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various domains. However, for clinical diagnosis, higher expectations are required for LLM's reliability and sensitivity: thinking like physicians and remaining sensitive to key medical information that affects diagnostic reasoning, as subtle variations can lead to different diagnosis results. Yet, existing works focus mainly on investigating the sensitivity of LLMs to irrelevant context and overlook the importance of key information. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs, i.e. GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, Claude3 and LLaMA2-7b, to key medical information by introducing different perturbation strategies. The evaluation results highlight the limitations of current LLMs in remaining sensitive to key medical information for diagnostic decision-making. The evolution of LLMs must focus on improving their reliability, enhancing their ability to be sensitive to key information, and effectively utilizing this information. These improvements will enhance human trust in LLMs and facilitate their practical application in real-world scenarios. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/chenwei23333/DiagnosisQA.

### Everything You Wanted to Know About LLM-based Vulnerability Detection   But Were Afraid to Ask
**Authors**: Yue Li, Xiao Li, Hao Wu, Minghui Xu, Yue Zhang, Xiuzhen Cheng, Fengyuan Xu, Sheng Zhong

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T05:32:47Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models are a promising tool for automated vulnerability detection, thanks to their success in code generation and repair. However, despite widespread adoption, a critical question remains: Are LLMs truly effective at detecting real-world vulnerabilities? Current evaluations, which often assess models on isolated functions or files, ignore the broader execution and data-flow context essential for understanding vulnerabilities. This oversight leads to two types of misleading outcomes: incorrect conclusions and flawed rationales, collectively undermining the reliability of prior assessments. Therefore, in this paper, we challenge three widely held community beliefs: that LLMs are (i) unreliable, (ii) insensitive to code patches, and (iii) performance-plateaued across model scales. We argue that these beliefs are artifacts of context-deprived evaluations. To address this, we propose CORRECT (Context-Rich Reasoning Evaluation of Code with Trust), a new evaluation framework that systematically incorporates contextual information into LLM-based vulnerability detection. We construct a context-rich dataset of 2,000 vulnerable-patched program pairs spanning 99 CWEs and evaluate 13 LLMs across four model families. Our framework elicits both binary predictions and natural-language rationales, which are further validated using LLM-as-a-judge techniques. Our findings overturn existing misconceptions. When provided with sufficient context, SOTA LLMs achieve significantly improved performance (e.g., 0.7 F1-score on key CWEs), with 0.8 precision. We show that most false positives stem from reasoning errors rather than misclassification, and that while model and test-time scaling improve performance, they introduce diminishing returns and trade-offs in recall. Finally, we uncover new flaws in current LLM-based detection systems, such as limited generalization and overthinking biases.

### CodeVisionary: An Agent-based Framework for Evaluating Large Language   Models in Code Generation
**Authors**: Xinchen Wang, Pengfei Gao, Chao Peng, Ruida Hu, Cuiyun Gao

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T05:26:32Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, underscoring the critical need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation. Existing evaluation approaches fall into three categories, including human-centered, metric-based, and LLM-based. Considering that human-centered approaches are labour-intensive and metric-based ones overly rely on reference answers, LLM-based approaches are gaining increasing attention due to their stronger contextual understanding capabilities and superior efficiency. However, the performance of LLM-based approaches remains limited due to: (1) lack of multisource domain knowledge, and (2) insufficient comprehension of complex code.   To mitigate the limitations, we propose CodeVisionary, the first LLM-based agent framework for evaluating LLMs in code generation. CodeVisionary consists of two stages: (1) Multiscore knowledge analysis stage, which aims to gather multisource and comprehensive domain knowledge by formulating and executing a stepwise evaluation plan. (2) Negotiation-based scoring stage, which involves multiple judges engaging in discussions to better comprehend the complex code and reach a consensus on the evaluation score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeVisionary achieves the best performance for evaluating LLMs in code generation, outperforming the best baseline methods with average improvements of 0.202, 0.139, and 0.117 in Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall-Tau coefficients, respectively. Besides, CodeVisionary provides detailed evaluation reports, which assist developers in identifying shortcomings and making improvements. The resources of CodeVisionary are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CodeVisionary.

### From Large to Super-Tiny: End-to-End Optimization for Cost-Efficient   LLMs
**Authors**: Jiliang Ni, Jiachen Pu, Zhongyi Yang, Kun Zhou, Hui Wang, Xiaoliang Xiao, Dakui Wang, Xin Li, Jingfeng Luo, Conggang Hu

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T05:25:22Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence by optimizing traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines, improving performance and generalization. This has spurred their integration into various systems. Many NLP systems, including ours, employ a "one-stage" pipeline directly incorporating LLMs. While effective, this approach incurs substantial costs and latency due to the need for large model parameters to achieve satisfactory outcomes. This paper introduces a three-stage cost-efficient end-to-end LLM deployment pipeline-including prototyping, knowledge transfer, and model compression-to tackle the cost-performance dilemma in LLM-based frameworks. Our approach yields a super tiny model optimized for cost and performance in online systems, simplifying the system architecture. Initially, by transforming complex tasks into a function call-based LLM-driven pipeline, an optimal performance prototype system is constructed to produce high-quality data as a teacher model. The second stage combine techniques like rejection fine-tuning, reinforcement learning and knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge to a smaller 0.5B student model, delivering effective performance at minimal cost. The final stage applies quantization and pruning to extremely compress model to 0.4B, achieving ultra-low latency and cost. The framework's modular design and cross-domain capabilities suggest potential applicability in other NLP areas.

### If LLMs Would Just Look: Simple Line-by-line Checking Improves   Vulnerability Localization
**Authors**: Yue Li, Xiao Li, Hao Wu, Yue Zhang, Xiuzhen Cheng, Yating Liu, Fengyuan Xu, Sheng Zhong

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T04:46:00Z

**Summary**: The rapid expansion of software systems and the growing number of reported vulnerabilities have emphasized the importance of accurately identifying vulnerable code segments. Traditional methods for vulnerability localization, such as manual code audits or rule-based tools, are often time-consuming and limited in scope, typically focusing on specific programming languages or types of vulnerabilities. In recent years, the introduction of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT and LLaMA has opened new possibilities for automating vulnerability detection. However, while LLMs show promise in this area, they face challenges, particularly in maintaining accuracy over longer code contexts. This paper introduces LOVA, a novel framework leveraging the self-attention mechanisms inherent in LLMs to enhance vulnerability localization. Our key insight is that self-attention mechanisms assign varying importance to different parts of the input, making it possible to track how much attention the model focuses on specific lines of code. In the context of vulnerability localization, the hypothesis is that vulnerable lines of code will naturally attract higher attention weights because they have a greater influence on the model's output. By systematically tracking changes in attention weights and focusing on specific lines of code, LOVA improves the precision of identifying vulnerable lines across various programming languages. Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate that LOVA significantly outperforms existing LLM-based approaches, achieving up to a 5.3x improvement in F1-scores. LOVA also demonstrated strong scalability, with up to a 14.6x improvement in smart contract vulnerability localization across languages like C, Python, Java, and Solidity. Its robustness was proven through consistent performance across different LLM architectures.

**Summary**: This paper presents an appendix to the original NeBula autonomy solution developed by the TEAM CoSTAR (Collaborative SubTerranean Autonomous Robots), participating in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. Specifically, this paper presents extensions to NeBula's hardware, software, and algorithmic components that focus on increasing the range and scale of the exploration environment. From the algorithmic perspective, we discuss the following extensions to the original NeBula framework: (i) large-scale geometric and semantic environment mapping; (ii) an adaptive positioning system; (iii) probabilistic traversability analysis and local planning; (iv) large-scale POMDP-based global motion planning and exploration behavior; (v) large-scale networking and decentralized reasoning; (vi) communication-aware mission planning; and (vii) multi-modal ground-aerial exploration solutions. We demonstrate the application and deployment of the presented systems and solutions in various large-scale underground environments, including limestone mine exploration scenarios as well as deployment in the DARPA Subterranean challenge.

### Chain-of-Thought Textual Reasoning for Few-shot Temporal Action   Localization
**Authors**: Hongwei Ji, Wulian Yun, Mengshi Qi, Huadong Ma

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T04:35:35Z

**Summary**: Traditional temporal action localization (TAL) methods rely on large amounts of detailed annotated data, whereas few-shot TAL reduces this dependence by using only a few training samples to identify unseen action categories. However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark.

**Authors**: Dayu Yang, Antoine Simoulin, Xin Qian, Xiaoyi Liu, Yuwei Cao, Zhaopu Teng, Grey Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T04:32:43Z

**Summary**: High-quality code documentation is crucial for software development especially in the era of AI. However, generating it automatically using Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging, as existing approaches often produce incomplete, unhelpful, or factually incorrect outputs. We introduce DocAgent, a novel multi-agent collaborative system using topological code processing for incremental context building. Specialized agents (Reader, Searcher, Writer, Verifier, Orchestrator) then collaboratively generate documentation. We also propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework assessing Completeness, Helpfulness, and Truthfulness. Comprehensive experiments show DocAgent significantly outperforms baselines consistently. Our ablation study confirms the vital role of the topological processing order. DocAgent offers a robust approach for reliable code documentation generation in complex and proprietary repositories.

### Customizing Emotional Support: How Do Individuals Construct and Interact   With LLM-Powered Chatbots
**Authors**: Xi Zheng, Zhuoyang Li, Xinning Gui, Yuhan Luo

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T04:23:00Z

**Summary**: Personalized support is essential to fulfill individuals' emotional needs and sustain their mental well-being. Large language models (LLMs), with great customization flexibility, hold promises to enable individuals to create their own emotional support agents. In this work, we developed ChatLab, where users could construct LLM-powered chatbots with additional interaction features including voices and avatars. Using a Research through Design approach, we conducted a week-long field study followed by interviews and design activities (N = 22), which uncovered how participants created diverse chatbot personas for emotional reliance, confronting stressors, connecting to intellectual discourse, reflecting mirrored selves, etc. We found that participants actively enriched the personas they constructed, shaping the dynamics between themselves and the chatbot to foster open and honest conversations. They also suggested other customizable features, such as integrating online activities and adjustable memory settings. Based on these findings, we discuss opportunities for enhancing personalized emotional support through emerging AI technologies.

### Modular XL-Array-Enabled 3-D Localization based on Hybrid   Spherical-Planar Wave Model in Terahertz Systems
**Authors**: Yang Zhang, Ruidong Li, Cunhua Pan, Hong Ren, Tuo Wu, Changhong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T04:12:47Z

**Summary**: This work considers the three-dimensional (3-D) positioning problem in a Terahertz (THz) system enabled by a modular extra-large (XL) array with sub-connected architecture. Our purpose is to estimate the Cartesian Coordinates of multiple user equipments (UEs) with the received signal of the RF chains while considering the spatial non-stationarity (SNS). We apply the hybrid spherical-planar wave model (HSPWM) as the channel model owing to the structual feature of the modular array, and propose a 3-D localization algorithm with relatively high accuracy and low complexity. Specifically, we first distinguish the visible sub-arrays (SAs) located in the VR and estimate the angles-of-arrival (AoAs) from each UE to typical visible SAs with the largest receive power via compressed sensing (CS) method. In addition, we apply the weighted least square (WLS) method to obtain a coarse 3-D position estimation of each UE according to the AoA estimations. Then, we estimate the AoAs of the other SAs with a reduced dictionary (RD)-CS-based method for lower computational complexity, and utilize all the efficient AoA estimations to derive a fine position estimation. Simulation results indicate that the proposed positioning framework based on modular XL-array can achieve satisfactory accuracy with evident reduction in complexity. Furthermore, the deployment of SAs and the allocation of antenna elements need to be specially designed for better positioning performance.

### Balancing Engagement and Polarization: Multi-Objective Alignment of News   Content Using LLMs
**Authors**: Mengjie, Cheng, Elie Ofek, Hema Yoganarasimhan

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T03:50:56Z

**Summary**: We study how media firms can use LLMs to generate news content that aligns with multiple objectives -- making content more engaging while maintaining a preferred level of polarization/slant consistent with the firm's editorial policy. Using news articles from The New York Times, we first show that more engaging human-written content tends to be more polarizing. Further, naively employing LLMs (with prompts or standard Direct Preference Optimization approaches) to generate more engaging content can also increase polarization. This has an important managerial and policy implication: using LLMs without building in controls for limiting slant can exacerbate news media polarization. We present a constructive solution to this problem based on the Multi-Objective Direct Preference Optimization (MODPO) algorithm, a novel approach that integrates Direct Preference Optimization with multi-objective optimization techniques. We build on open-source LLMs and develop a new language model that simultaneously makes content more engaging while maintaining a preferred editorial stance. Our model achieves this by modifying content characteristics strongly associated with polarization but that have a relatively smaller impact on engagement. Our approach and findings apply to other settings where firms seek to use LLMs for content creation to achieve multiple objectives, e.g., advertising and social media.

### Trust, but verify
**Authors**: Michael J. Yuan, Carlos Campoy, Sydney Lai, James Snewin, Ju Long

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T03:49:53Z

**Summary**: Decentralized AI agent networks, such as Gaia, allows individuals to run customized LLMs on their own computers and then provide services to the public. However, in order to maintain service quality, the network must verify that individual nodes are running their designated LLMs. In this paper, we demonstrate that in a cluster of mostly honest nodes, we can detect nodes that run unauthorized or incorrect LLM through social consensus of its peers. We will discuss the algorithm and experimental data from the Gaia network. We will also discuss the intersubjective validation system, implemented as an EigenLayer AVS to introduce financial incentives and penalties to encourage honest behavior from LLM nodes.

### Quantifying the benefits of code hints for refactoring deprecated Java   APIs
**Authors**: Cristina David, Pascal Kesseli, Daniel Kroening, Hanliang Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T03:23:33Z

**Summary**: When done manually, refactoring legacy code in order to eliminate uses of deprecated APIs is an error-prone and time-consuming process. In this paper, we investigate to which degree refactorings for deprecated Java APIs can be automated, and quantify the benefit of Javadoc code hints for this task. To this end, we build a symbolic and a neural engine for the automatic refactoring of deprecated APIs. The former is based on type-directed and component-based program synthesis, whereas the latter uses LLMs. We applied our engines to refactor the deprecated methods in the Oracle JDK 15. Our experiments show that code hints are enabling for the automation of this task: even the worst engine correctly refactors 71% of the tasks with code hints, which drops to at best 14% on tasks without. Adding more code hints to Javadoc can hence boost the refactoring of code that uses deprecated APIs.

### A Comprehensive Survey of Mixture-of-Experts: Algorithms, Theory, and   Applications
**Authors**: Siyuan Mu, Sen Lin

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T02:53:01Z

**Summary**: Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved astonishing successes in many domains, especially with the recent breakthroughs in the development of foundational large models. These large models, leveraging their extensive training data, provide versatile solutions for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, as modern datasets become increasingly diverse and complex, the development of large AI models faces two major challenges: (1) the enormous consumption of computational resources and deployment difficulties, and (2) the difficulty in fitting heterogeneous and complex data, which limits the usability of the models. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models has recently attracted much attention in addressing these challenges, by dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant sub-models to process input data. It has been shown that MoEs can significantly improve model performance and efficiency with fewer resources, particularly excelling in handling large-scale, multimodal data. Given the tremendous potential MoE has demonstrated across various domains, it is urgent to provide a comprehensive summary of recent advancements of MoEs in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE have their limitations, e.g., being outdated or lacking discussion on certain key areas, and we aim to address these gaps. In this paper, we first introduce the basic design of MoE, including gating functions, expert networks, routing mechanisms, training strategies, and system design. We then explore the algorithm design of MoE in important machine learning paradigms such as continual learning, meta-learning, multi-task learning, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, we summarize theoretical studies aimed at understanding MoE and review its applications in computer vision and natural language processing. Finally, we discuss promising future research directions.

### Secure Multifaceted-RAG for Enterprise: Hybrid Knowledge Retrieval with   Security Filtering
**Authors**: Grace Byun, Shinsun Lee, Nayoung Choi, Jinho Choi

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T02:51:29Z

**Summary**: Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face challenges in enterprise settings due to limited retrieval scope and data security risks. When relevant internal documents are unavailable, the system struggles to generate accurate and complete responses. Additionally, using closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about exposing proprietary information. To address these issues, we propose the Secure Multifaceted-RAG (SecMulti-RAG) framework, which retrieves not only from internal documents but also from two supplementary sources: pre-generated expert knowledge for anticipated queries and on-demand external LLM-generated knowledge. To mitigate security risks, we adopt a local open-source generator and selectively utilize external LLMs only when prompts are deemed safe by a filtering mechanism. This approach enhances completeness, prevents data leakage, and reduces costs. In our evaluation on a report generation task in the automotive industry, SecMulti-RAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG - achieving 79.3 to 91.9 percent win rates across correctness, richness, and helpfulness in LLM-based evaluation, and 56.3 to 70.4 percent in human evaluation. This highlights SecMulti-RAG as a practical and secure solution for enterprise RAG.

### DNR Bench: Benchmarking Over-Reasoning in Reasoning LLMs
**Authors**: Masoud Hashemi, Oluwanifemi Bamgbose, Sathwik Tejaswi Madhusudhan, Jishnu Sethumadhavan Nair, Aman Tiwari, Vikas Yadav

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T02:38:12Z

**Summary**: Test-time scaling has significantly improved large language model performance, enabling deeper reasoning to solve complex problems. However, this increased reasoning capability also leads to excessive token generation and unnecessary problem-solving attempts. We introduce Don\'t Reason Bench (DNR Bench), a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs ability to robustly understand the tricky reasoning triggers and avoiding unnecessary generation. DNR Bench consists of 150 adversarially designed prompts that are easy for humans to understand and respond to, but surprisingly not for many of the recent prominent LLMs. DNR Bench tests models abilities across different capabilities, such as instruction adherence, hallucination avoidance, redundancy filtering, and unanswerable question recognition. We evaluate reasoning LLMs (RLMs), including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI O3-mini, Claude-3.7-sonnet and compare them against a powerful non-reasoning model, e.g., GPT-4o. Our experiments reveal that RLMs generate up to 70x more tokens than necessary, often failing at tasks that simpler non-reasoning models handle efficiently with higher accuracy. Our findings underscore the need for more effective training and inference strategies in RLMs.

### STAMP Your Content: Proving Dataset Membership via Watermarked   Rephrasings
**Authors**: Saksham Rastogi, Pratyush Maini, Danish Pruthi

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T02:25:08Z

**Summary**: Given how large parts of publicly available text are crawled to pretrain large language models (LLMs), data creators increasingly worry about the inclusion of their proprietary data for model training without attribution or licensing. Their concerns are also shared by benchmark curators whose test-sets might be compromised. In this paper, we present STAMP, a framework for detecting dataset membership-i.e., determining the inclusion of a dataset in the pretraining corpora of LLMs. Given an original piece of content, our proposal involves first generating multiple rephrases, each embedding a watermark with a unique secret key. One version is to be released publicly, while others are to be kept private. Subsequently, creators can compare model likelihoods between public and private versions using paired statistical tests to prove membership. We show that our framework can successfully detect contamination across four benchmarks which appear only once in the training data and constitute less than 0.001% of the total tokens, outperforming several contamination detection and dataset inference baselines. We verify that STAMP preserves both the semantic meaning and the utility of the original data in comparing different models. We apply STAMP to two real-world scenarios to confirm the inclusion of paper abstracts and blog articles in the pretraining corpora.

### A Model-Based Approach to Imitation Learning through Multi-Step   Predictions
**Authors**: Haldun Balim, Yang Hu, Yuyang Zhang, Na Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T02:19:30Z

**Summary**: Imitation learning is a widely used approach for training agents to replicate expert behavior in complex decision-making tasks. However, existing methods often struggle with compounding errors and limited generalization, due to the inherent challenge of error correction and the distribution shift between training and deployment. In this paper, we present a novel model-based imitation learning framework inspired by model predictive control, which addresses these limitations by integrating predictive modeling through multi-step state predictions. Our method outperforms traditional behavior cloning numerical benchmarks, demonstrating superior robustness to distribution shift and measurement noise both in available data and during execution. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees on the sample complexity and error bounds of our method, offering insights into its convergence properties.

### WaterFlow: Learning Fast & Robust Watermarks using Stable Diffusion
**Authors**: Vinay Shukla, Prachee Sharma, Ryan Rossi, Sungchul Kim, Tong Yu, Aditya Grover

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T02:12:50Z

**Summary**: The ability to embed watermarks in images is a fundamental problem of interest for computer vision, and is exacerbated by the rapid rise of generated imagery in recent times. Current state-of-the-art techniques suffer from computational and statistical challenges such as the slow execution speed for practical deployments. In addition, other works trade off fast watermarking speeds but suffer greatly in their robustness or perceptual quality. In this work, we propose WaterFlow (WF), a fast and extremely robust approach for high fidelity visual watermarking based on a learned latent-dependent watermark. Our approach utilizes a pretrained latent diffusion model to encode an arbitrary image into a latent space and produces a learned watermark that is then planted into the Fourier Domain of the latent. The transformation is specified via invertible flow layers that enhance the expressivity of the latent space of the pre-trained model to better preserve image quality while permitting robust and tractable detection. Most notably, WaterFlow demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on general robustness and is the first method capable of effectively defending against difficult combination attacks. We validate our findings on three widely used real and generated datasets: MS-COCO, DiffusionDB, and WikiArt.

### Revealing the Intrinsic Ethical Vulnerability of Aligned Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Jiawei Lian, Jianhong Pan, Lefan Wang, Yi Wang, Shaohui Mei, Lap-Pui Chau

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T02:10:21Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are foundational explorations to artificial general intelligence, yet their alignment with human values via instruction tuning and preference learning achieves only superficial compliance. Here, we demonstrate that harmful knowledge embedded during pretraining persists as indelible "dark patterns" in LLMs' parametric memory, evading alignment safeguards and resurfacing under adversarial inducement at distributional shifts. In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts. This combined theoretical and empirical approach achieves a 100% attack success rate across 19 out of 23 state-of-the-art aligned LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA-3, revealing their universal vulnerabilities.

### Multimodal machine learning with large language embedding model for   polymer property prediction
**Authors**: Tianren Zhang, Dai-Bei Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T02:07:52Z

**Summary**: Contemporary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have harnessed extensive computational power and diverse text corpora to achieve remarkable proficiency in interpreting and generating domain-specific content, including materials science. To leverage the domain knowledge embedded within these models, we propose a simple yet effective multimodal architecture, PolyLLMem, which integrates text embeddings generated by Llama 3 with molecular structure embeddings derived from Uni-Mol, for polymer properties prediction tasks. In our model, Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers were also incorporated during the property prediction tasks to refine the embeddings based on our limited polymer dataset, thereby enhancing their chemical relevance for polymer SMILES representation. This balanced fusion of fine-tuned textual and structural information enables PolyLLMem to accurately predict a variety of polymer properties despite the scarcity of training data. Its performance is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of graph-based models, as well as transformer-based models that typically require pretraining on millions of polymer samples. These findings demonstrate that LLM, such as Llama, can effectively capture chemical information encoded in polymer PSMILES, and underscore the efficacy of multimodal fusion of LLM embeddings and molecular structure embeddings in overcoming data scarcity and accelerating the discovery of advanced polymeric materials.

### How Breakable Is Privacy: Probing and Resisting Model Inversion Attacks   in Collaborative Inference
**Authors**: Rongke Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T02:06:06Z

**Summary**: Collaborative inference (CI) improves computational efficiency for edge devices by transmitting intermediate features to cloud models. However, this process inevitably exposes feature representations to model inversion attacks (MIAs), enabling unauthorized data reconstruction. Despite extensive research, there is no established criterion for assessing the difficulty of MIA implementation, leaving a fundamental question unanswered: \textit{What factors truly and verifiably determine the attack's success in CI?} Moreover, existing defenses lack the theoretical foundation described above, making it challenging to regulate feature information effectively while ensuring privacy and minimizing computational overhead. These shortcomings introduce three key challenges: theoretical gap, methodological limitation, and practical constraint.   To overcome these challenges, we propose the first theoretical criterion to assess MIA difficulty in CI, identifying mutual information, entropy, and effective information volume as key influencing factors. The validity of this criterion is demonstrated by using the mutual information neural estimator. Building on this insight, we propose SiftFunnel, a privacy-preserving framework to resist MIA while maintaining usability. Specifically, we incorporate linear and non-linear correlation constraints alongside label smoothing to suppress redundant information transmission, effectively balancing privacy and usability. To enhance deployability, the edge model adopts a funnel-shaped structure with attention mechanisms, strengthening privacy while reducing computational and storage burdens. Experiments show that, compared to state-of-the-art defense, SiftFunnel increases reconstruction error by $\sim$30\%, lowers mutual and effective information metrics by $\geq$50\%, and reduces edge burdens by almost $20\times$, while maintaining comparable usability.

### Assessing Judging Bias in Large Reasoning Models: An Empirical Study
**Authors**: Qian Wang, Zhanzhi Lou, Zhenheng Tang, Nuo Chen, Xuandong Zhao, Wenxuan Zhang, Dawn Song, Bingsheng He

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T02:05:38Z

**Summary**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o1 have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, raising important questions about their biases in LLM-as-a-judge settings. We present a comprehensive benchmark comparing judging biases between LLMs and LRMs across both subjective preference-alignment datasets and objective fact-based datasets. Through investigation of bandwagon, authority, position, and distraction biases, we uncover four key findings: (1) despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, LRMs remain susceptible to the above biases; (2) LRMs demonstrate better robustness than LLMs specifically on fact-related datasets; (3) LRMs exhibit notable position bias, preferring options in later positions; and (4) we identify a novel "superficial reflection bias" where phrases mimicking reasoning (e.g., "wait, let me think...") significantly influence model judgments. To address these biases, we design and evaluate three mitigation strategies: specialized system prompts that reduce judging biases by up to 19\% in preference alignment datasets and 14\% in fact-related datasets, in-context learning that provides up to 27\% improvement on preference tasks but shows inconsistent results on factual tasks, and a self-reflection mechanism that reduces biases by up to 10\% in preference datasets and 16\% in fact-related datasets, with self-reflection proving particularly effective for LRMs. Our work provides crucial insights for developing more reliable LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, especially as LRMs become increasingly deployed as automated judges.

### Towards a Multi-Agent Vision-Language System for Zero-Shot Novel   Hazardous Object Detection for Autonomous Driving Safety
**Authors**: Shashank Shriram, Srinivasa Perisetla, Aryan Keskar, Harsha Krishnaswamy, Tonko Emil Westerhof Bossen, Andreas Møgelmose, Ross Greer

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T01:25:02Z

**Summary**: Detecting anomalous hazards in visual data, particularly in video streams, is a critical challenge in autonomous driving. Existing models often struggle with unpredictable, out-of-label hazards due to their reliance on predefined object categories. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates vision-language reasoning with zero-shot object detection to improve hazard identification and explanation. Our pipeline consists of a Vision-Language Model (VLM), a Large Language Model (LLM), in order to detect hazardous objects within a traffic scene. We refine object detection by incorporating OpenAI's CLIP model to match predicted hazards with bounding box annotations, improving localization accuracy. To assess model performance, we create a ground truth dataset by denoising and extending the foundational COOOL (Challenge-of-Out-of-Label) anomaly detection benchmark dataset with complete natural language descriptions for hazard annotations. We define a means of hazard detection and labeling evaluation on the extended dataset using cosine similarity. This evaluation considers the semantic similarity between the predicted hazard description and the annotated ground truth for each video. Additionally, we release a set of tools for structuring and managing large-scale hazard detection datasets. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of current vision-language-based approaches, offering insights into future improvements in autonomous hazard detection systems.

### Where is the answer? Investigating Positional Bias in Language Model   Knowledge Extraction
**Authors**: Kuniaki Saito, Kihyuk Sohn, Chen-Yu Lee, Yoshitaka Ushiku

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T00:24:19Z

**Summary**: Large language models require updates to remain up-to-date or adapt to new domains by fine-tuning them with new documents. One key is memorizing the latest information in a way that the memorized information is extractable with a query prompt. However, LLMs suffer from a phenomenon called perplexity curse; despite minimizing document perplexity during fine-tuning, LLMs struggle to extract information through a prompt sentence. In this new knowledge acquisition and extraction, we find a very intriguing fact that LLMs can accurately answer questions about the first sentence, but they struggle to extract information described in the middle or end of the documents used for fine-tuning. Our study suggests that the auto-regressive training causes this issue; each token is prompted by reliance on all previous tokens, which hinders the model from recalling information from training documents by question prompts. To conduct the in-depth study, we publish both synthetic and real datasets, enabling the evaluation of the QA performance w.r.t. the position of the corresponding answer in a document. Our investigation shows that even a large model suffers from the perplexity curse, but regularization such as denoising auto-regressive loss can enhance the information extraction from diverse positions. These findings will be (i) a key to improving knowledge extraction from LLMs and (ii) new elements to discuss the trade-off between RAG and fine-tuning in adapting LLMs to a new domain.

### Understanding the Difficulty of Low-Precision Post-Training Quantization   for LLMs
**Authors**: Zifei Xu, Sayeh Sharify, Wanzin Yazar, Tristan Webb, Xin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T23:26:11Z

**Summary**: Large language models of high parameter counts are computationally expensive, yet can be made much more efficient by compressing their weights to very low numerical precision. This can be achieved either through post-training quantization by minimizing local, layer-wise quantization errors, or through quantization-aware fine-tuning by minimizing the global loss function. In this study, we discovered that, under the same data constraint, the former approach nearly always fared worse than the latter, a phenomenon particularly prominent when the numerical precision is very low. We further showed that this difficulty of post-training quantization arose from stark misalignment between optimization of the local and global objective functions. Our findings explains limited utility in minimization of local quantization error and the importance of direct quantization-aware fine-tuning, in the regime of large models at very low precision.

### Chemist-X: Large Language Model-empowered Agent for Reaction Condition   Recommendation in Chemical Synthesis

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T22:42:04Z

**Summary**: Recent AI research plots a promising future of automatic chemical reactions within the chemistry society. This study proposes Chemist-X, a comprehensive AI agent that automates the reaction condition optimization (RCO) task in chemical synthesis with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology and AI-controlled wet-lab experiment executions. To begin with, as an emulation on how chemical experts solve the RCO task, Chemist-X utilizes a novel RAG scheme to interrogate available molecular and literature databases to narrow the searching space for later processing. The agent then leverages a computer-aided design (CAD) tool we have developed through a large language model (LLM) supervised programming interface. With updated chemical knowledge obtained via RAG, as well as the ability in using CAD tools, our agent significantly outperforms conventional RCO AIs confined to the fixed knowledge within its training data. Finally, Chemist-X interacts with the physical world through an automated robotic system, which can validate the suggested chemical reaction condition without human interventions. The control of the robotic system was achieved with a novel algorithm we have developed for the equipment, which relies on LLMs for reliable script generation. Results of our automatic wet-lab experiments, achieved by fully LLM-supervised end-to-end operation with no human in the lope, prove Chemist-X's ability in self-driving laboratories.

### Adaptive Layer-skipping in Pre-trained LLMs
**Authors**: Xuan Luo, Weizhi Wang, Xifeng Yan

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T22:26:31Z

**Summary**: Various layer-skipping methods have been proposed to accelerate token generation in large language models (LLMs). However, they have overlooked a fundamental question: How do computational demands vary across the generation of different tokens? In this work, we introduce FlexiDepth, a method that dynamically adjusts the number of Transformer layers used in text generation. By incorporating a plug-in router and adapter, FlexiDepth enables adaptive layer-skipping in LLMs without modifying their original parameters. Introducing FlexiDepth to Llama-3-8B model achieves layer skipping of 8 layers out of 32, and meanwhile maintains the full 100\% benchmark performance. Experimental results with FlexiDepth demonstrate that computational demands in LLMs significantly vary based on token type. Specifically, generating repetitive tokens or fixed phrases requires fewer layers, whereas producing tokens involving computation or high uncertainty requires more layers. Interestingly, this adaptive allocation pattern aligns with human intuition. To advance research in this area, we open sourced FlexiDepth and a dataset documenting FlexiDepth's layer allocation patterns for future exploration.
