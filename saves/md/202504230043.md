 ### Joint Knowledge and Power Management for Secure Semantic Communication   Networks
**Authors**: Xuesong Liu, Yansong Liu, Haoyu Tang, Fangzhou Zhao, Le Xia, Yao Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:39:59Z

**Summary**: Recently, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown its great superiorities in resource savings and information exchanges. However, while its unique background knowledge guarantees accurate semantic reasoning and recovery, semantic information security-related concerns are introduced at the same time. Since the potential eavesdroppers may have the same background knowledge to accurately decrypt the private semantic information transmitted between legal SemCom users, this makes the knowledge management in SemCom networks rather challenging in joint consideration with the power control. To this end, this paper focuses on jointly addressing three core issues of power allocation, knowledge base caching (KBC), and device-to-device (D2D) user pairing (DUP) in secure SemCom networks. We first develop a novel performance metric, namely semantic secrecy throughput (SST), to quantify the information security level that can be achieved at each pair of D2D SemCom users. Next, an SST maximization problem is formulated subject to secure SemCom-related delay and reliability constraints. Afterward, we propose a security-aware resource management solution using the Lagrange primal-dual method and a two-stage method. Simulation results demonstrate our proposed solution nearly doubles the SST performance and realizes less than half of the queuing delay performance compared to different benchmarks.

### Lance: Efficient Random Access in Columnar Storage through Adaptive   Structural Encodings
**Authors**: Weston Pace, Chang She, Lei Xu, Will Jones, Albert Lockett, Jun Wang, Raunak Shah

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:22:18Z

**Summary**: The growing interest in artificial intelligence has created workloads that require both sequential and random access. At the same time, NVMe-backed storage solutions have emerged, providing caching capability for large columnar datasets in cloud storage. Current columnar storage libraries fall short of effectively utilizing an NVMe device's capabilities, especially when it comes to random access. Historically, this has been assumed an implicit weakness in columnar storage formats, but this has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of popular columnar formats such as Apache Arrow, Apache Parquet, and Lance in both random access and full scan tasks against NVMe storage.   We argue that effective encoding of a column's structure, such as the repetition and validity information, is the key to unlocking the disk's performance. We show that Parquet, when configured correctly, can achieve over 60x better random access performance than default settings. We also show that this high random access performance requires making minor trade-offs in scan performance and RAM utilization. We then describe the Lance structural encoding scheme, which alternates between two different structural encodings based on data width, and achieves better random access performance without making trade-offs in scan performance or RAM utilization.

### A Unified Framework for Quantitative Cache Analysis
**Authors**: Sophie Kahlen, Jan Reineke

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:36:53Z

**Summary**: In this work we unify two existing lines of work towards cache analysis for non-LRU policies. To this end, we extend the notion of competitiveness to block competitiveness and systematically analyze the competitiveness and block competitiveness of FIFO and MRU relative to LRU for arbitrary associativities. We show how competitiveness and block competitiveness can be exploited in state-of-the-art WCET analysis based on the results of existing persistence analyses for LRU. Unlike prior work, our approach is applicable to microarchitectures that exhibit timing anomalies. We experimentally evaluate the precision and cost of our approach on benchmarks from TACLeBench. The experiments demonstrate that quantitative cache analysis for FIFO and MRU comes close to the precision of LRU.

### LServe: Efficient Long-sequence LLM Serving with Unified Sparse   Attention
**Authors**: Shang Yang, Junxian Guo, Haotian Tang, Qinghao Hu, Guangxuan Xiao, Jiaming Tang, Yujun Lin, Zhijian Liu, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:13:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in processing long sequences and complex reasoning tasks, yet efficiently serving these models remains challenging due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention in the prefilling stage and the large memory footprint of the KV cache in the decoding stage. To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the compatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention. This design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations. Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context and reasoning capabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve.

### Is Intelligence the Right Direction in New OS Scheduling for Multiple   Resources in Cloud Environments?
**Authors**: Xinglei Dou, Lei Liu, Limin Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T11:09:43Z

**Summary**: Making it intelligent is a promising way in System/OS design. This paper proposes OSML+, a new ML-based resource scheduling mechanism for co-located cloud services. OSML+ intelligently schedules the cache and main memory bandwidth resources at the memory hierarchy and the computing core resources simultaneously. OSML+ uses a multi-model collaborative learning approach during its scheduling and thus can handle complicated cases, e.g., avoiding resource cliffs, sharing resources among applications, enabling different scheduling policies for applications with different priorities, etc. OSML+ can converge faster using ML models than previous studies. Moreover, OSML+ can automatically learn on the fly and handle dynamically changing workloads accordingly. Using transfer learning technologies, we show our design can work well across various cloud servers, including the latest off-the-shelf large-scale servers. Our experimental results show that OSML+ supports higher loads and meets QoS targets with lower overheads than previous studies.

### Efficient Pretraining Length Scaling
**Authors**: Bohong Wu, Shen Yan, Sijun Zhang, Jianqiao Lu, Yutao Zeng, Ya Wang, Xun Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T09:41:26Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the effectiveness of length scaling during post-training, yet its potential in pre-training remains underexplored. We present the Parallel Hidden Decoding Transformer (\textit{PHD}-Transformer), a novel framework that enables efficient length scaling during pre-training while maintaining inference efficiency. \textit{PHD}-Transformer achieves this through an innovative KV cache management strategy that distinguishes between original tokens and hidden decoding tokens. By retaining only the KV cache of original tokens for long-range dependencies while immediately discarding hidden decoding tokens after use, our approach maintains the same KV cache size as the vanilla transformer while enabling effective length scaling. To further enhance performance, we introduce two optimized variants: \textit{PHD-SWA} employs sliding window attention to preserve local dependencies, while \textit{PHD-CSWA} implements chunk-wise sliding window attention to eliminate linear growth in pre-filling time. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks.

### GainSight: Application-Guided Profiling for Composing Heterogeneous   On-Chip Memories in AI Hardware Accelerators
**Authors**: Peijing Li, Matthew Hung, Yiming Tan, Konstantin Hoßfeld, Jake Jiajun Cheng, Shuhan Liu, Lixian Yan, Xinxin Wang, H. -S. Philip Wong, Thierry Tambe

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T05:27:33Z

**Summary**: As AI workloads drive soaring memory requirements, there is a need for higher-density on-chip memory for domain-specific accelerators that goes beyond what current SRAM technology can provide. We motivate that algorithms and application behavior should guide the composition of heterogeneous on-chip memories. However, there has been little work in factoring dynamic application profiles into such design decisions. We present GainSight, a profiling framework that analyzes fine-grained memory access patterns and computes data lifetimes in domain-specific accelerators. By combining instrumentation and simulation across retargetable hardware backends, GainSight aligns heterogeneous memory designs with workload-specific traffic and lifetime metrics. Case studies on MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads using NVIDIA H100 GPUs and systolic arrays reveal key insights: (1) 40% of L1 and 18% of L2 GPU cache accesses, and 79% of systolic array scratchpad accesses across profiled workloads are short-lived and suitable for silicon-based gain cell RAM (Si-GCRAM); (2) Si-GCRAM reduces active energy by 11-28% compared to SRAM; (3) Up to 90% of GPU cache fetches are never reused, highlighting inefficiencies in terms of cache pollution. These insights that GainSight provides can be used to better understand the design spaces of both emerging on-chip memories and software algorithmic optimizations for the next generation of AI accelerators.

**Authors**: Amy Yang, Jingyi Yang, Aya Ibrahim, Xinfeng Xie, Bangsheng Tang, Grigory Sizov, Jeremy Reizenstein, Jongsoo Park, Jianyu Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T03:40:10Z

**Summary**: We present context parallelism for long-context large language model inference, which achieves near-linear scaling for long-context prefill latency with up to 128 H100 GPUs across 16 nodes. Particularly, our method achieves 1M context prefill with Llama3 405B model in 77s (93% parallelization efficiency, 63% FLOPS utilization) and 128K context prefill in 3.8s. We develop two lossless exact ring attention variants: pass-KV and pass-Q to cover a wide range of use cases with the state-of-the-art performance: full prefill, persistent KV prefill and decode. Benchmarks on H100 GPU hosts inter-connected with RDMA and TCP both show similar scalability for long-context prefill, demonstrating that our method scales well using common commercial data center with medium-to-low inter-host bandwidth.

### gLLM: Global Balanced Pipeline Parallelism System for Distributed LLM   Serving with Token Throttling
**Authors**: Tianyu Guo, Xianwei Zhang, Jiangsu Du, Zhiguang Chen, Nong Xiao, Yutong Lu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T00:07:49Z

**Summary**: Pipeline parallelism has emerged as a predominant approach for deploying large language models (LLMs) across distributed nodes, owing to its lower communication overhead compared to tensor parallelism. While demonstrating high throughput in request serving, pipeline parallelism often suffers from performance limitations caused by pipeline bubbles, which are primarily resulted from imbalanced computation delays across batches. Existing methods like Sarathi-Serve attempt to address this through hybrid scheduling of chunked prefill and decode tokens using a fixed token budget. However, such methods may experience significant fluctuations due to either insufficient prefill tokens or uneven distribution of decode tokens, ultimately leading to computational imbalance. To overcome these inefficiencies, we present gLLM, a globally balanced pipeline parallelism system incorporating Token Throttling to effectively mitigate the pipeline bubbles. Our Token Throttling mechanism is a fine-grained scheduling policy that independently regulates the quantities of prefill and decode tokens, thus enabling balanced computation by leveraging global information from the inference system. Specifically, for decode tokens, gLLM maintains near-consistent token count across processing batches. For prefill tokens, it dynamically adjusts batch sizes based on both total pending tokens and the memory utilization rates of key-value cache (KV cache). Furthermore, gLLM runtime adopts an asynchronous execution and message passing architecture specifically optimized for pipeline parallelism characteristics. Experimental evaluations with representative LLMs show that gLLM achieves significant performance improvements, delivering 11% to 398% higher maximum throughput compared to state-of-the-art pipeline or tensor parallelism systems, while simultaneously maintaining lower latency.

### Star Attention: Efficient LLM Inference over Long Sequences
**Authors**: Shantanu Acharya, Fei Jia, Boris Ginsburg

**Updated**: 2025-04-20T21:50:03Z

**Summary**: Inference with Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) on long sequences is both costly and slow due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. We introduce Star Attention, a two-phase block-sparse approximation that improves computational efficiency by sharding attention across multiple hosts while minimizing communication overhead. In the first phase, the context is processed using blockwise-local attention across hosts, in parallel. In the second phase, query and response tokens attend to all prior cached tokens through sequence-global attention. Star Attention integrates seamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs trained with global attention, reducing memory requirements and inference time by up to 11x while preserving 97-100% of accuracy.

### Understanding and Optimizing Multi-Stage AI Inference Pipelines
**Authors**: Abhimanyu Rajeshkumar Bambhaniya, Hanjiang Wu, Suvinay Subramanian, Sudarshan Srinivasan, Souvik Kundu, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Midhilesh Elavazhagan, Madhu Kumar, Tushar Krishna

**Updated**: 2025-04-20T19:57:16Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for increasingly sophisticated inference pipelines and hardware platforms. Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.   To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.

### Slice+Slice Baby: Generating Last-Level Cache Eviction Sets in the Blink   of an Eye
**Authors**: Bradley Morgan, Gal Horowitz, Sioli O'Connell, Stephan van Schaik, Chitchanok Chuengsatiansup, Daniel Genkin, Olaf Maennel, Paul Montague, Eyal Ronen, Yuval Yarom

**Updated**: 2025-04-20T07:53:09Z

**Summary**: An essential step for mounting cache attacks is finding eviction sets, collections of memory locations that contend on cache space. On Intel processors, one of the main challenges for identifying contending addresses is the sliced cache design, where the processor hashes the physical address to determine where in the cache a memory location is stored. While past works have demonstrated that the hash function can be reversed, they also showed that it depends on physical address bits that the adversary does not know.   In this work, we make three main contributions to the art of finding eviction sets. We first exploit microarchitectural races to compare memory access times and identify the cache slice to which an address maps. We then use the known hash function to both reduce the error rate in our slice identification method and to reduce the work by extrapolating slice mappings to untested memory addresses. Finally, we show how to propagate information on eviction sets across different page offsets for the hitherto unexplored case of non-linear hash functions.   Our contributions allow for entire LLC eviction set generation in 0.7 seconds on the Intel i7-9850H and 1.6 seconds on the i9-10900K, both using non-linear functions. This represents a significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art techniques taking 9x and 10x longer, respectively.

### Optimizing SLO-oriented LLM Serving with PD-Multiplexing
**Authors**: Weihao Cui, Yukang Chen, Han Zhao, Ziyi Xu, Quan Chen, Xusheng Chen, Yangjie Zhou, Shixuan Sun, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2025-04-20T04:46:34Z

**Summary**: Modern LLM services demand high throughput and stringent SLO guarantees across two distinct inference phases-prefill and decode-and complex multi-turn workflows. However, current systems face a fundamental tradeoff: out-of-place compute partition enables per-phase SLO attainment, while in-place memory sharing maximizes throughput via KV cache reuse. Moreover, existing in-place compute partition also encounters low utilization and high overhead due to phase-coupling design. We present Yoda, a new LLM serving framework that resolves this tension via PD multiplexing, enabling in-place and phase-decoupled compute partition. Yoda leverages low-level GPU partitioning techniques to multiplex prefill and decode phases spatially and adaptively on shared GPUs, while preserving in-place memory sharing. To fully leverage the multiplexing capability, Yoda introduces an adaptive gang scheduling mechanism, a contention-free modeling method, and a SLO-aware dispatching policy. Evaluation shows that Yoda achieves an average $5.1\times$ throughput improvement (up to $17.5\times$) over state-of-the-art baselines, while consistently meeting SLO targets under complex LLM workloads.

### Deuteronomy 2.0: Record Caching and Latch Freedom
**Authors**: David Lomet

**Updated**: 2025-04-20T00:49:27Z

**Summary**: The Deuteronomy transactional key-value store is unique architecturally in providing separation between transaction functionality -- its Transactional Component (TC) and data management -- its Data Component (DC). It is unique in technology by (1) supporting record caching, a smaller unit than the traditional page; and (2) protecting resources during concurrent execution using a latch-free approach. Both technologies are enabled by delta updating. This paper explains how record caching improves cache cost/performance. It also shows how a new latch-free approach makes implementation easier and improves performance.

### A fast MPI-based Distributed Hash-Table as Surrogate Model demonstrated   in a coupled reactive transport HPC simulation
**Authors**: Max Lübke, Marco De Lucia, Stefan Petri, Bettina Schnor

**Updated**: 2025-04-19T18:25:20Z

**Summary**: Surrogate models can play a pivotal role in enhancing performance in contemporary High-Performance Computing applications. Cache-based surrogates use already calculated simulation results to interpolate or extrapolate further simulation output values. But this approach only pays off if the access time to retrieve the needed values is much faster than the actual simulation. While the most existing key-value stores use a Client-Server architecture with dedicated storage nodes, this is not the most suitable architecture for HPC applications. Instead, we propose a distributed architecture where the parallel processes offer a part of their available memory to build a shared distributed hash table based on MPI. This paper presents three DHT approaches with the special requirements of HPC applications in mind. The presented lock-free design outperforms both DHT versions which use explicit synchronization by coarse-grained resp. fine-grained locking. The lock-free DHT shows very good scaling regarding read and write performance. The runtime of a coupled reactive transport simulation was improved between 14% and 42% using the lock-free DHT as a surrogate model.

### Room-temperature high-average-power strong-field terahertz source based   on industrial high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser
**Authors**: Deyin Kong, Yichen Su, Cheng Song, Xiaojun Wu

**Updated**: 2025-04-19T06:18:56Z

**Summary**: Free-space strong-field terahertz (THz) pulses, generated via optical rectification of femtosecond lasers in nonlinear crystals, are pivotal in various applications. However, conventional Ti:sapphire lasers struggle to produce high-average-power THz due to their limited output power. While kilowatt ytterbium lasers are increasingly adopted, their application in THz generation faces challenges: low optical-to-THz conversion efficiency (attributed to long pulse durations and low energy) and crystal damage under high pumping power. Here, we report a high-average-power strong-field THz source using a lithium niobate crystal pumped by a 1030-nm, 570-fs, 1-mJ, 50-kHz ytterbium femtosecond laser with tilted pulse front pumping (TPFP). By systematically optimizing TPFP implementations and comparing grating- and echelon-type configurations, we achieve a THz source with 64.5 mW average power at 42-W, 50-kHz pumping, and a focused peak electric field of 525 kV/cm at 0.83-mJ, 1-kHz operation. Additionally, we observe Zeeman torque signals in cobalt-iron ferromagnetic nanofilms. This high-repetition-rate, high-average-power THz system, combined with its potential capabilities in high signal-to-noise spectroscopy and imaging, promises transformative impacts in quantum matter manipulation, non-destructive testing, and biomedicine.

### Spineless Traversal for Layout Invalidation
**Authors**: Marisa Kirisame, Tiezhi Wang, Pavel Panchekha

**Updated**: 2025-04-19T05:57:44Z

**Summary**: Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

### LogicTree: Structured Proof Exploration for Coherent and Rigorous   Logical Reasoning with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Kang He, Kaushik Roy

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T22:10:02Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities across various domains. However, LLMs still face distinct challenges in complex logical reasoning, as (1) proof-finding requires systematic exploration and the maintenance of logical coherence and (2) searching the right combination of premises at each reasoning step is inherently challenging in tasks with large premise space. To address this, we propose LogicTree, an inference-time modular framework employing algorithm-guided search to automate structured proof exploration and ensure logical coherence. Advancing beyond tree-of-thought (ToT), we incorporate caching mechanism into LogicTree to enable effective utilization of historical knowledge, preventing reasoning stagnation and minimizing redundancy. Furthermore, we address the combinatorial complexity of premise search by decomposing it into a linear process. The refined premise selection restricts subsequent inference to at most one derivation per step, enhancing reasoning granularity and enforcing strict step-by-step reasoning. Additionally, we introduce two LLM-free heuristics for premise prioritization, enabling strategic proof search. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that LogicTree optimally scales inference-time computation to achieve higher proof accuracy, surpassing chain-of-thought (CoT) and ToT with average gains of 23.6% and 12.5%, respectively, on GPT-4o. Moreover, within LogicTree, GPT-4o outperforms o3-mini by 7.6% on average.

### CAOTE: KV Caching through Attention Output Error based Token Eviction
**Authors**: Raghavv Goel, Junyoung Park, Mukul Gagrani, Dalton Jones, Matthew Morse, Harper Langston, Mingu Lee, Chris Lott

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T19:46:54Z

**Summary**: While long context support of large language models has extended their abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors. This is the first method which uses value vector information on top of attention-based eviction scores. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

### Gradual Binary Search and Dimension Expansion : A general method for   activation quantization in LLMs
**Authors**: Lucas Maisonnave, Cyril Moineau, Olivier Bichler, Fabrice Rastello

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T13:46:58Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have become pivotal in artificial intelligence, demonstrating strong capabilities in reasoning, understanding, and generating data. However, their deployment on edge devices is hindered by their substantial size, often reaching several billion parameters. Quantization is a widely used method to reduce memory usage and inference time, however LLMs present unique challenges due to the prevalence of outliers in their activations. In this work, we leverage the theoretical advantages of Hadamard matrices over random rotation matrices to push the boundaries of quantization in LLMs. We demonstrate that Hadamard matrices are more effective in reducing outliers, which are a significant obstacle in achieving low-bit quantization. Our method based on a gradual binary search enables 3-bit quantization for weights, activations, and key-value (KV) caches, resulting in a 40\% increase in accuracy on common benchmarks compared to SoTA methods. We extend the use of rotation matrices to support non-power-of-2 embedding dimensions, similar to the Qwen architecture, by employing the Paley algorithm. We theoretically demonstrates the superiority of Hadamard matrices in reducing outliers.We achieved 3-bit quantization for weights, activations, and KV cache, significantly enhancing model performance. Our experimental results on multiple models family like Mistral, LLaMA, and Qwen demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming existing methods and enabling practical 3-bit quantization.

### CacheFormer: High Attention-Based Segment Caching
**Authors**: Sushant Singh, Ausif Mahmood

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T06:34:57Z

**Summary**: Efficiently handling long contexts in transformer-based language models with low perplexity is an active area of research. Numerous recent approaches like Linformer, Longformer, Performer, and Structured state space models (SSMs)., have not fully resolved this problem. All these models strive to reduce the quadratic time complexity of the attention mechanism while minimizing the loss in quality due to the effective compression of the long context. Inspired by the cache and virtual memory principle in computers, where in case of a cache miss, not only the needed data is retrieved from the memory, but the adjacent data is also obtained, we apply this concept to handling long contexts by dividing it into small segments. In our design, we retrieve the nearby segments in an uncompressed form when high segment-level attention occurs at the compressed level. Our en-hancements for handling long context include aggregating four attention mechanisms consisting of short sliding window attention, long compressed segmented attention, dynamically retrieving top k high attention uncompressed segments, and overlapping segments in long segment attention to avoid segment fragmentation. These enhancements result in an architecture that outperforms ex-isting SOTA architectures with an average perplexity improvement of 8.5% over similar model sizes.

**Authors**: Amit Kumar Bhuyan, Hrishikesh Dutta, Subir Biswas

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T05:13:52Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - enabled content management architecture that is suitable for critical content access in communities of users that are communication-isolated during diverse types of disaster scenarios. The proposed architecture leverages a hybrid network of stationary anchor UAVs and mobile Micro-UAVs for ubiquitous content dissemination. The anchor UAVs are equipped with both vertical and lateral communication links, and they serve local users, while the mobile micro-ferrying UAVs extend coverage across communities with increased mobility. The focus is on developing a content dissemination system that dynamically learns optimal caching policies to maximize content availability. The core innovation is an adaptive content dissemination framework based on distributed Federated Multi-Armed Bandit learning. The goal is to optimize UAV content caching decisions based on geo-temporal content popularity and user demand variations. A Selective Caching Algorithm is also introduced to reduce redundant content replication by incorporating inter-UAV information sharing. This method strategically preserves the uniqueness in user preferences while amalgamating the intelligence across a distributed learning system. This approach improves the learning algorithm's ability to adapt to diverse user preferences. Functional verification and performance evaluation confirm the proposed architecture's utility across different network sizes, UAV swarms, and content popularity patterns.

### EXAM: Exploiting Exclusive System-Level Cache in Apple M-Series SoCs for   Enhanced Cache Occupancy Attacks
**Authors**: Tianhong Xu, Aidong Adam Ding, Yunsi Fei

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T00:21:00Z

**Summary**: Cache occupancy attacks exploit the shared nature of cache hierarchies to infer a victim's activities by monitoring overall cache usage, unlike access-driven cache attacks that focus on specific cache lines or sets. There exists some prior work that target the last-level cache (LLC) of Intel processors, which is inclusive of higher-level caches, and L2 caches of ARM systems. In this paper, we target the System-Level Cache (SLC) of Apple M-series SoCs, which is exclusive to higher-level CPU caches. We address the challenges of the exclusiveness and propose a suite of SLC-cache occupancy attacks, the first of its kind, where an adversary can monitor GPU and other CPU cluster activities from their own CPU cluster. We first discover the structure of SLC in Apple M1 SOC and various policies pertaining to access and sharing through reverse engineering. We propose two attacks against websites. One is a coarse-grained fingerprinting attack, recognizing which website is accessed based on their different GPU memory access patterns monitored through the SLC occupancy channel. The other attack is a fine-grained pixel stealing attack, which precisely monitors the GPU memory usage for rendering different pixels, through the SLC occupancy channel. Third, we introduce a novel screen capturing attack which works beyond webpages, with the monitoring granularity of 57 rows of pixels (there are 1600 rows for the screen). This significantly expands the attack surface, allowing the adversary to retrieve any screen display, posing a substantial new threat to system security. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in Apple's M-series SoCs and emphasize the urgent need for effective countermeasures against cache occupancy attacks in heterogeneous computing environments.

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T23:45:51Z

**Summary**: We report on energy bands and breakdown characteristics of Al2O3 dielectrics on ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructures. Metal-dielectric-semiconductor structures are important to sustain high fields needed for future high-performance UWBG transistors. Using systematic experiments, we determined the fixed charge density (> 1013 cm-2), the dielectric/interface, and electric fields in the oxide of under flat-band conditions in the semiconductor. Low gate-to-drain leakage current of up to 5 x 10-7 A/cm2 were obtained in the metal-oxide-semiconductor structures. In lateral metal-semiconductor-insulator test structures, breakdown voltage exceeding 1 kV was obtained with a channel sheet charge density of 1.27 x 1013 cm-2. The effective peak electric field and average breakdown field were estimated to be > 4.27 MV/cm and 1.99 MV/cm, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of Al2O2 integration for enhancing the breakdown performance of UWBG AlGaN HEMTs.

### ShadowKV: KV Cache in Shadows for High-Throughput Long-Context LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Hanshi Sun, Li-Wen Chang, Wenlei Bao, Size Zheng, Ningxin Zheng, Xin Liu, Harry Dong, Yuejie Chi, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T21:19:19Z

**Summary**: With the widespread deployment of long-context large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing demand for efficient support of high-throughput inference. However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence length, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each token generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs. While various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up inference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to sufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding latency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a high-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key cache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger batch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV employs an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV pairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks, including RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and Qwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\times$ larger batch sizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\times$ on an A100 GPU without sacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite batch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory. The code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/ShadowKV.

### Long-Context Autoregressive Video Modeling with Next-Frame Prediction
**Authors**: Yuchao Gu, Weijia Mao, Mike Zheng Shou

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T15:26:04Z

**Summary**: Long-context autoregressive modeling has significantly advanced language generation, but video generation still struggles to fully utilize extended temporal contexts. To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce Frame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive modeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens (i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous frames, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion transformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context video modeling faces challenges due to visual redundancy. Training on long videos is computationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language tokens. To tackle this issue, we propose balancing locality and long-range dependency through long short-term context modeling. A high-resolution short-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an unlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer tokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a manageable token context length, thereby significantly reducing training time and memory usage. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level KV cache designed to support the long short-term context modeling, which accelerating inference on long video sequences. We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet effective baseline for video autoregressive modeling. The code is released at https://github.com/showlab/FAR.

### In-context KV-Cache Eviction for LLMs via Attention-Gate
**Authors**: Zihao Zeng, Bokai Lin, Tianqi Hou, Hao Zhang, Zhijie Deng

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T03:51:06Z

**Summary**: The KV-Cache technique has become the standard for the inference of large language models (LLMs). Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a bottleneck of the LLM inference system. This paper enables a novel dynamic KV-Cache eviction policy by injecting a lightweight module called Attention-Gate to the model. It accepts the global context as input and yields eviction flags for each token. The self-attention modules in the model proceed according to the flags and cache only a subset of the KV states for next token prediction. The Attention-Gates can yield various flags for different heads and layers and be easily tuned on top of a pre-trained LLM via continual pre-training or supervised fine-tuning. The computational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates can be minimal. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach across multiple scenarios, showing that effective eviction of redundant tokens can not only improve efficiency but also enhance performance.

### Demoting Security via Exploitation of Cache Demote Operation in Intel's   Latest ISA Extension
**Authors**: Taehun Kim, Hyerean Jang, Youngjoo Shin

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T00:38:24Z

**Summary**: ISA extensions are increasingly adopted to boost the performance of specialized workloads without requiring an entire architectural redesign. However, these enhancements can inadvertently expose new attack surfaces in the microarchitecture. In this paper, we investigate Intel's recently introduced cldemote extension, which promotes efficient data sharing by transferring cache lines from upper-level caches to the Last Level Cache (LLC). Despite its performance benefits, we uncover critical properties-unprivileged access, inter-cache state transition, and fault suppression-that render cldemote exploitable for microarchitectural attacks. We propose two new attack primitives, Flush+Demote and Demote+Time, built on our analysis. Flush+Demote constructs a covert channel with a bandwidth of 2.84 Mbps and a bit error rate of 0.018%, while Demote+Time derandomizes the kernel base address in 2.49 ms on Linux. Furthermore, we show that leveraging cldemote accelerates eviction set construction in non-inclusive LLC designs by obviating the need for helper threads or extensive cache conflicts, thereby reducing construction time by 36% yet retaining comparable success rates. Finally, we examine how ISA extensions contribute to broader microarchitectural attacks, identifying five key exploitable characteristics and categorizing four distinct attack types. We also discuss potential countermeasures, highlighting the far-reaching security implications of emerging ISA extensions.

### MOM: Memory-Efficient Offloaded Mini-Sequence Inference for Long Context   Language Models
**Authors**: Junyang Zhang, Tianyi Zhu, Cheng Luo, Anima Anandkumar

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T23:15:09Z

**Summary**: Long-context language models exhibit impressive performance but remain challenging to deploy due to high GPU memory demands during inference. We propose Memory-efficient Offloaded Mini-sequence Inference (MOM), a method that partitions critical layers into smaller "mini-sequences" and integrates seamlessly with KV cache offloading. Experiments on various Llama, Qwen, and Mistral models demonstrate that MOM reduces peak memory usage by over 50\% on average. On Meta-Llama-3.2-8B, MOM extends the maximum context length from 155k to 455k tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU, while keeping outputs identical and not compromising accuracy. MOM also maintains highly competitive throughput due to minimal computational overhead and efficient last-layer processing. Compared to traditional chunked prefill methods, MOM achieves a 35\% greater context length extension. More importantly, our method drastically reduces prefill memory consumption, eliminating it as the longstanding dominant memory bottleneck during inference. This breakthrough fundamentally changes research priorities, redirecting future efforts from prefill-stage optimizations to improving decode-stage residual KV cache efficiency.

### Activated LoRA: Fine-tuned LLMs for Intrinsics
**Authors**: Kristjan Greenewald, Luis Lastras, Thomas Parnell, Vraj Shah, Lucian Popa, Giulio Zizzo, Chulaka Gunasekara, Ambrish Rawat, David Cox

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T18:03:21Z

**Summary**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is highly inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. highly specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We use aLoRA to train a set of intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.

### Cobra: Efficient Line Art COlorization with BRoAder References
**Authors**: Junhao Zhuang, Lingen Li, Xuan Ju, Zhaoyang Zhang, Chun Yuan, Ying Shan

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T16:45:19Z

**Summary**: The comic production industry requires reference-based line art colorization with high accuracy, efficiency, contextual consistency, and flexible control. A comic page often involves diverse characters, objects, and backgrounds, which complicates the coloring process. Despite advancements in diffusion models for image generation, their application in line art colorization remains limited, facing challenges related to handling extensive reference images, time-consuming inference, and flexible control. We investigate the necessity of extensive contextual image guidance on the quality of line art colorization. To address these challenges, we introduce Cobra, an efficient and versatile method that supports color hints and utilizes over 200 reference images while maintaining low latency. Central to Cobra is a Causal Sparse DiT architecture, which leverages specially designed positional encodings, causal sparse attention, and Key-Value Cache to effectively manage long-context references and ensure color identity consistency. Results demonstrate that Cobra achieves accurate line art colorization through extensive contextual reference, significantly enhancing inference speed and interactivity, thereby meeting critical industrial demands. We release our codes and models on our project page: https://zhuang2002.github.io/Cobra/.

**Authors**: Kihyun Kim, Jinwoo Kim, Hyunsun Chung, Myung-Hoon Cha, Hong-Yeon Kim, Youngjae Kim

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T07:02:38Z

**Summary**: LLM inference is essential for applications like text summarization, translation, and data analysis, but the high cost of GPU instances from Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) like AWS is a major burden. This paper proposes InferSave, a cost-efficient VM selection framework for cloud based LLM inference. InferSave optimizes KV cache offloading based on Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and workload charac teristics, estimating GPU memory needs, and recommending cost-effective VM instances. Additionally, the Compute Time Calibration Function (CTCF) improves instance selection accuracy by adjusting for discrepancies between theoretical and actual GPU performance. Experiments on AWS GPU instances show that selecting lower-cost instances without KV cache offloading improves cost efficiency by up to 73.7% for online workloads, while KV cache offloading saves up to 20.19% for offline workloads.

### Efficient Architecture for RISC-V Vector Memory Access
**Authors**: Hongyi Guan, Yichuan Gao, Chenlu Miao, Haoyang Wu, Hang Zhu, Mingfeng Lin, Huayue Liang

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T05:57:08Z

**Summary**: Vector processors frequently suffer from inefficient memory accesses, particularly for strided and segment patterns. While coalescing strided accesses is a natural solution, effectively gathering or scattering elements at fixed strides remains challenging. Naive approaches rely on high-overhead crossbars that remap any byte between memory and registers, leading to physical design issues. Segment operations require row-column transpositions, typically handled using either element-level in-place transposition (degrading performance) or large buffer-based bulk transposition (incurring high area overhead). In this paper, we present EARTH, a novel vector memory access architecture designed to overcome these challenges through shifting-based optimizations. For strided accesses, EARTH integrates specialized shift networks for gathering and scattering elements. After coalescing multiple accesses within the same cache line, data is routed between memory and registers through the shifting network with minimal overhead. For segment operations, EARTH employs a shifted register bank enabling direct column-wise access, eliminating dedicated segment buffers while providing high-performance, in-place bulk transposition. Implemented on FPGA with Chisel HDL based on an open-source RISC-V vector unit, EARTH enhances performance for strided memory accesses, achieving 4x-8x speedups in benchmarks dominated by strided operations. Compared to conventional designs, EARTH reduces hardware area by 9% and power consumption by 41%, significantly advancing both performance and efficiency of vector processors.

### Shared Disk KV Cache Management for Efficient Multi-Instance Inference   in RAG-Powered LLMs
**Authors**: Hyungwoo Lee, Kihyun Kim, Jinwoo Kim, Jungmin So, Myung-Hoon Cha, Hong-Yeon Kim, James J. Kim, Youngjae Kim

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T04:59:18Z

**Summary**: Recent large language models (LLMs) face increasing inference latency as input context length and model size continue to grow. In particular, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which enhances LLM responses by incorporating external knowledge, exacerbates this issue by significantly increasing the number of input tokens. This expansion in token length leads to a substantial rise in computational overhead, particularly during the prefill stage, resulting in prolonged time-to-first-token (TTFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce TTFT by leveraging a disk-based key-value (KV) cache to lessen the computational burden during the prefill stage. We also introduce a disk-based shared KV cache management system, called Shared RAG-DCache, for multi-instance LLM RAG service environments. This system, together with an optimal system configuration, improves both throughput and latency under given resource constraints. Shared RAG-DCache exploits the locality of documents related to user queries in RAG, as well as the queueing delay in LLM inference services. It proactively generates and stores disk KV caches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM instances to enhance inference performance. In experiments on a single host equipped with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU, Shared RAG-DCache achieved a 15~71% increase in throughput and up to a 12~65% reduction in latency, depending on the resource configuration.

### EdgePrompt: A Distributed Key-Value Inference Framework for LLMs in 6G   Networks
**Authors**: Jiahong Ning, Pengyan Zhu, Ce Zheng, Gary Lee, Sumei Sun, Tingting Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T03:07:07Z

**Summary**: As sixth-generation (6G) networks advance, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into 6G infrastructure to enhance network management and intelligence. However, traditional LLMs architecture struggle to meet the stringent latency and security requirements of 6G, especially as the increasing in sequence length leads to greater task complexity. This paper proposes Edge-Prompt, a cloud-edge collaborative framework based on a hierarchical attention splicing mechanism. EdgePrompt employs distributed key-value (KV) pair optimization techniques to accelerate inference and adapt to network conditions. Additionally, to reduce the risk of data leakage, EdgePrompt incorporates a privacy preserving strategy by isolating sensitive information during processing. Experiments on public dataset show that EdgePrompt effectively improves the inference throughput and reduces the latency, which provides a reliable solution for LLMs deployment in 6G environments.

### Engineering MultiQueues: Fast Relaxed Concurrent Priority Queues
**Authors**: Marvin Williams, Peter Sanders

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T22:38:54Z

**Summary**: Priority queues are used in a wide range of applications, including prioritized online scheduling, discrete event simulation, and greedy algorithms. In parallel settings, classical priority queues often become a severe bottleneck, resulting in low throughput. Consequently, there has been significant interest in concurrent priority queues with relaxed semantics. In this article, we present the MultiQueue, a flexible approach to relaxed priority queues that uses multiple internal sequential priority queues. The scalability of the MultiQueue is enhanced by buffering elements, batching operations on the internal queues, and optimizing access patterns for high cache locality. We investigate the complementary quality criteria of rank error, which measures how close deleted elements are to the global minimum, and delay, which quantifies how many smaller elements were deleted before a given element. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the MultiQueue outperforms competing approaches across several benchmarks. This includes shortest-path and branch-and-bound benchmarks that resemble real applications. Moreover, the MultiQueue can be configured easily to balance throughput and quality according to the application's requirements. We employ a seemingly paradoxical technique of wait-free locking that might be of broader interest for converting sequential data structures into relaxed concurrent data structures.

### Optimizing LLM Inference: Fluid-Guided Online Scheduling with Memory   Constraints
**Authors**: Ruicheng Ao, Gan Luo, David Simchi-Levi, Xinshang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T16:00:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are indispensable in today's applications, but their inference procedure -- generating responses by processing text in segments and using a memory-heavy Key-Value (KV) cache -- demands significant computational resources, particularly under memory constraints. This paper formulates LLM inference optimization as a multi-stage online scheduling problem where sequential prompt arrivals and KV cache growth render conventional scheduling ineffective. We develop a fluid dynamics approximation to provide a tractable benchmark that guides algorithm design. Building on this, we propose the Waiting for Accumulated Inference Threshold (WAIT) algorithm, which uses multiple thresholds to schedule incoming prompts optimally when output lengths are known, and extend it to Nested WAIT for cases with unknown output lengths. Theoretical analysis shows that both algorithms achieve near-optimal performance against the fluid benchmark in heavy traffic conditions, balancing throughput, latency, and Time to First Token (TTFT). Experiments with the Llama-7B model on an A100 GPU using both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate improved throughput and reduced latency relative to established baselines like vLLM and Sarathi. This work bridges operations research and machine learning, offering a rigorous framework for the efficient deployment of LLMs under memory constraints.

### Performant Automatic BLAS Offloading on Unified Memory Architecture with   OpenMP First-Touch Style Data Movement
**Authors**: Junjie Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T15:40:25Z

**Summary**: BLAS is a fundamental building block of advanced linear algebra libraries and many modern scientific computing applications. GPUs are known for their strong arithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations. However, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for large, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While various tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often impractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The advent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the NVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of memory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in conventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative application developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary work demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends the framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a novel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory coherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement policy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU programming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing codes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool intercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code modifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple quantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising speedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was achieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.

**Summary**: Porting codes to GPU often requires major efforts. While several tools exist for automatically offload numerical libraries such as BLAS and LAPACK, they often prove impractical due to the high cost of mandatory data transfer. The new unified memory architecture in NVIDIA Grace-Hopper allows high bandwidth cache-coherent memory access of all memory from both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating bottleneck faced in conventional architecture. This breakthrough opens up new avenues for application development and porting strategies. In this study, we introduce a new tool for automatic BLAS offload, the tool leverages the high speed cache coherent NVLink C2C interconnect in Grace-Hopper, and enables performant GPU offload for BLAS heavy applications with no code changes or recompilation. The tool was tested on two quantum chemistry or physics codes, great performance benefits were observed.

### Morphing-based Compression for Data-centric ML Pipelines
**Authors**: Sebastian Baunsgaard, Matthias Boehm

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T11:02:34Z

**Summary**: Data-centric ML pipelines extend traditional machine learning (ML) pipelines -- of feature transformations and ML model training -- by outer loops for data cleaning, augmentation, and feature engineering to create high-quality input data. Existing lossless matrix compression applies lightweight compression schemes to numeric matrices and performs linear algebra operations such as matrix-vector multiplications directly on the compressed representation but struggles to efficiently rediscover structural data redundancy. Compressed operations are effective at fitting data in available memory, reducing I/O across the storage-memory-cache hierarchy, and improving instruction parallelism. The applied data cleaning, augmentation, and feature transformations provide a rich source of information about data characteristics such as distinct items, column sparsity, and column correlations. In this paper, we introduce BWARE -- an extension of AWARE for workload-aware lossless matrix compression -- that pushes compression through feature transformations and engineering to leverage information about structural transformations. Besides compressed feature transformations, we introduce a novel technique for lightweight morphing of a compressed representation into workload-optimized compressed representations without decompression. BWARE shows substantial end-to-end runtime improvements, reducing the execution time for training data-centric ML pipelines from days to hours.

**Summary**: AlayaDB is a cutting-edge vector database system natively architected for efficient and effective long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) at AlayaDB AI. Specifically, it decouples the KV cache and attention computation from the LLM inference systems, and encapsulates them into a novel vector database system. For the Model as a Service providers (MaaS), AlayaDB consumes fewer hardware resources and offers higher generation quality for various workloads with different kinds of Service Level Objectives (SLOs), when comparing with the existing alternative solutions (e.g., KV cache disaggregation, retrieval-based sparse attention). The crux of AlayaDB is that it abstracts the attention computation and cache management for LLM inference into a query processing procedure, and optimizes the performance via a native query optimizer. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AlayaDB via (i) three use cases from our industry partners, and (ii) extensive experimental results on LLM inference benchmarks.

### Shield Bash: Abusing Defensive Coherence State Retrieval to Break Timing   Obfuscation
**Authors**: Kartik Ramkrishnan, Antonia Zhai, Stephen McCamant, Pen Chung Yew

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T15:27:32Z

**Summary**: Microarchitectural attacks are a significant concern, leading to many hardware-based defense proposals. However, different defenses target different classes of attacks, and their impact on each other has not been fully considered. To raise awareness of this problem, we study an interaction between two state-of-the art defenses in this paper, timing obfuscations of remote cache lines (TORC) and delaying speculative changes to remote cache lines (DSRC). TORC mitigates cache-hit based attacks and DSRC mitigates speculative coherence state change attacks.   We observe that DSRC enables coherence information to be retrieved into the processor core, where it is out of the reach of timing obfuscations to protect. This creates an unforeseen consequence that redo operations can be triggered within the core to detect the presence or absence of remote cache lines, which constitutes a security vulnerability. We demonstrate that a new covert channel attack is possible using this vulnerability. We propose two ways to mitigate the attack, whose performance varies depending on an application's cache usage. One way is to never send remote exclusive coherence state (E) information to the core even if it is created. The other way is to never create a remote E state, which is responsible for triggering redos.   We demonstrate the timing difference caused by this microarchitectural defense assumption violation using GEM5 simulations. Performance evaluation on SPECrate 2017 and PARSEC benchmarks of the two fixes show less than 32\% average overhead across both sets of benchmarks. The repair which prevented the creation of remote E state had less than 2.8% average overhead.

### A New Paradigm in IBR Modeling for Power Flow and Short Circuit Analysis
**Authors**: Zahid Javid, Firdous Ul Nazir, Wentao Zhu, Diptargha Chakravorty, Ahmed Aboushady, Mohamed Galeela

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T12:34:20Z

**Summary**: The fault characteristics of inverter-based resources (IBRs) are different from conventional synchronous generators. The fault response of IBRs is non-linear due to saturation states and mainly determined by fault ride through (FRT) strategies of the associated voltage source converter (VSC). This results in prohibitively large solution times for power flows considering these short circuit characteristics, especially when the power system states change fast due to uncertainty in IBR generations. To overcome this, a phasor-domain steady state (SS) short circuit (SC) solver for IBR dominated power systems is proposed in this paper, and subsequently the developed IBR models are incorporated with a novel Jacobian-based Power Flow (PF) solver. In this multiphase PF solver, any power system components can be modeled by considering their original non-linear or linear mathematical representations. Moreover, two novel FRT strategies are proposed to fully utilize the converter capacity and to comply with IEEE-2800 2022 std and German grid code. The results are compared with the Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulation on the IEEE 34 test network and the 120 kV EPRI benchmark system. The developed IBR sequence domain PF model demonstrates more accurate behavior compared to the classical IBR generator model. The error in calculating the short circuit current with the proposed SC solver is less than 3%, while achieving significant speed improvements of three order of magnitudes.

### Diversity in Network-Friendly Recommendations
**Authors**: Evangelia Tzimpimpaki, Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T11:20:56Z

**Summary**: In recent years, the Internet has been dominated by content-rich platforms, employing recommendation systems to provide users with more appealing content (e.g., videos in YouTube, movies in Netflix). While traditional content recommendations are oblivious to network conditions, the paradigm of Network-Friendly Recommendations (NFR) has recently emerged, favoring content that improves network performance (e.g. cached near the user), while still being appealing to the user. However, NFR algorithms sometimes achieve their goal by shrinking the pool of content recommended to users. The undesirable side-effect is reduced content diversity, a phenomenon known as ``content/filter bubble''. This reduced diversity is problematic for both users, who are prevented from exploring a broader range of content, and content creators (e.g. YouTubers) whose content may be recommended less frequently, leading to perceived unfairness. In this paper, we first investigate - using real data and state-of-the-art NFR schemes - the extent of this phenomenon. We then formulate a ``Diverse-NFR'' optimization problem (i.e., network-friendly recommendations with - sufficient - content diversity), and through a series of transformation steps, we manage to reduce it to a linear program that can be solved fast and optimally. Our findings show that Diverse-NFR can achieve high network gains (comparable to non-diverse NFR) while maintaining diversity constraints. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that incorporates diversity issues into network-friendly recommendation algorithms.

### On Precomputation and Caching in Information Retrieval Experiments with   Pipeline Architectures
**Authors**: Sean MacAvaney, Craig Macdonald

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T08:51:35Z

**Summary**: Modern information retrieval systems often rely on multiple components executed in a pipeline. In a research setting, this can lead to substantial redundant computations (e.g., retrieving the same query multiple times for evaluating different downstream rerankers). To overcome this, researchers take cached "result" files as inputs, which represent the output of another pipeline. However, these result files can be brittle and can cause a disconnect between the conceptual design of the pipeline and its logical implementation. To overcome both the redundancy problem (when executing complete pipelines) and the disconnect problem (when relying on intermediate result files), we describe our recent efforts to improve the caching capabilities in the open-source PyTerrier IR platform. We focus on two main directions: (1) automatic implicit caching of common pipeline prefixes when comparing systems and (2) explicit caching of operations through a new extension package, pyterrier-caching. These approaches allow for the best of both worlds: pipelines can be fully expressed end-to-end, while also avoiding redundant computations between pipelines.

### Secrecy and Privacy in Multi-Access Combinatorial Topology
**Authors**: Mallikharjuna Chinnapadamala, B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T07:30:03Z

**Summary**: In this work, we consider the multi-access combinatorial topology with $C$ caches where each user accesses a unique set of $r$ caches. For this setup, we consider secrecy, where each user should not know anything about the files it did not request, and demand privacy, where each user's demand must be kept private from other non-colluding users. We propose a scheme satisfying both conditions and derive a lower bound based on cut-set arguments. Also, we prove that our scheme is optimal when $r\geq C-1$, and it is order-optimal when the cache memory size $M$ is greater than or equal to a certain threshold for $r<C-1$. When $r=1$, in most of the memory region, our scheme achieves the same rate as the one given by the secretive scheme for the dedicated cache setup by Ravindrakumar et al. ( 'Private Coded Caching,' in \textit{IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security}, 2018), while satisfying both secrecy and demand privacy conditions.

### KeepKV: Eliminating Output Perturbation in KV Cache Compression for   Efficient LLMs Inference
**Authors**: Yuxuan Tian, Zihan Wang, Yebo Peng, Aomufei Yuan, Zhiming Wang, Bairen Yi, Xin Liu, Yong Cui, Tong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T06:58:00Z

**Summary**: Efficient inference of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by an ever-growing key-value (KV) cache, making KV cache compression a critical research direction. Traditional methods selectively evict less important KV cache entries based on attention scores or position heuristics, which leads to information loss and hallucinations. Recently, merging-based strategies have been explored to retain more information by merging KV pairs that would be discarded; however, these existing approaches inevitably introduce inconsistencies in attention distributions before and after merging, causing output perturbation and degraded generation quality. To overcome this challenge, we propose KeepKV, a novel adaptive KV cache merging method designed to eliminate output perturbation while preserving performance under strict memory constraints. KeepKV introduces the Electoral Votes mechanism that records merging history and adaptively adjusts attention scores. Moreover, it further leverages a novel Zero Inference-Perturbation Merging methods, keeping attention consistency and compensating for attention loss resulting from cache merging. KeepKV successfully retains essential context information within a significantly compressed cache. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLM architectures demonstrate that KeepKV substantially reduces memory usage, enhances inference throughput by more than 2x and keeps superior generation quality even with 10% KV cache budgets.

### Plato: Plan to Efficiently Decode for Large Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Shuowei Jin, Xueshen Liu, Yongji Wu, Haizhong Zheng, Qingzhao Zhang, Atul Prakash, Matthew Lentz, Danyang Zhuo, Feng Qian, Z. Morley Mao

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T14:17:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language tasks, but their inference incurs substantial computational and memory overhead. To improve efficiency, parallel decoding methods like Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT) decompose prompts into sub-problems for concurrent processing. However, these methods significantly compromise answer quality by treating semantically linked sub-problems as independent. We propose Plato, a novel approach that co-designs algorithms and systems for semantic-aware parallel decoding. Plato leverages LLMs to organize sub-problems into a dependency graph based on logical and causal relationships, enabling concurrent decoding of non-dependent nodes while preserving answer coherence and quality. To further enhance efficiency, Plato pipelines planning and node decoding stages, implements a global context cache, and carefully structures node inference prompts to maximize key-value cache reuse and minimize overhead. Our evaluations show that Plato improves throughput by 68% over autoregressive decoding while achieving a 40% net win rate in answer quality. Compared to SoT, Plato demonstrates a remarkable 90% quality net-win rate. Ablation studies reveal that our pipeline design improves speedup by 29%, while our KV cache reuse optimization reduces overhead by 75%.

### Efficient LLM Serving on Hybrid Real-time and Best-effort Requests
**Authors**: Wan Borui, Zhao Juntao, Jiang Chenyu, Guo Chuanxiong, Wu Chuan

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T14:16:57Z

**Summary**: Recent breakthroughs in large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled various generative tasks on a single model. Real-world services (e.g., OpenAI's ChatGPT [27]) powered by an LLM often concurrently support latency-critical requests for interactive applications (e.g., question-answering systems, referred to as real-time or RT requests) and throughput-oriented requests for back-of-house processing (e.g., documents batch processing [28], referred to best-effort or BE requests), with complex hybrid inference workloads to the underlying model. State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM serving systems dedicate machines to each type of request, towards either low inference latency or high serving throughput, respectively. This practice simplifies request scheduling and management but suffers from poor resource utilization. We propose BROS, a hybrid LLM serving system that aims to collocate RT/BE requests, meeting RT requests' latency requirements while maintaining BE requests' throughput. BROS formulates the problem of hybrid RT/BE request scheduling and solves it with a dynamic priority-based algorithm. BROS designs a bidirectional KV cache management mechanism, allowing RT requests to share KV memory with BE requests to remove the scheduling restrictions caused by insufficient KV memory and improve utilization. Extensive experiments validate that BROS achieves a good trade-off when serving hybrid RT and BE requests. It significantly reduces the latency of RT requests (up to 74.20%), improving their fine-grained service level objectives (SLOs) attainments (up to 36.38x), with negligible throughput reduction for BE requests, showing significant advantages over SOTA systems like vLLM and TGI.

### Block-Attention for Efficient Prefilling
**Authors**: Dongyang Ma, Yan Wang, Lan Tian

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T14:02:47Z

**Summary**: We introduce Block-attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Traditional approaches often encode the entire context in an auto-regressive manner. Instead, Block-attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each block independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during inference. The implementation of Block-attention involves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-attention mechanism. Experiments on 11 diverse benchmarks, including RAG, ICL, and general domains, demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block-attention model not only achieves performance comparable to that of full-attention models, but can also seamlessly switch between the block and full attention modes without any performance loss. Notably, Block-attention significantly reduces the time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared to the full-attention models, the TTFT and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7% and 99.8%, respectively. Additionally, in Appendix A, we elaborate on how Block-attention is applied in Game AI scenario and the substantial potential benefits it entails. We strongly suggest researchers in the gaming field not to overlook this section.

### AB-Cache: Training-Free Acceleration of Diffusion Models via   Adams-Bashforth Cached Feature Reuse
**Authors**: Zichao Yu, Zhen Zou, Guojiang Shao, Chengwei Zhang, Shengze Xu, Jie Huang, Feng Zhao, Xiaodong Cun, Wenyi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T08:29:58Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in generative tasks, yet their iterative denoising process results in slow inference, limiting their practicality. While existing acceleration methods exploit the well-known U-shaped similarity pattern between adjacent steps through caching mechanisms, they lack theoretical foundation and rely on simplistic computation reuse, often leading to performance degradation. In this work, we provide a theoretical understanding by analyzing the denoising process through the second-order Adams-Bashforth method, revealing a linear relationship between the outputs of consecutive steps. This analysis explains why the outputs of adjacent steps exhibit a U-shaped pattern. Furthermore, extending Adams-Bashforth method to higher order, we propose a novel caching-based acceleration approach for diffusion models, instead of directly reusing cached results, with a truncation error bound of only \(O(h^k)\) where $h$ is the step size. Extensive validation across diverse image and video diffusion models (including HunyuanVideo and FLUX.1-dev) with various schedulers demonstrates our method's effectiveness in achieving nearly $3\times$ speedup while maintaining original performance levels, offering a practical real-time solution without compromising generation quality.

### Sub-nanosecond in-plane magnetization switching induced by field-like   spin-orbit torques from ferromagnets
**Authors**: Hanying Zhang, Ziqian Cui, Baiqing Jiang, Yuan Wang, C. Bi

**Updated**: 2025-04-13T04:46:02Z

**Summary**: Spin-orbit torques (SOTs) generated in SOT-material/ferromagnet structures are classified as damping-like (DL) and field-like (FL) torques for current-driven magnetization switching. It is well known that both DL- and FL-SOTs originate from the SOT-material and DL-SOT dominates the current-driven switching process while FL-SOT contributes limitedly, resulting in an incubation time (several nanoseconds) during collinear magnetization switching with the spin polarization because of the DL attributes. Here we report a FL-SOT originated from the ferromagnet, different from the origin of DL-SOT, and demonstrate that it dominates the collinear magnetization switching. We show that the FL-SOT and resultant collinear switching can be modulated, one order of magnitude and sign reversal, by controlling the ferromagnet. Because of no incubation time and higher charge-to-spin efficiencies in the FL switching, we further show that the switching time can be down to 200 ps with one order lower critical switching current density compared to DL switching. These results indicate that the FL switching may provide a practical solution for magnetic memory in speed-priority cache applications.

### Head-Aware KV Cache Compression for Efficient Visual Autoregressive   Modeling
**Authors**: Ziran Qin, Youru Lv, Mingbao Lin, Zeren Zhang, Danping Zou, Weiyao Lin

**Updated**: 2025-04-12T15:42:17Z

**Summary**: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have emerged as a powerful approach for multi-modal content creation, offering high efficiency and quality across diverse multimedia applications. However, they face significant memory bottlenecks due to extensive KV cache accumulation during inference. Existing KV cache compression techniques for large language models are suboptimal for VAR models due to, as we identify in this paper, two distinct categories of attention heads in VAR models: Structural Heads, which preserve spatial coherence through diagonal attention patterns, and Contextual Heads, which maintain semantic consistency through vertical attention patterns. These differences render single-strategy KV compression techniques ineffective for VAR models. To address this, we propose HACK, a training-free Head-Aware Compression method for KV cache. HACK allocates asymmetric cache budgets and employs pattern-specific compression strategies tailored to the essential characteristics of each head category. Experiments on Infinity-2B, Infinity-8B, and VAR-d30 demonstrate its effectiveness in text-to-image and class-conditional generation tasks. HACK can hack down up to 50\% and 70\% of cache with minimal performance degradation for VAR-d30 and Infinity-8B, respectively. Even with 70\% and 90\% KV cache compression in VAR-d30 and Infinity-8B, HACK still maintains high-quality generation while reducing memory usage by 44.2\% and 58.9\%, respectively.

### WF-VAE: Enhancing Video VAE by Wavelet-Driven Energy Flow for Latent   Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Zongjian Li, Bin Lin, Yang Ye, Liuhan Chen, Xinhua Cheng, Shenghai Yuan, Li Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-04-11T12:31:07Z

**Summary**: Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional latent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly, we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache, which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference. Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and 4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/WF-VAE.

### Scaling Up On-Device LLMs via Active-Weight Swapping Between DRAM and   Flash
**Authors**: Fucheng Jia, Zewen Wu, Shiqi Jiang, Huiqiang Jiang, Qianxi Zhang, Yuqing Yang, Yunxin Liu, Ju Ren, Deyu Zhang, Ting Cao

**Updated**: 2025-04-11T09:26:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed on mobile devices, but the limited DRAM capacity constrains the deployable model size. This paper introduces ActiveFlow, the first LLM inference framework that can achieve adaptive DRAM usage for modern LLMs (not ReLU-based), enabling the scaling up of deployable model sizes. The framework is based on the novel concept of active weight DRAM-flash swapping and incorporates three novel techniques: (1) Cross-layer active weights preloading. It uses the activations from the current layer to predict the active weights of several subsequent layers, enabling computation and data loading to overlap, as well as facilitating large I/O transfers. (2) Sparsity-aware self-distillation. It adjusts the active weights to align with the dense-model output distribution, compensating for approximations introduced by contextual sparsity. (3) Active weight DRAM-flash swapping pipeline. It orchestrates the DRAM space allocation among the hot weight cache, preloaded active weights, and computation-involved weights based on available memory. Results show ActiveFlow achieves the performance-cost Pareto frontier compared to existing efficiency optimization methods.

### II-NVM: Enhancing Map Accuracy and Consistency with Normal   Vector-Assisted Mapping
**Authors**: Chengwei Zhao, Yixuan Li, Yina Jian, Jie Xu, Linji Wang, Yongxin Ma, Xinglai Jin

**Updated**: 2025-04-11T02:10:02Z

**Summary**: SLAM technology plays a crucial role in indoor mapping and localization. A common challenge in indoor environments is the "double-sided mapping issue", where closely positioned walls, doors, and other surfaces are mistakenly identified as a single plane, significantly hindering map accuracy and consistency. To address this issue this paper introduces a SLAM approach that ensures accurate mapping using normal vector consistency. We enhance the voxel map structure to store both point cloud data and normal vector information, enabling the system to evaluate consistency during nearest neighbor searches and map updates. This process distinguishes between the front and back sides of surfaces, preventing incorrect point-to-plane constraints. Moreover, we implement an adaptive radius KD-tree search method that dynamically adjusts the search radius based on the local density of the point cloud, thereby enhancing the accuracy of normal vector calculations. To further improve realtime performance and storage efficiency, we incorporate a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache strategy, which facilitates efficient incremental updates of the voxel map. The code is released as open-source and validated in both simulated environments and real indoor scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach effectively resolves the "double-sided mapping issue" and significantly improves mapping precision. Additionally, we have developed and open-sourced the first simulation and real world dataset specifically tailored for the "double-sided mapping issue".

### Boosting Universal LLM Reward Design through Heuristic Reward   Observation Space Evolution
**Authors**: Zen Kit Heng, Zimeng Zhao, Tianhao Wu, Yuanfei Wang, Mingdong Wu, Yangang Wang, Hao Dong

**Updated**: 2025-04-11T02:05:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising tools for automated reinforcement learning (RL) reward design, owing to their robust capabilities in commonsense reasoning and code generation. By engaging in dialogues with RL agents, LLMs construct a Reward Observation Space (ROS) by selecting relevant environment states and defining their internal operations. However, existing frameworks have not effectively leveraged historical exploration data or manual task descriptions to iteratively evolve this space. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic framework that enhances LLM-driven reward design by evolving the ROS through a table-based exploration caching mechanism and a text-code reconciliation strategy. Our framework introduces a state execution table, which tracks the historical usage and success rates of environment states, overcoming the Markovian constraint typically found in LLM dialogues and facilitating more effective exploration. Furthermore, we reconcile user-provided task descriptions with expert-defined success criteria using structured prompts, ensuring alignment in reward design objectives. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark RL tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed framework. Code and video demos are available at jingjjjjjie.github.io/LLM2Reward.

**Authors**: Dibyadip Chatterjee, Edoardo Remelli, Yale Song, Bugra Tekin, Abhay Mittal, Bharat Bhatnagar, Necati Cihan Camgöz, Shreyas Hampali, Eric Sauser, Shugao Ma, Angela Yao, Fadime Sener

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T17:13:08Z

**Summary**: We introduce ProVideLLM, an end-to-end framework for real-time procedural video understanding. ProVideLLM integrates a multimodal cache configured to store two types of tokens - verbalized text tokens, which provide compressed textual summaries of long-term observations, and visual tokens, encoded with DETR-QFormer to capture fine-grained details from short-term observations. This design reduces token count by 22x over existing methods in representing one hour of long-term observations while effectively encoding fine-granularity of the present. By interleaving these tokens in our multimodal cache, ProVideLLM ensures sub-linear scaling of memory and compute with video length, enabling per-frame streaming inference at 10 FPS and streaming dialogue at 25 FPS, with a minimal 2GB GPU memory footprint. ProVideLLM also sets new state-of-the-art results on six procedural tasks across four datasets.

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T14:52:03Z

**Summary**: Investigative workflows require interactive exploratory analysis on large heterogeneous knowledge graphs. Current databases show limitations in enabling such task. This paper discusses the architecture of Siren Federate, a system that efficiently supports exploratory graph analysis by bridging document-oriented, relational and graph models. Technical contributions include distributed join algorithms, adaptive query planning, query plan folding, semantic caching, and semi-join decomposition for path query. Semi-join decomposition addresses the exponential growth of intermediate results in path-based queries. Experiments show that Siren Federate exhibits low latency and scales well with the amount of data, the number of users, and the number of computing nodes.

### Cache-a-lot: Pushing the Limits of Unsatisfiable Core Reuse in SMT-Based   Program Analysis
**Authors**: Rustam Sadykov, Azat Abdullin, Marat Akhin

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T10:43:42Z

**Summary**: Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers are integral to program analysis techniques like concolic and symbolic execution, where they help assess the satisfiability of logical formulae to explore execution paths of the program under test. However, frequent solver invocations are still the main performance bottleneck of these techniques. One way to mitigate this challenge is through optimizations such as caching and reusing solver results. While current methods typically focus on reusing results from fully equivalent or closely related formulas, they often miss broader opportunities for reuse. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Cache-a-lot, that extends the reuse of unsatisfiable (unsat) results by systematically considering all possible variable substitutions. This enables more extensive reuse of results, thereby reducing the number of SMT solver invocations and improving the overall efficiency of concolic and symbolic execution. Our evaluation, conducted against the state-of-the-art Utopia solution using two benchmark sets, shows significant improvements, particularly with more complex formulas. Our method achieves up to 74% unsat core reuse, compared to Utopia's 41%, and significant increase in the time savings. These results demonstrate that, despite the additional computational complexity, the broader reuse of unsat results significantly enhances performance, offering valuable advancements for formal verification and program analysis.

### Apt-Serve: Adaptive Request Scheduling on Hybrid Cache for Scalable LLM   Inference Serving
**Authors**: Shihong Gao, Xin Zhang, Yanyan Shen, Lei Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T06:51:23Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) inference serving systems are essential to various LLM-based applications. As demand for LLM services continues to grow, scaling these systems to handle high request rates while meeting latency Service-Level Objectives (SLOs), referred to as effective throughput, becomes critical. However, existing systems often struggle to improve effective throughput, primarily due to a significant decline in Time To First Token (TTFT) SLO attainment. We identify two major causes of this bottleneck: (1) memory-intensive KV cache that limits batch size expansion under GPU memory constraints, and (2) rigid batch composition enforced by the default First-Come-First-Serve scheduling policy. In this paper, we introduce Apt-Serve, a scalable framework designed to enhance effective throughput in LLM inference serving. Apt-Serve features a new hybrid cache scheme that combines KV cache with a memory-efficient hidden cache for reusable input hidden state vectors, allowing large batch sizes and improving request concurrency. Based on the hybrid cache, Apt-Serve employs an adaptive runtime scheduling mechanism that dynamically optimizes batch composition. We formally define the adaptive scheduling optimization problem and propose an efficient algorithm with theoretical guarantees. Extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets and LLMs ranging from 13B to 66B parameters demonstrate that Apt-Serve achieves up to 8.8x improvement in effective throughput compared to the state-of-the-art inference serving systems.

### UniCAIM: A Unified CAM/CIM Architecture with Static-Dynamic KV Cache   Pruning for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Weikai Xu, Wenxuan Zeng, Qianqian Huang, Meng Li, Ru Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T06:13:30Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in various natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, the high memory and computation cost induced by the KV cache limits the inference efficiency, especially for long input sequences. Compute-in-memory (CIM)-based accelerators have been proposed for LLM acceleration with KV cache pruning. However, as existing accelerators only support static pruning with a fixed pattern or dynamic pruning with primitive implementations, they suffer from either high accuracy degradation or low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a ferroelectric FET (FeFET)-based unified content addressable memory (CAM) and CIM architecture, dubbed as UniCAIM. UniCAIM features simultaneous support for static and dynamic pruning with 3 computation modes: 1) in the CAM mode, UniCAIM enables approximate similarity measurement in O(1) time for dynamic KV cache pruning with high energy efficiency; 2) in the charge-domain CIM mode, static pruning can be supported based on accumulative similarity score, which is much more flexible compared to fixed patterns; 3) in the current-domain mode, exact attention computation can be conducted with a subset of selected KV cache. We further propose a novel CAM/CIM cell design that leverages the multi-level characteristics of FeFETs for signed multibit storage of the KV cache and in-place attention computation. With extensive experimental results, we demonstrate UniCAIM can reduce the area-energy-delay product (AEDP) by 8.2-831x over the state-ofthe-art CIM-based LLM accelerators at the circuit level, along with high accuracy comparable with dense attention at the application level, showing its great potential for efficient long-context LLM inference.

### Marconi: Prefix Caching for the Era of Hybrid LLMs
**Authors**: Rui Pan, Zhuang Wang, Zhen Jia, Can Karakus, Luca Zancato, Tri Dao, Yida Wang, Ravi Netravali

**Updated**: 2025-04-10T05:06:29Z

**Summary**: Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention layers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have gained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model serving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of complementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip redundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place state updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for partial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits; the effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which yield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that supports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its novel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential cache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their reuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the compute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse workloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\times$ higher token hit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix caching systems.

### MAGNUS: Generating Data Locality to Accelerate Sparse Matrix-Matrix   Multiplication on CPUs
**Authors**: Jordi Wolfson-Pou, Jan Laukemann, Fabrizio Petrini

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T21:47:31Z

**Summary**: Sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a critical operation in many applications. Current multithreaded implementations are based on Gustavson's algorithm and often perform poorly on large matrices due to limited cache reuse by the accumulators. We present MAGNUS (Matrix Algebra for Gigantic NUmerical Systems), a novel algorithm to maximize data locality in SpGEMM. To generate locality, MAGNUS reorders the intermediate product into discrete cache-friendly chunks using a two-level hierarchical approach. The accumulator is applied to each chunk, where the chunk size is chosen such that the accumulator is cache-efficient. MAGNUS is input- and system-aware: based on the matrix characteristics and target system specifications, the optimal number of chunks is computed by minimizing the storage cost of the necessary data structures. MAGNUS allows for a hybrid accumulation strategy in which each chunk uses a different accumulator based on an input threshold. We consider two accumulators: an AVX-512 vectorized bitonic sorting algorithm and classical dense accumulation. An OpenMP implementation of MAGNUS is compared with several baselines, including Intel MKL, for a variety of different matrices on three Intel architectures. For matrices from the SuiteSparse collection, MAGNUS is faster than all the baselines in most cases and is often an order of magnitude faster than at least one baseline. For massive random matrices, MAGNUS scales to the largest matrix sizes, while the baselines do not. Furthermore, MAGNUS is close to the optimal bound for these matrices, regardless of the matrix size, structure, and density.

### Tensor Product Attention Is All You Need
**Authors**: Yifan Zhang, Yifeng Liu, Huizhuo Yuan, Zhen Qin, Yang Yuan, Quanquan Gu, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T20:51:08Z

**Summary**: Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, significantly shrinking KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components (contextual factorization) and seamlessly integrating with RoPE, TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation of language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 exceeds the performance of standard Transformer baselines including MHA, MQA, GQA, and MLA across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of renowned evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency enables the processing of significantly longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models. The code is available at https://github.com/tensorgi/T6.

### Hogwild! Inference: Parallel LLM Generation via Concurrent Attention
**Authors**: Gleb Rodionov, Roman Garipov, Alina Shutova, George Yakushev, Vage Egiazarian, Anton Sinitsin, Denis Kuznedelev, Dan Alistarh

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T17:56:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through advanced reasoning, long-form content generation, and tool use. Solving these tasks often involves long inference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to expedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks, exploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown that LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation frameworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks may not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their applicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM "workers" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated attention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our approach allows the instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy for the problem at hand, all the while "seeing" each other's partial progress in the concurrent cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a parallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in parallel with the same attention cache, with "instant" access to each other's generated tokens. Hogwild! inference takes advantage of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware utilization. We find that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference with shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning.

### Saliency-driven Dynamic Token Pruning for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yao Tao, Yehui Tang, Yun Wang, Mingjian Zhu, Hailin Hu, Yunhe Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T14:36:19Z

**Summary**: Despite the recent success of large language models (LLMs), LLMs are particularly challenging in long-sequence inference scenarios due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism. Inspired by the interpretability theory of feature attribution in neural network models, we observe that not all tokens have the same contribution. Based on this observation, we propose a novel token pruning framework, namely Saliency-driven Dynamic Token Pruning (SDTP), to gradually and dynamically prune redundant tokens based on the input context. Specifically, a lightweight saliency-driven prediction module is designed to estimate the importance score of each token with its hidden state, which is added to different layers of the LLM to hierarchically prune redundant tokens. Furthermore, a ranking-based optimization strategy is proposed to minimize the ranking divergence of the saliency score and the predicted importance score. Extensive experiments have shown that our framework is generalizable to various models and datasets. By hierarchically pruning 65\% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 33\% $\sim$ 47\% FLOPs and achieves speedup up to 1.75$\times$ during inference, while maintaining comparable performance. We further demonstrate that SDTP can be combined with KV cache compression method for further compression.

### Introducing the Arm-membench Throughput Benchmark
**Authors**: Cyrill Burth, Markus Velten, Robert Schöne

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T12:07:26Z

**Summary**: Application performance of modern day processors is often limited by the memory subsystem rather than actual compute capabilities. Therefore, data throughput specifications play a key role in modeling application performance and determining possible bottlenecks. However, while peak instruction throughputs and bandwidths for local caches are often documented, the achievable throughput can also depend on the relation between memory access and compute instructions. In this paper, we present an Arm version of the well established x86-membench throughput benchmark, which we have adapted to support all current SIMD extensions of the Armv8 instruction set architecture. We describe aspects of the Armv8 ISA that need to be considered in the portable design of this benchmark. We use the benchmark to analyze the memory subsystem at a fine spatial granularity and to unveil microarchitectural details of three processors: Fujitsu A64FX, Ampere Altra and Cavium ThunderX2. Based on the resulting performance information, we show that instruction fetch and decoder widths become a potential bottleneck for cache-bandwidth-sensitive workloads due to the load-store concept of the Arm ISA.

### Optimizing LLM Queries in Relational Data Analytics Workloads
**Authors**: Shu Liu, Asim Biswal, Amog Kamsetty, Audrey Cheng, Luis Gaspar Schroeder, Liana Patel, Shiyi Cao, Xiangxi Mo, Ion Stoica, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Matei Zaharia

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T10:23:39Z

**Summary**: Batch data analytics is a growing application for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs enable users to perform a wide range of natural language tasks, such as classification, entity extraction, and translation, over large datasets. However, LLM inference is highly costly and slow: for example, an NVIDIA L4 GPU running Llama3-8B can only process 6 KB of text per second, taking about a day to handle 15 GB of data; processing a similar amount of data costs around $10K on OpenAI's GPT-4o. In this paper, we propose novel techniques that can significantly reduce the cost of LLM calls for relational data analytics workloads. Our key contribution is developing efficient algorithms for reordering the rows and the fields within each row of an input table to maximize key-value (KV) cache reuse when performing LLM serving. As such, our approach can be easily applied to existing analytics systems and serving platforms. Our evaluation shows that our solution can yield up to 3.4x improvement in job completion time on a benchmark of diverse LLM-based queries using Llama 3 models. Our solution also achieves a 32% cost savings under OpenAI and Anthropic pricing models.

### MemoRAG: Boosting Long Context Processing with Global Memory-Enhanced   Retrieval Augmentation
**Authors**: Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang, Kelong Mao, Defu Lian, Zhicheng Dou, Tiejun Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T09:09:37Z

**Summary**: Processing long contexts presents a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs). While recent advancements allow LLMs to handle much longer contexts than before (e.g., 32K or 128K tokens), it is computationally expensive and can still be insufficient for many applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is considered a promising strategy to address this problem. However, conventional RAG methods face inherent limitations because of two underlying requirements: 1) explicitly stated queries, and 2) well-structured knowledge. These conditions, however, do not hold in general long-context processing tasks.   In this work, we propose MemoRAG, a novel RAG framework empowered by global memory-augmented retrieval. MemoRAG features a dual-system architecture. First, it employs a light but long-range system to create a global memory of the long context. Once a task is presented, it generates draft answers, providing useful clues for the retrieval tools to locate relevant information within the long context. Second, it leverages an expensive but expressive system, which generates the final answer based on the retrieved information. Building upon this fundamental framework, we realize the memory module in the form of KV compression, and reinforce its memorization and cluing capacity from the Generation quality's Feedback (a.k.a. RLGF). In our experiments, MemoRAG achieves superior performances across a variety of long-context evaluation tasks, not only complex scenarios where traditional RAG methods struggle, but also simpler ones where RAG is typically applied.

### Dynamic Content Caching with Waiting Costs via Restless Multi-Armed   Bandits
**Authors**: Ankita Koley, Chandramani Singh

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T07:55:43Z

**Summary**: We consider a system with a local cache connected to a backend server and an end user population. A set of contents are stored at the the server where they continuously get updated. The local cache keeps copies, potentially stale, of a subset of the contents. The users make content requests to the local cache which either can serve the local version if available or can fetch a fresh version or can wait for additional requests before fetching and serving a fresh version. Serving a stale version of a content incurs an age-of-version(AoV) dependent ageing cost, fetching it from the server incurs a fetching cost, and making a request wait incurs a per unit time waiting cost. We focus on the optimal actions subject to the cache capacity constraint at each decision epoch, aiming at minimizing the long term average cost. We pose the problem as a Restless Multi-armed Bandit(RMAB) Problem and propose a Whittle index based policy which is known to be asymptotically optimal. We explicitly characterize the Whittle indices. We numerically evaluate the proposed policy and also compare it to a greedy policy. We show that it is close to the optimal policy and substantially outperforms the exising policies.

### GastCoCo: Graph Storage and Coroutine-Based Prefetch Co-Design for   Dynamic Graph Processing
**Authors**: Hongfu Li, Qian Tao, Song Yu, Shufeng Gong, Yanfeng Zhang, Feng Yao, Wenyuan Yu, Ge Yu, Jingren Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-09T03:49:16Z

**Summary**: An efficient data structure is fundamental to meeting the growing demands in dynamic graph processing. However, the dual requirements for graph computation efficiency (with contiguous structures) and graph update efficiency (with linked list-like structures) present a conflict in the design principles of graph structures. After experimental studies of existing state-of-the-art dynamic graph structures, we observe that the overhead of cache misses accounts for a major portion of the graph computation time. This paper presents GastCoCo, a system with graph storage and coroutine-based prefetch co-design. By employing software prefetching via stackless coroutines and introducing a prefetch-friendly data structure CBList, GastCoCo significantly alleviates the performance degradation caused by cache misses. Our results show that GastCoCo outperforms state-of-the-art graph storage systems by 1.3x - 180x in graph updates and 1.4x - 41.1x in graph computation.

### SPIRe: Boosting LLM Inference Throughput with Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Sanjit Neelam, Daniel Heinlein, Vaclav Cvicek, Akshay Mishra, Reiner Pope

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T20:39:20Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding (SD) has been shown to reduce the latency of autoregressive decoding (AD) by 2-3x for small batch sizes. However, increasing throughput and therefore reducing the cost per token requires decoding with large batch sizes. Recent work shows that SD can accelerate decoding with large batch sizes too if the context is sufficiently long and the draft model's KV cache is sparse. We introduce SPIRe, a draft model that combines static sparse attention, pruned initialization, and feedback memory to increase the modeled throughput of speculative decoding by over 100% compared to speculation with a much smaller draft model and by over 35% compared to the strong baseline of sparse self-speculation. Our approach is particularly effective when context lengths vary significantly across requests.

### Unifying Autoregressive and Diffusion-Based Sequence Generation
**Authors**: Nima Fathi, Torsten Scholak, Pierre-André Noël

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T20:32:10Z

**Summary**: We present significant extensions to diffusion-based sequence generation models, blurring the line with autoregressive language models. We introduce hyperschedules, which assign distinct noise schedules to individual token positions, generalizing both autoregressive models (e.g., GPT) and conventional diffusion models (e.g., SEDD, MDLM) as special cases. Second, we propose two hybrid token-wise noising processes that interpolate between absorbing and uniform processes, enabling the model to fix past mistakes, and we introduce a novel inference algorithm that leverages this new feature in a simplified context inspired from MDLM. To support efficient training and inference, we design attention masks compatible with KV-caching. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art perplexity and generate diverse, high-quality sequences across standard benchmarks, suggesting a promising path for autoregressive diffusion-based sequence generation.

### Walking on Spheres and Talking to Neighbors: Variance Reduction for   Laplace's Equation
**Authors**: Michael Czekanski, Benjamin Faber, Margaret Fairborn, Adelle Wright, David Bindel

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T19:26:41Z

**Summary**: Walk on Spheres algorithms leverage properties of Brownian Motion to create Monte Carlo estimates of solutions to a class of elliptic partial differential equations. We propose a new caching strategy which leverages the continuity of paths of Brownian Motion. In the case of Laplace's equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, our algorithm has improved asymptotic runtime compared to previous approaches. Until recently, estimates were constructed pointwise and did not use the relationship between solutions at nearby points within a domain. Instead, our results are achieved by passing information from a cache of fixed size. We also provide bounds on the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its performance on example problems of increasing complexity.

### GPU-accelerated Evolutionary Many-objective Optimization Using   Tensorized NSGA-III
**Authors**: Hao Li, Zhenyu Liang, Ran Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T14:09:23Z

**Summary**: NSGA-III is one of the most widely adopted algorithms for tackling many-objective optimization problems. However, its CPU-based design severely limits scalability and computational efficiency. To address the limitations, we propose {TensorNSGA-III}, a fully tensorized implementation of NSGA-III that leverages GPU parallelism for large-scale many-objective optimization. Unlike conventional GPU-accelerated evolutionary algorithms that rely on heuristic approximations to improve efficiency, TensorNSGA-III maintains the exact selection and variation mechanisms of NSGA-III while achieving significant acceleration. By reformulating the selection process with tensorized data structures and an optimized caching strategy, our approach effectively eliminates computational bottlenecks inherent in traditional CPU-based and na\"ive GPU implementations. Experimental results on widely used numerical benchmarks show that TensorNSGA-III achieves speedups of up to $3629\times$ over the CPU version of NSGA-III. Additionally, we validate its effectiveness in multiobjective robotic control tasks, where it discovers diverse and high-quality behavioral solutions. Furthermore, we investigate the critical role of large population sizes in many-objective optimization and demonstrate the scalability of TensorNSGA-III in such scenarios.

### Unifying KV Cache Compression for Large Language Models with LeanKV
**Authors**: Yanqi Zhang, Yuwei Hu, Runyuan Zhao, John C. S. Lui, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T14:05:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance but incur significant serving costs due to their substantial memory requirements, with the key-value (KV) cache being a primary bottleneck. Existing KV cache compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, apply uniform treatment to both keys and values, and discard unimportant tokens entirely, overlooking the fine-grained differences in significance of various components within the KV cache. To address these limitations, we introduce LeanKV, a framework that advances KV cache compression by exploiting three levels of differentiation in the KV cache: (1) the differing impact of keys and values on attention computation, (2) the varying importance of tokens, and (3) the diverse dynamic sparsity patterns across attention heads. At the core of LeanKV is an on-GPU memory manager that compacts fragmented free memory list into contiguous regions in parallel, effectively translating sparsity in the KV cache into performance gains. We evaluate LeanKV on several mainstream models, including the recent "thinking model". LeanKV is able to compress the KV cache by $2.7\times$ to $5.7\times$ with near-lossless accuracy on complex workloads requiring sophisticated reasoning and long-generation capabilities, and enhances throughput by $1.9\times$ to $5.4\times$.

### Graph Federated Learning Based Proactive Content Caching in Edge   Computing
**Authors**: Rui Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T12:46:45Z

**Summary**: With the rapid growth of mobile data traffic and the increasing prevalence of video streaming, proactive content caching in edge computing has become crucial for reducing latency and alleviating network congestion. However, traditional caching strategies such as FIFO, LRU, and LFU fail to effectively predict future content popularity, while existing proactive caching approaches often require users to upload data to a central server, raising concerns regarding privacy and scalability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Graph Federated Learning-based Proactive Content Caching (GFPCC) scheme that enhances caching efficiency while preserving user privacy. The proposed approach integrates federated learning and graph neural networks, enabling users to locally train Light Graph Convolutional Networks (LightGCN) to capture user-item relationships and predict content popularity. Instead of sharing raw data, only the trained model parameters are transmitted to the central server, where a federated averaging algorithm aggregates updates, refines the global model, and selects the most popular files for proactive caching. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets, such as MovieLens, demonstrate that GFPCC outperforms baseline caching algorithms by achieving higher cache efficiency through more accurate content popularity predictions. Moreover, the federated learning framework strengthens privacy protection while maintaining efficient model training; however, scalability remains a challenge in large-scale networks with dynamic user preferences.

### HybriMoE: Hybrid CPU-GPU Scheduling and Cache Management for Efficient   MoE Inference
**Authors**: Shuzhang Zhong, Yanfan Sun, Ling Liang, Runsheng Wang, Ru Huang, Meng Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T10:47:37Z

**Summary**: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has demonstrated significant advantages as it enables to increase the model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. However, the large MoE model size still introduces substantial memory demands, which usually requires expert offloading on resource-constrained platforms and incurs significant overhead. Hybrid CPU-GPU inference has been proposed to leverage CPU computation to reduce expert loading overhead but faces major challenges: on one hand, the expert activation patterns of MoE models are highly unstable, rendering the fixed mapping strategies in existing works inefficient; on the other hand, the hybrid CPU-GPU schedule for MoE is inherently complex due to the diverse expert sizes, structures, uneven workload distribution, etc. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose HybriMoE, a hybrid CPU-GPU inference framework that improves resource utilization through a novel CPU-GPU scheduling and cache management system. HybriMoE introduces (i) a dynamic intra-layer scheduling strategy to balance workloads across CPU and GPU, (ii) an impact-driven inter-layer prefetching algorithm, and (iii) a score-based caching algorithm to mitigate expert activation instability. We implement HybriMoE on top of the kTransformers framework and evaluate it on three widely used MoE-based LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that HybriMoE achieves an average speedup of 1.33$\times$ in the prefill stage and 1.70$\times$ in the decode stage compared to state-of-the-art hybrid MoE inference framework. Our code is available at: https://github.com/PKU-SEC-Lab/HybriMoE.

### Accelerating LLM Inference Throughput via Asynchronous KV Cache   Prefetching
**Authors**: Yanhao Dong, Yubo Miao, Weinan Li, Xiao Zheng, Chao Wang, Feng Lyu

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T09:17:35Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit pronounced memory-bound characteristics during inference due to High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) bandwidth constraints. In this paper, we propose an L2 Cache-oriented asynchronous KV Cache prefetching method to break through the memory bandwidth bottleneck in LLM inference through computation-load overlap. By strategically scheduling idle memory bandwidth during active computation windows, our method proactively prefetches required KV Cache into GPU L2 cache, enabling high-speed L2 cache hits for subsequent accesses and effectively hiding HBM access latency within computational cycles. Extensive experiments on NVIDIA H20 GPUs demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 2.15x improvement in attention kernel efficiency and up to 1.97x end-to-end throughput enhancement, surpassing state-of-the-art baseline FlashAttention-3. Notably, our solution maintains orthogonality to existing optimization techniques and can be integrated with current inference frameworks, providing a scalable latency-hiding solution for next-generation LLM inference engines.

**Summary**: For a two-hop IoT system consisting of multiple energy harvesting sensors, a cache-enabled edge node, and multiple monitors, the status update control at the edge node, which has partial battery state information (pBSI) of the sensors, is formulated as a pBSI problem. The concept of inferred pBSI is introduced to reduce the noiseless single-sensor pBSI problem to a Markov decision process with a moderate state-space size, enabling the optimal policy to be obtained through a value iteration algorithm. A lower bound on the expected time-average on-demand age of information performance is established for the general single-sensor status update problem. For the single-sensor pBSI problem, a semi-closed-form policy called the current-next (CN) policy is proposed, along with an efficient post-update value iteration algorithm with a per-iteration time complexity proportional to the square of the battery capacity. A weighted-update-gain-competition (WUGC) approach is further leveraged to extend the CN policy to the multi-sensor case. Numerical results in the single-sensor case demonstrate the near-optimal performance of the CN policy across various energy arrival processes. Simulations for an IoT system with $100$ sensors reveal that the WUGC-CN policy outperforms the maximum-age-first policy and the random-scheduling-based CN policy under Bernoulli energy arrival processes.

### CVA6-VMRT: A Modular Approach Towards Time-Predictable Virtual Memory in   a 64-bit Application Class RISC-V Processor
**Authors**: Christopher Reinwardt, Robert Balas, Alessandro Ottaviano, Angelo Garofalo, Luca Benini

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T06:38:27Z

**Summary**: The increasing complexity of autonomous systems has driven a shift to integrated heterogeneous SoCs with real-time and safety demands. Ensuring deterministic WCETs and low-latency for critical tasks requires minimizing interference on shared resources like virtual memory. Existing techniques, such as software coloring and memory replication, introduce significant area and performance overhead, especially with virtualized memory where address translation adds latency uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose CVA6-VMRT, an extension of the open-source RISC-V CVA6 core, adding hardware support for predictability in virtual memory access with minimal area overhead. CVA6-VMRT features dynamically partitioned Translation Look-aside Buffers (TLBs) and hybrid L1 cache/scratchpad memory (SPM) functionality. It allows fine-grained per-thread control of resources, enabling the operating system to manage TLB replacements, including static overwrites, to ensure single-cycle address translation for critical memory regions. Additionally, CVA6-VMRT enables runtime partitioning of data and instruction caches into cache and SPM sections, providing low and predictable access times for critical data without impacting other accesses. In a virtualized setting, CVA6-VMRT enhances execution time determinism for critical guests by 94% during interference from non-critical guests, with minimal impact on their average absolute execution time compared to isolated execution of the critical guests only. This interference-aware behaviour is achieved with just a 4% area overhead and no timing penalty compared to the baseline CVA6 core.

### SR-LIO++: Efficient LiDAR-Inertial Odometry and Quantized Mapping with   Sweep Reconstruction
**Authors**: Zikang Yuan, Ruiye Ming, Chengwei Zhao, Yonghao Tan, Pingcheng Dong, Hongcheng Luo, Yuzhong Jiao, Xin Yang, Kwang-Ting Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T05:27:15Z

**Summary**: Addressing the inherent low acquisition frequency limitation of 3D LiDAR to achieve high-frequency output has become a critical research focus in the LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) domain. To ensure real-time performance, frequency-enhanced LIO systems must process each sweep within significantly reduced timeframe, which presents substantial challenges for deployment on low-computational-power platforms. To address these limitations, we introduce SR-LIO++, an innovative LIO system capable of achieving doubled output frequency relative to input frequency on resource-constrained hardware platforms, including the Raspberry Pi 4B. Our system employs a sweep reconstruction methodology to enhance LiDAR sweep frequency, generating high-frequency reconstructed sweeps. Building upon this foundation, we propose a caching mechanism for intermediate results (i.e., surface parameters) of the most recent segments, effectively minimizing redundant processing of common segments in adjacent reconstructed sweeps. This method decouples processing time from the traditionally linear dependence on reconstructed sweep frequency. Furthermore, we present a quantized map point management based on index table mapping, significantly reducing memory usage by converting global 3D point storage from 64-bit double precision to 8-bit char representation. This method also converts the computationally intensive Euclidean distance calculations in nearest neighbor searches from 64-bit double precision to 16-bit short and 32-bit integer formats, significantly reducing both memory and computational cost. Extensive experimental evaluations across three distinct computing platforms and four public datasets demonstrate that SR-LIO++ maintains state-of-the-art accuracy while substantially enhancing efficiency. Notably, our system successfully achieves 20Hz state output on Raspberry Pi 4B hardware.

### MILLION: Mastering Long-Context LLM Inference Via Outlier-Immunized KV   Product Quantization
**Authors**: Zongwu Wang, Peng Xu, Fangxin Liu, Yiwei Hu, Qingxiao Sun, Gezi Li, Cheng Li, Xuan Wang, Li Jiang, Haibing Guan

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T04:34:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized for complex tasks requiring longer context lengths, with some models supporting up to 128K or 1M tokens. This trend, however, presents significant challenges in inference speed and memory management. Quantization emerges as a promising approach to address the widening gap between LLM size and memory capacity. However, traditional quantization schemes often yield suboptimal compression results for KV caches due to two key factors: i) On-the-fly quantization and de-quantization, causing significant performance overhead; ii) Prevalence of outliers in KV values, challenging low-bitwidth uniform quantization. To this end, we propose MILLION, a novel quantization framework achieving low-bitwidth KV cache through product quantization. First, we conduct a thorough analysis of KV cache distribution, revealing the limitations of existing quantization schemes. Second, we introduce a non-uniform quantization algorithm based on product quantization, which efficiently compresses data while preserving accuracy. Third, we develop a high-performance GPU inference framework with efficient attention kernel and pipeline design for MILLION that leverages sparse computation and asynchronous quantization, significantly enhancing inference speed. Comprehensive evaluation results demonstrate that MILLION can achieve 4 bits quantization with trivial perplexity and accuracy loss, and achieve 2.09x end-to-end performance gains at 32K context length. Code is released at https://github.com/ZongwuWang/MILLION.

### Lattice: Learning to Efficiently Compress the Memory
**Authors**: Mahdi Karami, Vahab Mirrokni

**Updated**: 2025-04-08T03:48:43Z

**Summary**: Attention mechanisms have revolutionized sequence learning but suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This paper introduces Lattice, a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) mechanism that leverages the inherent low-rank structure of K-V matrices to efficiently compress the cache into a fixed number of memory slots, achieving sub-quadratic complexity. We formulate this compression as an online optimization problem and derive a dynamic memory update rule based on a single gradient descent step. The resulting recurrence features a state- and input-dependent gating mechanism, offering an interpretable memory update process. The core innovation is the orthogonal update: each memory slot is updated exclusively with information orthogonal to its current state hence incorporation of only novel, non-redundant data, which minimizes the interference with previously stored information. The experimental results show that Lattice achieves the best perplexity compared to all baselines across diverse context lengths, with performance improvement becoming more pronounced as the context length increases.

### ARCANE: Adaptive RISC-V Cache Architecture for Near-memory Extensions
**Authors**: Vincenzo Petrolo, Flavia Guella, Michele Caon, Pasquale Davide Schiavone, Guido Masera, Maurizio Martina

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T22:48:33Z

**Summary**: Modern data-driven applications expose limitations of von Neumann architectures - extensive data movement, low throughput, and poor energy efficiency. Accelerators improve performance but lack flexibility and require data transfers. Existing compute in- and near-memory solutions mitigate these issues but face usability challenges due to data placement constraints. We propose a novel cache architecture that doubles as a tightly-coupled compute-near-memory coprocessor. Our RISC-V cache controller executes custom instructions from the host CPU using vector operations dispatched to near-memory vector processing units within the cache memory subsystem. This architecture abstracts memory synchronization and data mapping from application software while offering software-based Instruction Set Architecture extensibility. Our implementation shows $30\times$ to $84\times$ performance improvement when operating on 8-bit data over the same system with a traditional cache when executing a worst-case 32-bit CNN workload, with only $41.3\%$ area overhead.

### LLM meets ML: Data-efficient Anomaly Detection on Unseen Unstable Logs
**Authors**: Fatemeh Hadadi, Qinghua Xu, Domenico Bianculli, Lionel Briand

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T20:52:04Z

**Summary**: Most log-based anomaly detectors assume logs are stable, though logs are often unstable due to software or environmental changes. Anomaly detection on unstable logs (ULAD) is therefore a more realistic, yet under-investigated challenge. Current approaches predominantly employ machine learning (ML) models, which often require extensive labeled data for training. To mitigate data insufficiency, we propose FlexLog, a novel hybrid approach for ULAD that combines ML models -- decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and a feedforward neural network -- with a Large Language Model (Mistral) through ensemble learning. FlexLog also incorporates a cache and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further enhance efficiency and effectiveness. To evaluate FlexLog, we configured four datasets for ULAD, namely ADFA-U, LOGEVOL-U, SynHDFS-U, and SYNEVOL-U. FlexLog outperforms all baselines by at least 1.2 percentage points in F1 score while using 62.87 percentage points less labeled data. When trained on the same amount of data as the baselines, FlexLog achieves up to a 13 percentage points increase in F1 score on ADFA-U across varying training dataset sizes. Additionally, FlexLog maintains inference time under one second per log sequence, making it suitable for most applications except latency-sensitive systems. Further analysis reveals the positive impact of FlexLog's key components: cache, RAG and ensemble learning.

### State Tuning: State-based Test-Time Scaling on RWKV-7
**Authors**: Liu Xiao, Li Zhiyuan, Lin Yueyu

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T14:04:30Z

**Summary**: Test-time scaling has emerged as a prominent research direction in machine learning, enabling models to enhance their expressive capabilities during inference.Transformers, renowned for striking a delicate balance between efficiency and expressiveness, have benefited from test-time scaling techniques that leverage an expanding key-value (KV) cache to significantly improve performance.In this paper, we introduce a novel state-based approach to test-time scaling, which we term state tuning, tailored to the RNN-based RWKV-7 model.By exploiting the unique strengths of RWKV-7, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the target task without altering the model's pre-trained weights. Our approach centers on three key innovations. First, we develop an observer framework that allows a smaller model to replicate and learn the state dynamics of the RWKV-7 model. Second, we employ a kernel method to dynamically upscale the state size, enhancing the model's capacity to capture intricate patterns. Third, we integrate Decorrelated Backpropagation (DBP) to optimize the upscaled state matrix, thereby improving convergence and expressivity. By tuning only the state matrix, we demonstrate that a smaller model can outperform larger models on the given task. This method preserves the efficiency of the original RWKV-7 architecture while harnessing the power of test-time scaling to deliver superior results. Our findings underscore the potential of state tuning as an effective strategy for advancing model performance in resource-constrained settings.

### Quantization Hurts Reasoning? An Empirical Study on Quantized Reasoning   Models
**Authors**: Ruikang Liu, Yuxuan Sun, Manyi Zhang, Haoli Bai, Xianzhi Yu, Tiezheng Yu, Chun Yuan, Lu Hou

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T08:22:45Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex tasks, but their extended chain-of-thought reasoning process increases inference overhead. While quantization has been widely adopted to reduce the inference cost of large language models, its impact on reasoning models remains understudied. In this study, we conduct the first systematic study on quantized reasoning models, evaluating the open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Distilled Qwen and LLaMA families ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters, and QwQ-32B. Our investigation covers weight, KV cache, and activation quantization using state-of-the-art algorithms at varying bit-widths, with extensive evaluation across mathematical (AIME, MATH-500), scientific (GPQA), and programming (LiveCodeBench) reasoning benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while lossless quantization can be achieved with W8A8 or W4A16 quantization, lower bit-widths introduce significant accuracy risks. We further identify model size, model origin, and task difficulty as critical determinants of performance. Contrary to expectations, quantized models do not exhibit increased output lengths. In addition, strategically scaling the model sizes or reasoning steps can effectively enhance the performance. All quantized models and codes will be open-sourced in https://github.com/ruikangliu/Quantized-Reasoning-Models.

### Semantic Parsing with Candidate Expressions for Knowledge Base Question   Answering
**Authors**: Daehwan Nam, Gary Geunbae Lee

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T06:27:48Z

**Summary**: Semantic parsers convert natural language to logical forms, which can be evaluated on knowledge bases (KBs) to produce denotations. Recent semantic parsers have been developed with sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) pre-trained language models (PLMs) or large language models, where the models treat logical forms as sequences of tokens. For syntactic and semantic validity, the semantic parsers use grammars that enable constrained decoding. However, the grammars lack the ability to utilize large information of KBs, although logical forms contain representations of KB elements, such as entities or relations. In this work, we propose a grammar augmented with candidate expressions for semantic parsing on a large KB with a seq2seq PLM. The grammar defines actions as production rules, and our semantic parser predicts actions during inference under the constraints by types and candidate expressions. We apply the grammar to knowledge base question answering, where the constraints by candidate expressions assist a semantic parser to generate valid KB elements. We also introduce two special rules, sub-type inference and union types, and a mask caching algorithm. In particular, sub-type inference and the mask caching algorithm greatly increase the decoding speed of our semantic parser. We experimented on two benchmarks, KQA Pro and Overnight, where the constraints by candidate expressions increased the accuracy of our semantic parser, whether it was trained with strong supervision or weak supervision. In addition, our semantic parser had a fast decoding speed in the experiments.

### LagKV: Lag-Relative Information of the KV Cache Tells Which Tokens Are   Important
**Authors**: Manlai Liang, JiaMing Zhang, Xiong Li, Jinlong Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T03:22:15Z

**Summary**: The increasing size of the Key-Value (KV) cache during the Large Language Models long-context inference is the main obstacle for its balance between the deployment cost and task accuracy. To reduce the KV cache size in such scenarios, most previous efforts leveraged on the attention weight to evict non-critical cache tokens. But there is a trade-off in those methods, they usually require major modifiation of the inference infrastructure and significant computation overhead. Base on the fact that the Large Lanuage models are autoregresssive models, we propose {\it LagKV}, a KV allocation strategy only relying on straight forward comparison among KV themself. It is a totally attention free method which offers easy integration to the main stream inference platform and comparable performance comparing to other complicated KV compression methods. Results on LongBench and PasskeyRetrieval show that, our approach achieves nearly zero loss when the ratio is $2\times$ and $\approx 90\%$ of the original model performance for $8\times$. Especially in the 64-digit passkey retrieval task, our mehod outperforms the attention weight based method $H_2O$ over $60\%$ with same compression ratios. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/AI-Lab-China-Merchants-Bank/LagKV}.

### FastVAR: Linear Visual Autoregressive Modeling via Cached Token Pruning
**Authors**: Hang Guo, Yawei Li, Taolin Zhang, Jiangshan Wang, Tao Dai, Shu-Tao Xia, Luca Benini

**Updated**: 2025-04-07T01:35:39Z

**Summary**: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling has gained popularity for its shift towards next-scale prediction. However, existing VAR paradigms process the entire token map at each scale step, leading to the complexity and runtime scaling dramatically with image resolution. To address this challenge, we propose FastVAR, a post-training acceleration method for efficient resolution scaling with VARs. Our key finding is that the majority of latency arises from the large-scale step where most tokens have already converged. Leveraging this observation, we develop the cached token pruning strategy that only forwards pivotal tokens for scale-specific modeling while using cached tokens from previous scale steps to restore the pruned slots. This significantly reduces the number of forwarded tokens and improves the efficiency at larger resolutions. Experiments show the proposed FastVAR can further speedup FlashAttention-accelerated VAR by 2.7$\times$ with negligible performance drop of <1%. We further extend FastVAR to zero-shot generation of higher resolution images. In particular, FastVAR can generate one 2K image with 15GB memory footprints in 1.5s on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code is available at https://github.com/csguoh/FastVAR.

### ZSMerge: Zero-Shot KV Cache Compression for Memory-Efficient   Long-Context LLMs
**Authors**: Xin Liu, Pei Liu, Guoming Tang

**Updated**: 2025-04-06T12:20:25Z

**Summary**: The linear growth of key-value (KV) cache memory and quadratic computational in attention mechanisms complexity pose significant bottlenecks for large language models (LLMs) in long-context processing. While existing KV cache optimization methods address these challenges through token pruning or feature merging, they often incur irreversible information loss or require costly parameter retraining. To this end, we propose ZSMerge, a dynamic KV cache compression framework designed for efficient cache management, featuring three key operations: (1) fine-grained memory allocation guided by multi-dimensional token importance metrics at head-level granularity, (2) a residual merging mechanism that preserves critical context through compensated attention scoring, and (3) a zero-shot adaptation mechanism compatible with diverse LLM architectures without requiring retraining. ZSMerge significantly enhances memory efficiency and inference speed with negligible performance degradation across LLMs. When applied to LLaMA2-7B, it demonstrates a 20:1 compression ratio for key-value cache retention (reducing memory footprint to 5\% of baseline) while sustaining comparable generation quality, coupled with triple throughput gains at extreme 54k-token contexts that eliminate out-of-memory failures. The code is available at https://github.com/SusCom-Lab/ZSMerge.

### Learning Cache Coherence Traffic for NoC Routing Design
**Authors**: Guochu Xiong, Xiangzhong Luo, Weichen Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-05T00:59:52Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of multi-core systems highlights the need for efficient Network-on-Chip (NoC) design to ensure seamless communication. Cache coherence, essential for data consistency, substantially reduces task computation time by enabling data sharing among caches. As a result, routing serves two roles: facilitating data sharing (influenced by topology) and managing NoC-level communication. However, cache coherence is often overlooked in routing, causing mismatches between design expectations and evaluation outcomes. Two main challenges are the lack of specialized tools to assess cache coherence's impact and the neglect of topology selection in routing. In this work, we propose a cache coherence-aware routing approach with integrated topology selection, guided by our Cache Coherence Traffic Analyzer (CCTA). Our method achieves up to 10.52% lower packet latency, 55.51% faster execution time, and 49.02% total energy savings, underscoring the critical role of cache coherence in NoC design and enabling effective co-design.

**Updated**: 2025-04-04T17:56:44Z

**Summary**: The Aurora supercomputer is an exascale-class system designed to tackle some of the most demanding computational workloads. Equipped with both High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and DDR memory, it provides unique trade-offs in performance, latency, and capacity. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the memory systems on the Aurora supercomputer, with a focus on evaluating the trade-offs between HBM and DDR memory systems. We explore how different memory configurations, including memory modes (Flat and Cache) and clustering modes (Quad and SNC4), influence key system performance metrics such as memory bandwidth, latency, CPU-GPU PCIe bandwidth, and MPI communication bandwidth. Additionally, we examine the performance of three representative HPC applications -- HACC, QMCPACK, and BFS -- each illustrating the impact of memory configurations on performance. By using microbenchmarks and application-level analysis, we provide insights into how to select the optimal memory system and configuration to maximize performance based on the application characteristics. The findings presented in this paper offer guidance for users of the Aurora system and similar exascale systems.

### Adaptive Semantic Prompt Caching with VectorQ
**Authors**: Luis Gaspar Schroeder, Shu Liu, Alejandro Cuadron, Mark Zhao, Stephan Krusche, Alfons Kemper, Matei Zaharia, Joseph E. Gonzalez

**Updated**: 2025-04-04T16:51:15Z

**Summary**: Semantic prompt caches reduce the latency and cost of large language model (LLM) inference by reusing cached LLM-generated responses for semantically similar prompts. Vector similarity metrics assign a numerical score to quantify the similarity between an embedded prompt and its nearest neighbor in the cache. Existing systems rely on a static threshold to classify whether the similarity score is sufficiently high to result in a cache hit. We show that this one-size-fits-all threshold is insufficient across different embeddings. We propose VectorQ, an online framework with a threshold convergence guarantee to learn embedding-specific threshold regions that adapt to the uncertainty of an embedding. Through evaluations on a combination of three diverse datasets, we show that VectorQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems across all static thresholds, achieving up to 26x increases in cache hit rate and error rate reductions up to 74%.

### Performance Modeling of Data Storage Systems using Generative Models
**Authors**: Abdalaziz Rashid Al-Maeeni, Aziz Temirkhanov, Artem Ryzhikov, Mikhail Hushchyn

**Updated**: 2025-04-04T15:30:20Z

**Summary**: High-precision modeling of systems is one of the main areas of industrial data analysis. Models of systems, their digital twins, are used to predict their behavior under various conditions. We have developed several models of a storage system using machine learning-based generative models. The system consists of several components: hard disk drive (HDD) and solid-state drive (SSD) storage pools with different RAID schemes and cache. Each storage component is represented by a probabilistic model that describes the probability distribution of the component performance in terms of IOPS and latency, depending on their configuration and external data load parameters. The results of the experiments demonstrate the errors of 4-10 % for IOPS and 3-16 % for latency predictions depending on the components and models of the system. The predictions show up to 0.99 Pearson correlation with Little's law, which can be used for unsupervised reliability checks of the models. In addition, we present novel data sets that can be used for benchmarking regression algorithms, conditional generative models, and uncertainty estimation methods in machine learning.

### Optimistic Learning for Communication Networks
**Authors**: George Iosifidis, Naram Mhaisen, Douglas J. Leith

**Updated**: 2025-04-04T14:55:27Z

**Summary**: AI/ML-based tools are at the forefront of resource management solutions for communication networks. Deep learning, in particular, is highly effective in facilitating fast and high-performing decision-making whenever representative training data is available to build offline accurate models. Conversely, online learning solutions do not require training and enable adaptive decisions based on runtime observations, alas are often overly conservative. This extensive tutorial proposes the use of optimistic learning (OpL) as a decision engine for resource management frameworks in modern communication systems. When properly designed, such solutions can achieve fast and high-performing decisions -- comparable to offline-trained models -- while preserving the robustness and performance guarantees of the respective online learning approaches. We introduce the fundamental concepts, algorithms and results of OpL, discuss the roots of this theory and present different approaches to defining and achieving optimism. We proceed to showcase how OpL can enhance resource management in communication networks for several key problems such as caching, edge computing, network slicing, and workload assignment in decentralized O-RAN platforms. Finally, we discuss the open challenges that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of this new resource management approach.

### EVOS: Efficient Implicit Neural Training via EVOlutionary Selector
**Authors**: Weixiang Zhang, Shuzhao Xie, Chengwei Ren, Siyi Xie, Chen Tang, Shijia Ge, Mingzi Wang, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-04T13:27:49Z

**Summary**: We propose EVOlutionary Selector (EVOS), an efficient training paradigm for accelerating Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Unlike conventional INR training that feeds all samples through the neural network in each iteration, our approach restricts training to strategically selected points, reducing computational overhead by eliminating redundant forward passes. Specifically, we treat each sample as an individual in an evolutionary process, where only those fittest ones survive and merit inclusion in training, adaptively evolving with the neural network dynamics. While this is conceptually similar to Evolutionary Algorithms, their distinct objectives (selection for acceleration vs. iterative solution optimization) require a fundamental redefinition of evolutionary mechanisms for our context. In response, we design sparse fitness evaluation, frequency-guided crossover, and augmented unbiased mutation to comprise EVOS. These components respectively guide sample selection with reduced computational cost, enhance performance through frequency-domain balance, and mitigate selection bias from cached evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves approximately 48%-66% reduction in training time while ensuring superior convergence without additional cost, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.

### Model Reveals What to Cache: Profiling-Based Feature Reuse for Video   Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Xuran Ma, Yexin Liu, Yaofu Liu, Xianfeng Wu, Mingzhe Zheng, Zihao Wang, Ser-Nam Lim, Harry Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-04T03:30:15Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video generation. However, the computational intensity remains a significant challenge for practical applications. While feature caching has been proposed to reduce the computational burden of diffusion models, existing methods typically overlook the heterogeneous significance of individual blocks, resulting in suboptimal reuse and degraded output quality. To this end, we address this gap by introducing ProfilingDiT, a novel adaptive caching strategy that explicitly disentangles foreground and background-focused blocks. Through a systematic analysis of attention distributions in diffusion models, we reveal a key observation: 1) Most layers exhibit a consistent preference for either foreground or background regions. 2) Predicted noise shows low inter-step similarity initially, which stabilizes as denoising progresses. This finding inspires us to formulate a selective caching strategy that preserves full computation for dynamic foreground elements while efficiently caching static background features. Our approach substantially reduces computational overhead while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant acceleration (e.g., 2.01 times speedup for Wan2.1) while maintaining visual fidelity across comprehensive quality metrics, establishing a viable method for efficient video generation.

**Summary**: Process reward models (PRMs) have proven effective for test-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. However, reward hacking issues with PRMs limit their successful application in reinforcement fine-tuning. In this paper, we identify the main cause of PRM-induced reward hacking: the canonical summation-form credit assignment in reinforcement learning (RL), which defines the value as cumulative gamma-decayed future rewards, easily induces LLMs to hack steps with high rewards. To address this, we propose PURE: Process sUpervised Reinforcement lEarning. The key innovation of PURE is a min-form credit assignment that formulates the value function as the minimum of future rewards. This method significantly alleviates reward hacking by limiting the value function range and distributing advantages more reasonably. Through extensive experiments on 3 base models, we show that PRM-based approaches enabling min-form credit assignment achieve comparable reasoning performance to verifiable reward-based methods within only 30% steps. In contrast, the canonical sum-form credit assignment collapses training even at the beginning! Additionally, when we supplement PRM-based fine-tuning with just 10% verifiable rewards, we further alleviate reward hacking and produce the best fine-tuned model based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B in our experiments, achieving 82.5% accuracy on AMC23 and 53.3% average accuracy across 5 benchmarks. Moreover, we summarize the observed reward hacking cases and analyze the causes of training collapse. Code and models are available at https://github.com/CJReinforce/PURE.

**Authors**: Xinyue Wang, Kun Zhou, Wenyi Wu, Har Simrat Singh, Fang Nan, Songyao Jin, Aryan Philip, Saloni Patnaik, Hou Zhu, Shivam Singh, Parjanya Prashant, Qian Shen, Biwei Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:58:08Z

**Summary**: Causal analysis plays a foundational role in scientific discovery and reliable decision-making, yet it remains largely inaccessible to domain experts due to its conceptual and algorithmic complexity. This disconnect between causal methodology and practical usability presents a dual challenge: domain experts are unable to leverage recent advances in causal learning, while causal researchers lack broad, real-world deployment to test and refine their methods. To address this, we introduce Causal-Copilot, an autonomous agent that operationalizes expert-level causal analysis within a large language model framework. Causal-Copilot automates the full pipeline of causal analysis for both tabular and time-series data -- including causal discovery, causal inference, algorithm selection, hyperparameter optimization, result interpretation, and generation of actionable insights. It supports interactive refinement through natural language, lowering the barrier for non-specialists while preserving methodological rigor. By integrating over 20 state-of-the-art causal analysis techniques, our system fosters a virtuous cycle -- expanding access to advanced causal methods for domain experts while generating rich, real-world applications that inform and advance causal theory. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Causal-Copilot achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines, offering a reliable, scalable, and extensible solution that bridges the gap between theoretical sophistication and real-world applicability in causal analysis. A live interactive demo of Causal-Copilot is available at https://causalcopilot.com/.

### Beating the Correlation Breakdown: Robust Inference, Flexible Scenarios,   and Stress Testing for Financial Portfolios
**Authors**: JD Opdyke

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:52:36Z

**Summary**: We live in a multivariate world, and effective modeling of financial portfolios, including their construction, allocation, forecasting, and risk analysis, simply is not possible without explicitly modeling the dependence structure of their assets. Dependence structure can drive portfolio results more than many other parameters in investment and risk models, sometimes even more than their combined effects, but the literature provides relatively little to define the finite-sample distributions of dependence measures in useable and useful ways under challenging, real-world financial data conditions. Yet this is exactly what is needed to make valid inferences about their estimates, and to use these inferences for a myriad of essential purposes, such as hypothesis testing, dynamic monitoring, realistic and granular scenario and reverse scenario analyses, and mitigating the effects of correlation breakdowns during market upheavals (which is when we need valid inferences the most). This work develops a new and straightforward method, Nonparametric Angles-based Correlation (NAbC), for defining the finite-sample distributions of any dependence measure whose matrix of pairwise associations is positive definite (e.g. Pearsons, Kendalls Tau, Spearmans Rho, Chatterjees, Lancasters, Szekelys, and their many variants). The solution remains valid under marginal asset distributions characterized by notably different and varying degrees of serial correlation, non-stationarity, heavy-tailedness, and asymmetry. Notably, NAbCs p-values and confidence intervals remain analytically consistent at both the matrix level and the pairwise cell level. Finally, NAbC maintains validity even when selected cells in the matrix are frozen for a given scenario or stress test, that is, unaffected by the scenario, thus enabling flexible, granular, and realistic scenarios.

### Interpretable Locomotion Prediction in Construction Using a   Memory-Driven LLM Agent With Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
**Authors**: Ehsan Ahmadi, Chao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:45:21Z

**Summary**: Construction tasks are inherently unpredictable, with dynamic environments and safety-critical demands posing significant risks to workers. Exoskeletons offer potential assistance but falter without accurate intent recognition across diverse locomotion modes. This paper presents a locomotion prediction agent leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with memory systems, aimed at improving exoskeleton assistance in such settings. Using multimodal inputs - spoken commands and visual data from smart glasses - the agent integrates a Perception Module, Short-Term Memory (STM), Long-Term Memory (LTM), and Refinement Module to predict locomotion modes effectively. Evaluation reveals a baseline weighted F1-score of 0.73 without memory, rising to 0.81 with STM, and reaching 0.90 with both STM and LTM, excelling with vague and safety-critical commands. Calibration metrics, including a Brier Score drop from 0.244 to 0.090 and ECE from 0.222 to 0.044, affirm improved reliability. This framework supports safer, high-level human-exoskeleton collaboration, with promise for adaptive assistive systems in dynamic industries.

### ASIDE: Architectural Separation of Instructions and Data in Language   Models
**Authors**: Egor Zverev, Evgenii Kortukov, Alexander Panfilov, Alexandra Volkova, Soroush Tabesh, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Wojciech Samek, Christoph H. Lampert

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:45:08Z

**Summary**: Despite their remarkable performance, large language models lack elementary safety features, and this makes them susceptible to numerous malicious attacks. In particular, previous work has identified the absence of an intrinsic separation between instructions and data as a root cause for the success of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a method, ASIDE, that allows the model to clearly separate between instructions and data on the level of embeddings. ASIDE applies a fixed orthogonal rotation to the embeddings of data tokens, thus creating distinct representations of instructions and data tokens without introducing any additional parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by instruct-tuning LLMs with ASIDE and showing (1) highly increased instruction-data separation scores without a loss in model capabilities and (2) competitive results on prompt injection benchmarks, even without dedicated safety training. Additionally, we study the working mechanism behind our method through an analysis of model representations.

### Population Models for Star Formation Timescales in Early Galaxies: The   First Step Towards Solving Outshining in Star Formation History Inference
**Authors**: Bingjie Wang, Joel Leja, Hakim Atek, Rachel Bezanson, Emilie Burnham, Pratika Dayal, Robert Feldmann, Jenny E. Greene, Benjamin D. Johnson, Ivo Labbe, Michael V. Maseda, Themiya Nanayakkara, Sedona H. Price, Katherine A. Suess, John R. Weaver, Katherine E. Whitaker

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:34:55Z

**Summary**: JWST have revealed temporarily-quenched and ultraviolet-luminous galaxies in the early universe, suggesting enhanced star formation stochasticity. Verifying this hypothesis is critical, yet challenging; outshining, wherein light from young stars dominates the spectral energy distribution, represents perhaps the greatest challenge in inferring the formation histories of unresolved galaxies. In this paper, we take a simple model of burstiness and show that state-of-the-art inference methods with flexible star formation histories (SFHs) and neutral priors, while recovering average star formation rates (SFRs; $\sim0.1$ dex median offset), fail to recover the complexities of fluctuations on tens of Myr timescales, and typically underestimate masses in bursty systems ($\sim0.15$ dex). Surprisingly, detailed SFH recovery is still sensitive to priors even when data quality is optimal, e.g., including high signal-to-noise ($\rm20~pixel^{-1}$) spectroscopy with wide coverage (rest-frame $0.12-1.06~\mu$m). Crucially, however, refitting the same data with a prior correctly encoding the bursty expectation eliminates these biases: median offsets in mass and SFRs decrease to $\sim 0.04$ dex and $\sim 0.05$ dex, respectively. Under the assumption that current population burstiness predicts past SFH, the solution to outshining in modeling statistical samples is empirically measuring recent galaxy SFHs with population modeling. A prototype is H$\alpha$/UV: while helpful, it is insufficient to constrain the expected complex burstiness. To this end, we introduce a more complete, quantitative population-level approach and demonstrate that it promises to recover the typical amplitude, timescale, and slope of the recent SFH to high accuracy. This approach thus has the strong potential to solve outshining using observations from JWST.

### CRUST-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for C-to-safe-Rust Transpilation
**Authors**: Anirudh Khatry, Robert Zhang, Jia Pan, Ziteng Wang, Qiaochu Chen, Greg Durrett, Isil Dillig

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:33:33Z

**Summary**: C-to-Rust transpilation is essential for modernizing legacy C code while enhancing safety and interoperability with modern Rust ecosystems. However, no dataset currently exists for evaluating whether a system can transpile C into safe Rust that passes a set of test cases. We introduce CRUST-Bench, a dataset of 100 C repositories, each paired with manually-written interfaces in safe Rust as well as test cases that can be used to validate correctness of the transpilation. By considering entire repositories rather than isolated functions, CRUST-Bench captures the challenges of translating complex projects with dependencies across multiple files. The provided Rust interfaces provide explicit specifications that ensure adherence to idiomatic, memory-safe Rust patterns, while the accompanying test cases enforce functional correctness. We evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on this task and find that safe and idiomatic Rust generation is still a challenging problem for various state-of-the-art methods and techniques. We also provide insights into the errors LLMs usually make in transpiling code from C to safe Rust. The best performing model, OpenAI o1, is able to solve only 15 tasks in a single-shot setting. Improvements on CRUST-Bench would lead to improved transpilation systems that can reason about complex scenarios and help in migrating legacy codebases from C into languages like Rust that ensure memory safety. You can find the dataset and code at https://github.com/anirudhkhatry/CRUST-bench.

### Evaluating Judges as Evaluators: The JETTS Benchmark of LLM-as-Judges as   Test-Time Scaling Evaluators
**Authors**: Yilun Zhou, Austin Xu, Peifeng Wang, Caiming Xiong, Shafiq Joty

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:33:23Z

**Summary**: Scaling test-time computation, or affording a generator large language model (LLM) extra compute during inference, typically employs the help of external non-generative evaluators (i.e., reward models). Concurrently, LLM-judges, models trained to generate evaluations and critiques (explanations) in natural language, are becoming increasingly popular in automatic evaluation. Despite judge empirical successes, their effectiveness as evaluators in test-time scaling settings is largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce the Judge Evaluation for Test-Time Scaling (JETTS) benchmark, which evaluates judge performance in three domains (math reasoning, code generation, and instruction following) under three task settings: response reranking, step-level beam search, and critique-based response refinement. We evaluate 10 different judge models (7B-70B parameters) for 8 different base generator models (6.7B-72B parameters). Our benchmark shows that while judges are competitive with outcome reward models in reranking, they are consistently worse than process reward models in beam search procedures. Furthermore, though unique to LLM-judges, their natural language critiques are currently ineffective in guiding the generator towards better responses.

### Can LLMs Rank the Harmfulness of Smaller LLMs? We are Not There Yet
**Authors**: Berk Atil, Vipul Gupta, Sarkar Snigdha Sarathi Das, Rebecca J. Passonneau

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:30:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous, thus it is important to understand their risks and limitations. Smaller LLMs can be deployed where compute resources are constrained, such as edge devices, but with different propensity to generate harmful output. Mitigation of LLM harm typically depends on annotating the harmfulness of LLM output, which is expensive to collect from humans. This work studies two questions: How do smaller LLMs rank regarding generation of harmful content? How well can larger LLMs annotate harmfulness? We prompt three small LLMs to elicit harmful content of various types, such as discriminatory language, offensive content, privacy invasion, or negative influence, and collect human rankings of their outputs. Then, we evaluate three state-of-the-art large LLMs on their ability to annotate the harmfulness of these responses. We find that the smaller models differ with respect to harmfulness. We also find that large LLMs show low to moderate agreement with humans. These findings underline the need for further work on harm mitigation in LLMs.

### MR. Guard: Multilingual Reasoning Guardrail using Curriculum Learning
**Authors**: Yahan Yang, Soham Dan, Shuo Li, Dan Roth, Insup Lee

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:15:06Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks such as jailbreaking, which can elicit harmful or unsafe behaviors. This vulnerability is exacerbated in multilingual setting, where multilingual safety-aligned data are often limited. Thus, developing a guardrail capable of detecting and filtering unsafe content across diverse languages is critical for deploying LLMs in real-world applications. In this work, we propose an approach to build a multilingual guardrail with reasoning. Our method consists of: (1) synthetic multilingual data generation incorporating culturally and linguistically nuanced variants, (2) supervised fine-tuning, and (3) a curriculum-guided Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework that further improves performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our multilingual guardrail consistently outperforms recent baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain languages. The multilingual reasoning capability of our guardrail enables it to generate multilingual explanations, which are particularly useful for understanding language-specific risks and ambiguities in multilingual content moderation.

### A Spatiotemporal, Quasi-experimental Causal Inference Approach to   Characterize the Effects of Global Plastic Waste Export and Burning on Air   Quality Using Remotely Sensed Data
**Authors**: Ellen M. Considine, Rachel C. Nethery

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:07:52Z

**Summary**: Open burning of plastic waste may pose a significant threat to global health by degrading air quality, but quantitative research on this problem -- crucial for policy making -- has been stunted by lack of data. Critically, many low- and middle-income countries, where open burning is of greatest concern, have little to no air quality monitoring. Here, we propose an approach to leverage remotely sensed data products combined with spatiotemporal causal analytic techniques to evaluate the impact of large-scale plastic waste policies on air quality. Throughout, we use the case study of Indonesia before and after 2018, when China halted its import of plastic waste, resulting in diversion of this massive waste stream to other countries. We tailor cutting-edge statistical methods to this setting, estimating effects of the increase in plastic waste imports on fine particulate matter (PM$_{2.5}$) near waste dump sites in Indonesia as a function of proximity to ports, which serves as an induced continuous exposure. We observe that dump sites above the 20th quantile of port proximity experienced a statistically significant increase in monthly PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations after China's ban took effect (2018-2019) compared to concentrations expected under business-as-usual (2012-2017), with increases ranging from 0.76--1.72$\mu$g/m$^3$.

### A Self-Improving Coding Agent
**Authors**: Maxime Robeyns, Martin Szummer, Laurence Aitchison

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T16:58:18Z

**Summary**: We demonstrate that an LLM coding agent, equipped with basic coding tools, can autonomously edit itself, and thereby improve its performance on benchmark tasks. We find performance gains from 17% to 53% on a random subset of SWE Bench Verified, with additional performance gains on LiveCodeBench, as well as synthetically generated agent benchmarks. Our work represents an advancement in the automated and open-ended design of agentic systems, and provides a reference agent framework for those seeking to post-train LLMs on tool use and other agentic tasks.

### Fully Bayesian Approaches to Topics over Time
**Authors**: Julián Cendrero, Julio Gonzalo, Ivar Zapata

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T16:46:07Z

**Summary**: The Topics over Time (ToT) model captures thematic changes in timestamped datasets by explicitly modeling publication dates jointly with word co-occurrence patterns. However, ToT was not approached in a fully Bayesian fashion, a flaw that makes it susceptible to stability problems. To address this issue, we propose a fully Bayesian Topics over Time (BToT) model via the introduction of a conjugate prior to the Beta distribution. This prior acts as a regularization that prevents the online version of the algorithm from unstable updates when a topic is poorly represented in a mini-batch. The characteristics of this prior to the Beta distribution are studied here for the first time. Still, this model suffers from a difference in scale between the single-time observations and the multiplicity of words per document. A variation of BToT, Weighted Bayesian Topics over Time (WBToT), is proposed as a solution. In WBToT, publication dates are repeated a certain number of times per document, which balances the relative influence of words and timestamps along the inference process. We have tested our models on two datasets: a collection of over 200 years of US state-of-the-union (SOTU) addresses and a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter corpus of 10 million tweets. The results show that WBToT captures events better than Latent Dirichlet Allocation and other SOTA topic models like BERTopic: the median absolute deviation of the topic presence over time is reduced by $51\%$ and $34\%$, respectively. Our experiments also demonstrate the superior coherence of WBToT over BToT, which highlights the importance of balancing the time and word modalities. Finally, we illustrate the stability of the online optimization algorithm in WBToT, which allows the application of WBToT to problems that are intractable for standard ToT.

### EvalAgent: Discovering Implicit Evaluation Criteria from the Web
**Authors**: Manya Wadhwa, Zayne Sprague, Chaitanya Malaviya, Philippe Laban, Junyi Jessy Li, Greg Durrett

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T16:43:50Z

**Summary**: Evaluation of language model outputs on structured writing tasks is typically conducted with a number of desirable criteria presented to human evaluators or large language models (LLMs). For instance, on a prompt like "Help me draft an academic talk on coffee intake vs research productivity", a model response may be evaluated for criteria like accuracy and coherence. However, high-quality responses should do more than just satisfy basic task requirements. An effective response to this query should include quintessential features of an academic talk, such as a compelling opening, clear research questions, and a takeaway. To help identify these implicit criteria, we introduce EvalAgent, a novel framework designed to automatically uncover nuanced and task-specific criteria. EvalAgent first mines expert-authored online guidance. It then uses this evidence to propose diverse, long-tail evaluation criteria that are grounded in reliable external sources. Our experiments demonstrate that the grounded criteria produced by EvalAgent are often implicit (not directly stated in the user's prompt), yet specific (high degree of lexical precision). Further, EvalAgent criteria are often not satisfied by initial responses but they are actionable, such that responses can be refined to satisfy them. Finally, we show that combining LLM-generated and EvalAgent criteria uncovers more human-valued criteria than using LLMs alone.

### HiddenDetect: Detecting Jailbreak Attacks against Large Vision-Language   Models via Monitoring Hidden States
**Authors**: Yilei Jiang, Xinyan Gao, Tianshuo Peng, Yingshui Tan, Xiaoyong Zhu, Bo Zheng, Xiangyu Yue

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T16:41:37Z

**Summary**: The integration of additional modalities increases the susceptibility of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to safety risks, such as jailbreak attacks, compared to their language-only counterparts. While existing research primarily focuses on post-hoc alignment techniques, the underlying safety mechanisms within LVLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work , we investigate whether LVLMs inherently encode safety-relevant signals within their internal activations during inference. Our findings reveal that LVLMs exhibit distinct activation patterns when processing unsafe prompts, which can be leveraged to detect and mitigate adversarial inputs without requiring extensive fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we introduce HiddenDetect, a novel tuning-free framework that harnesses internal model activations to enhance safety. Experimental results show that {HiddenDetect} surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting jailbreak attacks against LVLMs. By utilizing intrinsic safety-aware patterns, our method provides an efficient and scalable solution for strengthening LVLM robustness against multimodal threats. Our code will be released publicly at https://github.com/leigest519/HiddenDetect.

### Potential Societal Biases of ChatGPT in Higher Education: A Scoping   Review
**Authors**: Ming Li, Ariunaa Enkhtur, Beverley Anne Yamamoto, Fei Cheng, Lilan Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T16:33:14Z

**Summary**: Purpose:Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models, such as ChatGPT, may inherit or amplify societal biases due to their training on extensive datasets. With the increasing usage of GAI by students, faculty, and staff in higher education institutions (HEIs), it is urgent to examine the ethical issues and potential biases associated with these technologies. Design/Approach/Methods:This scoping review aims to elucidate how biases related to GAI in HEIs have been researched and discussed in recent academic publications. We categorized the potential societal biases that GAI might cause in the field of higher education. Our review includes articles written in English, Chinese, and Japanese across four main databases, focusing on GAI usage in higher education and bias. Findings:Our findings reveal that while there is meaningful scholarly discussion around bias and discrimination concerning LLMs in the AI field, most articles addressing higher education approach the issue superficially. Few articles identify specific types of bias under different circumstances, and there is a notable lack of empirical research. Most papers in our review focus primarily on educational and research fields related to medicine and engineering, with some addressing English education. However, there is almost no discussion regarding the humanities and social sciences. Additionally, a significant portion of the current discourse is in English and primarily addresses English-speaking contexts. Originality/Value:To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to summarize the potential societal biases in higher education. This review highlights the need for more in-depth studies and empirical work to understand the specific biases that GAI might introduce or amplify in educational settings, guiding the development of more ethical AI applications in higher education.

### Position: Bayesian Statistics Facilitates Stakeholder Participation in   Evaluation of Generative AI
**Authors**: Yanan Long

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T16:31:15Z

**Summary**: The evaluation of Generative AI (GenAI) systems plays a critical role in public policy and decision-making, yet existing methods are often limited by reliance on benchmark-driven, point-estimate comparisons that fail to capture uncertainty and broader societal impacts. This paper argues for the use of Bayesian statistics as a principled framework to address these challenges. Bayesian methods enable the integration of domain expertise through prior elicitation, allow for continuous learning from new data, and provide robust uncertainty quantification via posterior inference. We demonstrate how Bayesian inference can be applied to GenAI evaluation, particularly in incorporating stakeholder perspectives to enhance fairness, transparency, and reliability. Furthermore, we discuss Bayesian workflows as an iterative process for model validation and refinement, ensuring robust assessments of GenAI systems in dynamic, real-world contexts.

### Integrating Symbolic Execution into the Fine-Tuning of Code-Generating   LLMs
**Authors**: Marina Sakharova, Abhinav Anand, Mira Mezini

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T16:29:07Z

**Summary**: Code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential tools in modern software development, enhancing productivity and accelerating development. This paper aims to investigate the fine-tuning of code-generating LLMs using Reinforcement Learning and Direct Preference Optimization, further improving their performance. To achieve this, we enhance the training data for the reward model with the help of symbolic execution techniques, ensuring more comprehensive and objective data. With symbolic execution, we create a custom dataset that better captures the nuances in code evaluation. Our reward models, fine-tuned on this dataset, demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline, CodeRL, in estimating the quality of generated code. Our code-generating LLMs, trained with the help of reward model feedback, achieve similar results compared to the CodeRL benchmark.

### Compute-Optimal LLMs Provably Generalize Better With Scale
**Authors**: Marc Finzi, Sanyam Kapoor, Diego Granziol, Anming Gu, Christopher De Sa, J. Zico Kolter, Andrew Gordon Wilson

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T16:26:56Z

**Summary**: Why do larger language models generalize better? To investigate this question, we develop generalization bounds on the pretraining objective of large language models (LLMs) in the compute-optimal regime, as described by the Chinchilla scaling laws. We introduce a novel, fully empirical Freedman-type martingale concentration inequality that tightens existing bounds by accounting for the variance of the loss function. This generalization bound can be decomposed into three interpretable components: the number of parameters per token, the loss variance, and the quantization error at a fixed bitrate. As compute-optimal language models are scaled up, the number of parameters per data point remains constant; however, both the loss variance and the quantization error decrease, implying that larger models should have smaller generalization gaps. We examine why larger models tend to be more quantizable from an information theoretic perspective, showing that the rate at which they can integrate new information grows more slowly than their capacity on the compute-optimal frontier. From these findings we produce a scaling law for the generalization gap, with bounds that become predictably stronger with scale.

### Support Evaluation for the TREC 2024 RAG Track: Comparing Human versus   LLM Judges
**Authors**: Nandan Thakur, Ronak Pradeep, Shivani Upadhyay, Daniel Campos, Nick Craswell, Jimmy Lin

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T16:20:43Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to generate answers with citations from source documents containing "ground truth", thereby reducing system hallucinations. A crucial factor in RAG evaluation is "support", whether the information in the cited documents supports the answer. To this end, we conducted a large-scale comparative study of 45 participant submissions on 36 topics to the TREC 2024 RAG Track, comparing an automatic LLM judge (GPT-4o) against human judges for support assessment. We considered two conditions: (1) fully manual assessments from scratch and (2) manual assessments with post-editing of LLM predictions. Our results indicate that for 56% of the manual from-scratch assessments, human and GPT-4o predictions match perfectly (on a three-level scale), increasing to 72% in the manual with post-editing condition. Furthermore, by carefully analyzing the disagreements in an unbiased study, we found that an independent human judge correlates better with GPT-4o than a human judge, suggesting that LLM judges can be a reliable alternative for support assessment. To conclude, we provide a qualitative analysis of human and GPT-4o errors to help guide future iterations of support assessment.

### Zero-Shot, But at What Cost? Unveiling the Hidden Overhead of MILS's   LLM-CLIP Framework for Image Captioning
**Authors**: Yassir Benhammou, Alessandro Tiberio, Gabriel Trautmann, Suman Kalyan

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T16:16:19Z

**Summary**: MILS (Multimodal Iterative LLM Solver) is a recently published framework that claims "LLMs can see and hear without any training" by leveraging an iterative, LLM-CLIP based approach for zero-shot image captioning. While this MILS approach demonstrates good performance, our investigation reveals that this success comes at a hidden, substantial computational cost due to its expensive multi-step refinement process. In contrast, alternative models such as BLIP-2 and GPT-4V achieve competitive results through a streamlined, single-pass approach. We hypothesize that the significant overhead inherent in MILS's iterative process may undermine its practical benefits, thereby challenging the narrative that zero-shot performance can be attained without incurring heavy resource demands. This work is the first to expose and quantify the trade-offs between output quality and computational cost in MILS, providing critical insights for the design of more efficient multimodal models.

### Synergistic Weak-Strong Collaboration by Aligning Preferences
**Authors**: Yizhu Jiao, Xuchao Zhang, Zhaoyang Wang, Yubo Ma, Zhun Deng, Rujia Wang, Chetan Bansal, Saravan Rajmohan, Jiawei Han, Huaxiu Yao

**Updated**: 2025-04-22T04:22:09Z

**Summary**: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general reasoning yet struggle with specialized tasks requiring proprietary or domain-specific knowledge. Fine-tuning large models for every niche application is often infeasible due to black-box constraints and high computational overhead. To address this, we propose a collaborative framework that pairs a specialized weak model with a general strong model. The weak model, tailored to specific domains, produces initial drafts and background information, while the strong model leverages its advanced reasoning to refine these drafts, extending LLMs' capabilities to critical yet specialized tasks. To optimize this collaboration, we introduce a collaborative feedback to fine-tunes the weak model, which quantifies the influence of the weak model's contributions in the collaboration procedure and establishes preference pairs to guide preference tuning of the weak model. We validate our framework through experiments on three domains. We find that the collaboration significantly outperforms each model alone by leveraging complementary strengths. Moreover, aligning the weak model with the collaborative preference further enhances overall performance.

### CAP: A General Algorithm for Online Selective Conformal Prediction with   FCR Control
**Authors**: Yajie Bao, Yuyang Huo, Haojie Ren, Changliang Zou

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:51:01Z

**Summary**: We study the problem of post-selection predictive inference in an online fashion. To avoid devoting resources to unimportant units, a preliminary selection of the current individual before reporting its prediction interval is common and meaningful in online predictive tasks. Since the online selection causes a temporal multiplicity in the selected prediction intervals, it is important to control the real-time false coverage-statement rate (FCR) which measures the overall miscoverage level. We develop a general framework named CAP (Calibration after Adaptive Pick) that performs an adaptive pick rule on historical data to construct a calibration set if the current individual is selected and then outputs a conformal prediction interval for the unobserved label. We provide tractable procedures for constructing the calibration set for popular online selection rules. We proved that CAP can achieve an exact selection-conditional coverage guarantee in the finite-sample and distribution-free regimes. To account for the distribution shift in online data, we also embed CAP into some recent dynamic conformal prediction algorithms and show that the proposed method can deliver long-run FCR control. Numerical results on both synthetic and real data corroborate that CAP can effectively control FCR around the target level and yield more narrowed prediction intervals over existing baselines across various settings.

### Time-Series Analysis on Edge-AI Hardware for Healthcare Monitoring
**Authors**: Jinhai Hu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:40:10Z

**Summary**: This project addresses the need for efficient, real-time analysis of biomedical signals such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and electroencephalograms (EEG) for continuous health monitoring. Traditional methods rely on long-duration data recording followed by offline analysis, which is power-intensive and delays responses to critical symptoms such as arrhythmia. To overcome these limitations, a time-domain ECG analysis model based on a novel dynamically-biased Long Short-Term Memory (DB-LSTM) neural network is proposed. This model supports simultaneous ECG forecasting and classification with high performance-achieving over 98% accuracy and a normalized mean square error below 1e-3 for forecasting, and over 97% accuracy with faster convergence and fewer training parameters for classification. To enable edge deployment, the model is hardware-optimized by quantizing weights to INT4 or INT3 formats, resulting in only a 2% and 6% drop in classification accuracy during training and inference, respectively, while maintaining full accuracy for forecasting. Extensive simulations using multiple ECG datasets confirm the model's robustness. Future work includes implementing the algorithm on FPGA and CMOS circuits for practical cardiac monitoring, as well as developing a digital hardware platform that supports flexible neural network configurations and on-chip online training for personalized healthcare applications.

### Tree of Attributes Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Tong Ding, Wanhua Li, Zhongqi Miao, Hanspeter Pfister

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:37:50Z

**Summary**: Prompt learning has proven effective in adapting vision language models for downstream tasks. However, existing methods usually append learnable prompt tokens solely with the category names to obtain textual features, which fails to fully leverage the rich context indicated in the category name. To address this issue, we propose the Tree of Attributes Prompt learning (TAP), which first instructs LLMs to generate a tree of attributes with a "concept - attribute - description" structure for each category, and then learn the hierarchy with vision and text prompt tokens. Unlike existing methods that merely augment category names with a set of unstructured descriptions, our approach essentially distills structured knowledge graphs associated with class names from LLMs. Furthermore, our approach introduces text and vision prompts designed to explicitly learn the corresponding visual attributes, effectively serving as domain experts. Additionally, the general and diverse descriptions generated based on the class names may be wrong or absent in the specific given images. To address this misalignment, we further introduce a vision-conditional pooling module to extract instance-specific text features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the zero-shot base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, as well as few-shot classification across 11 diverse datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/HHenryD/TAP.

### Inverse Constitutional AI: Compressing Preferences into Principles
**Authors**: Arduin Findeis, Timo Kaufmann, Eyke Hüllermeier, Samuel Albanie, Robert Mullins

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:37:15Z

**Summary**: Feedback data is widely used for fine-tuning and evaluating state-of-the-art AI models. Pairwise text preferences, where human or AI annotators select the "better" of two options, are particularly common. Such preferences are used to train (reward) models or to rank models with aggregate statistics. For many applications it is desirable to understand annotator preferences in addition to modelling them - not least because extensive prior work has shown various unintended biases in preference datasets. Yet, preference datasets remain challenging to interpret. Neither black-box reward models nor statistics can answer why one text is preferred over another. Manual interpretation of the numerous (long) response pairs is usually equally infeasible. In this paper, we introduce the Inverse Constitutional AI (ICAI) problem, formulating the interpretation of pairwise text preference data as a compression task. In constitutional AI, a set of principles (a constitution) is used to provide feedback and fine-tune AI models. ICAI inverts this process: given a feedback dataset, we aim to extract a constitution that best enables a large language model (LLM) to reconstruct the original annotations. We propose a corresponding ICAI algorithm and validate its generated constitutions quantitatively based on annotation reconstruction accuracy on several datasets: (a) synthetic feedback data with known principles; (b) AlpacaEval cross-annotated human feedback data; (c) crowdsourced Chatbot Arena data; and (d) PRISM data from diverse demographic groups. As a short and interpretable representation of the original dataset, generated constitutions have many potential use cases: help identify undesirable annotator biases, understand model performance better, scale feedback to unseen data, or adapt models to individual user or group preferences. We release the source code at https://github.com/rdnfn/icai.

### Understanding LLM Behaviors via Compression: Data Generation, Knowledge   Acquisition and Scaling Laws
**Authors**: Zhixuan Pan, Shaowen Wang, Jian Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:18:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous tasks, yet principled explanations for their underlying mechanisms and several phenomena, such as scaling laws, hallucinations, and related behaviors, remain elusive. In this work, we revisit the classical relationship between compression and prediction, grounded in Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon information theory, to provide deeper insights into LLM behaviors. By leveraging the Kolmogorov Structure Function and interpreting LLM compression as a two-part coding process, we offer a detailed view of how LLMs acquire and store information across increasing model and data scales -- from pervasive syntactic patterns to progressively rarer knowledge elements. Motivated by this theoretical perspective and natural assumptions inspired by Heap's and Zipf's laws, we introduce a simplified yet representative hierarchical data-generation framework called the Syntax-Knowledge model. Under the Bayesian setting, we show that prediction and compression within this model naturally lead to diverse learning and scaling behaviors of LLMs. In particular, our theoretical analysis offers intuitive and principled explanations for both data and model scaling laws, the dynamics of knowledge acquisition during training and fine-tuning, factual knowledge hallucinations in LLMs. The experimental results validate our theoretical predictions.

### Simulating biochemical reactions: The Linear Noise Approximation can   capture non-linear dynamics
**Authors**: Frederick Truman-Williams, Giorgos Minas

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:16:30Z

**Summary**: There is a plethora of highly stochastic non-linear dynamical systems in fields such as molecular biology, chemistry, epidemiology, and ecology. Yet, none of the currently available stochastic models are both accurate and computationally efficient for long-term predictions of large systems. The Linear Noise Approximation (LNA) model for biochemical reaction networks is analytically tractable, which makes it computationally efficient for simulation, analysis, and inference. However, it is only accurate for linear systems and short-time transitions. Other methods can achieve greater accuracy across a wider range of systems, including non-linear ones, but lack analytical tractability. This paper seeks to challenge the prevailing view by demonstrating that the Linear Noise Approximation can indeed capture non-linear dynamics after certain modifications. We introduce a new framework that utilises centre manifold theory allowing us to identify simple interventions to the LNA that do not significantly compromise its computational efficiency. We develop specific algorithms for systems that exhibit oscillations or bi-stability and demonstrate their accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple examples.

### LServe: Efficient Long-sequence LLM Serving with Unified Sparse   Attention
**Authors**: Shang Yang, Junxian Guo, Haotian Tang, Qinghao Hu, Guangxuan Xiao, Jiaming Tang, Yujun Lin, Zhijian Liu, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:13:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in processing long sequences and complex reasoning tasks, yet efficiently serving these models remains challenging due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention in the prefilling stage and the large memory footprint of the KV cache in the decoding stage. To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the compatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention. This design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations. Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context and reasoning capabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve.

### Study of the Coulomb and nuclear breakup of $^{11}$Be using a Halo-EFT   description at N$^2$LO
**Authors**: L. -P. Kubushishi, P. Capel

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:10:02Z

**Summary**: Background: The halo effective field theory (Halo-EFT) provides a very efficient description of loosely-bound nuclei in models of reaction. It offers a very systematical ranking of the significance of nuclear-structure observables in reaction calculations. This greatly helps to infer reliable structure information from reaction cross sections. However, for a meaningful analysis, the Halo-EFT scheme needs to have converged. Purpose: In a previous study [P. Capel, D. R. Phillips, and H.-W. Hammer, Phys. Rev. C 98, 034610 (2018)], NLO descriptions of 11Be have been developed and lead to excellent agreement with existing breakup data. However, the convergence of the scheme at NLO was not fully demonstrated. Moreover, a significant dependence on the regulator of the effective 10Be-n interaction has been observed. Method: We develop Halo-EFT descriptions of 11Be at N2LO and use them in an accurate breakup-reaction code. We compare our theoretical cross sections with experiment on Pb and C targets at about 70 MeV/nucleon. Results: On Pb, the N2LO descriptions of 11Be lead to little change to the NLO results of the previous study, confirming the convergence of that scheme. On C, the reaction is significantly affected by the presence of d resonances in the low-energy spectrum of 11Be. In the Halo-EFT power counting these resonances appear only at N2LO; our new descriptions include them naturally. Going to N2LO removes also the cutoff dependence observed in the previous study. Conclusions: We demonstrate the convergence of the Halo-EFT description of 11Be at NLO for Coulomb breakup and at N2LO for nuclear-dominated dissociation. The reliability of the nuclear-structure information inferred in the previous study is thus confirmed.

### To Offload or Not To Offload: Model-driven Comparison of Edge-native and   On-device Processing
**Authors**: Nathan Ng, David Irwin, Ananthram Swami, Don Towsley, Prashant Shenoy

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:08:01Z

**Summary**: Computational offloading is a promising approach for overcoming resource constraints on client devices by moving some or all of an application's computations to remote servers. With the advent of specialized hardware accelerators, client devices are now able to perform fast local processing of specific tasks, such as machine learning inference, reducing the need for offloading computations. However, edge servers with accelerators also offer faster processing for offloaded tasks than was previously possible. In this paper, we present an analytic and experimental comparison of on-device processing and edge offloading for a range of accelerator, network, and application workload scenarios, with the goal of understanding when to use local on-device processing and when to offload computations. We present models that leverage analytical queuing results to capture the effects of dynamic factors such as the performance gap between the device and edge server, network variability, server load, and multi-tenancy on the edge server. We experimentally demonstrate the accuracy of our models for a range of hardware and application scenarios and show that our models achieve a mean absolute percentage error of 2.2% compared to observed latencies. We use our models to develop an adaptive resource manager for intelligent offloading and show its efficacy in the presence of variable network conditions and dynamic multi-tenant edge settings.

### The Synthetic Imputation Approach: Generating Optimal Synthetic Texts   For Underrepresented Categories In Supervised Classification Tasks
**Authors**: Joan C. Timoneda

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:07:26Z

**Summary**: Encoder-decoder Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BERT and RoBERTa, require that all categories in an annotation task be sufficiently represented in the training data for optimal performance. However, it is often difficult to find sufficient examples for all categories in a task when building a high-quality training set. In this article, I describe this problem and propose a solution, the synthetic imputation approach. Leveraging a generative LLM (GPT-4o), this approach generates synthetic texts based on careful prompting and five original examples drawn randomly with replacement from the sample. This approach ensures that new synthetic texts are sufficiently different from the original texts to reduce overfitting, but retain the underlying substantive meaning of the examples to maximize out-of-sample performance. With 75 original examples or more, synthetic imputation's performance is on par with a full sample of original texts, and overfitting remains low, predictable and correctable with 50 original samples. The synthetic imputation approach provides a novel role for generative LLMs in research and allows applied researchers to balance their datasets for best performance.

### Cosmological Constraints with Void Lensing I: the Simulation-Based   Inference Framework
**Authors**: Chen Su, Huanyuan Shan, Cheng Zhao, Wenshuo Xu, Jiajun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T14:52:56Z

**Summary**: We present a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) framework for cosmological parameter estimation via void lensing analysis. Despite the absence of an analytical model of void lensing, SBI can effectively learn posterior distributions through forward modeling of mock data. We develop a forward modeling pipeline that accounts for both cosmology and the galaxy-halo connection. By training a neural density estimator on simulated data, we infer the posteriors of two cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$ and $S_8$. Validation tests are conducted on posteriors derived from different cosmological parameters and a fiducial sample. The results demonstrate that SBI provides unbiased estimates of mean values and accurate uncertainties. These findings highlight the potential to apply void lensing analysis to observational data even without an analytical void lensing model.

### Deep Compression Autoencoder for Efficient High-Resolution Diffusion   Models
**Authors**: Junyu Chen, Han Cai, Junsong Chen, Enze Xie, Shang Yang, Haotian Tang, Muyang Li, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T14:48:23Z

**Summary**: We present Deep Compression Autoencoder (DC-AE), a new family of autoencoder models for accelerating high-resolution diffusion models. Existing autoencoder models have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compression ratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy for high spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge by introducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design our models to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features to alleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders; (2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phases training strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of high spatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve the autoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining the reconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, we achieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet 512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedup on H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widely used SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder. Our code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/efficientvit.

### Automatic Generation of Aerobatic Flight in Complex Environments via   Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Yuhang Zhong, Anke Zhao, Tianyue Wu, Tingrui Zhang, Fei Gao

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T14:40:55Z

**Summary**: Performing striking aerobatic flight in complex environments demands manual designs of key maneuvers in advance, which is intricate and time-consuming as the horizon of the trajectory performed becomes long. This paper presents a novel framework that leverages diffusion models to automate and scale up aerobatic trajectory generation. Our key innovation is the decomposition of complex maneuvers into aerobatic primitives, which are short frame sequences that act as building blocks, featuring critical aerobatic behaviors for tractable trajectory synthesis. The model learns aerobatic primitives using historical trajectory observations as dynamic priors to ensure motion continuity, with additional conditional inputs (target waypoints and optional action constraints) integrated to enable user-editable trajectory generation. During model inference, classifier guidance is incorporated with batch sampling to achieve obstacle avoidance. Additionally, the generated outcomes are refined through post-processing with spatial-temporal trajectory optimization to ensure dynamical feasibility. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments have validated the key component designs of our method, demonstrating its feasibility for deploying on real drones to achieve long-horizon aerobatic flight.

### CTINexus: Automatic Cyber Threat Intelligence Knowledge Graph   Construction Using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yutong Cheng, Osama Bajaber, Saimon Amanuel Tsegai, Dawn Song, Peng Gao

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T14:37:40Z

**Summary**: Textual descriptions in cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports, such as security articles and news, are rich sources of knowledge about cyber threats, crucial for organizations to stay informed about the rapidly evolving threat landscape. However, current CTI knowledge extraction methods lack flexibility and generalizability, often resulting in inaccurate and incomplete knowledge extraction. Syntax parsing relies on fixed rules and dictionaries, while model fine-tuning requires large annotated datasets, making both paradigms challenging to adapt to new threats and ontologies. To bridge the gap, we propose CTINexus, a novel framework leveraging optimized in-context learning (ICL) of large language models (LLMs) for data-efficient CTI knowledge extraction and high-quality cybersecurity knowledge graph (CSKG) construction. Unlike existing methods, CTINexus requires neither extensive data nor parameter tuning and can adapt to various ontologies with minimal annotated examples. This is achieved through: (1) a carefully designed automatic prompt construction strategy with optimal demonstration retrieval for extracting a wide range of cybersecurity entities and relations; (2) a hierarchical entity alignment technique that canonicalizes the extracted knowledge and removes redundancy; (3) an long-distance relation prediction technique to further complete the CSKG with missing links. Our extensive evaluations using 150 real-world CTI reports collected from 10 platforms demonstrate that CTINexus significantly outperforms existing methods in constructing accurate and complete CSKG, highlighting its potential to transform CTI analysis with an efficient and adaptable solution for the dynamic threat landscape.

### EasyEdit2: An Easy-to-use Steering Framework for Editing Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Ziwen Xu, Shuxun Wang, Kewei Xu, Haoming Xu, Mengru Wang, Xinle Deng, Yunzhi Yao, Guozhou Zheng, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T14:33:55Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce EasyEdit2, a framework designed to enable plug-and-play adjustability for controlling Large Language Model (LLM) behaviors. EasyEdit2 supports a wide range of test-time interventions, including safety, sentiment, personality, reasoning patterns, factuality, and language features. Unlike its predecessor, EasyEdit2 features a new architecture specifically designed for seamless model steering. It comprises key modules such as the steering vector generator and the steering vector applier, which enable automatic generation and application of steering vectors to influence the model's behavior without modifying its parameters. One of the main advantages of EasyEdit2 is its ease of use-users do not need extensive technical knowledge. With just a single example, they can effectively guide and adjust the model's responses, making precise control both accessible and efficient. Empirically, we report model steering performance across different LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques. We have released the source code on GitHub at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit along with a demonstration notebook. In addition, we provide a demo video at https://zjunlp.github.io/project/EasyEdit2/video for a quick introduction.

### Investigating Youth's Technical and Ethical Understanding of Generative   Language Models When Engaging in Construction and Deconstruction Activities
**Authors**: Luis Morales-Navarro

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T14:30:16Z

**Summary**: The widespread adoption of generative artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) technologies has increased the need to support youth in developing AI/ML literacies. However, most work has centered on preparing young people to use these systems, with less attention to how they can participate in designing and evaluating them. This study investigates how engaging young people in the design and auditing of generative language models (GLMs) may foster the development of their understanding of how these systems work from both technical and ethical perspectives. The study takes an in-pieces approach to investigate novices' conceptions of GLMs. Such an approach supports the analysis of how technical and ethical conceptions evolve and relate to each other. I am currently conducting a series of participatory design workshops with sixteen ninth graders (ages 14-15) in which they will (a) build GLMs from a data-driven perspective that glassboxes how data shapes model performance and (b) audit commercial GLMs by repeatedly and systematically querying them to draw inferences about their behaviors. I will analyze participants' interactions to identify ethical and technical conceptions they may exhibit while designing and auditing GLMs. I will also conduct clinical interviews and use microgenetic knowledge analysis and ordered network analysis to investigate how participants' ethical and technical conceptions of GLMs relate to each other and change after the workshop. The study will contribute (a) evidence of how engaging youth in design and auditing activities may support the development of ethical and technical understanding of GLMs and (b) an inventory of novice design and auditing practices that may support youth's technical and ethical understanding of GLMs.

### Contemplative Wisdom for Superalignment
**Authors**: Ruben Laukkonen, Fionn Inglis, Shamil Chandaria, Lars Sandved-Smith, Jakob Hohwy, Jonathan Gold, Adam Elwood

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T14:20:49Z

**Summary**: As artificial intelligence (AI) improves, traditional alignment strategies may falter in the face of unpredictable self-improvement, hidden subgoals, and the sheer complexity of intelligent systems. Rather than externally constraining behavior, we advocate designing AI with intrinsic morality built into its cognitive architecture and world model. Inspired by contemplative wisdom traditions, we show how four axiomatic principles can instil a resilient Wise World Model in AI systems. First, mindfulness enables self-monitoring and recalibration of emergent subgoals. Second, emptiness forestalls dogmatic goal fixation and relaxes rigid priors. Third, non-duality dissolves adversarial self-other boundaries. Fourth, boundless care motivates the universal reduction of suffering. We find that prompting AI to reflect on these principles improves performance on the AILuminate Benchmark using GPT-4o, particularly when combined. We offer detailed implementation strategies for state-of-the-art models, including contemplative architectures, constitutions, and reinforcement of chain-of-thought. For future systems, the active inference framework may offer the self-organizing and dynamic coupling capabilities needed to enact these insights in embodied agents. This interdisciplinary approach offers a self-correcting and resilient alternative to prevailing brittle control schemes.

**Summary**: Enhancing existing models with new knowledge is a crucial aspect of AI development. This paper introduces a novel method for integrating a new language into a large language model (LLM). Our approach successfully incorporates a previously unseen target language into an existing LLM without compromising its prior knowledge. We trained a tiny model with 1.5 billion parameters named Kuwain by injecting the Arabic language into a small open-source model mainly trained in English. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in Arabic language performance, with an average 8% improvement across various benchmarks, while retaining the model's existing knowledge with a minimum amount of the original model's data. This offers a cost-effective alternative to training a comprehensive model in both English and Arabic. The results highlight the potential for efficient, targeted language model expansion without extensive retraining or resource-intensive processes.

### Rethinking the Potential of Multimodality in Collaborative Problem   Solving Diagnosis with Large Language Models
**Authors**: K. Wong, B. Wu, S. Bulathwela, M. Cukurova

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T13:25:55Z

**Summary**: Detecting collaborative and problem-solving behaviours from digital traces to interpret students' collaborative problem solving (CPS) competency is a long-term goal in the Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) field. Although multimodal data and advanced models are argued to have the potential to detect complex CPS behaviours, empirical evidence on their value remains limited with some contrasting evidence. In this study, we investigated the potential of multimodal data to improve model performance in diagnosing 78 secondary school students' CPS subskills and indicators in authentic educational settings. In particular, text embeddings from verbal data and acoustic embeddings from audio data were used in a multimodal classification model for CPS diagnosis. Both unimodal and multimodal transformer-based models outperformed traditional models in detecting CPS classes. Although the inclusion of multimodality did not improve the performance of traditional unimodal models, its integration into transformer-based models demonstrated improved performance for diagnosing social-cognitive CPS classes compared to unimodal transformer-based models. Based on the results, the paper argues that multimodality and the selection of a particular modelling technique should not be taken for granted to achieve the best performance in the automated detection of every CPS subskill and indicator. Rather, their value is limited to certain types of CPS indicators, affected by the complexity of the labels, and dependent on the composition of indicators in the dataset. We conclude the paper by discussing the required nuance when considering the value of LLMs and multimodality in automated CPS diagnosis, highlighting the need for human-AI complementarity, and proposing the exploration of relevant model architectures and techniques to improve CPS diagnosis in authentic educational contexts.

### Empowering AI to Generate Better AI Code: Guided Generation of Deep   Learning Projects with LLMs
**Authors**: Chen Xie, Mingsheng Jiao, Xiaodong Gu, Beijun Shen

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T13:09:25Z

**Summary**: While large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to code generation, they struggle with generating entire deep learning projects, which are characterized by complex structures, longer functions, and stronger reliance on domain knowledge than general-purpose code. An open-domain LLM often lacks coherent contextual guidance and domain expertise for specific projects, making it challenging to produce complete code that fully meets user requirements.   In this paper, we propose a novel planning-guided code generation method, DLCodeGen, tailored for generating deep learning projects. DLCodeGen predicts a structured solution plan, offering global guidance for LLMs to generate the project. The generated plan is then leveraged to retrieve semantically analogous code samples and subsequently abstract a code template. To effectively integrate these multiple retrieval-augmented techniques, a comparative learning mechanism is designed to generate the final code. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on a dataset we build for deep learning code generation. Experimental results demonstrate that DLCodeGen outperforms other baselines, achieving improvements of 9.7% in CodeBLEU and 3.6% in human evaluation metrics.

### Think2SQL: Reinforce LLM Reasoning Capabilities for Text2SQL
**Authors**: Simone Papicchio, Simone Rossi, Luca Cagliero, Paolo Papotti

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T13:05:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in transforming natural language questions about relational databases into SQL queries. Despite recent improvements, small LLMs struggle to handle questions involving multiple tables and complex SQL patterns under a Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) setting. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) partially compensate the knowledge deficits in pretrained models but falls short while dealing with queries involving multi-hop reasoning. To bridge this gap, different LLM training strategies to reinforce reasoning capabilities have been proposed, ranging from leveraging a thinking process within ZSL, including reasoning traces in SFT, or adopt Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies. However, the influence of reasoning on Text2SQL performance is still largely unexplored. This paper investigates to what extent LLM reasoning capabilities influence their Text2SQL performance on four benchmark datasets. To this end, it considers the following LLM settings: (1) ZSL, including general-purpose reasoning or not; (2) SFT, with and without task-specific reasoning traces; (3) RL, leveraging execution accuracy as primary reward function; (4) SFT+RL, i.e, a two-stage approach that combines SFT and RL. The results show that general-purpose reasoning under ZSL proves to be ineffective in tackling complex Text2SQL cases. Small LLMs benefit from SFT with reasoning much more than larger ones, bridging the gap of their (weaker) model pretraining. RL is generally beneficial across all tested models and datasets, particularly when SQL queries involve multi-hop reasoning and multiple tables. Small LLMs with SFT+RL excel on most complex datasets thanks to a strategic balance between generality of the reasoning process and optimization of the execution accuracy. Thanks to RL, the7B Qwen-Coder-2.5 model performs on par with 100+ Billion ones on the Bird dataset.

### Semantic Wave Functions: Exploring Meaning in Large Language Models   Through Quantum Formalism
**Authors**: Timo Aukusti Laine

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T13:04:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode semantic relationships in high-dimensional vector embeddings. This paper explores the analogy between LLM embedding spaces and quantum mechanics, positing that LLMs operate within a quantized semantic space where words and phrases behave as quantum states. To capture nuanced semantic interference effects, we extend the standard real-valued embedding space to the complex domain, drawing parallels to the double-slit experiment. We introduce a "semantic wave function" to formalize this quantum-derived representation and utilize potential landscapes, such as the double-well potential, to model semantic ambiguity. Furthermore, we propose a complex-valued similarity measure that incorporates both magnitude and phase information, enabling a more sensitive comparison of semantic representations. We develop a path integral formalism, based on a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a gauge field and Mexican hat potential, to model the dynamic evolution of LLM behavior. This interdisciplinary approach offers a new theoretical framework for understanding and potentially manipulating LLMs, with the goal of advancing both artificial and natural language understanding.

### The Great Nugget Recall: Automating Fact Extraction and RAG Evaluation   with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ronak Pradeep, Nandan Thakur, Shivani Upadhyay, Daniel Campos, Nick Craswell, Jimmy Lin

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T12:55:06Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of information access systems, especially with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Nevertheless, the evaluation of RAG systems remains a barrier to continued progress, a challenge we tackle in this work by proposing an automatic evaluation framework that is validated against human annotations. We believe that the nugget evaluation methodology provides a solid foundation for evaluating RAG systems. This approach, originally developed for the TREC Question Answering (QA) Track in 2003, evaluates systems based on atomic facts that should be present in good answers. Our efforts focus on "refactoring" this methodology, where we describe the AutoNuggetizer framework that specifically applies LLMs to both automatically create nuggets and automatically assign nuggets to system answers. In the context of the TREC 2024 RAG Track, we calibrate a fully automatic approach against strategies where nuggets are created manually or semi-manually by human assessors and then assigned manually to system answers. Based on results from a community-wide evaluation, we observe strong agreement at the run level between scores derived from fully automatic nugget evaluation and human-based variants. The agreement is stronger when individual framework components such as nugget assignment are automated independently. This suggests that our evaluation framework provides tradeoffs between effort and quality that can be used to guide the development of future RAG systems. However, further research is necessary to refine our approach, particularly in establishing robust per-topic agreement to diagnose system failures effectively.

### Is Translation All You Need? A Study on Solving Multilingual Tasks with   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chaoqun Liu, Wenxuan Zhang, Yiran Zhao, Anh Tuan Luu, Lidong Bing

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T12:52:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated multilingual capabilities, yet they are mostly English-centric due to the imbalanced training corpora. While prior works have leveraged this bias to enhance multilingual performance through translation, they have been largely limited to natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this work, we extend the evaluation to real-world user queries and non-English-centric LLMs, offering a broader examination of multilingual performance. Our key contribution lies in demonstrating that while translation into English can boost the performance of English-centric LLMs on NLP tasks, it is not universally optimal. For culture-related tasks that need deep language understanding, prompting in the native language proves more effective as it better captures the nuances of culture and language. Our experiments expose varied behaviors across LLMs and tasks in the multilingual context, underscoring the need for a more comprehensive approach to multilingual evaluation. Therefore, we call for greater efforts in developing and evaluating LLMs that go beyond English-centric paradigms.

### Linear Item-Item Model with Neural Knowledge for Session-based   Recommendation
**Authors**: Minjin Choi, Sunkyung Lee, Seongmin Park, Jongwuk Lee

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T12:34:57Z

**Summary**: Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict users' subsequent actions by modeling short-term interactions within sessions. Existing neural models primarily focus on capturing complex dependencies for sequential item transitions. As an alternative solution, linear item-item models mainly identify strong co-occurrence patterns across items and support faster inference speed. Although each paradigm has been actively studied in SBR, their fundamental differences in capturing item relationships and how to bridge these distinct modeling paradigms effectively remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel SBR model, namely Linear Item-Item model with Neural Knowledge (LINK), which integrates both types of knowledge into a unified linear framework. Specifically, we design two specialized components of LINK: (i) Linear knowledge-enhanced Item-item Similarity model (LIS), which refines the item similarity correlation via self-distillation, and (ii) Neural knowledge-enhanced Item-item Transition model (NIT), which seamlessly incorporates complicated neural knowledge distilled from the off-the-shelf neural model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LINK outperforms state-of-the-art linear SBR models across six real-world datasets, achieving improvements of up to 14.78% and 11.04% in Recall@20 and MRR@20 while showing up to 813x fewer inference FLOPs. Our code is available at https://github.com/jin530/LINK.

### Structure-guided Diffusion Transformer for Low-Light Image Enhancement
**Authors**: Xiangchen Yin, Zhenda Yu, Longtao Jiang, Xin Gao, Xiao Sun, Zhi Liu, Xun Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T12:30:01Z

**Summary**: While the diffusion transformer (DiT) has become a focal point of interest in recent years, its application in low-light image enhancement remains a blank area for exploration. Current methods recover the details from low-light images while inevitably amplifying the noise in images, resulting in poor visual quality. In this paper, we firstly introduce DiT into the low-light enhancement task and design a novel Structure-guided Diffusion Transformer based Low-light image enhancement (SDTL) framework. We compress the feature through wavelet transform to improve the inference efficiency of the model and capture the multi-directional frequency band. Then we propose a Structure Enhancement Module (SEM) that uses structural prior to enhance the texture and leverages an adaptive fusion strategy to achieve more accurate enhancement effect. In Addition, we propose a Structure-guided Attention Block (SAB) to pay more attention to texture-riched tokens and avoid interference from noisy areas in noise prediction. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance on several popular datasets, validating the effectiveness of SDTL in improving image quality and the potential of DiT in low-light enhancement tasks.

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T12:26:27Z

**Summary**: From pathogens and computer viruses to genes and memes, contagion models have found widespread utility across the natural and social sciences. Despite their success and breadth of adoption, the approach and structure of these models remain surprisingly siloed by field. Given the siloed nature of their development and widespread use, one persistent assumption is that a given contagion can be studied in isolation, independently from what else might be spreading in the population. In reality, countless contagions of biological and social nature interact within hosts (interacting with existing beliefs, or the immune system) and across hosts (interacting in the environment, or affecting transmission mechanisms). Additionally, from a modeling perspective, we know that relaxing these assumptions has profound effects on the physics and translational implications of the models. Here, we review mechanisms for interactions in social and biological contagions, as well as the models and frameworks developed to include these interactions in the study of the contagions. We highlight existing problems related to the inference of interactions and to the scalability of mathematical models and identify promising avenues of future inquiries. In doing so, we highlight the need for interdisciplinary efforts under a unified science of contagions and for removing a common dichotomy between social and biological contagions.

### Testing LLMs' Capabilities in Annotating Translations Based on an Error   Typology Designed for LSP Translation: First Experiments with ChatGPT
**Authors**: Joachim Minder, Guillaume Wisniewski, Natalie Kübler

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T12:21:37Z

**Summary**: This study investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, in annotating MT outputs based on an error typology. In contrast to previous work focusing mainly on general language, we explore ChatGPT's ability to identify and categorise errors in specialised translations. By testing two different prompts and based on a customised error typology, we compare ChatGPT annotations with human expert evaluations of translations produced by DeepL and ChatGPT itself. The results show that, for translations generated by DeepL, recall and precision are quite high. However, the degree of accuracy in error categorisation depends on the prompt's specific features and its level of detail, ChatGPT performing very well with a detailed prompt. When evaluating its own translations, ChatGPT achieves significantly poorer results, revealing limitations with self-assessment. These results highlight both the potential and the limitations of LLMs for translation evaluation, particularly in specialised domains. Our experiments pave the way for future research on open-source LLMs, which could produce annotations of comparable or even higher quality. In the future, we also aim to test the practical effectiveness of this automated evaluation in the context of translation training, particularly by optimising the process of human evaluation by teachers and by exploring the impact of annotations by LLMs on students' post-editing and translation learning.

### ScanEdit: Hierarchically-Guided Functional 3D Scan Editing
**Authors**: Mohamed el amine Boudjoghra, Ivan Laptev, Angela Dai

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T12:12:43Z

**Summary**: With the fast pace of 3D capture technology and resulting abundance of 3D data, effective 3D scene editing becomes essential for a variety of graphics applications. In this work we present ScanEdit, an instruction-driven method for functional editing of complex, real-world 3D scans. To model large and interdependent sets of ob- jectswe propose a hierarchically-guided approach. Given a 3D scan decomposed into its object instances, we first construct a hierarchical scene graph representation to enable effective, tractable editing. We then leverage reason- ing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and translate high-level language instructions into actionable commands applied hierarchically to the scene graph. Fi- nally, ScanEdit integrates LLM-based guidance with ex- plicit physical constraints and generates realistic scenes where object arrangements obey both physics and common sense. In our extensive experimental evaluation ScanEdit outperforms state of the art and demonstrates excellent re- sults for a variety of real-world scenes and input instruc- tions.

### RainbowPlus: Enhancing Adversarial Prompt Generation via Evolutionary   Quality-Diversity Search
**Authors**: Quy-Anh Dang, Chris Ngo, Truong-Son Hy

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T12:04:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but are susceptible to adversarial prompts that exploit vulnerabilities to produce unsafe or biased outputs. Existing red-teaming methods often face scalability challenges, resource-intensive requirements, or limited diversity in attack strategies. We propose RainbowPlus, a novel red-teaming framework rooted in evolutionary computation, enhancing adversarial prompt generation through an adaptive quality-diversity (QD) search that extends classical evolutionary algorithms like MAP-Elites with innovations tailored for language models. By employing a multi-element archive to store diverse high-quality prompts and a comprehensive fitness function to evaluate multiple prompts concurrently, RainbowPlus overcomes the constraints of single-prompt archives and pairwise comparisons in prior QD methods like Rainbow Teaming. Experiments comparing RainbowPlus to QD methods across six benchmark datasets and four open-source LLMs demonstrate superior attack success rate (ASR) and diversity (Diverse-Score $\approx 0.84$), generating up to 100 times more unique prompts (e.g., 10,418 vs. 100 for Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410). Against nine state-of-the-art methods on the HarmBench dataset with twelve LLMs (ten open-source, two closed-source), RainbowPlus achieves an average ASR of 81.1%, surpassing AutoDAN-Turbo by 3.9%, and is 9 times faster (1.45 vs. 13.50 hours). Our open-source implementation fosters further advancements in LLM safety, offering a scalable tool for vulnerability assessment. Code and resources are publicly available at https://github.com/knoveleng/rainbowplus, supporting reproducibility and future research in LLM red-teaming.

### MRAMG-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Advancing Multimodal   Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation
**Authors**: Qinhan Yu, Zhiyou Xiao, Binghui Li, Zhengren Wang, Chong Chen, Wentao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T12:02:08Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have significantly improved response accuracy and relevance by incorporating external knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG methods primarily focus on generating text-only answers, even in Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) scenarios, where multimodal elements are retrieved to assist in generating text answers. To address this, we introduce the Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation (MRAMG) task, in which we aim to generate multimodal answers that combine both text and images, fully leveraging the multimodal data within a corpus. Despite growing attention to this challenging task, a notable lack of a comprehensive benchmark persists for effectively evaluating its performance. To bridge this gap, we provide MRAMG-Bench, a meticulously curated, human-annotated benchmark comprising 4,346 documents, 14,190 images, and 4,800 QA pairs, distributed across six distinct datasets and spanning three domains: Web, Academia, and Lifestyle. The datasets incorporate diverse difficulty levels and complex multi-image scenarios, providing a robust foundation for evaluating the MRAMG task. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, MRAMG-Bench incorporates a comprehensive suite of both statistical and LLM-based metrics, enabling a thorough analysis of the performance of generative models in the MRAMG task. Additionally, we propose an efficient and flexible multimodal answer generation framework that can leverage LLMs/MLLMs to generate multimodal responses. Our datasets and complete evaluation results for 11 popular generative models are available at https://github.com/MRAMG-Bench/MRAMG.

### Text-to-Decision Agent: Learning Generalist Policies from Natural   Language Supervision
**Authors**: Shilin Zhang, Zican Hu, Wenhao Wu, Xinyi Xie, Jianxiang Tang, Chunlin Chen, Daoyi Dong, Yu Cheng, Zhenhong Sun, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-22T05:56:57Z

**Summary**: RL systems usually tackle generalization by inferring task beliefs from high-quality samples or warmup explorations. The restricted form limits their generality and usability since these supervision signals are expensive and even infeasible to acquire in advance for unseen tasks. Learning directly from the raw text about decision tasks is a promising alternative to leverage a much broader source of supervision. In the paper, we propose Text-to-Decision Agent (T2DA), a simple and scalable framework that supervises generalist policy learning with natural language. We first introduce a generalized world model to encode multi-task decision data into a dynamics-aware embedding space. Then, inspired by CLIP, we predict which textual description goes with which decision embedding, effectively bridging their semantic gap via contrastive language-decision pre-training and aligning the text embeddings to comprehend the environment dynamics. After training the text-conditioned generalist policy, the agent can directly realize zero-shot text-to-decision generation in response to language instructions. Comprehensive experiments on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks show that T2DA facilitates high-capacity zero-shot generalization and outperforms various types of baselines.

### Beyond Terabit/s Integrated Neuromorphic Photonic Processor for DSP-Free   Optical Interconnects
**Authors**: Benshan Wang, Qiarong Xiao, Tengji Xu, Li Fan, Shaojie Liu, Jianji Dong, Junwen Zhang, Chaoran Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T11:56:36Z

**Summary**: The rapid expansion of generative AI drives unprecedented demands for high-performance computing. Training large-scale AI models now requires vast interconnected GPU clusters across multiple data centers. Multi-scale AI training and inference demand uniform, ultra-low latency, and energy-efficient links to enable massive GPUs to function as a single cohesive unit. However, traditional electrical and optical interconnects, relying on conventional digital signal processors (DSPs) for signal distortion compensation, increasingly fail to meet these stringent requirements. To overcome these limitations, we present an integrated neuromorphic optical signal processor (OSP) that leverages deep reservoir computing and achieves DSP-free, all-optical, real-time processing. Experimentally, our OSP achieves a 100 Gbaud PAM4 per lane, 1.6 Tbit/s data center interconnect over a 5 km optical fiber in the C-band (equivalent to over 80 km in the O-band), far exceeding the reach of state-of-the-art DSP solutions, which are fundamentally constrained by chromatic dispersion in IMDD systems. Simultaneously, it reduces processing latency by four orders of magnitude and energy consumption by three orders of magnitude. Unlike DSPs, which introduce increased latency at high data rates, our OSP maintains consistent, ultra-low latency regardless of data rate scaling, making it ideal for future optical interconnects. Moreover, the OSP retains full optical field information for better impairment compensation and adapts to various modulation formats, data rates, and wavelengths. Fabricated using a mature silicon photonic process, the OSP can be monolithically integrated with silicon photonic transceivers, enhancing the compactness and reliability of all-optical interconnects. This research provides a highly scalable, energy-efficient, and high-speed solution, paving the way for next-generation AI infrastructure.

### Bayesian Sensing for Time-Varying Channels in ISAC Systems
**Authors**: Xueyang Wang, Kai Wu, J. Andrew Zhang, Shiqi Gong, Chengwen Xing

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T11:53:44Z

**Summary**: Future mobile networks are projected to support integrated sensing and communications in high-speed communication scenarios. Nevertheless, large Doppler shifts induced by time-varying channels may cause severe inter-carrier interference (ICI). Frequency domain shows the potential of reducing ISAC complexity as compared with other domains. However, parameter mismatching issue still exists for such sensing. In this paper, we develop a novel sensing scheme based on sparse Bayesian framework, where the delay and Doppler estimation problem in time-varying channels is formulated as a 3D multiple measurement-sparse signal recovery (MM-SSR) problem. We then propose a novel two-layer variational Bayesian inference (VBI) method to decompose the 3D MM-SSR problem into two layers and estimate the Doppler in the first layer and the delay in the second layer alternatively. Subsequently, as is benefited from newly unveiled signal construction, a simplified two-stage multiple signal classification (MUSIC)-based VBI method is proposed, where the delay and the Doppler are estimated by MUSIC and VBI, respectively. Additionally, the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) of the considered sensing parameters is derived to characterize the lower bound for the proposed estimators. Corroborated by extensive simulation results, our proposed method can achieve improved mean square error (MSE) than its conventional counterparts and is robust against the target number and target speed, thereby validating its wide applicability and advantages over prior arts.

### DyST-XL: Dynamic Layout Planning and Content Control for Compositional   Text-to-Video Generation
**Authors**: Weijie He, Mushui Liu, Yunlong Yu, Zhao Wang, Chao Wu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T11:41:22Z

**Summary**: Compositional text-to-video generation, which requires synthesizing dynamic scenes with multiple interacting entities and precise spatial-temporal relationships, remains a critical challenge for diffusion-based models. Existing methods struggle with layout discontinuity, entity identity drift, and implausible interaction dynamics due to unconstrained cross-attention mechanisms and inadequate physics-aware reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose DyST-XL, a \textbf{training-free} framework that enhances off-the-shelf text-to-video models (e.g., CogVideoX-5B) through frame-aware control. DyST-XL integrates three key innovations: (1) A Dynamic Layout Planner that leverages large language models (LLMs) to parse input prompts into entity-attribute graphs and generates physics-aware keyframe layouts, with intermediate frames interpolated via trajectory optimization; (2) A Dual-Prompt Controlled Attention Mechanism that enforces localized text-video alignment through frame-aware attention masking, achieving the precise control over individual entities; and (3) An Entity-Consistency Constraint strategy that propagates first-frame feature embeddings to subsequent frames during denoising, preserving object identity without manual annotation. Experiments demonstrate that DyST-XL excels in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly improving performance on complex prompts and bridging a crucial gap in training-free video synthesis.

### DistilQwen2.5: Industrial Practices of Training Distilled Open   Lightweight Language Models
**Authors**: Chengyu Wang, Junbing Yan, Yuanhao Yue, Jun Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T11:26:02Z

**Summary**: Enhancing computational efficiency and reducing deployment costs for large language models (LLMs) have become critical challenges in various resource-constrained scenarios. In this work, we present DistilQwen2.5, a family of distilled, lightweight LLMs derived from the public Qwen2.5 models. These distilled models exhibit enhanced instruction-following capabilities compared to the original models based on a series of distillation techniques that incorporate knowledge from much larger LLMs. In our industrial practice, we first leverage powerful proprietary LLMs with varying capacities as multi-agent teachers to select, rewrite, and refine instruction-response pairs that are more suitable for student LLMs to learn. After standard fine-tuning, we further leverage a computationally efficient model fusion approach that enables student models to progressively integrate fine-grained hidden knowledge from their teachers. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the distilled models possess significantly stronger capabilities than their original checkpoints. Additionally, we present use cases to illustrate the applications of our framework in real-world scenarios. To facilitate practical use, we have released all the DistilQwen2.5 models to the open-source community.

### LLMs as Data Annotators: How Close Are We to Human Performance
**Authors**: Muhammad Uzair Ul Haq, Davide Rigoni, Alessandro Sperduti

**Summary**: In NLP, fine-tuning LLMs is effective for various applications but requires high-quality annotated data. However, manual annotation of data is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Therefore, LLMs are increasingly used to automate the process, often employing in-context learning (ICL) in which some examples related to the task are given in the prompt for better performance. However, manually selecting context examples can lead to inefficiencies and suboptimal model performance. This paper presents comprehensive experiments comparing several LLMs, considering different embedding models, across various datasets for the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. The evaluation encompasses models with approximately $7$B and $70$B parameters, including both proprietary and non-proprietary models. Furthermore, leveraging the success of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it also considers a method that addresses the limitations of ICL by automatically retrieving contextual examples, thereby enhancing performance. The results highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate LLM and embedding model, understanding the trade-offs between LLM sizes and desired performance, and the necessity to direct research efforts towards more challenging datasets.

**Authors**: Hanwen Zhang, Ruichen Zhang, Wei Zhang, Dusit Niyato, Yonggang Wen

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T11:09:11Z

**Summary**: Generative artificial intelligence, particularly through large language models (LLMs), is poised to transform energy optimization and demand side management (DSM) within microgrids. This paper explores the integration of LLMs into energy management, emphasizing their roles in automating the optimization of DSM strategies with Internet of electric vehicles.

### Impact of weak-lensing mass-mapping algorithms on cosmology inference
**Authors**: Andreas Tersenov, Lucie Baumont, Jean-Luc Starck, Martin Kilbinger

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T10:49:13Z

**Summary**: Weak-lensing mass-mapping algorithms, which reconstruct the convergence field from galaxy shear measurements, are crucial for extracting higher-order statistics to constrain cosmological parameters. However, only limited research has explored whether the choice of mass-mapping algorithm affects the inference of cosmological parameters from weak-lensing higher-order statistics. This study aims to evaluate the impact of different mass-mapping algorithms on the inference of cosmological parameters measured with weak-lensing peak counts. We employ Kaiser-Squires, inpainting Kaiser-Squires, and MCALens mass-mapping algorithms to reconstruct the convergence field from simulated weak-lensing data. Using these maps, we compute the peak counts and wavelet peak counts as data vectors and perform Bayesian analysis with MCMC sampling to estimate posterior distributions of cosmological parameters. Our results indicate that the choice of mass-mapping algorithm significantly affects the constraints on cosmological parameters, with the MCALens method improving constraints by up to 157$\%$ compared to the standard Kaiser-Squires method. This improvement arises from MCALens' ability to better capture small-scale structures. In contrast, inpainting Kaiser-Squires yields constraints similar to Kaiser-Squires, indicating a limited benefit from inpainting for cosmological parameter estimation with peaks. The accuracy of mass-mapping algorithms is thus critical for cosmological inference from weak-lensing data. Advanced algorithms like MCALens, which offer superior reconstruction of the convergence field, can substantially enhance the precision of cosmological parameter estimates. These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate mass-mapping techniques in weak-lensing studies to fully exploit the potential of higher-order statistics for cosmological research.

**Authors**: Yow-Fu Liou, Yu-Chien Tang, An-Zi Yen

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T10:35:48Z

**Summary**: The process of creating educational materials is both time-consuming and demanding for educators. This research explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline this task by automating the generation of extended reading materials and relevant course suggestions. Using the TED-Ed Dig Deeper sections as an initial exploration, we investigate how supplementary articles can be enriched with contextual knowledge and connected to additional learning resources. Our method begins by generating extended articles from video transcripts, leveraging LLMs to include historical insights, cultural examples, and illustrative anecdotes. A recommendation system employing semantic similarity ranking identifies related courses, followed by an LLM-based refinement process to enhance relevance. The final articles are tailored to seamlessly integrate these recommendations, ensuring they remain cohesive and informative. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our model produces high-quality content and accurate course suggestions, assessed through metrics such as Hit Rate, semantic similarity, and coherence. Our experimental analysis highlight the nuanced differences between the generated and existing materials, underscoring the model's capacity to offer more engaging and accessible learning experiences. This study showcases how LLMs can bridge the gap between core content and supplementary learning, providing students with additional recommended resources while also assisting teachers in designing educational materials.

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T10:34:50Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in video generation have been driven by diffusion models and autoregressive frameworks, yet critical challenges persist in harmonizing prompt adherence, visual quality, motion dynamics, and duration: compromises in motion dynamics to enhance temporal visual quality, constrained video duration (5-10 seconds) to prioritize resolution, and inadequate shot-aware generation stemming from general-purpose MLLMs' inability to interpret cinematic grammar, such as shot composition, actor expressions, and camera motions. These intertwined limitations hinder realistic long-form synthesis and professional film-style generation. To address these limitations, we propose SkyReels-V2, an Infinite-length Film Generative Model, that synergizes Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), Multi-stage Pretraining, Reinforcement Learning, and Diffusion Forcing Framework. Firstly, we design a comprehensive structural representation of video that combines the general descriptions by the Multi-modal LLM and the detailed shot language by sub-expert models. Aided with human annotation, we then train a unified Video Captioner, named SkyCaptioner-V1, to efficiently label the video data. Secondly, we establish progressive-resolution pretraining for the fundamental video generation, followed by a four-stage post-training enhancement: Initial concept-balanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) improves baseline quality; Motion-specific Reinforcement Learning (RL) training with human-annotated and synthetic distortion data addresses dynamic artifacts; Our diffusion forcing framework with non-decreasing noise schedules enables long-video synthesis in an efficient search space; Final high-quality SFT refines visual fidelity. All the code and models are available at https://github.com/SkyworkAI/SkyReels-V2.

### Quantifying the benefits of code hints for refactoring deprecated Java   APIs
**Authors**: Cristina David, Pascal Kesseli, Daniel Kroening, Hanliang Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T10:30:34Z

**Summary**: When done manually, refactoring legacy code in order to eliminate uses of deprecated APIs is an error-prone and time-consuming process. In this paper, we investigate to which degree refactorings for deprecated Java APIs can be automated, and quantify the benefit of Javadoc code hints for this task. To this end, we build a symbolic and a neural engine for the automatic refactoring of deprecated APIs. The former is based on type-directed and component-based program synthesis, whereas the latter uses LLMs. We applied our engines to refactor the deprecated methods in the Oracle JDK 15. Our experiments show that code hints are enabling for the automation of this task: even the worst engine correctly refactors 71% of the tasks with code hints, which drops to at best 14% on tasks without. Adding more code hints to Javadoc can hence boost the refactoring of code that uses deprecated APIs.

### Learning Compositional Transferability of Time Series for Source-Free   Domain Adaptation
**Authors**: Hankang Sun, Guiming Li, Su Yang, Baoqi Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T09:51:24Z

**Summary**: Domain adaptation is challenging for time series classification due to the highly dynamic nature. This study tackles the most difficult subtask when both target labels and source data are inaccessible, namely, source-free domain adaptation. To reuse the classification backbone pre-trained on source data, time series reconstruction is a sound solution that aligns target and source time series by minimizing the reconstruction errors of both. However, simply fine-tuning the source pre-trained reconstruction model on target data may lose the learnt priori, and it struggles to accommodate domain varying temporal patterns in a single encoder-decoder. Therefore, this paper tries to disentangle the composition of domain transferability by using a compositional architecture for time series reconstruction. Here, the preceding component is a U-net frozen since pre-trained, the output of which during adaptation is the initial reconstruction of a given target time series, acting as a coarse step to prompt the subsequent finer adaptation. The following pipeline for finer adaptation includes two parallel branches: The source replay branch using a residual link to preserve the output of U-net, and the offset compensation branch that applies an additional autoencoder (AE) to further warp U-net's output. By deploying a learnable factor on either branch to scale their composition in the final output of reconstruction, the data transferability is disentangled and the learnt reconstructive capability from source data is retained. During inference, aside from the batch-level optimization in the training, we search at test time stability-aware rescaling of source replay branch to tolerate instance-wise variation. The experimental results show that such compositional architecture of time series reconstruction leads to SOTA performance on 3 widely used benchmarks.

### MoWE-Audio: Multitask AudioLLMs with Mixture of Weak Encoders
**Authors**: Wenyu Zhang, Shuo Sun, Bin Wang, Xunlong Zou, Zhuohan Liu, Yingxu He, Geyu Lin, Nancy F. Chen, Ai Ti Aw

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T09:48:05Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced natural language processing capabilities, facilitating the development of AudioLLMs that process and understand speech and audio inputs alongside text. Existing AudioLLMs typically combine a pre-trained audio encoder with a pre-trained LLM, which are subsequently finetuned on specific audio tasks. However, the pre-trained audio encoder has constrained capacity to capture features for new tasks and datasets. To address this, we propose to incorporate mixtures of `weak' encoders (MoWE) into the AudioLLM framework. MoWE supplements a base encoder with a pool of relatively light weight encoders, selectively activated based on the audio input to enhance feature extraction without significantly increasing model size. Our empirical results demonstrate that MoWE effectively improves multi-task performance, broadening the applicability of AudioLLMs to more diverse audio tasks.

### Efficient Pretraining Length Scaling
**Authors**: Bohong Wu, Shen Yan, Sijun Zhang, Jianqiao Lu, Yutao Zeng, Ya Wang, Xun Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T09:41:26Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the effectiveness of length scaling during post-training, yet its potential in pre-training remains underexplored. We present the Parallel Hidden Decoding Transformer (\textit{PHD}-Transformer), a novel framework that enables efficient length scaling during pre-training while maintaining inference efficiency. \textit{PHD}-Transformer achieves this through an innovative KV cache management strategy that distinguishes between original tokens and hidden decoding tokens. By retaining only the KV cache of original tokens for long-range dependencies while immediately discarding hidden decoding tokens after use, our approach maintains the same KV cache size as the vanilla transformer while enabling effective length scaling. To further enhance performance, we introduce two optimized variants: \textit{PHD-SWA} employs sliding window attention to preserve local dependencies, while \textit{PHD-CSWA} implements chunk-wise sliding window attention to eliminate linear growth in pre-filling time. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks.

### Inference Optimal VLMs Need Fewer Visual Tokens and More Parameters
**Authors**: Kevin Y. Li, Sachin Goyal, Joao D. Semedo, J. Zico Kolter

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T09:34:59Z

**Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various visual understanding and reasoning tasks, driven by incorporating image representations into the token inputs of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, their real-world deployment is often constrained by high latency during inference due to the substantial compute required by the LLM to process the large number of input tokens, predominantly arising from the image. To reduce inference costs, one can either downsize the LLM or reduce the number of input tokens needed to represent the image, the latter of which has been the focus of many recent efforts around token compression. However, it is unclear what the optimal trade-off is given a fixed inference budget. We first characterize this optimal trade-off between the number of visual tokens and LLM parameters by establishing scaling laws that capture variations in performance with these two factors. Our results reveal a surprising trend: for visual reasoning tasks, the inference-optimal behavior in VLMs is achieved by using the largest LLM that fits within the inference budget while minimizing visual token count - often to a single token. While the token reduction literature has mainly focused on maintaining base model performance by modestly reducing the token count (e.g., $5-10\times$), our results indicate that the compute-optimal inference regime requires operating under even higher token compression ratios. Based on these insights, we take the first steps toward designing token compression algorithms tailored for high-compression settings, utilizing prompt-based compression of tokens. Our work underscores the performance and efficiency benefits of operating in low visual token regimes and the importance of developing tailored token reduction algorithms for such conditions. Code is available at https://github.com/locuslab/llava-token-compression.

### aiXamine: LLM Safety and Security Simplified
**Authors**: Fatih Deniz, Dorde Popovic, Yazan Boshmaf, Euisuh Jeong, Minhaj Ahmad, Sanjay Chawla, Issa Khalil

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T09:26:05Z

**Summary**: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for safety and security remains a complex task, often requiring users to navigate a fragmented landscape of ad hoc benchmarks, datasets, metrics, and reporting formats. To address this challenge, we present aiXamine, a comprehensive black-box evaluation platform for LLM safety and security. aiXamine integrates over 40 tests (i.e., benchmarks) organized into eight key services targeting specific dimensions of safety and security: adversarial robustness, code security, fairness and bias, hallucination, model and data privacy, out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, over-refusal, and safety alignment. The platform aggregates the evaluation results into a single detailed report per model, providing a detailed breakdown of model performance, test examples, and rich visualizations. We used aiXamine to assess over 50 publicly available and proprietary LLMs, conducting over 2K examinations. Our findings reveal notable vulnerabilities in leading models, including susceptibility to adversarial attacks in OpenAI's GPT-4o, biased outputs in xAI's Grok-3, and privacy weaknesses in Google's Gemini 2.0. Additionally, we observe that open-source models can match or exceed proprietary models in specific services such as safety alignment, fairness and bias, and OOD robustness. Finally, we identify trade-offs between distillation strategies, model size, training methods, and architectural choices.

### Bayesian model selection of Primordial Black Holes and Dressed   Primordial Black Holes with lensed Gravitational Waves
**Authors**: Xin-yi Lin, Zhengxiang Li, Jian-dong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T09:14:59Z

**Summary**: If particle dark matter (DM) and primordial black holes (PBHs) coexist, PBHs will be surrounded by particle DM, forming celestial objects known as dressed PBHs (dPBHs). These structures suggest a scenario in which PBHs and DM can exist simultaneously. However, in the high-frequency regime, the gravitational lensing effect of bare PBHs is similar to that of dPBHs. Ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are particularly sensitive to high-frequency GW signals. In this regime, the lensing effect of a point-mass lens with a mass in the range of $10^{-1} \sim 10^2 M_{\odot}$ becomes significant. In this work, we incorporate dPBH models with GW observations and employ Bayesian inference techniques to distinguish PBHs from dPBHs. Using the third-generation ground-based GW detectors, Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE), as examples, we demonstrate that these detectors can effectively differentiate the lensing effects of dPBHs from those of PBHs across a broad frequency range. Furthermore, we find that with a larger black hole (BH) mass inside the surrounding particle DM, ET and CE can distinguish these two lensed models with even greater precision.

### SLO-Aware Scheduling for Large Language Model Inferences
**Authors**: Jinqi Huang, Yi Xiong, Xuebing Yu, Wenjie Huang, Entong Li, Li Zeng, Xin Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T08:48:48Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized applications such as code completion, chatbots, and online classification. To elevate user experiences, service level objectives (SLOs) serve as crucial benchmarks for assessing inference services capabilities. In practice, an inference service processes multiple types of tasks, each with its own distinct SLO. To ensure satisfactory user experiences, each request's distinct SLOs should be considered in scheduling. However, existing designs lack this consideration, leading to insufficient hardware utility and suboptimal performance.   This paper analyzes scenarios to process tasks with varying SLOs, and introduces a simulated annealing-based scheduler to decide request priority sequence based on a request's SLO, input lengths, and possible output lengths. As the first specialized scheduler for multi-SLO scenarios, this work improves SLO attainment by up to 5x and reduces average latency by 31.6% on Python-Code-23k-ShareGPT and ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered datasets, compared to current state-of-the-art framework vLLM and a new framework LMDeploy.

### Evaluating Code Generation of LLMs in Advanced Computer Science Problems
**Authors**: Emir Catir, Robin Claesson, Rodothea Myrsini Tsoupidi

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T08:45:23Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have become popular among programming students. Students use LLMs to assist them in programming courses, including generating source code. Previous work has evaluated the ability of LLMs in solving introductory-course programming assignments. The results have shown that LLMs are highly effective in generating code for introductory Computer Science (CS) courses. However, there is a gap in research on evaluating LLMs' ability to generate code that solves advanced programming assignments. In this work, we evaluate the ability of four LLM tools to solve programming assignments from advanced CS courses in three popular programming languages, Java, Python, and C. We manually select 12 problems, three problems from introductory courses as the baseline and nine programming assignments from second- and third-year CS courses. To evaluate the LLM-generated code, we generate a test suite of 1000 test cases per problem and analyze the program output. Our evaluation shows that although LLMs are highly effective in generating source code for introductory programming courses, solving advanced programming assignments is more challenging. Nonetheless, in many cases, LLMs identify the base problem and provide partial solutions that may be useful to CS students. Furthermore, our results may provide useful guidance for teachers of advanced programming courses on how to design programming assignments.

### Can LLMs Replace Human Evaluators? An Empirical Study of LLM-as-a-Judge   in Software Engineering
**Authors**: Ruiqi Wang, Jiyu Guo, Cuiyun Gao, Guodong Fan, Chun Yong Chong, Xin Xia

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T08:41:21Z

**Summary**: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been deployed to tackle various software engineering (SE) tasks like code generation, significantly advancing the automation of SE tasks. However, assessing the quality of these LLM-generated code and text remains challenging. The commonly used Pass@k metric necessitates extensive unit tests and configured environments, demands a high labor cost, and is not suitable for evaluating LLM-generated text. Conventional metrics like BLEU, which measure only lexical rather than semantic similarity, have also come under scrutiny. In response, a new trend has emerged to employ LLMs for automated evaluation, known as LLM-as-a-judge. These LLM-as-a-judge methods are claimed to better mimic human assessment than conventional metrics without relying on high-quality reference answers. Nevertheless, their exact human alignment in SE tasks remains unexplored.   In this paper, we empirically explore LLM-as-a-judge methods for evaluating SE tasks, focusing on their alignment with human judgments. We select seven LLM-as-a-judge methods that utilize general-purpose LLMs, alongside two LLMs specifically fine-tuned for evaluation. After generating and manually scoring LLM responses on three recent SE datasets of code translation, code generation, and code summarization, we then prompt these methods to evaluate each response. Finally, we compare the scores generated by these methods with human evaluation. The results indicate that output-based methods reach the highest Pearson correlation of 81.32 and 68.51 with human scores in code translation and generation, achieving near-human evaluation, noticeably outperforming ChrF++, one of the best conventional metrics, at 34.23 and 64.92. Such output-based methods prompt LLMs to output judgments directly, and exhibit more balanced score distributions that resemble human score patterns. Finally, we provide...

### Efficient Document Retrieval with G-Retriever
**Authors**: Manthankumar Solanki

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T08:27:26Z

**Summary**: Textual data question answering has gained significant attention due to its growing applicability. Recently, a novel approach leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method was introduced, utilizing the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST) optimization for sub-graph construction. However, this method focused solely on node attributes, leading to incomplete contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach that replaces the PCST method with an attention-based sub-graph construction technique, enabling more efficient and context-aware retrieval. Additionally, we encode both node and edge attributes, leading to richer graph representations. Our method also incorporates an improved projection layer and multi-head attention pooling for better alignment with Large Language Models (LLMs). Experimental evaluations on the WebQSP dataset demonstrate that our approach is competitive and achieves marginally better results compared to the original method, underscoring its potential for more accurate question answering.

### A Purely Data-Driven Adaptive Impedance Matching Method Robust to   Parasitic Effects
**Authors**: Wendong Cheng, Li Chen, Weidong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T08:17:41Z

**Summary**: Adaptive impedance matching between antennas and radio frequency front-end (RFFE) power modules is essential for mobile communication systems. To address the matching performance degradation caused by parasitic effects in practical tunable matching networks (TMN), this paper proposes a purely data-driven adaptive impedance matching method that avoids trial-and-error physical adjustment. First, we propose the residual enhanced circuit behavior modeling network (RECBM-Net), a deep learning model that maps TMN operating states to their scattering parameters (S-parameters). Then, we formulate the matching process based on the trained surrogate model as a mathematical optimization problem. We employ two classic numerical methods with different online computational overhead, namely simulated annealing particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) and adaptive moment estimation with automatic differentiation (AD-Adam), to search for the matching solution. To further reduce the online inference overhead caused by repeated forward propagation through RECBM-Net, we train an inverse mapping solver network (IMS-Net) to directly predict the optimal solution. Simulation results show that RECBM-Net achieves exceptionally high modeling accuracy. While AD-Adam significantly reduces computational overhead compared to SAPSO, it sacrifices slight accuracy. IMS-Net offers the lowest online overhead while maintaining excellent matching accuracy.

### Risks of Practicing Large Language Models in Smart Grid: Threat Modeling   and Validation
**Authors**: Jiangnan Li, Yingyuan Yang, Jinyuan Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T08:14:52Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) represent significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and hold potential for applications within smart grids. However, as demonstrated in previous literature, AI technologies are susceptible to various types of attacks. It is crucial to investigate and evaluate the risks associated with LLMs before deploying them in critical infrastructure like smart grids. In this paper, we systematically evaluated the risks of LLMs and identified two major types of attacks relevant to potential smart grid LLM applications, presenting the corresponding threat models. We validated these attacks using popular LLMs and real smart grid data. Our validation demonstrates that attackers are capable of injecting bad data and retrieving domain knowledge from LLMs employed in different smart grid applications.

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T08:06:55Z

**Summary**: We study the G013.313+0.193 G013.313 region, a complex environment characterized by molecular cloud interactions indicative of cloud-cloud collision (CCC). Observations of the NH3(1,1) and (2,2) inversion transitions were obtained using the Nanshan 26 m radio telescope, while HCO+ (1-0), 12CO, 13CO, and C18O(1-0) transitions from the Purple Mountain Observatory Delingha 14 m telescope. Archival data are also included. We identified key observational signatures of CCC, including complementary spatial distributions, U-shaped structures, bridge features, and V-shaped velocity distributions. The position-velocity diagrams (P-V) reveal clear indications of gas interaction between two velocity components, suggesting an ongoing collision at an estimated angle of approximately 45 degree to the line of sight. The estimated collision timescale is 0.35-1.03 Myr, aligned with the inferred ages of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the region, supporting the hypothesis of collision-induced star formation. Hub-filament system (HFS) are identified in the compressed gas region, where filaments converge toward a dense hub, suggesting the CCC as a potential driver of HFS formation and massive star formation. The high column density suggests favorable conditions for the formation of massive stars. Although alternative kinematic drivers such as longitudinal collapse and shear motion are considered, CCC remains the most plausible explanation for the observed features. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of cloud dynamics and massive star formation in turbulent molecular environments.

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a technology that enhances large language models by integrating information retrieval. In the industry, inference services based on LLMs are highly sensitive to cost-performance ratio, prompting the need for improving hardware resource utilization in the inference service. Specifically, vector embedding and retrieval processes take up to 20% of the total latency. Therefore, optimizing the utilization of computational resources in vector embeddings is crucial for enhancing the cost-performance ratio of inference processes, which in turn boosts their product competitiveness.In this paper, we analyze the deployment costs of vector embedding technology in inference services, propose a theoretical formula, and determine through the mathematical expression that increasing the capacity to process concurrent queries is the key to reducing the deployment costs of vector embeddings. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on improving the product's capability to process concurrent queries. To optimize concurrency without sacrificing performance, we have designed a queue manager that adeptly offloads CPU peak queries. This manager utilizes a linear regression model to ascertain the optimal queue depths, a critical parameter that significantly influences the efficacy of the system. We further develop a system named WindVE that uses a CPU-NPU heterogeneous architecture to offload peak concurrent queries, which leverages the performance differences between the two processors to effectively manage traffic surges. Through experiments, we compare WindVE to the state-of-the-art vector embedding framework FlagEmbedding, and achieve a concurrency level up to 22.3% higher than the scheme without offloading.

### Causal DAG Summarization (Full Version)
**Authors**: Anna Zeng, Michael Cafarella, Batya Kenig, Markos Markakis, Brit Youngmann, Babak Salimi

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T08:01:32Z

**Summary**: Causal inference aids researchers in discovering cause-and-effect relationships, leading to scientific insights. Accurate causal estimation requires identifying confounding variables to avoid false discoveries. Pearl's causal model uses causal DAGs to identify confounding variables, but incorrect DAGs can lead to unreliable causal conclusions. However, for high dimensional data, the causal DAGs are often complex beyond human verifiability. Graph summarization is a logical next step, but current methods for general-purpose graph summarization are inadequate for causal DAG summarization. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a causal graph summarization objective that balances graph simplification for better understanding while retaining essential causal information for reliable inference. We develop an efficient greedy algorithm and show that summary causal DAGs can be directly used for inference and are more robust to misspecification of assumptions, enhancing robustness for causal inference. Experimenting with six real-life datasets, we compared our algorithm to three existing solutions, showing its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and its ability to generate summary DAGs that ensure both reliable causal inference and robustness against misspecifications.

### EducationQ: Evaluating LLMs' Teaching Capabilities Through Multi-Agent   Dialogue Framework
**Authors**: Yao Shi, Rongkeng Liang, Yong Xu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:48:20Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as educational tools, yet evaluating their teaching capabilities remains challenging due to the resource-intensive, context-dependent, and methodologically complex nature of teacher-student interactions. We introduce EducationQ, a multi-agent dialogue framework that efficiently assesses teaching capabilities through simulated dynamic educational scenarios, featuring specialized agents for teaching, learning, and evaluation. Testing 14 LLMs across major AI Organizations (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic, and others) on 1,498 questions spanning 13 disciplines and 10 difficulty levels reveals that teaching effectiveness does not correlate linearly with model scale or general reasoning capabilities - with some smaller open-source models outperforming larger commercial counterparts in teaching contexts. This finding highlights a critical gap in current evaluations that prioritize knowledge recall over interactive pedagogy. Our mixed-methods evaluation, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis and expert case studies, identifies distinct pedagogical strengths employed by top-performing models (e.g., sophisticated questioning strategies, adaptive feedback mechanisms). Human expert evaluations show 78% agreement with our automated qualitative analysis of effective teaching behaviors, validating our methodology. EducationQ demonstrates that LLMs-as-teachers require specialized optimization beyond simple scaling, suggesting next-generation educational AI prioritize targeted enhancement of specific pedagogical effectiveness.

### GenCLIP: Generalizing CLIP Prompts for Zero-shot Anomaly Detection
**Authors**: Donghyeong Kim, Chaewon Park, Suhwan Cho, Hyeonjeong Lim, Minseok Kang, Jungho Lee, Sangyoun Lee

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:38:25Z

**Summary**: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) aims to identify anomalies in unseen categories by leveraging CLIP's zero-shot capabilities to match text prompts with visual features. A key challenge in ZSAD is learning general prompts stably and utilizing them effectively, while maintaining both generalizability and category specificity. Although general prompts have been explored in prior works, achieving their stable optimization and effective deployment remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose GenCLIP, a novel framework that learns and leverages general prompts more effectively through multi-layer prompting and dual-branch inference. Multi-layer prompting integrates category-specific visual cues from different CLIP layers, enriching general prompts with more comprehensive and robust feature representations. By combining general prompts with multi-layer visual features, our method further enhances its generalization capability. To balance specificity and generalization, we introduce a dual-branch inference strategy, where a vision-enhanced branch captures fine-grained category-specific features, while a query-only branch prioritizes generalization. The complementary outputs from both branches improve the stability and reliability of anomaly detection across unseen categories. Additionally, we propose an adaptive text prompt filtering mechanism, which removes irrelevant or atypical class names not encountered during CLIP's training, ensuring that only meaningful textual inputs contribute to the final vision-language alignment.

### POLYRAG: Integrating Polyviews into Retrieval-Augmented Generation for   Medical Applications
**Authors**: Chunjing Gan, Dan Yang, Binbin Hu, Ziqi Liu, Yue Shen, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jian Wang, Jun Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:35:24Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have become a disruptive force in the industry, introducing unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing, logical reasoning and so on. However, the challenges of knowledge updates and hallucination issues have limited the application of LLMs in medical scenarios, where retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can offer significant assistance. Nevertheless, existing retrieve-then-read approaches generally digest the retrieved documents, without considering the timeliness, authoritativeness and commonality of retrieval. We argue that these approaches can be suboptimal, especially in real-world applications where information from different sources might conflict with each other and even information from the same source in different time scale might be different, and totally relying on this would deteriorate the performance of RAG approaches. We propose PolyRAG that carefully incorporate judges from different perspectives and finally integrate the polyviews for retrieval augmented generation in medical applications. Due to the scarcity of real-world benchmarks for evaluation, to bridge the gap we propose PolyEVAL, a benchmark consists of queries and documents collected from real-world medical scenarios (including medical policy, hospital & doctor inquiry and healthcare) with multiple tagging (e.g., timeliness, authoritativeness) on them. Extensive experiments and analysis on PolyEVAL have demonstrated the superiority of PolyRAG.

### StableQuant: Layer Adaptive Post-Training Quantization for Speech   Foundation Models
**Authors**: Yeona Hong, Hyewon Han, Woo-jin Chung, Hong-Goo Kang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:33:27Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we propose StableQuant, a novel adaptive post-training quantization (PTQ) algorithm for widely used speech foundation models (SFMs). While PTQ has been successfully employed for compressing large language models (LLMs) due to its ability to bypass additional fine-tuning, directly applying these techniques to SFMs may not yield optimal results, as SFMs utilize distinct network architecture for feature extraction. StableQuant demonstrates optimal quantization performance regardless of the network architecture type, as it adaptively determines the quantization range for each layer by analyzing both the scale distributions and overall performance. We evaluate our algorithm on two SFMs, HuBERT and wav2vec2.0, for an automatic speech recognition (ASR) task, and achieve superior performance compared to traditional PTQ methods. StableQuant successfully reduces the sizes of SFM models to a quarter and doubles the inference speed while limiting the word error rate (WER) performance drop to less than 0.3% with 8-bit quantization.

### A Strategic Coordination Framework of Small LLMs Matches Large LLMs in   Data Synthesis
**Authors**: Xin Gao, Qizhi Pei, Zinan Tang, Yu Li, Honglin Lin, Jiang Wu, Lijun Wu, Conghui He

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:29:28Z

**Summary**: While data synthesis and distillation are promising strategies to enhance small language models, current approaches heavily rely on Large Language Models (LLMs), which suffer from high computational costs, environmental inefficiency, and potential biases inherited from monolithic architectures. In contrast, smaller LLMs are more accessible and sustainable, but their individual capabilities often fall short in generating high-quality, diverse, and reliable data. Inspired by collaborative human processes (e.g., peer review), we propose a multiple small LLMs involved framework, GRA, that aggregates specialized roles across small LLMs to iterative refinement and quality control typically achieved by a single large LLM. In this collaborative framework, multiple small LLMs assume distinct roles-Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator-to simulate a peer-review-inspired data synthesis pipeline. The Generator proposes initial data samples, the Reviewer critiques their quality and diversity, and the Adjudicator resolves conflicts to finalize the output. By decomposing the synthesis process into specialized sub-tasks, collaborative small LLMs can achieve data-level parity with large LLM-based distillation. Through experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that GRA-produced data matches or exceeds the quality of single large LLM outputs, e.g., Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct. Our results challenge the necessity of monolithic large models for high-quality data synthesis, advocating instead for strategic coordination of smaller agents. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/GX-XinGao/GRA.

### Estimation and inference in error-in-operator model
**Authors**: Vladimir Spokoiny

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:27:30Z

**Summary**: Many statistical problems can be reduced to a linear inverse problem in which only a noisy version of the operator is available. Particular examples include random design regression, deconvolution problem, instrumental variable regression, functional data analysis, error-in-variable regression, drift estimation in stochastic diffusion, and many others. The pragmatic plug-in approach can be well justified in the classical asymptotic setup with a growing sample size. However, recent developments in high dimensional inference reveal some new features of this problem. In high dimensional linear regression with a random design, the plug-in approach is questionable but the use of a simple ridge penalization yields a benign overfitting phenomenon; see \cite{baLoLu2020}, \cite{ChMo2022}, \cite{NoPuSp2024}. This paper revisits the general Error-in-Operator problem for finite samples and high dimension of the source and image spaces. A particular focus is on the choice of a proper regularization. We show that a simple ridge penalty (Tikhonov regularization) works properly in the case when the operator is more regular than the signal. In the opposite case, some model reduction technique like spectral truncation should be applied.

### MCGMark: An Encodable and Robust Online Watermark for Tracing   LLM-Generated Malicious Code
**Authors**: Kaiwen Ning, Jiachi Chen, Qingyuan Zhong, Tao Zhang, Yanlin Wang, Wei Li, Jingwen Zhang, Jianxing Yu, Yuming Feng, Weizhe Zhang, Zibin Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:25:13Z

**Summary**: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), numerous software service providers (SSPs) are dedicated to developing LLMs customized for code generation tasks, such as CodeLlama and Copilot. However, these LLMs can be leveraged by attackers to create malicious software, which may pose potential threats to the software ecosystem. For example, they can automate the creation of advanced phishing malware. To address this issue, we first conduct an empirical study and design a prompt dataset, MCGTest, which involves approximately 400 person-hours of work and consists of 406 malicious code generation tasks. Utilizing this dataset, we propose MCGMark, the first robust, code structure-aware, and encodable watermarking approach to trace LLM-generated code. We embed encodable information by controlling the token selection and ensuring the output quality based on probabilistic outliers. Additionally, we enhance the robustness of the watermark by considering the structural features of malicious code, preventing the embedding of the watermark in easily modified positions, such as comments. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of MCGMark on the DeepSeek-Coder. MCGMark achieves an embedding success rate of 88.9% within a maximum output limit of 400 tokens. Furthermore, it also demonstrates strong robustness and has minimal impact on the quality of the output code. Our approach assists SSPs in tracing and holding responsible parties accountable for malicious code generated by LLMs.

### CRAVE: A Conflicting Reasoning Approach for Explainable Claim   Verification Using LLMs
**Authors**: Yingming Zheng, Xiaoliang Liu, Peng Wu, Li Pan

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:20:31Z

**Summary**: The rapid spread of misinformation, driven by digital media and AI-generated content, has made automatic claim verification essential. Traditional methods, which depend on expert-annotated evidence, are labor-intensive and not scalable. Although recent automated systems have improved, they still struggle with complex claims that require nuanced reasoning. To address this, we propose CRAVE, a Conflicting Reasoning Approach for explainable claim VErification, that verify the complex claims based on the conflicting rationales reasoned by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, CRAVE introduces a three-module framework. Ambiguity Elimination enchanced Evidence Retrieval module performs ambiguity elimination and entity-based search to gather relevant evidence related to claim verification from external sources like Wikipedia. Conflicting Perspective Reasoning and Preliminary Judgment module with LLMs adopts LLMs to reason rationales with conflicting stances about claim verification from retrieved evidence across four dimensions, i.e., direct evidence, semantic relationships, linguistic patterns, and logical reasoning and make a preliminary judgment. Finally, Small Language Model (SLM) based Judge module is fine-tuned to make use of preliminary judgment from LLMs to assess the confidence of the conflicting rationales and make a final authenticity judgment. This methodology allows CRAVE to capture subtle inconsistencies in complex claims, improving both the accuracy and transparency of claim verification. Extensive experiments on two public claim verification datasets demonstrate that our CRAVE model achieves much better performance than state-of-the-art methods and exhibits a superior capacity for finding relevant evidence and explaining the model predictions. The code is provided at https://github.com/8zym/CRAVE.

### A Survey on Speech Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jing Peng, Yucheng Wang, Yu Xi, Xu Li, Xizhuo Zhang, Kai Yu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:17:53Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong contextual understanding and remarkable multitask performance. As a result, researchers have been actively exploring the integration of LLMs into the domain of speech understanding, with a primary focus on a broad range of speech-to-text tasks. These include automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech-to-text translation (ST), speech emotion recognition (SER), and others. We refer to such models as Speech LLMs, which are typically built on a unified architecture that follows the pipeline of Audio Feature Extraction -> Multimodal Information Fusion -> LLM Inference. This approach enables richer audio feature extraction while facilitating end-to-end fusion of audio and text modalities, thereby achieving deeper understanding and reasoning from audio data. This paper elucidates the development of Speech LLMs, offering an in-depth analysis of system architectures. Through extensive research and a series of targeted experiments, the paper assesses the advancements in Speech LLMs and their potential for cross-task integration within the speech understanding field. Furthermore, it highlights key challenges identified through experimentation, such as the dormancy of LLMs under certain conditions. The paper further explores training strategies for Speech LLMs, proposes potential solutions based on these findings, and offers valuable insights and references for future research.

### Uni3C: Unifying Precisely 3D-Enhanced Camera and Human Motion Controls   for Video Generation
**Authors**: Chenjie Cao, Jingkai Zhou, Shikai Li, Jingyun Liang, Chaohui Yu, Fan Wang, Xiangyang Xue, Yanwei Fu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:10:41Z

**Summary**: Camera and human motion controls have been extensively studied for video generation, but existing approaches typically address them separately, suffering from limited data with high-quality annotations for both aspects. To overcome this, we present Uni3C, a unified 3D-enhanced framework for precise control of both camera and human motion in video generation. Uni3C includes two key contributions. First, we propose a plug-and-play control module trained with a frozen video generative backbone, PCDController, which utilizes unprojected point clouds from monocular depth to achieve accurate camera control. By leveraging the strong 3D priors of point clouds and the powerful capacities of video foundational models, PCDController shows impressive generalization, performing well regardless of whether the inference backbone is frozen or fine-tuned. This flexibility enables different modules of Uni3C to be trained in specific domains, i.e., either camera control or human motion control, reducing the dependency on jointly annotated data. Second, we propose a jointly aligned 3D world guidance for the inference phase that seamlessly integrates both scenic point clouds and SMPL-X characters to unify the control signals for camera and human motion, respectively. Extensive experiments confirm that PCDController enjoys strong robustness in driving camera motion for fine-tuned backbones of video generation. Uni3C substantially outperforms competitors in both camera controllability and human motion quality. Additionally, we collect tailored validation sets featuring challenging camera movements and human actions to validate the effectiveness of our method.

### Expected Free Energy-based Planning as Variational Inference

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:09:05Z

**Summary**: We address the problem of planning under uncertainty, where an agent must choose actions that not only achieve desired outcomes but also reduce uncertainty. Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as separate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, offers such a foundation by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility with epistemic drives like ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However, the computational burden of EFE minimization has remained a major obstacle to its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle, by casting planning itself as variational inference. Our formulation yields optimal policies that jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable, resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.

### Fine-tuning a Large Language Model for Automating Computational Fluid   Dynamics Simulations
**Authors**: Zhehao Dong, Zhen Lu, Yue Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:04:57Z

**Summary**: Configuring computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations typically demands extensive domain expertise, limiting broader access. Although large language models (LLMs) have advanced scientific computing, their use in automating CFD workflows is underdeveloped. We introduce a novel approach centered on domain-specific LLM adaptation. By fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on NL2FOAM, our custom dataset of 28716 natural language-to-OpenFOAM configuration pairs with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, we enable direct translation from natural language descriptions to executable CFD setups. A multi-agent framework orchestrates the process, autonomously verifying inputs, generating configurations, running simulations, and correcting errors. Evaluation on a benchmark of 21 diverse flow cases demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 88.7% solution accuracy and 82.6% first-attempt success rate. This significantly outperforms larger general-purpose models like Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1, and Llama3.3-70B-Instruct, while also requiring fewer correction iterations and maintaining high computational efficiency. The results highlight the critical role of domain-specific adaptation in deploying LLM assistants for complex engineering workflows. Our code and fine-tuned model have been deposited at https://github.com/YYgroup/AutoCFD.

### Hardware-based Heterogeneous Memory Management for Large Language Model   Inference
**Authors**: Soojin Hwang, Jungwoo Kim, Sanghyeon Lee, Hongbeen Kim, Jaehyuk Huh

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T06:45:41Z

**Summary**: A large language model (LLM) is one of the most important emerging machine learning applications nowadays. However, due to its huge model size and runtime increase of the memory footprint, LLM inferences suffer from the lack of memory capacity in conventional systems consisting of multiple GPUs with a modest amount of high bandwidth memory. Moreover, since LLM contains many bandwidthintensive kernels, only focusing on the memory capacity without considering the bandwidth incurs a serious performance degradation. To handle such conflicting memory capacity and bandwidth demands in a cost-effective way, this study investigates the potential of heterogeneous memory systems, proposing H2M2. It uses an asymmetric memory architecture consisting of capacity-centric and bandwidthcentric memory with computation units attached to each memory device. With the asymmetric memory, we first analyze the effect of kernel-memory mapping for the asymmetric memory. Second, we propose a dynamic runtime algorithm that finds a mapping solution considering the characteristics of LLM operations and the change of footprint during LLM inference. Third, we advocate the need for memory abstraction for the efficient management of the asymmetric memory. H2M2 outperforms the conventional homogeneous memory system with LPDDR by 1.46x, 1.55x, and 2.94x speedup in GPT3-175B, Chinchilla-70B, and Llama2-70B, respectively.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation Evaluation in the Era of Large Language   Models: A Comprehensive Survey
**Authors**: Aoran Gan, Hao Yu, Kai Zhang, Qi Liu, Wenyu Yan, Zhenya Huang, Shiwei Tong, Guoping Hu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T06:39:47Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have revolutionized natural language processing by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with external information retrieval, enabling accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable text generation across diverse applications. However, evaluating RAG systems presents unique challenges due to their hybrid architecture that combines retrieval and generation components, as well as their dependence on dynamic knowledge sources in the LLM era. In response, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of RAG evaluation methods and frameworks, systematically reviewing traditional and emerging evaluation approaches, for system performance, factual accuracy, safety, and computational efficiency in the LLM era. We also compile and categorize the RAG-specific datasets and evaluation frameworks, conducting a meta-analysis of evaluation practices in high-impact RAG research. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most comprehensive survey for RAG evaluation, bridging traditional and LLM-driven methods, and serves as a critical resource for advancing RAG development.

### Natural Fingerprints of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Teppei Suzuki, Ryokan Ri, Sho Takase

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T05:48:52Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit biases -- systematic deviations from expected norms -- in their outputs. These range from overt issues, such as unfair responses, to subtler patterns that can reveal which model produced them. We investigate the factors that give rise to identifiable characteristics in LLMs. Since LLMs model training data distribution, it is reasonable that differences in training data naturally lead to the characteristics. However, our findings reveal that even when LLMs are trained on the exact same data, it is still possible to distinguish the source model based on its generated text. We refer to these unintended, distinctive characteristics as natural fingerprints. By systematically controlling training conditions, we show that the natural fingerprints can emerge from subtle differences in the training process, such as parameter sizes, optimization settings, and even random seeds. We believe that understanding natural fingerprints offers new insights into the origins of unintended bias and ways for improving control over LLM behavior.

### OTC: Optimal Tool Calls via Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Hongru Wang, Cheng Qian, Wanjun Zhong, Xiusi Chen, Jiahao Qiu, Shijue Huang, Bowen Jin, Mengdi Wang, Kam-Fai Wong, Heng Ji

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T05:40:05Z

**Summary**: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) augments large language models (LLMs) with the ability to invoke external tools, such as search engines and code interpreters, to solve tasks beyond the capabilities of language-only reasoning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in improving TIR by optimizing final answer correctness, existing approaches often overlook the efficiency and cost associated with tool usage. This can lead to suboptimal behavior, including excessive tool calls that increase computational and financial overhead, or insufficient tool use that compromises answer quality. In this work, we propose Optimal Tool Call-controlled Policy Optimization (OTC-PO), a simple yet effective RL-based framework that encourages models to produce accurate answers with minimal tool calls. Our method introduces a tool-integrated reward that jointly considers correctness and tool efficiency, promoting high tool productivity. We instantiate this framework within both Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO), resulting in OTC-PPO and OTC-GRPO. Experiments with Qwen-2.5 and Qwen-Math across multiple QA benchmarks show that our approach reduces tool calls by up to 73.1\% and improves tool productivity by up to 229.4\%, while maintaining comparable answer accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based framework that explicitly optimizes tool-use efficiency in TIR.

**Authors**: Qiang Yi, Yangfan He, Jianhui Wang, Xinyuan Song, Shiyao Qian, Xinhang Yuan, Miao Zhang, Li Sun, Keqin Li, Kuan Lu, Menghao Huo, Jiaqi Chen, Tianyu Shi

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T05:40:00Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate creative and engaging narratives from user-specified input, but maintaining coherence and emotional depth throughout these AI-generated stories remains a challenge. In this work, we propose SCORE, a framework for Story Coherence and Retrieval Enhancement, designed to detect and resolve narrative inconsistencies. By tracking key item statuses and generating episode summaries, SCORE uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, incorporating TF-IDF and cosine similarity to identify related episodes and enhance the overall story structure. Results from testing multiple LLM-generated stories demonstrate that SCORE significantly improves the consistency and stability of narrative coherence compared to baseline GPT models, providing a more robust method for evaluating and refining AI-generated narratives.

### Adapting Multilingual LLMs to Low-Resource Languages using Continued   Pre-training and Synthetic Corpus
**Authors**: Raviraj Joshi, Kanishk Singla, Anusha Kamath, Raunak Kalani, Rakesh Paul, Utkarsh Vaidya, Sanjay Singh Chauhan, Niranjan Wartikar, Eileen Long

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T05:29:01Z

**Summary**: Multilingual LLMs support a variety of languages; however, their performance is suboptimal for low-resource languages. In this work, we emphasize the importance of continued pre-training of multilingual LLMs and the use of translation-based synthetic pre-training corpora for improving LLMs in low-resource languages. We conduct our study in the context of the low-resource Indic language Hindi. We introduce Nemotron-Mini-Hindi 4B, a bilingual SLM supporting both Hindi and English, based on Nemotron-Mini 4B. The model is trained using a mix of real and synthetic Hindi + English tokens, with continuous pre-training performed on 400B tokens. We demonstrate that both the base and instruct models achieve state-of-the-art results on Hindi benchmarks while remaining competitive on English tasks. Additionally, we observe that the continued pre-training approach enhances the model's overall factual accuracy. We perform an ablation study to highlight the impact of Hindi pre-training, showing significant improvements in Hindi chat capabilities and factual accuracy, which cannot be achieved through Hindi alignment alone.

### GainSight: Application-Guided Profiling for Composing Heterogeneous   On-Chip Memories in AI Hardware Accelerators
**Authors**: Peijing Li, Matthew Hung, Yiming Tan, Konstantin Hoßfeld, Jake Jiajun Cheng, Shuhan Liu, Lixian Yan, Xinxin Wang, H. -S. Philip Wong, Thierry Tambe

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T05:27:33Z

**Summary**: As AI workloads drive soaring memory requirements, there is a need for higher-density on-chip memory for domain-specific accelerators that goes beyond what current SRAM technology can provide. We motivate that algorithms and application behavior should guide the composition of heterogeneous on-chip memories. However, there has been little work in factoring dynamic application profiles into such design decisions. We present GainSight, a profiling framework that analyzes fine-grained memory access patterns and computes data lifetimes in domain-specific accelerators. By combining instrumentation and simulation across retargetable hardware backends, GainSight aligns heterogeneous memory designs with workload-specific traffic and lifetime metrics. Case studies on MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads using NVIDIA H100 GPUs and systolic arrays reveal key insights: (1) 40% of L1 and 18% of L2 GPU cache accesses, and 79% of systolic array scratchpad accesses across profiled workloads are short-lived and suitable for silicon-based gain cell RAM (Si-GCRAM); (2) Si-GCRAM reduces active energy by 11-28% compared to SRAM; (3) Up to 90% of GPU cache fetches are never reused, highlighting inefficiencies in terms of cache pollution. These insights that GainSight provides can be used to better understand the design spaces of both emerging on-chip memories and software algorithmic optimizations for the next generation of AI accelerators.

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T05:22:55Z

**Summary**: Usability testing is a fundamental research method that user experience (UX) researchers use to evaluate and iterate a web design, but\textbf{ how to evaluate and iterate the usability testing study design } itself? Recent advances in Large Language Model-simulated Agent (\textbf{LLM Agent}) research inspired us to design \textbf{UXAgent} to support UX researchers in evaluating and reiterating their usability testing study design before they conduct the real human-subject study. Our system features a Persona Generator module, an LLM Agent module, and a Universal Browser Connector module to automatically generate thousands of simulated users to interactively test the target website. The system also provides an Agent Interview Interface and a Video Replay Interface so that the UX researchers can easily review and analyze the generated qualitative and quantitative log data. Through a heuristic evaluation, five UX researcher participants praised the innovation of our system but also expressed concerns about the future of LLM Agent usage in UX studies.

 ### StyleMe3D: Stylization with Disentangled Priors by Multiple Encoders on   3D Gaussians
**Authors**: Cailin Zhuang, Yaoqi Hu, Xuanyang Zhang, Wei Cheng, Jiacheng Bao, Shengqi Liu, Yiying Yang, Xianfang Zeng, Gang Yu, Ming Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:59:55Z

**Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in photorealistic scene reconstruction but struggles with stylized scenarios (e.g., cartoons, games) due to fragmented textures, semantic misalignment, and limited adaptability to abstract aesthetics. We propose StyleMe3D, a holistic framework for 3D GS style transfer that integrates multi-modal style conditioning, multi-level semantic alignment, and perceptual quality enhancement. Our key insights include: (1) optimizing only RGB attributes preserves geometric integrity during stylization; (2) disentangling low-, medium-, and high-level semantics is critical for coherent style transfer; (3) scalability across isolated objects and complex scenes is essential for practical deployment. StyleMe3D introduces four novel components: Dynamic Style Score Distillation (DSSD), leveraging Stable Diffusion's latent space for semantic alignment; Contrastive Style Descriptor (CSD) for localized, content-aware texture transfer; Simultaneously Optimized Scale (SOS) to decouple style details and structural coherence; and 3D Gaussian Quality Assessment (3DG-QA), a differentiable aesthetic prior trained on human-rated data to suppress artifacts and enhance visual harmony. Evaluated on NeRF synthetic dataset (objects) and tandt db (scenes) datasets, StyleMe3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving geometric details (e.g., carvings on sculptures) and ensuring stylistic consistency across scenes (e.g., coherent lighting in landscapes), while maintaining real-time rendering. This work bridges photorealistic 3D GS and artistic stylization, unlocking applications in gaming, virtual worlds, and digital art.

### Stop Summation: Min-Form Credit Assignment Is All Process Reward Model   Needs for Reasoning
**Authors**: Jie Cheng, Ruixi Qiao, Lijun Li, Chao Guo, Junle Wang, Gang Xiong, Yisheng Lv, Fei-Yue Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:59:02Z

**Summary**: Process reward models (PRMs) have proven effective for test-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. However, reward hacking issues with PRMs limit their successful application in reinforcement fine-tuning. In this paper, we identify the main cause of PRM-induced reward hacking: the canonical summation-form credit assignment in reinforcement learning (RL), which defines the value as cumulative gamma-decayed future rewards, easily induces LLMs to hack steps with high rewards. To address this, we propose PURE: Process sUpervised Reinforcement lEarning. The key innovation of PURE is a min-form credit assignment that formulates the value function as the minimum of future rewards. This method significantly alleviates reward hacking by limiting the value function range and distributing advantages more reasonably. Through extensive experiments on 3 base models, we show that PRM-based approaches enabling min-form credit assignment achieve comparable reasoning performance to verifiable reward-based methods within only 30% steps. In contrast, the canonical sum-form credit assignment collapses training even at the beginning! Additionally, when we supplement PRM-based fine-tuning with just 10% verifiable rewards, we further alleviate reward hacking and produce the best fine-tuned model based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B in our experiments, achieving 82.5% accuracy on AMC23 and 53.3% average accuracy across 5 benchmarks. Moreover, we summarize the observed reward hacking cases and analyze the causes of training collapse. Code and models are available at https://github.com/CJReinforce/PURE.

### Causal-Copilot: An Autonomous Causal Analysis Agent
**Authors**: Xinyue Wang, Kun Zhou, Wenyi Wu, Har Simrat Singh, Fang Nan, Songyao Jin, Aryan Philip, Saloni Patnaik, Hou Zhu, Shivam Singh, Parjanya Prashant, Qian Shen, Biwei Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:58:08Z

**Summary**: Causal analysis plays a foundational role in scientific discovery and reliable decision-making, yet it remains largely inaccessible to domain experts due to its conceptual and algorithmic complexity. This disconnect between causal methodology and practical usability presents a dual challenge: domain experts are unable to leverage recent advances in causal learning, while causal researchers lack broad, real-world deployment to test and refine their methods. To address this, we introduce Causal-Copilot, an autonomous agent that operationalizes expert-level causal analysis within a large language model framework. Causal-Copilot automates the full pipeline of causal analysis for both tabular and time-series data -- including causal discovery, causal inference, algorithm selection, hyperparameter optimization, result interpretation, and generation of actionable insights. It supports interactive refinement through natural language, lowering the barrier for non-specialists while preserving methodological rigor. By integrating over 20 state-of-the-art causal analysis techniques, our system fosters a virtuous cycle -- expanding access to advanced causal methods for domain experts while generating rich, real-world applications that inform and advance causal theory. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Causal-Copilot achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines, offering a reliable, scalable, and extensible solution that bridges the gap between theoretical sophistication and real-world applicability in causal analysis. A live interactive demo of Causal-Copilot is available at https://causalcopilot.com/.

### Interpretable Locomotion Prediction in Construction Using a   Memory-Driven LLM Agent With Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
**Authors**: Ehsan Ahmadi, Chao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:45:21Z

**Summary**: Construction tasks are inherently unpredictable, with dynamic environments and safety-critical demands posing significant risks to workers. Exoskeletons offer potential assistance but falter without accurate intent recognition across diverse locomotion modes. This paper presents a locomotion prediction agent leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with memory systems, aimed at improving exoskeleton assistance in such settings. Using multimodal inputs - spoken commands and visual data from smart glasses - the agent integrates a Perception Module, Short-Term Memory (STM), Long-Term Memory (LTM), and Refinement Module to predict locomotion modes effectively. Evaluation reveals a baseline weighted F1-score of 0.73 without memory, rising to 0.81 with STM, and reaching 0.90 with both STM and LTM, excelling with vague and safety-critical commands. Calibration metrics, including a Brier Score drop from 0.244 to 0.090 and ECE from 0.222 to 0.044, affirm improved reliability. This framework supports safer, high-level human-exoskeleton collaboration, with promise for adaptive assistive systems in dynamic industries.

### ASIDE: Architectural Separation of Instructions and Data in Language   Models
**Authors**: Egor Zverev, Evgenii Kortukov, Alexander Panfilov, Alexandra Volkova, Soroush Tabesh, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Wojciech Samek, Christoph H. Lampert

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:45:08Z

**Summary**: Despite their remarkable performance, large language models lack elementary safety features, and this makes them susceptible to numerous malicious attacks. In particular, previous work has identified the absence of an intrinsic separation between instructions and data as a root cause for the success of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a method, ASIDE, that allows the model to clearly separate between instructions and data on the level of embeddings. ASIDE applies a fixed orthogonal rotation to the embeddings of data tokens, thus creating distinct representations of instructions and data tokens without introducing any additional parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by instruct-tuning LLMs with ASIDE and showing (1) highly increased instruction-data separation scores without a loss in model capabilities and (2) competitive results on prompt injection benchmarks, even without dedicated safety training. Additionally, we study the working mechanism behind our method through an analysis of model representations.

### Impulsive pattern recognition of a myoelectric hand via Dynamic Time   Warping
**Authors**: Mustafa Can Kadilar, Ersin Toptaş, Gazi Akgün

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:35:12Z

**Summary**: Although myoelectric prosthetic hands provide amputees with intuitive control, their reliance on many EMG sensors limits accessibility and makes them complex and expensive. To address this problem, this work presents a different perspective that makes use of a single EMG sensor and brief impulse signals in conjunction with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for accurate pattern detection. Conventional techniques rely on real-time data from multiple sensors, which can be costly and bulky. The method presents high accuracy while lowering hardware complexity and expense. A DTW-based system that reliably identifies muscle activation patterns from short EMG signals was created and tested. Results show that this single-sensor approach obtained an accuracy rate of 92%, which is similar to that of conventional multi-sensor systems. This research provides a more straightforward and economical approach that can be used to obtain enhanced myoelectric control. These findings provide a different perspective on more easily accessible and user-friendly prosthetic devices, which will be especially helpful in disaster-affected areas where quick deployment is essential. Future improvements would investigate this system's dependability over time and wider implementations in real situations, to take prosthetic technology one step further.

### CRUST-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for C-to-safe-Rust Transpilation
**Authors**: Anirudh Khatry, Robert Zhang, Jia Pan, Ziteng Wang, Qiaochu Chen, Greg Durrett, Isil Dillig

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:33:33Z

**Summary**: C-to-Rust transpilation is essential for modernizing legacy C code while enhancing safety and interoperability with modern Rust ecosystems. However, no dataset currently exists for evaluating whether a system can transpile C into safe Rust that passes a set of test cases. We introduce CRUST-Bench, a dataset of 100 C repositories, each paired with manually-written interfaces in safe Rust as well as test cases that can be used to validate correctness of the transpilation. By considering entire repositories rather than isolated functions, CRUST-Bench captures the challenges of translating complex projects with dependencies across multiple files. The provided Rust interfaces provide explicit specifications that ensure adherence to idiomatic, memory-safe Rust patterns, while the accompanying test cases enforce functional correctness. We evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on this task and find that safe and idiomatic Rust generation is still a challenging problem for various state-of-the-art methods and techniques. We also provide insights into the errors LLMs usually make in transpiling code from C to safe Rust. The best performing model, OpenAI o1, is able to solve only 15 tasks in a single-shot setting. Improvements on CRUST-Bench would lead to improved transpilation systems that can reason about complex scenarios and help in migrating legacy codebases from C into languages like Rust that ensure memory safety. You can find the dataset and code at https://github.com/anirudhkhatry/CRUST-bench.

### Evaluating Judges as Evaluators: The JETTS Benchmark of LLM-as-Judges as   Test-Time Scaling Evaluators
**Authors**: Yilun Zhou, Austin Xu, Peifeng Wang, Caiming Xiong, Shafiq Joty

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:33:23Z

**Summary**: Scaling test-time computation, or affording a generator large language model (LLM) extra compute during inference, typically employs the help of external non-generative evaluators (i.e., reward models). Concurrently, LLM-judges, models trained to generate evaluations and critiques (explanations) in natural language, are becoming increasingly popular in automatic evaluation. Despite judge empirical successes, their effectiveness as evaluators in test-time scaling settings is largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce the Judge Evaluation for Test-Time Scaling (JETTS) benchmark, which evaluates judge performance in three domains (math reasoning, code generation, and instruction following) under three task settings: response reranking, step-level beam search, and critique-based response refinement. We evaluate 10 different judge models (7B-70B parameters) for 8 different base generator models (6.7B-72B parameters). Our benchmark shows that while judges are competitive with outcome reward models in reranking, they are consistently worse than process reward models in beam search procedures. Furthermore, though unique to LLM-judges, their natural language critiques are currently ineffective in guiding the generator towards better responses.

**Summary**: Understanding and monitoring aquatic biodiversity is critical for ecological health and conservation efforts. This paper proposes SuoiAI, an end-to-end pipeline for building a dataset of aquatic invertebrates in Vietnam and employing machine learning (ML) techniques for species classification. We outline the methods for data collection, annotation, and model training, focusing on reducing annotation effort through semi-supervised learning and leveraging state-of-the-art object detection and classification models. Our approach aims to overcome challenges such as data scarcity, fine-grained classification, and deployment in diverse environmental conditions.

### Can LLMs Rank the Harmfulness of Smaller LLMs? We are Not There Yet
**Authors**: Berk Atil, Vipul Gupta, Sarkar Snigdha Sarathi Das, Rebecca J. Passonneau

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:30:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous, thus it is important to understand their risks and limitations. Smaller LLMs can be deployed where compute resources are constrained, such as edge devices, but with different propensity to generate harmful output. Mitigation of LLM harm typically depends on annotating the harmfulness of LLM output, which is expensive to collect from humans. This work studies two questions: How do smaller LLMs rank regarding generation of harmful content? How well can larger LLMs annotate harmfulness? We prompt three small LLMs to elicit harmful content of various types, such as discriminatory language, offensive content, privacy invasion, or negative influence, and collect human rankings of their outputs. Then, we evaluate three state-of-the-art large LLMs on their ability to annotate the harmfulness of these responses. We find that the smaller models differ with respect to harmfulness. We also find that large LLMs show low to moderate agreement with humans. These findings underline the need for further work on harm mitigation in LLMs.

### MR. Guard: Multilingual Reasoning Guardrail using Curriculum Learning
**Authors**: Yahan Yang, Soham Dan, Shuo Li, Dan Roth, Insup Lee

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:15:06Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks such as jailbreaking, which can elicit harmful or unsafe behaviors. This vulnerability is exacerbated in multilingual setting, where multilingual safety-aligned data are often limited. Thus, developing a guardrail capable of detecting and filtering unsafe content across diverse languages is critical for deploying LLMs in real-world applications. In this work, we propose an approach to build a multilingual guardrail with reasoning. Our method consists of: (1) synthetic multilingual data generation incorporating culturally and linguistically nuanced variants, (2) supervised fine-tuning, and (3) a curriculum-guided Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework that further improves performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our multilingual guardrail consistently outperforms recent baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain languages. The multilingual reasoning capability of our guardrail enables it to generate multilingual explanations, which are particularly useful for understanding language-specific risks and ambiguities in multilingual content moderation.

### Values in the Wild: Discovering and Analyzing Values in Real-World   Language Model Interactions
**Authors**: Saffron Huang, Esin Durmus, Miles McCain, Kunal Handa, Alex Tamkin, Jerry Hong, Michael Stern, Arushi Somani, Xiuruo Zhang, Deep Ganguli

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:13:16Z

**Summary**: AI assistants can impart value judgments that shape people's decisions and worldviews, yet little is known empirically about what values these systems rely on in practice. To address this, we develop a bottom-up, privacy-preserving method to extract the values (normative considerations stated or demonstrated in model responses) that Claude 3 and 3.5 models exhibit in hundreds of thousands of real-world interactions. We empirically discover and taxonomize 3,307 AI values and study how they vary by context. We find that Claude expresses many practical and epistemic values, and typically supports prosocial human values while resisting values like "moral nihilism". While some values appear consistently across contexts (e.g. "transparency"), many are more specialized and context-dependent, reflecting the diversity of human interlocutors and their varied contexts. For example, "harm prevention" emerges when Claude resists users, "historical accuracy" when responding to queries about controversial events, "healthy boundaries" when asked for relationship advice, and "human agency" in technology ethics discussions. By providing the first large-scale empirical mapping of AI values in deployment, our work creates a foundation for more grounded evaluation and design of values in AI systems.

**Summary**: We demonstrate that an LLM coding agent, equipped with basic coding tools, can autonomously edit itself, and thereby improve its performance on benchmark tasks. We find performance gains from 17% to 53% on a random subset of SWE Bench Verified, with additional performance gains on LiveCodeBench, as well as synthetically generated agent benchmarks. Our work represents an advancement in the automated and open-ended design of agentic systems, and provides a reference agent framework for those seeking to post-train LLMs on tool use and other agentic tasks.

### My CXL Pool Obviates Your PCIe Switch
**Authors**: Yuhong Zhong, Daniel S. Berger, Pantea Zardoshti, Enrique Saurez, Jacob Nelson, Antonis Psistakis, Joshua Fried, Asaf Cidon

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T16:57:36Z

**Summary**: Pooling PCIe devices across multiple hosts offers a promising solution to mitigate stranded I/O resources, enhance device utilization, address device failures, and reduce total cost of ownership. The only viable option today are PCIe switches, which decouple PCIe devices from hosts by connecting them through a hardware switch. However, the high cost and limited flexibility of PCIe switches hinder their widespread adoption beyond specialized datacenter use cases.   This paper argues that PCIe device pooling can be effectively implemented in software using CXL memory pools. CXL memory pools improve memory utilization and already have positive return on investment. We find that, once CXL pools are in place, they can serve as a building block for pooling any kind of PCIe device. We demonstrate that PCIe devices can directly use CXL memory as I/O buffers without device modifications, which enables routing PCIe traffic through CXL pool memory. This software-based approach is deployable on today's hardware and is more flexible than hardware PCIe switches. In particular, we explore how disaggregating devices such as NICs can transform datacenter infrastructure.

### EvalAgent: Discovering Implicit Evaluation Criteria from the Web
**Authors**: Manya Wadhwa, Zayne Sprague, Chaitanya Malaviya, Philippe Laban, Junyi Jessy Li, Greg Durrett

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T16:43:50Z

**Summary**: Evaluation of language model outputs on structured writing tasks is typically conducted with a number of desirable criteria presented to human evaluators or large language models (LLMs). For instance, on a prompt like "Help me draft an academic talk on coffee intake vs research productivity", a model response may be evaluated for criteria like accuracy and coherence. However, high-quality responses should do more than just satisfy basic task requirements. An effective response to this query should include quintessential features of an academic talk, such as a compelling opening, clear research questions, and a takeaway. To help identify these implicit criteria, we introduce EvalAgent, a novel framework designed to automatically uncover nuanced and task-specific criteria. EvalAgent first mines expert-authored online guidance. It then uses this evidence to propose diverse, long-tail evaluation criteria that are grounded in reliable external sources. Our experiments demonstrate that the grounded criteria produced by EvalAgent are often implicit (not directly stated in the user's prompt), yet specific (high degree of lexical precision). Further, EvalAgent criteria are often not satisfied by initial responses but they are actionable, such that responses can be refined to satisfy them. Finally, we show that combining LLM-generated and EvalAgent criteria uncovers more human-valued criteria than using LLMs alone.

### Potential Societal Biases of ChatGPT in Higher Education: A Scoping   Review
**Authors**: Ming Li, Ariunaa Enkhtur, Beverley Anne Yamamoto, Fei Cheng, Lilan Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T16:33:14Z

**Summary**: Purpose:Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models, such as ChatGPT, may inherit or amplify societal biases due to their training on extensive datasets. With the increasing usage of GAI by students, faculty, and staff in higher education institutions (HEIs), it is urgent to examine the ethical issues and potential biases associated with these technologies. Design/Approach/Methods:This scoping review aims to elucidate how biases related to GAI in HEIs have been researched and discussed in recent academic publications. We categorized the potential societal biases that GAI might cause in the field of higher education. Our review includes articles written in English, Chinese, and Japanese across four main databases, focusing on GAI usage in higher education and bias. Findings:Our findings reveal that while there is meaningful scholarly discussion around bias and discrimination concerning LLMs in the AI field, most articles addressing higher education approach the issue superficially. Few articles identify specific types of bias under different circumstances, and there is a notable lack of empirical research. Most papers in our review focus primarily on educational and research fields related to medicine and engineering, with some addressing English education. However, there is almost no discussion regarding the humanities and social sciences. Additionally, a significant portion of the current discourse is in English and primarily addresses English-speaking contexts. Originality/Value:To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to summarize the potential societal biases in higher education. This review highlights the need for more in-depth studies and empirical work to understand the specific biases that GAI might introduce or amplify in educational settings, guiding the development of more ethical AI applications in higher education.

### Integrating Symbolic Execution into the Fine-Tuning of Code-Generating   LLMs
**Authors**: Marina Sakharova, Abhinav Anand, Mira Mezini

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T16:29:07Z

**Summary**: Code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential tools in modern software development, enhancing productivity and accelerating development. This paper aims to investigate the fine-tuning of code-generating LLMs using Reinforcement Learning and Direct Preference Optimization, further improving their performance. To achieve this, we enhance the training data for the reward model with the help of symbolic execution techniques, ensuring more comprehensive and objective data. With symbolic execution, we create a custom dataset that better captures the nuances in code evaluation. Our reward models, fine-tuned on this dataset, demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline, CodeRL, in estimating the quality of generated code. Our code-generating LLMs, trained with the help of reward model feedback, achieve similar results compared to the CodeRL benchmark.

### Compute-Optimal LLMs Provably Generalize Better With Scale
**Authors**: Marc Finzi, Sanyam Kapoor, Diego Granziol, Anming Gu, Christopher De Sa, J. Zico Kolter, Andrew Gordon Wilson

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T16:26:56Z

**Summary**: Why do larger language models generalize better? To investigate this question, we develop generalization bounds on the pretraining objective of large language models (LLMs) in the compute-optimal regime, as described by the Chinchilla scaling laws. We introduce a novel, fully empirical Freedman-type martingale concentration inequality that tightens existing bounds by accounting for the variance of the loss function. This generalization bound can be decomposed into three interpretable components: the number of parameters per token, the loss variance, and the quantization error at a fixed bitrate. As compute-optimal language models are scaled up, the number of parameters per data point remains constant; however, both the loss variance and the quantization error decrease, implying that larger models should have smaller generalization gaps. We examine why larger models tend to be more quantizable from an information theoretic perspective, showing that the rate at which they can integrate new information grows more slowly than their capacity on the compute-optimal frontier. From these findings we produce a scaling law for the generalization gap, with bounds that become predictably stronger with scale.

### Support Evaluation for the TREC 2024 RAG Track: Comparing Human versus   LLM Judges
**Authors**: Nandan Thakur, Ronak Pradeep, Shivani Upadhyay, Daniel Campos, Nick Craswell, Jimmy Lin

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T16:20:43Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to generate answers with citations from source documents containing "ground truth", thereby reducing system hallucinations. A crucial factor in RAG evaluation is "support", whether the information in the cited documents supports the answer. To this end, we conducted a large-scale comparative study of 45 participant submissions on 36 topics to the TREC 2024 RAG Track, comparing an automatic LLM judge (GPT-4o) against human judges for support assessment. We considered two conditions: (1) fully manual assessments from scratch and (2) manual assessments with post-editing of LLM predictions. Our results indicate that for 56% of the manual from-scratch assessments, human and GPT-4o predictions match perfectly (on a three-level scale), increasing to 72% in the manual with post-editing condition. Furthermore, by carefully analyzing the disagreements in an unbiased study, we found that an independent human judge correlates better with GPT-4o than a human judge, suggesting that LLM judges can be a reliable alternative for support assessment. To conclude, we provide a qualitative analysis of human and GPT-4o errors to help guide future iterations of support assessment.

### Zero-Shot, But at What Cost? Unveiling the Hidden Overhead of MILS's   LLM-CLIP Framework for Image Captioning
**Authors**: Yassir Benhammou, Alessandro Tiberio, Gabriel Trautmann, Suman Kalyan

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T16:16:19Z

**Summary**: MILS (Multimodal Iterative LLM Solver) is a recently published framework that claims "LLMs can see and hear without any training" by leveraging an iterative, LLM-CLIP based approach for zero-shot image captioning. While this MILS approach demonstrates good performance, our investigation reveals that this success comes at a hidden, substantial computational cost due to its expensive multi-step refinement process. In contrast, alternative models such as BLIP-2 and GPT-4V achieve competitive results through a streamlined, single-pass approach. We hypothesize that the significant overhead inherent in MILS's iterative process may undermine its practical benefits, thereby challenging the narrative that zero-shot performance can be attained without incurring heavy resource demands. This work is the first to expose and quantify the trade-offs between output quality and computational cost in MILS, providing critical insights for the design of more efficient multimodal models.

### Synergistic Weak-Strong Collaboration by Aligning Preferences
**Authors**: Yizhu Jiao, Xuchao Zhang, Zhaoyang Wang, Yubo Ma, Zhun Deng, Rujia Wang, Chetan Bansal, Saravan Rajmohan, Jiawei Han, Huaxiu Yao

**Updated**: 2025-04-22T04:22:09Z

**Summary**: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general reasoning yet struggle with specialized tasks requiring proprietary or domain-specific knowledge. Fine-tuning large models for every niche application is often infeasible due to black-box constraints and high computational overhead. To address this, we propose a collaborative framework that pairs a specialized weak model with a general strong model. The weak model, tailored to specific domains, produces initial drafts and background information, while the strong model leverages its advanced reasoning to refine these drafts, extending LLMs' capabilities to critical yet specialized tasks. To optimize this collaboration, we introduce a collaborative feedback to fine-tunes the weak model, which quantifies the influence of the weak model's contributions in the collaboration procedure and establishes preference pairs to guide preference tuning of the weak model. We validate our framework through experiments on three domains. We find that the collaboration significantly outperforms each model alone by leveraging complementary strengths. Moreover, aligning the weak model with the collaborative preference further enhances overall performance.

### Time-Series Analysis on Edge-AI Hardware for Healthcare Monitoring
**Authors**: Jinhai Hu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:40:10Z

**Summary**: This project addresses the need for efficient, real-time analysis of biomedical signals such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and electroencephalograms (EEG) for continuous health monitoring. Traditional methods rely on long-duration data recording followed by offline analysis, which is power-intensive and delays responses to critical symptoms such as arrhythmia. To overcome these limitations, a time-domain ECG analysis model based on a novel dynamically-biased Long Short-Term Memory (DB-LSTM) neural network is proposed. This model supports simultaneous ECG forecasting and classification with high performance-achieving over 98% accuracy and a normalized mean square error below 1e-3 for forecasting, and over 97% accuracy with faster convergence and fewer training parameters for classification. To enable edge deployment, the model is hardware-optimized by quantizing weights to INT4 or INT3 formats, resulting in only a 2% and 6% drop in classification accuracy during training and inference, respectively, while maintaining full accuracy for forecasting. Extensive simulations using multiple ECG datasets confirm the model's robustness. Future work includes implementing the algorithm on FPGA and CMOS circuits for practical cardiac monitoring, as well as developing a digital hardware platform that supports flexible neural network configurations and on-chip online training for personalized healthcare applications.

### Tree of Attributes Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Tong Ding, Wanhua Li, Zhongqi Miao, Hanspeter Pfister

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:37:50Z

**Summary**: Prompt learning has proven effective in adapting vision language models for downstream tasks. However, existing methods usually append learnable prompt tokens solely with the category names to obtain textual features, which fails to fully leverage the rich context indicated in the category name. To address this issue, we propose the Tree of Attributes Prompt learning (TAP), which first instructs LLMs to generate a tree of attributes with a "concept - attribute - description" structure for each category, and then learn the hierarchy with vision and text prompt tokens. Unlike existing methods that merely augment category names with a set of unstructured descriptions, our approach essentially distills structured knowledge graphs associated with class names from LLMs. Furthermore, our approach introduces text and vision prompts designed to explicitly learn the corresponding visual attributes, effectively serving as domain experts. Additionally, the general and diverse descriptions generated based on the class names may be wrong or absent in the specific given images. To address this misalignment, we further introduce a vision-conditional pooling module to extract instance-specific text features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the zero-shot base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, as well as few-shot classification across 11 diverse datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/HHenryD/TAP.

### Inverse Constitutional AI: Compressing Preferences into Principles
**Authors**: Arduin Findeis, Timo Kaufmann, Eyke Hüllermeier, Samuel Albanie, Robert Mullins

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:37:15Z

**Summary**: Feedback data is widely used for fine-tuning and evaluating state-of-the-art AI models. Pairwise text preferences, where human or AI annotators select the "better" of two options, are particularly common. Such preferences are used to train (reward) models or to rank models with aggregate statistics. For many applications it is desirable to understand annotator preferences in addition to modelling them - not least because extensive prior work has shown various unintended biases in preference datasets. Yet, preference datasets remain challenging to interpret. Neither black-box reward models nor statistics can answer why one text is preferred over another. Manual interpretation of the numerous (long) response pairs is usually equally infeasible. In this paper, we introduce the Inverse Constitutional AI (ICAI) problem, formulating the interpretation of pairwise text preference data as a compression task. In constitutional AI, a set of principles (a constitution) is used to provide feedback and fine-tune AI models. ICAI inverts this process: given a feedback dataset, we aim to extract a constitution that best enables a large language model (LLM) to reconstruct the original annotations. We propose a corresponding ICAI algorithm and validate its generated constitutions quantitatively based on annotation reconstruction accuracy on several datasets: (a) synthetic feedback data with known principles; (b) AlpacaEval cross-annotated human feedback data; (c) crowdsourced Chatbot Arena data; and (d) PRISM data from diverse demographic groups. As a short and interpretable representation of the original dataset, generated constitutions have many potential use cases: help identify undesirable annotator biases, understand model performance better, scale feedback to unseen data, or adapt models to individual user or group preferences. We release the source code at https://github.com/rdnfn/icai.

### Understanding LLM Behaviors via Compression: Data Generation, Knowledge   Acquisition and Scaling Laws
**Authors**: Zhixuan Pan, Shaowen Wang, Jian Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:18:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous tasks, yet principled explanations for their underlying mechanisms and several phenomena, such as scaling laws, hallucinations, and related behaviors, remain elusive. In this work, we revisit the classical relationship between compression and prediction, grounded in Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon information theory, to provide deeper insights into LLM behaviors. By leveraging the Kolmogorov Structure Function and interpreting LLM compression as a two-part coding process, we offer a detailed view of how LLMs acquire and store information across increasing model and data scales -- from pervasive syntactic patterns to progressively rarer knowledge elements. Motivated by this theoretical perspective and natural assumptions inspired by Heap's and Zipf's laws, we introduce a simplified yet representative hierarchical data-generation framework called the Syntax-Knowledge model. Under the Bayesian setting, we show that prediction and compression within this model naturally lead to diverse learning and scaling behaviors of LLMs. In particular, our theoretical analysis offers intuitive and principled explanations for both data and model scaling laws, the dynamics of knowledge acquisition during training and fine-tuning, factual knowledge hallucinations in LLMs. The experimental results validate our theoretical predictions.

### LServe: Efficient Long-sequence LLM Serving with Unified Sparse   Attention
**Authors**: Shang Yang, Junxian Guo, Haotian Tang, Qinghao Hu, Guangxuan Xiao, Jiaming Tang, Yujun Lin, Zhijian Liu, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:13:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in processing long sequences and complex reasoning tasks, yet efficiently serving these models remains challenging due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention in the prefilling stage and the large memory footprint of the KV cache in the decoding stage. To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the compatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention. This design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations. Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context and reasoning capabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve.

### Survey of Loss Augmented Knowledge Tracing
**Authors**: Altun Shukurlu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:09:40Z

**Summary**: The training of artificial neural networks is heavily dependent on the careful selection of an appropriate loss function. While commonly used loss functions, such as cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE), generally suffice for a broad range of tasks, challenges often emerge due to limitations in data quality or inefficiencies within the learning process. In such circumstances, the integration of supplementary terms into the loss function can serve to address these challenges, enhancing both model performance and robustness. Two prominent techniques, loss regularization and contrastive learning, have been identified as effective strategies for augmenting the capacity of loss functions in artificial neural networks.   Knowledge tracing is a compelling area of research that leverages predictive artificial intelligence to facilitate the automation of personalized and efficient educational experiences for students. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the deep learning-based knowledge tracing (DKT) algorithms trained using advanced loss functions and discuss their improvements over prior techniques. We discuss contrastive knowledge tracing algorithms, such as Bi-CLKT, CL4KT, SP-CLKT, CoSKT, and prediction-consistent DKT, providing performance benchmarks and insights into real-world deployment challenges. The survey concludes with future research directions, including hybrid loss strategies and context-aware modeling.

### The Synthetic Imputation Approach: Generating Optimal Synthetic Texts   For Underrepresented Categories In Supervised Classification Tasks
**Authors**: Joan C. Timoneda

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:07:26Z

**Summary**: Encoder-decoder Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BERT and RoBERTa, require that all categories in an annotation task be sufficiently represented in the training data for optimal performance. However, it is often difficult to find sufficient examples for all categories in a task when building a high-quality training set. In this article, I describe this problem and propose a solution, the synthetic imputation approach. Leveraging a generative LLM (GPT-4o), this approach generates synthetic texts based on careful prompting and five original examples drawn randomly with replacement from the sample. This approach ensures that new synthetic texts are sufficiently different from the original texts to reduce overfitting, but retain the underlying substantive meaning of the examples to maximize out-of-sample performance. With 75 original examples or more, synthetic imputation's performance is on par with a full sample of original texts, and overfitting remains low, predictable and correctable with 50 original samples. The synthetic imputation approach provides a novel role for generative LLMs in research and allows applied researchers to balance their datasets for best performance.

### CTINexus: Automatic Cyber Threat Intelligence Knowledge Graph   Construction Using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yutong Cheng, Osama Bajaber, Saimon Amanuel Tsegai, Dawn Song, Peng Gao

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T14:37:40Z

**Summary**: Textual descriptions in cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports, such as security articles and news, are rich sources of knowledge about cyber threats, crucial for organizations to stay informed about the rapidly evolving threat landscape. However, current CTI knowledge extraction methods lack flexibility and generalizability, often resulting in inaccurate and incomplete knowledge extraction. Syntax parsing relies on fixed rules and dictionaries, while model fine-tuning requires large annotated datasets, making both paradigms challenging to adapt to new threats and ontologies. To bridge the gap, we propose CTINexus, a novel framework leveraging optimized in-context learning (ICL) of large language models (LLMs) for data-efficient CTI knowledge extraction and high-quality cybersecurity knowledge graph (CSKG) construction. Unlike existing methods, CTINexus requires neither extensive data nor parameter tuning and can adapt to various ontologies with minimal annotated examples. This is achieved through: (1) a carefully designed automatic prompt construction strategy with optimal demonstration retrieval for extracting a wide range of cybersecurity entities and relations; (2) a hierarchical entity alignment technique that canonicalizes the extracted knowledge and removes redundancy; (3) an long-distance relation prediction technique to further complete the CSKG with missing links. Our extensive evaluations using 150 real-world CTI reports collected from 10 platforms demonstrate that CTINexus significantly outperforms existing methods in constructing accurate and complete CSKG, highlighting its potential to transform CTI analysis with an efficient and adaptable solution for the dynamic threat landscape.

### FROG: Effective Friend Recommendation in Online Games via Modality-aware   User Preferences
**Authors**: Qiwei Wang, Dandan Lin, Wenqing Lin, Ziming Wu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T14:37:39Z

**Summary**: Due to the convenience of mobile devices, the online games have become an important part for user entertainments in reality, creating a demand for friend recommendation in online games. However, none of existing approaches can effectively incorporate the multi-modal user features (e.g., images and texts) with the structural information in the friendship graph, due to the following limitations: (1) some of them ignore the high-order structural proximity between users, (2) some fail to learn the pairwise relevance between users at modality-specific level, and (3) some cannot capture both the local and global user preferences on different modalities. By addressing these issues, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end model FROG that better models the user preferences on potential friends. Comprehensive experiments on both offline evaluation and online deployment at Tencent have demonstrated the superiority of FROG over existing approaches.

**Authors**: Ziwen Xu, Shuxun Wang, Kewei Xu, Haoming Xu, Mengru Wang, Xinle Deng, Yunzhi Yao, Guozhou Zheng, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T14:33:55Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce EasyEdit2, a framework designed to enable plug-and-play adjustability for controlling Large Language Model (LLM) behaviors. EasyEdit2 supports a wide range of test-time interventions, including safety, sentiment, personality, reasoning patterns, factuality, and language features. Unlike its predecessor, EasyEdit2 features a new architecture specifically designed for seamless model steering. It comprises key modules such as the steering vector generator and the steering vector applier, which enable automatic generation and application of steering vectors to influence the model's behavior without modifying its parameters. One of the main advantages of EasyEdit2 is its ease of use-users do not need extensive technical knowledge. With just a single example, they can effectively guide and adjust the model's responses, making precise control both accessible and efficient. Empirically, we report model steering performance across different LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques. We have released the source code on GitHub at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit along with a demonstration notebook. In addition, we provide a demo video at https://zjunlp.github.io/project/EasyEdit2/video for a quick introduction.

### A General Infrastructure and Workflow for Quadrotor Deep Reinforcement   Learning and Reality Deployment
**Authors**: Kangyao Huang, Hao Wang, Yu Luo, Jingyu Chen, Jintao Chen, Xiangkui Zhang, Xiangyang Ji, Huaping Liu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T14:25:23Z

**Summary**: Deploying robot learning methods to a quadrotor in unstructured outdoor environments is an exciting task. Quadrotors operating in real-world environments by learning-based methods encounter several challenges: a large amount of simulator generated data required for training, strict demands for real-time processing onboard, and the sim-to-real gap caused by dynamic and noisy conditions. Current works have made a great breakthrough in applying learning-based methods to end-to-end control of quadrotors, but rarely mention the infrastructure system training from scratch and deploying to reality, which makes it difficult to reproduce methods and applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a platform that enables the seamless transfer of end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We integrate the training environment, flight dynamics control, DRL algorithms, the MAVROS middleware stack, and hardware into a comprehensive workflow and architecture that enables quadrotors' policies to be trained from scratch to real-world deployment in several minutes. Our platform provides rich types of environments including hovering, dynamic obstacle avoidance, trajectory tracking, balloon hitting, and planning in unknown environments, as a physical experiment benchmark. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate the efficiency of proposed sim-to-real platform, and robust outdoor flight performance under real-world perturbations. Details can be found from our website https://emnavi.tech/AirGym/.

**Authors**: Khalil Hennara, Sara Chrouf, Mohamed Motaism Hamed, Zeina Aldallal, Omar Hadid, Safwan AlModhayan

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T14:17:25Z

**Summary**: Enhancing existing models with new knowledge is a crucial aspect of AI development. This paper introduces a novel method for integrating a new language into a large language model (LLM). Our approach successfully incorporates a previously unseen target language into an existing LLM without compromising its prior knowledge. We trained a tiny model with 1.5 billion parameters named Kuwain by injecting the Arabic language into a small open-source model mainly trained in English. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in Arabic language performance, with an average 8% improvement across various benchmarks, while retaining the model's existing knowledge with a minimum amount of the original model's data. This offers a cost-effective alternative to training a comprehensive model in both English and Arabic. The results highlight the potential for efficient, targeted language model expansion without extensive retraining or resource-intensive processes.

### Rethinking the Potential of Multimodality in Collaborative Problem   Solving Diagnosis with Large Language Models
**Authors**: K. Wong, B. Wu, S. Bulathwela, M. Cukurova

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T13:25:55Z

**Summary**: Detecting collaborative and problem-solving behaviours from digital traces to interpret students' collaborative problem solving (CPS) competency is a long-term goal in the Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) field. Although multimodal data and advanced models are argued to have the potential to detect complex CPS behaviours, empirical evidence on their value remains limited with some contrasting evidence. In this study, we investigated the potential of multimodal data to improve model performance in diagnosing 78 secondary school students' CPS subskills and indicators in authentic educational settings. In particular, text embeddings from verbal data and acoustic embeddings from audio data were used in a multimodal classification model for CPS diagnosis. Both unimodal and multimodal transformer-based models outperformed traditional models in detecting CPS classes. Although the inclusion of multimodality did not improve the performance of traditional unimodal models, its integration into transformer-based models demonstrated improved performance for diagnosing social-cognitive CPS classes compared to unimodal transformer-based models. Based on the results, the paper argues that multimodality and the selection of a particular modelling technique should not be taken for granted to achieve the best performance in the automated detection of every CPS subskill and indicator. Rather, their value is limited to certain types of CPS indicators, affected by the complexity of the labels, and dependent on the composition of indicators in the dataset. We conclude the paper by discussing the required nuance when considering the value of LLMs and multimodality in automated CPS diagnosis, highlighting the need for human-AI complementarity, and proposing the exploration of relevant model architectures and techniques to improve CPS diagnosis in authentic educational contexts.

### Empowering AI to Generate Better AI Code: Guided Generation of Deep   Learning Projects with LLMs
**Authors**: Chen Xie, Mingsheng Jiao, Xiaodong Gu, Beijun Shen

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T13:09:25Z

**Summary**: While large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to code generation, they struggle with generating entire deep learning projects, which are characterized by complex structures, longer functions, and stronger reliance on domain knowledge than general-purpose code. An open-domain LLM often lacks coherent contextual guidance and domain expertise for specific projects, making it challenging to produce complete code that fully meets user requirements.   In this paper, we propose a novel planning-guided code generation method, DLCodeGen, tailored for generating deep learning projects. DLCodeGen predicts a structured solution plan, offering global guidance for LLMs to generate the project. The generated plan is then leveraged to retrieve semantically analogous code samples and subsequently abstract a code template. To effectively integrate these multiple retrieval-augmented techniques, a comparative learning mechanism is designed to generate the final code. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on a dataset we build for deep learning code generation. Experimental results demonstrate that DLCodeGen outperforms other baselines, achieving improvements of 9.7% in CodeBLEU and 3.6% in human evaluation metrics.

### Think2SQL: Reinforce LLM Reasoning Capabilities for Text2SQL
**Authors**: Simone Papicchio, Simone Rossi, Luca Cagliero, Paolo Papotti

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T13:05:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in transforming natural language questions about relational databases into SQL queries. Despite recent improvements, small LLMs struggle to handle questions involving multiple tables and complex SQL patterns under a Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) setting. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) partially compensate the knowledge deficits in pretrained models but falls short while dealing with queries involving multi-hop reasoning. To bridge this gap, different LLM training strategies to reinforce reasoning capabilities have been proposed, ranging from leveraging a thinking process within ZSL, including reasoning traces in SFT, or adopt Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies. However, the influence of reasoning on Text2SQL performance is still largely unexplored. This paper investigates to what extent LLM reasoning capabilities influence their Text2SQL performance on four benchmark datasets. To this end, it considers the following LLM settings: (1) ZSL, including general-purpose reasoning or not; (2) SFT, with and without task-specific reasoning traces; (3) RL, leveraging execution accuracy as primary reward function; (4) SFT+RL, i.e, a two-stage approach that combines SFT and RL. The results show that general-purpose reasoning under ZSL proves to be ineffective in tackling complex Text2SQL cases. Small LLMs benefit from SFT with reasoning much more than larger ones, bridging the gap of their (weaker) model pretraining. RL is generally beneficial across all tested models and datasets, particularly when SQL queries involve multi-hop reasoning and multiple tables. Small LLMs with SFT+RL excel on most complex datasets thanks to a strategic balance between generality of the reasoning process and optimization of the execution accuracy. Thanks to RL, the7B Qwen-Coder-2.5 model performs on par with 100+ Billion ones on the Bird dataset.

### Semantic Wave Functions: Exploring Meaning in Large Language Models   Through Quantum Formalism
**Authors**: Timo Aukusti Laine

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T13:04:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode semantic relationships in high-dimensional vector embeddings. This paper explores the analogy between LLM embedding spaces and quantum mechanics, positing that LLMs operate within a quantized semantic space where words and phrases behave as quantum states. To capture nuanced semantic interference effects, we extend the standard real-valued embedding space to the complex domain, drawing parallels to the double-slit experiment. We introduce a "semantic wave function" to formalize this quantum-derived representation and utilize potential landscapes, such as the double-well potential, to model semantic ambiguity. Furthermore, we propose a complex-valued similarity measure that incorporates both magnitude and phase information, enabling a more sensitive comparison of semantic representations. We develop a path integral formalism, based on a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a gauge field and Mexican hat potential, to model the dynamic evolution of LLM behavior. This interdisciplinary approach offers a new theoretical framework for understanding and potentially manipulating LLMs, with the goal of advancing both artificial and natural language understanding.

### The Great Nugget Recall: Automating Fact Extraction and RAG Evaluation   with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ronak Pradeep, Nandan Thakur, Shivani Upadhyay, Daniel Campos, Nick Craswell, Jimmy Lin

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T12:55:06Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of information access systems, especially with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Nevertheless, the evaluation of RAG systems remains a barrier to continued progress, a challenge we tackle in this work by proposing an automatic evaluation framework that is validated against human annotations. We believe that the nugget evaluation methodology provides a solid foundation for evaluating RAG systems. This approach, originally developed for the TREC Question Answering (QA) Track in 2003, evaluates systems based on atomic facts that should be present in good answers. Our efforts focus on "refactoring" this methodology, where we describe the AutoNuggetizer framework that specifically applies LLMs to both automatically create nuggets and automatically assign nuggets to system answers. In the context of the TREC 2024 RAG Track, we calibrate a fully automatic approach against strategies where nuggets are created manually or semi-manually by human assessors and then assigned manually to system answers. Based on results from a community-wide evaluation, we observe strong agreement at the run level between scores derived from fully automatic nugget evaluation and human-based variants. The agreement is stronger when individual framework components such as nugget assignment are automated independently. This suggests that our evaluation framework provides tradeoffs between effort and quality that can be used to guide the development of future RAG systems. However, further research is necessary to refine our approach, particularly in establishing robust per-topic agreement to diagnose system failures effectively.

**Authors**: Chaoqun Liu, Wenxuan Zhang, Yiran Zhao, Anh Tuan Luu, Lidong Bing

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T12:52:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated multilingual capabilities, yet they are mostly English-centric due to the imbalanced training corpora. While prior works have leveraged this bias to enhance multilingual performance through translation, they have been largely limited to natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this work, we extend the evaluation to real-world user queries and non-English-centric LLMs, offering a broader examination of multilingual performance. Our key contribution lies in demonstrating that while translation into English can boost the performance of English-centric LLMs on NLP tasks, it is not universally optimal. For culture-related tasks that need deep language understanding, prompting in the native language proves more effective as it better captures the nuances of culture and language. Our experiments expose varied behaviors across LLMs and tasks in the multilingual context, underscoring the need for a more comprehensive approach to multilingual evaluation. Therefore, we call for greater efforts in developing and evaluating LLMs that go beyond English-centric paradigms.

### Mining Characteristics of Vulnerable Smart Contracts Across Lifecycle   Stages
**Authors**: Hongli Peng, Xiaoqi Li, Wenkai Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T12:42:59Z

**Summary**: Smart contracts are the cornerstone of decentralized applications and financial protocols, which extend the application of digital currency transactions. The applications and financial protocols introduce significant security challenges, resulting in substantial economic losses. Existing solutions predominantly focus on code vulnerabilities within smart contracts, accounting for only 50% of security incidents. Therefore, a more comprehensive study of security issues related to smart contracts is imperative. The existing empirical research realizes the static analysis of smart contracts from the perspective of the lifecycle and gives the corresponding measures for each stage. However, they lack the characteristic analysis of vulnerabilities in each stage and the distinction between the vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present the first empirical study on the security of smart contracts throughout their lifecycle, including deployment and execution, upgrade, and destruction stages. It delves into the security issues at each stage and provides at least seven feature descriptions. Finally, utilizing these seven features, five machine-learning classification models are used to identify vulnerabilities at different stages. The classification results reveal that vulnerable contracts exhibit distinct transaction features and ego network properties at various stages.

### Testing LLMs' Capabilities in Annotating Translations Based on an Error   Typology Designed for LSP Translation: First Experiments with ChatGPT
**Authors**: Joachim Minder, Guillaume Wisniewski, Natalie Kübler

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T12:21:37Z

**Summary**: This study investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, in annotating MT outputs based on an error typology. In contrast to previous work focusing mainly on general language, we explore ChatGPT's ability to identify and categorise errors in specialised translations. By testing two different prompts and based on a customised error typology, we compare ChatGPT annotations with human expert evaluations of translations produced by DeepL and ChatGPT itself. The results show that, for translations generated by DeepL, recall and precision are quite high. However, the degree of accuracy in error categorisation depends on the prompt's specific features and its level of detail, ChatGPT performing very well with a detailed prompt. When evaluating its own translations, ChatGPT achieves significantly poorer results, revealing limitations with self-assessment. These results highlight both the potential and the limitations of LLMs for translation evaluation, particularly in specialised domains. Our experiments pave the way for future research on open-source LLMs, which could produce annotations of comparable or even higher quality. In the future, we also aim to test the practical effectiveness of this automated evaluation in the context of translation training, particularly by optimising the process of human evaluation by teachers and by exploring the impact of annotations by LLMs on students' post-editing and translation learning.

**Authors**: Mohamed el amine Boudjoghra, Ivan Laptev, Angela Dai

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T12:12:43Z

**Summary**: With the fast pace of 3D capture technology and resulting abundance of 3D data, effective 3D scene editing becomes essential for a variety of graphics applications. In this work we present ScanEdit, an instruction-driven method for functional editing of complex, real-world 3D scans. To model large and interdependent sets of ob- jectswe propose a hierarchically-guided approach. Given a 3D scan decomposed into its object instances, we first construct a hierarchical scene graph representation to enable effective, tractable editing. We then leverage reason- ing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and translate high-level language instructions into actionable commands applied hierarchically to the scene graph. Fi- nally, ScanEdit integrates LLM-based guidance with ex- plicit physical constraints and generates realistic scenes where object arrangements obey both physics and common sense. In our extensive experimental evaluation ScanEdit outperforms state of the art and demonstrates excellent re- sults for a variety of real-world scenes and input instruc- tions.

### Spectral Mode Enhancement in Coherent-harmonic Dual-comb Spectroscopy   Enables Exceeding 300-fold Averaging Time Reduction
**Authors**: Wei Long, Xinru Cao, Xiangze Ma, Jiaqi Zhou, Wenbin He, Dijun Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T12:10:34Z

**Summary**: Dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) is a novel Fourier-transform spectroscopy not relying on mechanical scanning and capable of simultaneously achieving high speed, high spectral resolution, and broad optical bandwidth. Nevertheless, it suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per single acquisition due to the dynamic range limitation of photodetectors imposed by the high-peak-power mode-locked pulses, making coherent averaging an essential means to improve SNR, at the price of compromising the exceptional time resolution and placing more stringent demands on mutual coherence and stability. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach to enhance SNR by exploiting the spectral mode enhancement mechanism in coherent-harmonic pulses. As a proof-of-concept, we employ two frequency combs with mode spacing of $\sim$12.5 MHz, operating at a 20th harmonic repetition rate of $\sim$250 MHz, demonstrating a $>$300-fold reduction in averaging time for comparable SNR in conventional DCS. This reduction is expected to be further enhanced through integration with ultra-high repetition rate combs like microresonator combs. This new approach promises both a recovery of the inherent high-speed capability and a mitigation of the coherence-time requirements, thereby making it possible to significantly facilitate subsequent DCS investigations and field deployments.

### RainbowPlus: Enhancing Adversarial Prompt Generation via Evolutionary   Quality-Diversity Search
**Authors**: Quy-Anh Dang, Chris Ngo, Truong-Son Hy

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T12:04:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but are susceptible to adversarial prompts that exploit vulnerabilities to produce unsafe or biased outputs. Existing red-teaming methods often face scalability challenges, resource-intensive requirements, or limited diversity in attack strategies. We propose RainbowPlus, a novel red-teaming framework rooted in evolutionary computation, enhancing adversarial prompt generation through an adaptive quality-diversity (QD) search that extends classical evolutionary algorithms like MAP-Elites with innovations tailored for language models. By employing a multi-element archive to store diverse high-quality prompts and a comprehensive fitness function to evaluate multiple prompts concurrently, RainbowPlus overcomes the constraints of single-prompt archives and pairwise comparisons in prior QD methods like Rainbow Teaming. Experiments comparing RainbowPlus to QD methods across six benchmark datasets and four open-source LLMs demonstrate superior attack success rate (ASR) and diversity (Diverse-Score $\approx 0.84$), generating up to 100 times more unique prompts (e.g., 10,418 vs. 100 for Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410). Against nine state-of-the-art methods on the HarmBench dataset with twelve LLMs (ten open-source, two closed-source), RainbowPlus achieves an average ASR of 81.1%, surpassing AutoDAN-Turbo by 3.9%, and is 9 times faster (1.45 vs. 13.50 hours). Our open-source implementation fosters further advancements in LLM safety, offering a scalable tool for vulnerability assessment. Code and resources are publicly available at https://github.com/knoveleng/rainbowplus, supporting reproducibility and future research in LLM red-teaming.

### MRAMG-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Advancing Multimodal   Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation
**Authors**: Qinhan Yu, Zhiyou Xiao, Binghui Li, Zhengren Wang, Chong Chen, Wentao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T12:02:08Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have significantly improved response accuracy and relevance by incorporating external knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG methods primarily focus on generating text-only answers, even in Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) scenarios, where multimodal elements are retrieved to assist in generating text answers. To address this, we introduce the Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation (MRAMG) task, in which we aim to generate multimodal answers that combine both text and images, fully leveraging the multimodal data within a corpus. Despite growing attention to this challenging task, a notable lack of a comprehensive benchmark persists for effectively evaluating its performance. To bridge this gap, we provide MRAMG-Bench, a meticulously curated, human-annotated benchmark comprising 4,346 documents, 14,190 images, and 4,800 QA pairs, distributed across six distinct datasets and spanning three domains: Web, Academia, and Lifestyle. The datasets incorporate diverse difficulty levels and complex multi-image scenarios, providing a robust foundation for evaluating the MRAMG task. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, MRAMG-Bench incorporates a comprehensive suite of both statistical and LLM-based metrics, enabling a thorough analysis of the performance of generative models in the MRAMG task. Additionally, we propose an efficient and flexible multimodal answer generation framework that can leverage LLMs/MLLMs to generate multimodal responses. Our datasets and complete evaluation results for 11 popular generative models are available at https://github.com/MRAMG-Bench/MRAMG.

### Energy-Efficient UAV-Mounted RIS for IoT: A Hybrid Energy Harvesting and   DRL Approach
**Authors**: Mahmoud M. Salim, Khaled M. Rabie, Ali H. Muqaibel

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T11:54:40Z

**Summary**: Many future Internet of Things (IoT) applications are expected to rely heavily on reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the endurance of such systems is constrained by the limited onboard energy, where frequent recharging or battery replacements are required. This consequently disrupts continuous operation and may be impractical in disaster scenarios. To address this challenge, we explore a dual energy harvesting (EH) framework that integrates time-switching (TS), power-splitting (PS), and element-splitting (ES) EH protocols for radio frequency energy, along with solar energy as a renewable source. First, we present the proposed system architecture and EH operating protocols, introducing the proposed hybrid ES-TS-PS EH strategy to extend UAV-mounted RIS endurance. Next, we outline key application scenarios and the associated design challenges. After that, a deep reinforcement learning-based framework is introduced to maximize the EH efficiency by jointly optimizing UAV trajectory, RIS phase shifts, and EH strategies. The framework considers dual EH, hardware impairments, and channel state information imperfections to reflect real-world deployment conditions. The optimization problem is formulated as a Markov decision process and solved using an enhanced deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, incorporating clipped double Q-learning and softmax-based Q-value estimation for improved stability and efficiency. The results demonstrate significant performance gains compared to the considered baseline approaches. Finally, possible challenges and open research directions are presented, highlighting the transformative potential of energy-efficient UAV-mounted RIS networks for IoT systems.

### DyST-XL: Dynamic Layout Planning and Content Control for Compositional   Text-to-Video Generation
**Authors**: Weijie He, Mushui Liu, Yunlong Yu, Zhao Wang, Chao Wu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T11:41:22Z

**Summary**: Compositional text-to-video generation, which requires synthesizing dynamic scenes with multiple interacting entities and precise spatial-temporal relationships, remains a critical challenge for diffusion-based models. Existing methods struggle with layout discontinuity, entity identity drift, and implausible interaction dynamics due to unconstrained cross-attention mechanisms and inadequate physics-aware reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose DyST-XL, a \textbf{training-free} framework that enhances off-the-shelf text-to-video models (e.g., CogVideoX-5B) through frame-aware control. DyST-XL integrates three key innovations: (1) A Dynamic Layout Planner that leverages large language models (LLMs) to parse input prompts into entity-attribute graphs and generates physics-aware keyframe layouts, with intermediate frames interpolated via trajectory optimization; (2) A Dual-Prompt Controlled Attention Mechanism that enforces localized text-video alignment through frame-aware attention masking, achieving the precise control over individual entities; and (3) An Entity-Consistency Constraint strategy that propagates first-frame feature embeddings to subsequent frames during denoising, preserving object identity without manual annotation. Experiments demonstrate that DyST-XL excels in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly improving performance on complex prompts and bridging a crucial gap in training-free video synthesis.

**Authors**: Jingxiang Guo, Jiayu Luo, Zhenyu Wei, Yiwen Hou, Zhixuan Xu, Xiaoyi Lin, Chongkai Gao, Lin Shao

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T11:40:22Z

**Summary**: Teleoperation provides an effective way to collect robot data, which is crucial for learning from demonstrations. In this field, teleoperation faces several key challenges: user-friendliness for new users, safety assurance, and transferability across different platforms. While collecting real robot dexterous manipulation data by teleoperation to train robots has shown impressive results on diverse tasks, due to the morphological differences between human and robot hands, it is not only hard for new users to understand the action mapping but also raises potential safety concerns during operation. To address these limitations, we introduce TelePreview. This teleoperation system offers real-time visual feedback on robot actions based on human user inputs, with a total hardware cost of less than $1,000. TelePreview allows the user to see a virtual robot that represents the outcome of the user's next movement. By enabling flexible switching between command visualization and actual execution, this system helps new users learn how to demonstrate quickly and safely. We demonstrate that it outperforms other teleoperation systems across five tasks, emphasize its ease of use, and highlight its straightforward deployment across diverse robotic platforms. We release our code and a deployment document on our website https://nus-lins-lab.github.io/telepreview-web/.

**Authors**: Chengyu Wang, Junbing Yan, Yuanhao Yue, Jun Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T11:26:02Z

**Summary**: Enhancing computational efficiency and reducing deployment costs for large language models (LLMs) have become critical challenges in various resource-constrained scenarios. In this work, we present DistilQwen2.5, a family of distilled, lightweight LLMs derived from the public Qwen2.5 models. These distilled models exhibit enhanced instruction-following capabilities compared to the original models based on a series of distillation techniques that incorporate knowledge from much larger LLMs. In our industrial practice, we first leverage powerful proprietary LLMs with varying capacities as multi-agent teachers to select, rewrite, and refine instruction-response pairs that are more suitable for student LLMs to learn. After standard fine-tuning, we further leverage a computationally efficient model fusion approach that enables student models to progressively integrate fine-grained hidden knowledge from their teachers. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the distilled models possess significantly stronger capabilities than their original checkpoints. Additionally, we present use cases to illustrate the applications of our framework in real-world scenarios. To facilitate practical use, we have released all the DistilQwen2.5 models to the open-source community.

### Gaussian Shading++: Rethinking the Realistic Deployment Challenge of   Performance-Lossless Image Watermark for Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Zijin Yang, Xin Zhang, Kejiang Chen, Kai Zeng, Qiyi Yao, Han Fang, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T11:18:16Z

**Summary**: Ethical concerns surrounding copyright protection and inappropriate content generation pose challenges for the practical implementation of diffusion models. One effective solution involves watermarking the generated images. Existing methods primarily focus on ensuring that watermark embedding does not degrade the model performance. However, they often overlook critical challenges in real-world deployment scenarios, such as the complexity of watermark key management, user-defined generation parameters, and the difficulty of verification by arbitrary third parties. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Shading++, a diffusion model watermarking method tailored for real-world deployment. We propose a double-channel design that leverages pseudorandom error-correcting codes to encode the random seed required for watermark pseudorandomization, achieving performance-lossless watermarking under a fixed watermark key and overcoming key management challenges. Additionally, we model the distortions introduced during generation and inversion as an additive white Gaussian noise channel and employ a novel soft decision decoding strategy during extraction, ensuring strong robustness even when generation parameters vary. To enable third-party verification, we incorporate public key signatures, which provide a certain level of resistance against forgery attacks even when model inversion capabilities are fully disclosed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Gaussian Shading++ not only maintains performance losslessness but also outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness, making it a more practical solution for real-world deployment.

### LLMs as Data Annotators: How Close Are We to Human Performance
**Authors**: Muhammad Uzair Ul Haq, Davide Rigoni, Alessandro Sperduti

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T11:11:07Z

**Summary**: In NLP, fine-tuning LLMs is effective for various applications but requires high-quality annotated data. However, manual annotation of data is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Therefore, LLMs are increasingly used to automate the process, often employing in-context learning (ICL) in which some examples related to the task are given in the prompt for better performance. However, manually selecting context examples can lead to inefficiencies and suboptimal model performance. This paper presents comprehensive experiments comparing several LLMs, considering different embedding models, across various datasets for the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. The evaluation encompasses models with approximately $7$B and $70$B parameters, including both proprietary and non-proprietary models. Furthermore, leveraging the success of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it also considers a method that addresses the limitations of ICL by automatically retrieving contextual examples, thereby enhancing performance. The results highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate LLM and embedding model, understanding the trade-offs between LLM sizes and desired performance, and the necessity to direct research efforts towards more challenging datasets.

**Authors**: Hanwen Zhang, Ruichen Zhang, Wei Zhang, Dusit Niyato, Yonggang Wen

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T11:09:11Z

**Summary**: Generative artificial intelligence, particularly through large language models (LLMs), is poised to transform energy optimization and demand side management (DSM) within microgrids. This paper explores the integration of LLMs into energy management, emphasizing their roles in automating the optimization of DSM strategies with Internet of electric vehicles.

We present a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution in charging scheduling and optimization for electric vehicles, highlighting our solution's significant advancements in energy efficiency and user adaptability. This work underscores the potential of LLMs for energy optimization and fosters a new era of intelligent DSM solutions.

### Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish: On the Extended Reading Articles Generation   with LLMs
**Authors**: Yow-Fu Liou, Yu-Chien Tang, An-Zi Yen

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T10:35:48Z

**Summary**: The process of creating educational materials is both time-consuming and demanding for educators. This research explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline this task by automating the generation of extended reading materials and relevant course suggestions. Using the TED-Ed Dig Deeper sections as an initial exploration, we investigate how supplementary articles can be enriched with contextual knowledge and connected to additional learning resources. Our method begins by generating extended articles from video transcripts, leveraging LLMs to include historical insights, cultural examples, and illustrative anecdotes. A recommendation system employing semantic similarity ranking identifies related courses, followed by an LLM-based refinement process to enhance relevance. The final articles are tailored to seamlessly integrate these recommendations, ensuring they remain cohesive and informative. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our model produces high-quality content and accurate course suggestions, assessed through metrics such as Hit Rate, semantic similarity, and coherence. Our experimental analysis highlight the nuanced differences between the generated and existing materials, underscoring the model's capacity to offer more engaging and accessible learning experiences. This study showcases how LLMs can bridge the gap between core content and supplementary learning, providing students with additional recommended resources while also assisting teachers in designing educational materials.

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T10:34:50Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in video generation have been driven by diffusion models and autoregressive frameworks, yet critical challenges persist in harmonizing prompt adherence, visual quality, motion dynamics, and duration: compromises in motion dynamics to enhance temporal visual quality, constrained video duration (5-10 seconds) to prioritize resolution, and inadequate shot-aware generation stemming from general-purpose MLLMs' inability to interpret cinematic grammar, such as shot composition, actor expressions, and camera motions. These intertwined limitations hinder realistic long-form synthesis and professional film-style generation. To address these limitations, we propose SkyReels-V2, an Infinite-length Film Generative Model, that synergizes Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), Multi-stage Pretraining, Reinforcement Learning, and Diffusion Forcing Framework. Firstly, we design a comprehensive structural representation of video that combines the general descriptions by the Multi-modal LLM and the detailed shot language by sub-expert models. Aided with human annotation, we then train a unified Video Captioner, named SkyCaptioner-V1, to efficiently label the video data. Secondly, we establish progressive-resolution pretraining for the fundamental video generation, followed by a four-stage post-training enhancement: Initial concept-balanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) improves baseline quality; Motion-specific Reinforcement Learning (RL) training with human-annotated and synthetic distortion data addresses dynamic artifacts; Our diffusion forcing framework with non-decreasing noise schedules enables long-video synthesis in an efficient search space; Final high-quality SFT refines visual fidelity. All the code and models are available at https://github.com/SkyworkAI/SkyReels-V2.

### Quantifying the benefits of code hints for refactoring deprecated Java   APIs
**Authors**: Cristina David, Pascal Kesseli, Daniel Kroening, Hanliang Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T10:30:34Z

**Summary**: When done manually, refactoring legacy code in order to eliminate uses of deprecated APIs is an error-prone and time-consuming process. In this paper, we investigate to which degree refactorings for deprecated Java APIs can be automated, and quantify the benefit of Javadoc code hints for this task. To this end, we build a symbolic and a neural engine for the automatic refactoring of deprecated APIs. The former is based on type-directed and component-based program synthesis, whereas the latter uses LLMs. We applied our engines to refactor the deprecated methods in the Oracle JDK 15. Our experiments show that code hints are enabling for the automation of this task: even the worst engine correctly refactors 71% of the tasks with code hints, which drops to at best 14% on tasks without. Adding more code hints to Javadoc can hence boost the refactoring of code that uses deprecated APIs.

### MoWE-Audio: Multitask AudioLLMs with Mixture of Weak Encoders
**Authors**: Wenyu Zhang, Shuo Sun, Bin Wang, Xunlong Zou, Zhuohan Liu, Yingxu He, Geyu Lin, Nancy F. Chen, Ai Ti Aw

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T09:48:05Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced natural language processing capabilities, facilitating the development of AudioLLMs that process and understand speech and audio inputs alongside text. Existing AudioLLMs typically combine a pre-trained audio encoder with a pre-trained LLM, which are subsequently finetuned on specific audio tasks. However, the pre-trained audio encoder has constrained capacity to capture features for new tasks and datasets. To address this, we propose to incorporate mixtures of `weak' encoders (MoWE) into the AudioLLM framework. MoWE supplements a base encoder with a pool of relatively light weight encoders, selectively activated based on the audio input to enhance feature extraction without significantly increasing model size. Our empirical results demonstrate that MoWE effectively improves multi-task performance, broadening the applicability of AudioLLMs to more diverse audio tasks.

### Inference Optimal VLMs Need Fewer Visual Tokens and More Parameters
**Authors**: Kevin Y. Li, Sachin Goyal, Joao D. Semedo, J. Zico Kolter

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T09:34:59Z

**Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various visual understanding and reasoning tasks, driven by incorporating image representations into the token inputs of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, their real-world deployment is often constrained by high latency during inference due to the substantial compute required by the LLM to process the large number of input tokens, predominantly arising from the image. To reduce inference costs, one can either downsize the LLM or reduce the number of input tokens needed to represent the image, the latter of which has been the focus of many recent efforts around token compression. However, it is unclear what the optimal trade-off is given a fixed inference budget. We first characterize this optimal trade-off between the number of visual tokens and LLM parameters by establishing scaling laws that capture variations in performance with these two factors. Our results reveal a surprising trend: for visual reasoning tasks, the inference-optimal behavior in VLMs is achieved by using the largest LLM that fits within the inference budget while minimizing visual token count - often to a single token. While the token reduction literature has mainly focused on maintaining base model performance by modestly reducing the token count (e.g., $5-10\times$), our results indicate that the compute-optimal inference regime requires operating under even higher token compression ratios. Based on these insights, we take the first steps toward designing token compression algorithms tailored for high-compression settings, utilizing prompt-based compression of tokens. Our work underscores the performance and efficiency benefits of operating in low visual token regimes and the importance of developing tailored token reduction algorithms for such conditions. Code is available at https://github.com/locuslab/llava-token-compression.

### aiXamine: LLM Safety and Security Simplified
**Authors**: Fatih Deniz, Dorde Popovic, Yazan Boshmaf, Euisuh Jeong, Minhaj Ahmad, Sanjay Chawla, Issa Khalil

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T09:26:05Z

**Summary**: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for safety and security remains a complex task, often requiring users to navigate a fragmented landscape of ad hoc benchmarks, datasets, metrics, and reporting formats. To address this challenge, we present aiXamine, a comprehensive black-box evaluation platform for LLM safety and security. aiXamine integrates over 40 tests (i.e., benchmarks) organized into eight key services targeting specific dimensions of safety and security: adversarial robustness, code security, fairness and bias, hallucination, model and data privacy, out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, over-refusal, and safety alignment. The platform aggregates the evaluation results into a single detailed report per model, providing a detailed breakdown of model performance, test examples, and rich visualizations. We used aiXamine to assess over 50 publicly available and proprietary LLMs, conducting over 2K examinations. Our findings reveal notable vulnerabilities in leading models, including susceptibility to adversarial attacks in OpenAI's GPT-4o, biased outputs in xAI's Grok-3, and privacy weaknesses in Google's Gemini 2.0. Additionally, we observe that open-source models can match or exceed proprietary models in specific services such as safety alignment, fairness and bias, and OOD robustness. Finally, we identify trade-offs between distillation strategies, model size, training methods, and architectural choices.

### SLO-Aware Scheduling for Large Language Model Inferences
**Authors**: Jinqi Huang, Yi Xiong, Xuebing Yu, Wenjie Huang, Entong Li, Li Zeng, Xin Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T08:48:48Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized applications such as code completion, chatbots, and online classification. To elevate user experiences, service level objectives (SLOs) serve as crucial benchmarks for assessing inference services capabilities. In practice, an inference service processes multiple types of tasks, each with its own distinct SLO. To ensure satisfactory user experiences, each request's distinct SLOs should be considered in scheduling. However, existing designs lack this consideration, leading to insufficient hardware utility and suboptimal performance.   This paper analyzes scenarios to process tasks with varying SLOs, and introduces a simulated annealing-based scheduler to decide request priority sequence based on a request's SLO, input lengths, and possible output lengths. As the first specialized scheduler for multi-SLO scenarios, this work improves SLO attainment by up to 5x and reduces average latency by 31.6% on Python-Code-23k-ShareGPT and ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered datasets, compared to current state-of-the-art framework vLLM and a new framework LMDeploy.

**Authors**: Emir Catir, Robin Claesson, Rodothea Myrsini Tsoupidi

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T08:45:23Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have become popular among programming students. Students use LLMs to assist them in programming courses, including generating source code. Previous work has evaluated the ability of LLMs in solving introductory-course programming assignments. The results have shown that LLMs are highly effective in generating code for introductory Computer Science (CS) courses. However, there is a gap in research on evaluating LLMs' ability to generate code that solves advanced programming assignments. In this work, we evaluate the ability of four LLM tools to solve programming assignments from advanced CS courses in three popular programming languages, Java, Python, and C. We manually select 12 problems, three problems from introductory courses as the baseline and nine programming assignments from second- and third-year CS courses. To evaluate the LLM-generated code, we generate a test suite of 1000 test cases per problem and analyze the program output. Our evaluation shows that although LLMs are highly effective in generating source code for introductory programming courses, solving advanced programming assignments is more challenging. Nonetheless, in many cases, LLMs identify the base problem and provide partial solutions that may be useful to CS students. Furthermore, our results may provide useful guidance for teachers of advanced programming courses on how to design programming assignments.

### Can LLMs Replace Human Evaluators? An Empirical Study of LLM-as-a-Judge   in Software Engineering
**Authors**: Ruiqi Wang, Jiyu Guo, Cuiyun Gao, Guodong Fan, Chun Yong Chong, Xin Xia

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T08:41:21Z

**Summary**: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been deployed to tackle various software engineering (SE) tasks like code generation, significantly advancing the automation of SE tasks. However, assessing the quality of these LLM-generated code and text remains challenging. The commonly used Pass@k metric necessitates extensive unit tests and configured environments, demands a high labor cost, and is not suitable for evaluating LLM-generated text. Conventional metrics like BLEU, which measure only lexical rather than semantic similarity, have also come under scrutiny. In response, a new trend has emerged to employ LLMs for automated evaluation, known as LLM-as-a-judge. These LLM-as-a-judge methods are claimed to better mimic human assessment than conventional metrics without relying on high-quality reference answers. Nevertheless, their exact human alignment in SE tasks remains unexplored.   In this paper, we empirically explore LLM-as-a-judge methods for evaluating SE tasks, focusing on their alignment with human judgments. We select seven LLM-as-a-judge methods that utilize general-purpose LLMs, alongside two LLMs specifically fine-tuned for evaluation. After generating and manually scoring LLM responses on three recent SE datasets of code translation, code generation, and code summarization, we then prompt these methods to evaluate each response. Finally, we compare the scores generated by these methods with human evaluation. The results indicate that output-based methods reach the highest Pearson correlation of 81.32 and 68.51 with human scores in code translation and generation, achieving near-human evaluation, noticeably outperforming ChrF++, one of the best conventional metrics, at 34.23 and 64.92. Such output-based methods prompt LLMs to output judgments directly, and exhibit more balanced score distributions that resemble human score patterns. Finally, we provide...

### Efficient Document Retrieval with G-Retriever
**Authors**: Manthankumar Solanki

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T08:27:26Z

**Summary**: Textual data question answering has gained significant attention due to its growing applicability. Recently, a novel approach leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method was introduced, utilizing the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST) optimization for sub-graph construction. However, this method focused solely on node attributes, leading to incomplete contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach that replaces the PCST method with an attention-based sub-graph construction technique, enabling more efficient and context-aware retrieval. Additionally, we encode both node and edge attributes, leading to richer graph representations. Our method also incorporates an improved projection layer and multi-head attention pooling for better alignment with Large Language Models (LLMs). Experimental evaluations on the WebQSP dataset demonstrate that our approach is competitive and achieves marginally better results compared to the original method, underscoring its potential for more accurate question answering.

### Risks of Practicing Large Language Models in Smart Grid: Threat Modeling   and Validation
**Authors**: Jiangnan Li, Yingyuan Yang, Jinyuan Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T08:14:52Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) represent significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and hold potential for applications within smart grids. However, as demonstrated in previous literature, AI technologies are susceptible to various types of attacks. It is crucial to investigate and evaluate the risks associated with LLMs before deploying them in critical infrastructure like smart grids. In this paper, we systematically evaluated the risks of LLMs and identified two major types of attacks relevant to potential smart grid LLM applications, presenting the corresponding threat models. We validated these attacks using popular LLMs and real smart grid data. Our validation demonstrates that attackers are capable of injecting bad data and retrieving domain knowledge from LLMs employed in different smart grid applications.

### WindVE: Collaborative CPU-NPU Vector Embedding
**Authors**: Jinqi Huang, Xuebing Yu, Yi Xiong, Wenjie Huang, Entong Li, Li Zeng, Xin chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-22T07:43:01Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a technology that enhances large language models by integrating information retrieval. In the industry, inference services based on LLMs are highly sensitive to cost-performance ratio, prompting the need for improving hardware resource utilization in the inference service. Specifically, vector embedding and retrieval processes take up to 20% of the total latency. Therefore, optimizing the utilization of computational resources in vector embeddings is crucial for enhancing the cost-performance ratio of inference processes, which in turn boosts their product competitiveness.In this paper, we analyze the deployment costs of vector embedding technology in inference services, propose a theoretical formula, and determine through the mathematical expression that increasing the capacity to process concurrent queries is the key to reducing the deployment costs of vector embeddings. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on improving the product's capability to process concurrent queries. To optimize concurrency without sacrificing performance, we have designed a queue manager that adeptly offloads CPU peak queries. This manager utilizes a linear regression model to ascertain the optimal queue depths, a critical parameter that significantly influences the efficacy of the system. We further develop a system named WindVE that uses a CPU-NPU heterogeneous architecture to offload peak concurrent queries, which leverages the performance differences between the two processors to effectively manage traffic surges. Through experiments, we compare WindVE to the state-of-the-art vector embedding framework FlagEmbedding, and achieve a concurrency level up to 22.3% higher than the scheme without offloading.

### EducationQ: Evaluating LLMs' Teaching Capabilities Through Multi-Agent   Dialogue Framework
**Authors**: Yao Shi, Rongkeng Liang, Yong Xu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:48:20Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as educational tools, yet evaluating their teaching capabilities remains challenging due to the resource-intensive, context-dependent, and methodologically complex nature of teacher-student interactions. We introduce EducationQ, a multi-agent dialogue framework that efficiently assesses teaching capabilities through simulated dynamic educational scenarios, featuring specialized agents for teaching, learning, and evaluation. Testing 14 LLMs across major AI Organizations (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic, and others) on 1,498 questions spanning 13 disciplines and 10 difficulty levels reveals that teaching effectiveness does not correlate linearly with model scale or general reasoning capabilities - with some smaller open-source models outperforming larger commercial counterparts in teaching contexts. This finding highlights a critical gap in current evaluations that prioritize knowledge recall over interactive pedagogy. Our mixed-methods evaluation, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis and expert case studies, identifies distinct pedagogical strengths employed by top-performing models (e.g., sophisticated questioning strategies, adaptive feedback mechanisms). Human expert evaluations show 78% agreement with our automated qualitative analysis of effective teaching behaviors, validating our methodology. EducationQ demonstrates that LLMs-as-teachers require specialized optimization beyond simple scaling, suggesting next-generation educational AI prioritize targeted enhancement of specific pedagogical effectiveness.

### GenCLIP: Generalizing CLIP Prompts for Zero-shot Anomaly Detection
**Authors**: Donghyeong Kim, Chaewon Park, Suhwan Cho, Hyeonjeong Lim, Minseok Kang, Jungho Lee, Sangyoun Lee

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:38:25Z

**Summary**: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) aims to identify anomalies in unseen categories by leveraging CLIP's zero-shot capabilities to match text prompts with visual features. A key challenge in ZSAD is learning general prompts stably and utilizing them effectively, while maintaining both generalizability and category specificity. Although general prompts have been explored in prior works, achieving their stable optimization and effective deployment remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose GenCLIP, a novel framework that learns and leverages general prompts more effectively through multi-layer prompting and dual-branch inference. Multi-layer prompting integrates category-specific visual cues from different CLIP layers, enriching general prompts with more comprehensive and robust feature representations. By combining general prompts with multi-layer visual features, our method further enhances its generalization capability. To balance specificity and generalization, we introduce a dual-branch inference strategy, where a vision-enhanced branch captures fine-grained category-specific features, while a query-only branch prioritizes generalization. The complementary outputs from both branches improve the stability and reliability of anomaly detection across unseen categories. Additionally, we propose an adaptive text prompt filtering mechanism, which removes irrelevant or atypical class names not encountered during CLIP's training, ensuring that only meaningful textual inputs contribute to the final vision-language alignment.

### POLYRAG: Integrating Polyviews into Retrieval-Augmented Generation for   Medical Applications
**Authors**: Chunjing Gan, Dan Yang, Binbin Hu, Ziqi Liu, Yue Shen, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jian Wang, Jun Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:35:24Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have become a disruptive force in the industry, introducing unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing, logical reasoning and so on. However, the challenges of knowledge updates and hallucination issues have limited the application of LLMs in medical scenarios, where retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can offer significant assistance. Nevertheless, existing retrieve-then-read approaches generally digest the retrieved documents, without considering the timeliness, authoritativeness and commonality of retrieval. We argue that these approaches can be suboptimal, especially in real-world applications where information from different sources might conflict with each other and even information from the same source in different time scale might be different, and totally relying on this would deteriorate the performance of RAG approaches. We propose PolyRAG that carefully incorporate judges from different perspectives and finally integrate the polyviews for retrieval augmented generation in medical applications. Due to the scarcity of real-world benchmarks for evaluation, to bridge the gap we propose PolyEVAL, a benchmark consists of queries and documents collected from real-world medical scenarios (including medical policy, hospital & doctor inquiry and healthcare) with multiple tagging (e.g., timeliness, authoritativeness) on them. Extensive experiments and analysis on PolyEVAL have demonstrated the superiority of PolyRAG.

### StableQuant: Layer Adaptive Post-Training Quantization for Speech   Foundation Models
**Authors**: Yeona Hong, Hyewon Han, Woo-jin Chung, Hong-Goo Kang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:33:27Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we propose StableQuant, a novel adaptive post-training quantization (PTQ) algorithm for widely used speech foundation models (SFMs). While PTQ has been successfully employed for compressing large language models (LLMs) due to its ability to bypass additional fine-tuning, directly applying these techniques to SFMs may not yield optimal results, as SFMs utilize distinct network architecture for feature extraction. StableQuant demonstrates optimal quantization performance regardless of the network architecture type, as it adaptively determines the quantization range for each layer by analyzing both the scale distributions and overall performance. We evaluate our algorithm on two SFMs, HuBERT and wav2vec2.0, for an automatic speech recognition (ASR) task, and achieve superior performance compared to traditional PTQ methods. StableQuant successfully reduces the sizes of SFM models to a quarter and doubles the inference speed while limiting the word error rate (WER) performance drop to less than 0.3% with 8-bit quantization.

### A Strategic Coordination Framework of Small LLMs Matches Large LLMs in   Data Synthesis
**Authors**: Xin Gao, Qizhi Pei, Zinan Tang, Yu Li, Honglin Lin, Jiang Wu, Lijun Wu, Conghui He

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:29:28Z

**Summary**: While data synthesis and distillation are promising strategies to enhance small language models, current approaches heavily rely on Large Language Models (LLMs), which suffer from high computational costs, environmental inefficiency, and potential biases inherited from monolithic architectures. In contrast, smaller LLMs are more accessible and sustainable, but their individual capabilities often fall short in generating high-quality, diverse, and reliable data. Inspired by collaborative human processes (e.g., peer review), we propose a multiple small LLMs involved framework, GRA, that aggregates specialized roles across small LLMs to iterative refinement and quality control typically achieved by a single large LLM. In this collaborative framework, multiple small LLMs assume distinct roles-Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator-to simulate a peer-review-inspired data synthesis pipeline. The Generator proposes initial data samples, the Reviewer critiques their quality and diversity, and the Adjudicator resolves conflicts to finalize the output. By decomposing the synthesis process into specialized sub-tasks, collaborative small LLMs can achieve data-level parity with large LLM-based distillation. Through experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that GRA-produced data matches or exceeds the quality of single large LLM outputs, e.g., Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct. Our results challenge the necessity of monolithic large models for high-quality data synthesis, advocating instead for strategic coordination of smaller agents. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/GX-XinGao/GRA.

### MCGMark: An Encodable and Robust Online Watermark for Tracing   LLM-Generated Malicious Code
**Authors**: Kaiwen Ning, Jiachi Chen, Qingyuan Zhong, Tao Zhang, Yanlin Wang, Wei Li, Jingwen Zhang, Jianxing Yu, Yuming Feng, Weizhe Zhang, Zibin Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:25:13Z

**Summary**: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), numerous software service providers (SSPs) are dedicated to developing LLMs customized for code generation tasks, such as CodeLlama and Copilot. However, these LLMs can be leveraged by attackers to create malicious software, which may pose potential threats to the software ecosystem. For example, they can automate the creation of advanced phishing malware. To address this issue, we first conduct an empirical study and design a prompt dataset, MCGTest, which involves approximately 400 person-hours of work and consists of 406 malicious code generation tasks. Utilizing this dataset, we propose MCGMark, the first robust, code structure-aware, and encodable watermarking approach to trace LLM-generated code. We embed encodable information by controlling the token selection and ensuring the output quality based on probabilistic outliers. Additionally, we enhance the robustness of the watermark by considering the structural features of malicious code, preventing the embedding of the watermark in easily modified positions, such as comments. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of MCGMark on the DeepSeek-Coder. MCGMark achieves an embedding success rate of 88.9% within a maximum output limit of 400 tokens. Furthermore, it also demonstrates strong robustness and has minimal impact on the quality of the output code. Our approach assists SSPs in tracing and holding responsible parties accountable for malicious code generated by LLMs.

### CRAVE: A Conflicting Reasoning Approach for Explainable Claim   Verification Using LLMs
**Authors**: Yingming Zheng, Xiaoliang Liu, Peng Wu, Li Pan

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:20:31Z

**Summary**: The rapid spread of misinformation, driven by digital media and AI-generated content, has made automatic claim verification essential. Traditional methods, which depend on expert-annotated evidence, are labor-intensive and not scalable. Although recent automated systems have improved, they still struggle with complex claims that require nuanced reasoning. To address this, we propose CRAVE, a Conflicting Reasoning Approach for explainable claim VErification, that verify the complex claims based on the conflicting rationales reasoned by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, CRAVE introduces a three-module framework. Ambiguity Elimination enchanced Evidence Retrieval module performs ambiguity elimination and entity-based search to gather relevant evidence related to claim verification from external sources like Wikipedia. Conflicting Perspective Reasoning and Preliminary Judgment module with LLMs adopts LLMs to reason rationales with conflicting stances about claim verification from retrieved evidence across four dimensions, i.e., direct evidence, semantic relationships, linguistic patterns, and logical reasoning and make a preliminary judgment. Finally, Small Language Model (SLM) based Judge module is fine-tuned to make use of preliminary judgment from LLMs to assess the confidence of the conflicting rationales and make a final authenticity judgment. This methodology allows CRAVE to capture subtle inconsistencies in complex claims, improving both the accuracy and transparency of claim verification. Extensive experiments on two public claim verification datasets demonstrate that our CRAVE model achieves much better performance than state-of-the-art methods and exhibits a superior capacity for finding relevant evidence and explaining the model predictions. The code is provided at https://github.com/8zym/CRAVE.

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:20:19Z

**Summary**: Exponentially growing short video platforms (SVPs) face significant challenges in moderating content detrimental to users' mental health, particularly for minors. The dissemination of such content on SVPs can lead to catastrophic societal consequences. Although substantial efforts have been dedicated to moderating such content, existing methods suffer from critical limitations: (1) Manual review is prone to human bias and incurs high operational costs. (2) Automated methods, though efficient, lack nuanced content understanding, resulting in lower accuracy. (3) Industrial moderation regulations struggle to adapt to rapidly evolving trends due to long update cycles. In this paper, we annotate the first SVP content moderation benchmark with authentic user/reviewer feedback to fill the absence of benchmark in this field. Then we evaluate various methods on the benchmark to verify the existence of the aforementioned limitations. We further propose our common-law content moderation framework named KuaiMod to address these challenges. KuaiMod consists of three components: training data construction, offline adaptation, and online deployment & refinement. Leveraging large vision language model (VLM) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, KuaiMod adequately models video toxicity based on sparse user feedback and fosters dynamic moderation policy with rapid update speed and high accuracy. Offline experiments and large-scale online A/B test demonstrates the superiority of KuaiMod: KuaiMod achieves the best moderation performance on our benchmark. The deployment of KuaiMod reduces the user reporting rate by 20% and its application in video recommendation increases both Daily Active User (DAU) and APP Usage Time (AUT) on several Kuaishou scenarios. We have open-sourced our benchmark at https://kuaimod.github.io.

### A Survey on Speech Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jing Peng, Yucheng Wang, Yu Xi, Xu Li, Xizhuo Zhang, Kai Yu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:17:53Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong contextual understanding and remarkable multitask performance. As a result, researchers have been actively exploring the integration of LLMs into the domain of speech understanding, with a primary focus on a broad range of speech-to-text tasks. These include automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech-to-text translation (ST), speech emotion recognition (SER), and others. We refer to such models as Speech LLMs, which are typically built on a unified architecture that follows the pipeline of Audio Feature Extraction -> Multimodal Information Fusion -> LLM Inference. This approach enables richer audio feature extraction while facilitating end-to-end fusion of audio and text modalities, thereby achieving deeper understanding and reasoning from audio data. This paper elucidates the development of Speech LLMs, offering an in-depth analysis of system architectures. Through extensive research and a series of targeted experiments, the paper assesses the advancements in Speech LLMs and their potential for cross-task integration within the speech understanding field. Furthermore, it highlights key challenges identified through experimentation, such as the dormancy of LLMs under certain conditions. The paper further explores training strategies for Speech LLMs, proposes potential solutions based on these findings, and offers valuable insights and references for future research.

### Fine-tuning a Large Language Model for Automating Computational Fluid   Dynamics Simulations
**Authors**: Zhehao Dong, Zhen Lu, Yue Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T07:04:57Z

**Summary**: Configuring computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations typically demands extensive domain expertise, limiting broader access. Although large language models (LLMs) have advanced scientific computing, their use in automating CFD workflows is underdeveloped. We introduce a novel approach centered on domain-specific LLM adaptation. By fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on NL2FOAM, our custom dataset of 28716 natural language-to-OpenFOAM configuration pairs with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, we enable direct translation from natural language descriptions to executable CFD setups. A multi-agent framework orchestrates the process, autonomously verifying inputs, generating configurations, running simulations, and correcting errors. Evaluation on a benchmark of 21 diverse flow cases demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 88.7% solution accuracy and 82.6% first-attempt success rate. This significantly outperforms larger general-purpose models like Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1, and Llama3.3-70B-Instruct, while also requiring fewer correction iterations and maintaining high computational efficiency. The results highlight the critical role of domain-specific adaptation in deploying LLM assistants for complex engineering workflows. Our code and fine-tuned model have been deposited at https://github.com/YYgroup/AutoCFD.

### Hardware-based Heterogeneous Memory Management for Large Language Model   Inference
**Authors**: Soojin Hwang, Jungwoo Kim, Sanghyeon Lee, Hongbeen Kim, Jaehyuk Huh

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T06:45:41Z

**Summary**: A large language model (LLM) is one of the most important emerging machine learning applications nowadays. However, due to its huge model size and runtime increase of the memory footprint, LLM inferences suffer from the lack of memory capacity in conventional systems consisting of multiple GPUs with a modest amount of high bandwidth memory. Moreover, since LLM contains many bandwidthintensive kernels, only focusing on the memory capacity without considering the bandwidth incurs a serious performance degradation. To handle such conflicting memory capacity and bandwidth demands in a cost-effective way, this study investigates the potential of heterogeneous memory systems, proposing H2M2. It uses an asymmetric memory architecture consisting of capacity-centric and bandwidthcentric memory with computation units attached to each memory device. With the asymmetric memory, we first analyze the effect of kernel-memory mapping for the asymmetric memory. Second, we propose a dynamic runtime algorithm that finds a mapping solution considering the characteristics of LLM operations and the change of footprint during LLM inference. Third, we advocate the need for memory abstraction for the efficient management of the asymmetric memory. H2M2 outperforms the conventional homogeneous memory system with LPDDR by 1.46x, 1.55x, and 2.94x speedup in GPT3-175B, Chinchilla-70B, and Llama2-70B, respectively.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation Evaluation in the Era of Large Language   Models: A Comprehensive Survey
**Authors**: Aoran Gan, Hao Yu, Kai Zhang, Qi Liu, Wenyu Yan, Zhenya Huang, Shiwei Tong, Guoping Hu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T06:39:47Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have revolutionized natural language processing by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with external information retrieval, enabling accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable text generation across diverse applications. However, evaluating RAG systems presents unique challenges due to their hybrid architecture that combines retrieval and generation components, as well as their dependence on dynamic knowledge sources in the LLM era. In response, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of RAG evaluation methods and frameworks, systematically reviewing traditional and emerging evaluation approaches, for system performance, factual accuracy, safety, and computational efficiency in the LLM era. We also compile and categorize the RAG-specific datasets and evaluation frameworks, conducting a meta-analysis of evaluation practices in high-impact RAG research. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most comprehensive survey for RAG evaluation, bridging traditional and LLM-driven methods, and serves as a critical resource for advancing RAG development.

### Natural Fingerprints of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Teppei Suzuki, Ryokan Ri, Sho Takase

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T05:48:52Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit biases -- systematic deviations from expected norms -- in their outputs. These range from overt issues, such as unfair responses, to subtler patterns that can reveal which model produced them. We investigate the factors that give rise to identifiable characteristics in LLMs. Since LLMs model training data distribution, it is reasonable that differences in training data naturally lead to the characteristics. However, our findings reveal that even when LLMs are trained on the exact same data, it is still possible to distinguish the source model based on its generated text. We refer to these unintended, distinctive characteristics as natural fingerprints. By systematically controlling training conditions, we show that the natural fingerprints can emerge from subtle differences in the training process, such as parameter sizes, optimization settings, and even random seeds. We believe that understanding natural fingerprints offers new insights into the origins of unintended bias and ways for improving control over LLM behavior.

**Authors**: Hongru Wang, Cheng Qian, Wanjun Zhong, Xiusi Chen, Jiahao Qiu, Shijue Huang, Bowen Jin, Mengdi Wang, Kam-Fai Wong, Heng Ji

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T05:40:05Z

**Summary**: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) augments large language models (LLMs) with the ability to invoke external tools, such as search engines and code interpreters, to solve tasks beyond the capabilities of language-only reasoning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in improving TIR by optimizing final answer correctness, existing approaches often overlook the efficiency and cost associated with tool usage. This can lead to suboptimal behavior, including excessive tool calls that increase computational and financial overhead, or insufficient tool use that compromises answer quality. In this work, we propose Optimal Tool Call-controlled Policy Optimization (OTC-PO), a simple yet effective RL-based framework that encourages models to produce accurate answers with minimal tool calls. Our method introduces a tool-integrated reward that jointly considers correctness and tool efficiency, promoting high tool productivity. We instantiate this framework within both Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO), resulting in OTC-PPO and OTC-GRPO. Experiments with Qwen-2.5 and Qwen-Math across multiple QA benchmarks show that our approach reduces tool calls by up to 73.1\% and improves tool productivity by up to 229.4\%, while maintaining comparable answer accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based framework that explicitly optimizes tool-use efficiency in TIR.

**Authors**: Qiang Yi, Yangfan He, Jianhui Wang, Xinyuan Song, Shiyao Qian, Xinhang Yuan, Miao Zhang, Li Sun, Keqin Li, Kuan Lu, Menghao Huo, Jiaqi Chen, Tianyu Shi

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T05:40:00Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate creative and engaging narratives from user-specified input, but maintaining coherence and emotional depth throughout these AI-generated stories remains a challenge. In this work, we propose SCORE, a framework for Story Coherence and Retrieval Enhancement, designed to detect and resolve narrative inconsistencies. By tracking key item statuses and generating episode summaries, SCORE uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, incorporating TF-IDF and cosine similarity to identify related episodes and enhance the overall story structure. Results from testing multiple LLM-generated stories demonstrate that SCORE significantly improves the consistency and stability of narrative coherence compared to baseline GPT models, providing a more robust method for evaluating and refining AI-generated narratives.

**Authors**: Raviraj Joshi, Kanishk Singla, Anusha Kamath, Raunak Kalani, Rakesh Paul, Utkarsh Vaidya, Sanjay Singh Chauhan, Niranjan Wartikar, Eileen Long

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T05:29:01Z

**Summary**: Multilingual LLMs support a variety of languages; however, their performance is suboptimal for low-resource languages. In this work, we emphasize the importance of continued pre-training of multilingual LLMs and the use of translation-based synthetic pre-training corpora for improving LLMs in low-resource languages. We conduct our study in the context of the low-resource Indic language Hindi. We introduce Nemotron-Mini-Hindi 4B, a bilingual SLM supporting both Hindi and English, based on Nemotron-Mini 4B. The model is trained using a mix of real and synthetic Hindi + English tokens, with continuous pre-training performed on 400B tokens. We demonstrate that both the base and instruct models achieve state-of-the-art results on Hindi benchmarks while remaining competitive on English tasks. Additionally, we observe that the continued pre-training approach enhances the model's overall factual accuracy. We perform an ablation study to highlight the impact of Hindi pre-training, showing significant improvements in Hindi chat capabilities and factual accuracy, which cannot be achieved through Hindi alignment alone.

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T05:22:55Z

**Summary**: Usability testing is a fundamental research method that user experience (UX) researchers use to evaluate and iterate a web design, but\textbf{ how to evaluate and iterate the usability testing study design } itself? Recent advances in Large Language Model-simulated Agent (\textbf{LLM Agent}) research inspired us to design \textbf{UXAgent} to support UX researchers in evaluating and reiterating their usability testing study design before they conduct the real human-subject study. Our system features a Persona Generator module, an LLM Agent module, and a Universal Browser Connector module to automatically generate thousands of simulated users to interactively test the target website. The system also provides an Agent Interview Interface and a Video Replay Interface so that the UX researchers can easily review and analyze the generated qualitative and quantitative log data. Through a heuristic evaluation, five UX researcher participants praised the innovation of our system but also expressed concerns about the future of LLM Agent usage in UX studies.

**Authors**: Yuxuan Lu, Jing Huang, Yan Han, Bennet Bei, Yaochen Xie, Dakuo Wang, Jessie Wang, Qi He

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T05:12:56Z

**Summary**: Recent research shows that LLMs can simulate ``believable'' human behaviors to power LLM agents via prompt-only methods. In this work, we focus on evaluating and improving LLM's objective ``accuracy'' rather than the subjective ``believability'' in the web action generation task, leveraging a large-scale, real-world dataset collected from online shopping human actions. We present the first comprehensive quantitative evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, Llama, and Claude) on the task of web action generation. Our results show that fine-tuning LLMs on real-world behavioral data substantially improves their ability to generate actions compared to prompt-only methods. Furthermore, incorporating synthesized reasoning traces into model training leads to additional performance gains, demonstrating the value of explicit rationale in behavior modeling. This work establishes a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in behavior simulation and offers actionable insights into how real-world action data and reasoning augmentation can enhance the fidelity of LLM agents.

**Authors**: Jiajun Shen, Tong Zhou, Yubo Chen, Delai Qiu, Shengping Liu, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T04:50:16Z

**Summary**: While hallucinations of large language models could been alleviated through retrieval-augmented generation and citation generation, how the model utilizes internal knowledge is still opaque, and the trustworthiness of its generated answers remains questionable. In this work, we introduce Context-Prior Augmented Citation Generation task, requiring models to generate citations considering both external and internal knowledge while providing trustworthy references, with 5 evaluation metrics focusing on 3 aspects: answer helpfulness, citation faithfulness, and trustworthiness. We introduce RAEL, the paradigm for our task, and also design INTRALIGN, an integrated method containing customary data generation and an alignment algorithm. Our experimental results show that our method achieves a better cross-scenario performance with regard to other baselines. Our extended experiments further reveal that retrieval quality, question types, and model knowledge have considerable influence on the trustworthiness in citation generation.

### TLAC: Two-stage LMM Augmented CLIP for Zero-Shot Classification
**Authors**: Ans Munir, Faisal Z. Qureshi, Muhammad Haris Khan, Mohsen Ali

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T04:44:14Z

**Summary**: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has shown impressive zero-shot performance on image classification. However, state-of-the-art methods often rely on fine-tuning techniques like prompt learning and adapter-based tuning to optimize CLIP's performance. The necessity for fine-tuning significantly limits CLIP's adaptability to novel datasets and domains. This requirement mandates substantial time and computational resources for each new dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce simple yet effective training-free approaches, Single-stage LMM Augmented CLIP (SLAC) and Two-stage LMM Augmented CLIP (TLAC), that leverages powerful Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), such as Gemini, for image classification. The proposed methods leverages the capabilities of pre-trained LMMs, allowing for seamless adaptation to diverse datasets and domains without the need for additional training. Our approaches involve prompting the LMM to identify objects within an image. Subsequently, the CLIP text encoder determines the image class by identifying the dataset class with the highest semantic similarity to the LLM predicted object. Our models achieved superior accuracy on 9 of 11 base-to-novel datasets, including ImageNet, SUN397, and Caltech101, while maintaining a strictly training-free paradigm. Our TLAC model achieved an overall accuracy of 83.44%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art few-shot methods by a margin of 6.75%. Compared to other training-free approaches, our TLAC method achieved 83.6% average accuracy across 13 datasets, a 9.7% improvement over the previous methods.

### MaCTG: Multi-Agent Collaborative Thought Graph for Automatic Programming
**Authors**: Zixiao Zhao, Jing Sun, Zhe Hou, Zhiyuan Wei, Cheng-Hao Cai, Miao Qiao, Jin Song Dong

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T04:40:38Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based approaches have demonstrated strong problem-solving capabilities across various domains. However, in automatic programming, a single LLM is typically limited to function-level code generation, while multi-agent systems composed of multiple LLMs often suffer from inefficient task planning. This lack of structured coordination can lead to cascading hallucinations, where accumulated errors across agents result in suboptimal workflows and excessive computational costs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MaCTG (Multi-Agent Collaborative Thought Graph), a novel multi-agent framework that employs a dynamic graph structure to facilitate precise task allocation and controlled collaboration among LLM agents. MaCTG autonomously assigns agent roles based on programming requirements, dynamically refines task distribution through context-aware adjustments, and systematically verifies and integrates project-level code, effectively reducing hallucination errors and improving overall accuracy. MaCTG enhances cost-effectiveness by implementing a hybrid LLM deployment, where proprietary models handle complex reasoning, while open-source models are used for routine coding and validation tasks. To evaluate MaCTG's effectiveness, we applied it to traditional image processing auto-programming tasks, achieving a state-of-the-art accuracy of 83.33%. Additionally, by leveraging its hybrid LLM configuration, MaCTG significantly reduced operational costs by 89.09% compared to existing multi-agent frameworks, demonstrating its efficiency, scalability, and real-world applicability.

### APIRAT: Integrating Multi-source API Knowledge for Enhanced Code   Translation with LLMs
**Authors**: Chaofan Wang, Guanjie Qiu, Xiaodong Gu, Beijun Shen

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T04:24:49Z

**Summary**: Code translation is an essential task in software migration, multilingual development, and system refactoring. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in this task. However, prior studies have highlighted that LLMs often struggle with domain-specific code, particularly in resolving cross-lingual API mappings. To tackle this challenge, we propose APIRAT, a novel code translation method that integrates multi-source API knowledge. APIRAT employs three API knowledge augmentation techniques, including API sequence retrieval, API sequence back-translation, and API mapping, to guide LLMs to translating code, ensuring both the correct structure of API sequences and the accurate usage of individual APIs. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, CodeNet and AVATAR, indicate that APIRAT significantly surpasses existing LLM-based methods, achieving improvements in computational accuracy ranging from 4% to 15.1%. Additionally, our evaluation across different LLMs showcases the generalizability of APIRAT. An ablation study further confirms the individual contributions of each API knowledge component, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

### Beyond Boundaries: Learning a Universal Entity Taxonomy across Datasets   and Languages for Open Named Entity Recognition
**Authors**: Yuming Yang, Wantong Zhao, Caishuang Huang, Junjie Ye, Xiao Wang, Huiyuan Zheng, Yang Nan, Yuran Wang, Xueying Xu, Kaixin Huang, Yunke Zhang, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T04:11:32Z

**Summary**: Open Named Entity Recognition (NER), which involves identifying arbitrary types of entities from arbitrary domains, remains challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that fine-tuning LLMs on extensive NER data can boost their performance. However, training directly on existing datasets neglects their inconsistent entity definitions and redundant data, limiting LLMs to dataset-specific learning and hindering out-of-domain adaptation. To address this, we present B2NERD, a compact dataset designed to guide LLMs' generalization in Open NER under a universal entity taxonomy. B2NERD is refined from 54 existing English and Chinese datasets using a two-step process. First, we detect inconsistent entity definitions across datasets and clarify them by distinguishable label names to construct a universal taxonomy of 400+ entity types. Second, we address redundancy using a data pruning strategy that selects fewer samples with greater category and semantic diversity. Comprehensive evaluation shows that B2NERD significantly enhances LLMs' Open NER capabilities. Our B2NER models, trained on B2NERD, outperform GPT-4 by 6.8-12.0 F1 points and surpass previous methods in 3 out-of-domain benchmarks across 15 datasets and 6 languages. The data, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/UmeanNever/B2NER.

### NAACL2025 Tutorial: Adaptation of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zixuan Ke, Yifei Ming, Shafiq Joty

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T04:07:33Z

**Summary**: This tutorial on adaptation of LLMs is designed to address the growing demand for models that go beyond the static capabilities of generic LLMs by providing an overview of dynamic, domain-specific, and task-adaptive LLM adaptation techniques. While general LLMs have demonstrated strong generalization across a variety of tasks, they often struggle to perform well in specialized domains such as finance, healthcare, and code generation for underrepresented languages. Additionally, their static nature limits their ability to evolve with the changing world, and they are often extremely large in size, making them impractical and costly to deploy at scale. As a result, the adaptation of LLMs has drawn much attention since the birth of LLMs and is of core importance, both for industry, which focuses on serving its targeted users, and academia, which can greatly benefit from small but powerful LLMs. To address this gap, this tutorial aims to provide an overview of the LLM adaptation techniques. We start with an introduction to LLM adaptation, from both the data perspective and the model perspective. We then emphasize how the evaluation metrics and benchmarks are different from other techniques. After establishing the problems, we explore various adaptation techniques. We categorize adaptation techniques into two main families. The first is parametric knowledge adaptation, which focuses on updating the parametric knowledge within LLMs. Additionally, we will discuss real-time adaptation techniques, including model editing, which allows LLMs to be updated dynamically in production environments. The second kind of adaptation is semi-parametric knowledge adaptation, where the goal is to update LLM parameters to better leverage external knowledge or tools through techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based systems.

### Fine-Grained Verifiers: Preference Modeling as Next-token Prediction in   Vision-Language Alignment
**Authors**: Chenhang Cui, An Zhang, Yiyang Zhou, Zhaorun Chen, Gelei Deng, Huaxiu Yao, Tat-Seng Chua

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T04:04:53Z

**Summary**: The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and pre-trained vision models have accelerated the development of vision-language large models (VLLMs), enhancing the interaction between visual and linguistic modalities. Despite their notable success across various domains, VLLMs face challenges in modality alignment, which can lead to issues like hallucinations and unsafe content generation. Current alignment techniques often rely on coarse feedback and external datasets, limiting scalability and performance. In this paper, we propose FiSAO (Fine-Grained Self-Alignment Optimization), a novel self-alignment method that utilizes the model's own visual encoder as a fine-grained verifier to improve vision-language alignment without the need for additional data. By leveraging token-level feedback from the vision encoder, FiSAO significantly improves vision-language alignment, even surpassing traditional preference tuning methods that require additional data. Through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that FiSAO effectively addresses the misalignment problem in VLLMs, marking the first instance of token-level rewards being applied to such models.

### Language Models for Materials Discovery and Sustainability: Progress,   Challenges, and Opportunities
**Authors**: Zongrui Pei, Junqi Yin, Jiaxin Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T04:03:32Z

**Summary**: Significant advancements have been made in one of the most critical branches of artificial intelligence: natural language processing (NLP). These advancements are exemplified by the remarkable success of OpenAI's GPT-3.5/4 and the recent release of GPT-4.5, which have sparked a global surge of interest akin to an NLP gold rush. In this article, we offer our perspective on the development and application of NLP and large language models (LLMs) in materials science. We begin by presenting an overview of recent advancements in NLP within the broader scientific landscape, with a particular focus on their relevance to materials science. Next, we examine how NLP can facilitate the understanding and design of novel materials and its potential integration with other methodologies. To highlight key challenges and opportunities, we delve into three specific topics: (i) the limitations of LLMs and their implications for materials science applications, (ii) the creation of a fully automated materials discovery pipeline, and (iii) the potential of GPT-like tools to synthesize existing knowledge and aid in the design of sustainable materials.

### Enhancing the Patent Matching Capability of Large Language Models via   the Memory Graph
**Authors**: Qiushi Xiong, Zhipeng Xu, Zhenghao Liu, Mengjia Wang, Zulong Chen, Yue Sun, Yu Gu, Xiaohua Li, Ge Yu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T03:56:56Z

**Summary**: Intellectual Property (IP) management involves strategically protecting and utilizing intellectual assets to enhance organizational innovation, competitiveness, and value creation. Patent matching is a crucial task in intellectual property management, which facilitates the organization and utilization of patents. Existing models often rely on the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and leverage them to identify related patents directly. However, these methods usually depend on matching keywords and overlook the hierarchical classification and categorical relationships of patents. In this paper, we propose MemGraph, a method that augments the patent matching capabilities of LLMs by incorporating a memory graph derived from their parametric memory. Specifically, MemGraph prompts LLMs to traverse their memory to identify relevant entities within patents, followed by attributing these entities to corresponding ontologies. After traversing the memory graph, we utilize extracted entities and ontologies to improve the capability of LLM in comprehending the semantics of patents. Experimental results on the PatentMatch dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MemGraph, achieving a 17.68% performance improvement over baseline LLMs. The further analysis highlights the generalization ability of MemGraph across various LLMs, both in-domain and out-of-domain, and its capacity to enhance the internal reasoning processes of LLMs during patent matching. All data and codes are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/MemGraph.

### Establishing Reliability Metrics for Reward Models in Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Yizhou Chen, Yawen Liu, Xuesi Wang, Qingtao Yu, Guangda Huzhang, Anxiang Zeng, Han Yu, Zhiming Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T03:39:33Z

**Summary**: The reward model (RM) that represents human preferences plays a crucial role in optimizing the outputs of large language models (LLMs), e.g., through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or rejection sampling. However, a long challenge for RM is its uncertain reliability, i.e., LLM outputs with higher rewards may not align with actual human preferences. Currently, there is a lack of a convincing metric to quantify the reliability of RMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the \textit{\underline{R}eliable at \underline{$\eta$}} (RETA) metric, which directly measures the reliability of an RM by evaluating the average quality (scored by an oracle) of the top $\eta$ quantile responses assessed by an RM. On top of RETA, we present an integrated benchmarking pipeline that allows anyone to evaluate their own RM without incurring additional Oracle labeling costs. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the superior stability of RETA metric, providing solid evaluations of the reliability of various publicly available and proprietary RMs. When dealing with an unreliable RM, we can use the RETA metric to identify the optimal quantile from which to select the responses.

### Aligning Beam with Imbalanced Multi-modality: A Generative Federated   Learning Approach
**Authors**: Jiahui Liang, Miaowen Wen, Shuoyao Wang, Yuxuan Liang, Shijian Gao

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T03:32:00Z

**Summary**: As vehicle intelligence advances, multi-modal sensing-aided communication emerges as a key enabler for reliable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) connectivity through precise environmental characterization. As centralized learning may suffer from data privacy, model heterogeneity and communication overhead issues, federated learning (FL) has been introduced to support V2X. However, the practical deployment of FL faces critical challenges: model performance degradation from label imbalance across vehicles and training instability induced by modality disparities in sensor-equipped agents. To overcome these limitations, we propose a generative FL approach for beam selection (GFL4BS). Our solution features two core innovations: 1) An adaptive zero-shot multi-modal generator coupled with spectral-regularized loss functions to enhance the expressiveness of synthetic data compensating for both label scarcity and missing modalities; 2) A hybrid training paradigm integrating feature fusion with decentralized optimization to ensure training resilience while minimizing communication costs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over baselines achieving 16.2% higher accuracy than the current state-of-the-art under severe label imbalance conditions while maintaining over 70% successful rate even when two agents lack both LiDAR and RGB camera inputs.

### Improving Generalization in Intent Detection: GRPO with Reward-Based   Curriculum Sampling
**Authors**: Zihao Feng, Xiaoxue Wang, Ziwei Bai, Donghang Su, Bowen Wu, Qun Yu, Baoxun Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T03:29:14Z

**Summary**: Intent detection, a critical component in task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, faces significant challenges in adapting to the rapid influx of integrable tools with complex interrelationships. Existing approaches, such as zero-shot reformulations and LLM-based dynamic recognition, struggle with performance degradation when encountering unseen intents, leading to erroneous task routing. To enhance the model's generalization performance on unseen tasks, we employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) combined with a Reward-based Curriculum Sampling (RCS) during Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training in intent detection tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained models substantially outperform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baselines in generalization. Besides, the introduction of the RCS, significantly bolsters the effectiveness of RL in intent detection by focusing the model on challenging cases during training. Moreover, incorporating Chain-of-Thought (COT) processes in RL notably improves generalization in complex intent detection tasks, underscoring the importance of thought in challenging scenarios. This work advances the generalization of intent detection tasks, offering practical insights for deploying adaptable dialogue systems.

### BadApex: Backdoor Attack Based on Adaptive Optimization Mechanism of   Black-box Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhengxian Wu, Juan Wen, Wanli Peng, Ziwei Zhang, Yinghan Zhou, Yiming Xue

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T03:12:50Z

**Summary**: Previous insertion-based and paraphrase-based backdoors have achieved great success in attack efficacy, but they ignore the text quality and semantic consistency between poisoned and clean texts. Although recent studies introduce LLMs to generate poisoned texts and improve the stealthiness, semantic consistency, and text quality, their hand-crafted prompts rely on expert experiences, facing significant challenges in prompt adaptability and attack performance after defenses. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack based on adaptive optimization mechanism of black-box large language models (BadApex), which leverages a black-box LLM to generate poisoned text through a refined prompt. Specifically, an Adaptive Optimization Mechanism is designed to refine an initial prompt iteratively using the generation and modification agents. The generation agent generates the poisoned text based on the initial prompt. Then the modification agent evaluates the quality of the poisoned text and refines a new prompt. After several iterations of the above process, the refined prompt is used to generate poisoned texts through LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three dataset with six backdoor attacks and two defenses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadApex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. It improves prompt adaptability, semantic consistency, and text quality. Furthermore, when two defense methods are applied, the average attack success rate (ASR) still up to 96.75%.

### What Lurks Within? Concept Auditing for Shared Diffusion Models at Scale
**Authors**: Xiaoyong Yuan, Xiaolong Ma, Linke Guo, Lan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T02:44:59Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of highly realistic and customized images from text prompts. With the rise of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA, users can now customize powerful pre-trained models using minimal computational resources. However, the widespread sharing of fine-tuned DMs on open platforms raises growing ethical and legal concerns, as these models may inadvertently or deliberately generate sensitive or unauthorized content, such as copyrighted material, private individuals, or harmful content. Despite the increasing regulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools for systematically auditing these models before deployment. In this paper, we address the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM has learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches typically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image classification but suffer from critical limitations, including prompt uncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric concept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection, PAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for optimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled model and 690 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform. PAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by 18-40x compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first scalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of diffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more transparent diffusion model sharing.

**Summary**: Ad-hoc instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) is widely adopted for domain-specific adaptation. While domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is effective and efficient, it often weakens cross-domain generalization and struggles with noisy training data. To address these challenges, we propose DONOD, a lightweight model-intrinsic data pruning method. Our approach evaluates data using two model-parameter-based metrics: Delta of Norm (DON), which captures the cumulative influence on model weights, and Norm of Delta (NOD), which quantifies weight instability. Moreover, by employing the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) algorithm, we effectively filter noisy, unlearnable, and generalization-harming samples without relying on auxiliary models during the SFT process. Experiments on mathematical tasks demonstrate that data selected by DONOD achieve superior fine-tuning efficiency and improved robustness against noisy data. By filtering out 70% of the full dataset, we improve target-domain accuracy by 14.90% and cross-domain accuracy by 5.67%. Meanwhile, our selected data present superior cross-architecture generalization. Data pruned by smaller models (e.g., Llama 3.1-8B) generalize effectively on larger models (e.g., Llama 2-13B). Compared to existing related methodologies, DONOD demonstrates comparable or superior performance while remaining dataset-agnostic, enabling broader applicability.

**Summary**: The advancement of large language models has grown parallel to the opacity of their training data. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data was used to train a model. They offer valuable insights into detecting data contamination and ensuring compliance with privacy and copyright standards. However, MIA for LLMs is challenging due to the massive scale of training data and the inherent ambiguity of membership in texts. Moreover, creating realistic MIA evaluation benchmarks is difficult as training and test data distributions are often unknown. We introduce EM-MIA, a novel membership inference method that iteratively refines membership scores and prefix scores via an expectation-maximization algorithm. Our approach leverages the observation that these scores can improve each other: membership scores help identify effective prefixes for detecting training data, while prefix scores help determine membership. As a result, EM-MIA achieves state-of-the-art results on WikiMIA. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce OLMoMIA, a benchmark built from OLMo resources, which allows controlling task difficulty through varying degrees of overlap between training and test data distributions. Our experiments demonstrate EM-MIA is robust across different scenarios while also revealing fundamental limitations of current MIA approaches when member and non-member distributions are nearly identical.
