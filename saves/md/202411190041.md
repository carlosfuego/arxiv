 ### ZipCache: A DRAM/SSD Cache with Built-in Transparent Compression
**Authors**: Rui Xie, Linsen Ma, Alex Zhong, Feng Chen, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T07:25:54Z

**Summary**: As a core component in modern data centers, key-value cache provides high-throughput and low-latency services for high-speed data processing. The effectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the needed data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than commonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs, cooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential solution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by condensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not gained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical issues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write amplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost. This paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic integration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as an essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data management, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for collaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache. Our experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher throughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by up to 26.2 times.

### Skew-Symmetric Matrix Decompositions on Shared-Memory Architectures
**Authors**: Ishna Satyarth, Chao Yin, RuQing G. Xu, Devin A. Matthews

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T00:37:31Z

**Summary**: The factorization of skew-symmetric matrices is a critically understudied area of dense linear algebra (DLA), particularly in comparison to that of symmetric matrices. While some algorithms can be adapted from the symmetric case, the cost of algorithms can be reduced by exploiting skew-symmetry. A motivating example is the factorization $X=LTL^T$ of a skew-symmetric matrix $X$, which is used in practical applications as a means of determining the determinant of $X$ as the square of the (cheaply-computed) Pfaffian of the skew-symmetric tridiagonal matrix $T$, for example in fields such as quantum electronic structure and machine learning. Such applications also often require pivoting in order to improve numerical stability. In this work we explore a combination of known literature algorithms and new algorithms recently derived using formal methods. High-performance parallel CPU implementations are created, leveraging the concept of fusion at multiple levels in order to reduce memory traffic overhead, as well as the BLIS framework which provides high-performance GEMM kernels, hierarchical parallelism, and cache blocking. We find that operation fusion and improved use of available bandwidth via parallelization of bandwidth-bound (level-2 BLAS) operations are essential for obtaining high performance, while a concise C++ implementation provides a clear and close connection to the formal derivation process without sacrificing performance.

### Edge Caching Optimization with PPO and Transfer Learning for Dynamic   Environments
**Authors**: Farnaz Niknia, Ping Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T21:01:29Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the challenge of edge caching in dynamic environments, where rising traffic loads strain backhaul links and core networks. We propose a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based caching strategy that fully incorporates key file attributes such as size, lifetime, importance, and popularity, while also considering random file request arrivals, reflecting more realistic edge caching scenarios. In dynamic environments, changes such as shifts in content popularity and variations in request rates frequently occur, making previously learned policies less effective as they were optimized for earlier conditions. Without adaptation, caching efficiency and response times can degrade. While learning a new policy from scratch in a new environment is an option, it is highly inefficient and computationally expensive. Thus, adapting an existing policy to these changes is critical. To address this, we develop a mechanism that detects changes in content popularity and request rates, ensuring timely adjustments to the caching strategy. We also propose a transfer learning-based PPO algorithm that accelerates convergence in new environments by leveraging prior knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate the significant effectiveness of our approach, outperforming a recent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based method.

### Squeezed Attention: Accelerating Long Context Length LLM Inference
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sehoon Kim, Hiva Mohammadzadeh, Monishwaran Maheswaran, June Paik, Michael W. Mahoney, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T18:54:19Z

**Summary**: Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input prompts to perform complex downstream tasks like document analysis and code generation. For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose Squeezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of the keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded during inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important keys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to identify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement optimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively evaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and up to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models.

### Value Residual Learning For Alleviating Attention Concentration In   Transformers
**Authors**: Zhanchao Zhou, Tianyi Wu, Zhiyun Jiang, Zhenzhong Lan

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T17:46:04Z

**Summary**: Transformers can capture long-range dependencies using self-attention, allowing tokens to attend to all others directly. However, stacking multiple attention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address this issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier layers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is computationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with residual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through adding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all subsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with single layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding from first layer, reducing the $KV$ cache by nearly 50\%. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates that ResFormer mitigates attention concentration problem in deeper layers and enhances representation across most layers, outperforming the vanilla Transformer, DenseFormer, and NeuTRENO in training error as well as downstream tasks. Further visualization results suggest that Resformer alleviates attention sinks through avoiding value-state drains. SVFormer trains significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer and performs better than other methods like GQA and CLA, with performance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate.

### Architectural Exploration of Application-Specific Resonant SRAM   Compute-in-Memory (rCiM)
**Authors**: Dhandeep Challagundla, Ignatius Bezzam, Riadul Islam

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T16:01:05Z

**Summary**: While general-purpose computing follows Von Neumann's architecture, the data movement between memory and processor elements dictates the processor's performance. The evolving compute-in-memory (CiM) paradigm tackles this issue by facilitating simultaneous processing and storage within static random-access memory (SRAM) elements. Numerous design decisions taken at different levels of hierarchy affect the figure of merits (FoMs) of SRAM, such as power, performance, area, and yield. The absence of a rapid assessment mechanism for the impact of changes at different hierarchy levels on global FoMs poses a challenge to accurately evaluating innovative SRAM designs. This paper presents an automation tool designed to optimize the energy and latency of SRAM designs incorporating diverse implementation strategies for executing logic operations within the SRAM. The tool structure allows easy comparison across different array topologies and various design strategies to result in energy-efficient implementations. Our study involves a comprehensive comparison of over 6900+ distinct design implementation strategies for EPFL combinational benchmark circuits on the energy-recycling resonant compute-in-memory (rCiM) architecture designed using TSMC 28 nm technology. When provided with a combinational circuit, the tool aims to generate an energy-efficient implementation strategy tailored to the specified input memory and latency constraints. The tool reduces 80.9% of energy consumption on average across all benchmarks while using the six-topology implementation compared to baseline implementation of single-macro topology by considering the parallel processing capability of rCiM cache size ranging from 4KB to 192KB.

### Breaking the Low-Rank Dilemma of Linear Attention
**Authors**: Qihang Fan, Huaibo Huang, Ran He

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T15:40:59Z

**Summary**: The Softmax attention mechanism in Transformer models is notoriously computationally expensive, particularly due to its quadratic complexity, posing significant challenges in vision applications. In contrast, linear attention provides a far more efficient solution by reducing the complexity to linear levels. However, compared to Softmax attention, linear attention often experiences significant performance degradation. Our experiments indicate that this performance drop is due to the low-rank nature of linear attention's feature map, which hinders its ability to adequately model complex spatial information. In this paper, to break the low-rank dilemma of linear attention, we conduct rank analysis from two perspectives: the KV buffer and the output features. Consequently, we introduce Rank-Augmented Linear Attention (RALA), which rivals the performance of Softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity and high efficiency. Based on RALA, we construct the Rank-Augmented Vision Linear Transformer (RAVLT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAVLT achieves excellent performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without using any additional labels, data, or supervision during training, RAVLT achieves an 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k with only 26M parameters and 4.6G FLOPs. This result significantly surpasses previous linear attention mechanisms, fully illustrating the potential of RALA. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/RALA.

**Authors**: Hanjiang Wu, Huan Xu, Joongun Park, Jesmin Jahan Tithi, Fabio Checconi, Jordi Wolfson-Pou, Fabrizio Petrini, Tushar Krishna

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T14:28:31Z

**Summary**: Influence Maximization (IM) is vital in viral marketing and biological network analysis for identifying key influencers. Given its NP-hard nature, approximate solutions are employed. This paper addresses scalability challenges in scale-out shared memory system by focusing on the state-of-the-art Influence Maximization via Martingales (IMM) benchmark. To enhance the work efficiency of the current IMM implementation, we propose EFFICIENTIMM with key strategies, including new parallelization scheme, NUMA-aware memory usage, dynamic load balancing and fine-grained adaptive data structures. Benchmarking on a 128-core CPU system with 8 NUMA nodes, EFFICIENTIMM demonstrated significant performance improvements, achieving an average 5.9x speedup over Ripples across 8 diverse SNAP datasets, when compared to the best execution times of the original Ripples framework. Additionally, on the Youtube graph, EFFICIENTIMM demonstrates a better memory access pattern with 357.4x reduction in L1+L2 cache misses as compared to Ripples.

### MARM: Unlocking the Future of Recommendation Systems through Memory   Augmentation and Scalable Complexity
**Authors**: Xiao Lv, Jiangxia Cao, Shijie Guan, Xiaoyou Zhou, Zhiguang Qi, Yaqiang Zang, Ming Li, Ben Wang, Kun Gai, Guorui Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T13:22:41Z

**Summary**: Scaling-law has guided the language model designing for past years, however, it is worth noting that the scaling laws of NLP cannot be directly applied to RecSys due to the following reasons: (1) The amount of training samples and model parameters is typically not the bottleneck for the model. Our recommendation system can generate over 50 billion user samples daily, and such a massive amount of training data can easily allow our model parameters to exceed 200 billion, surpassing many LLMs (about 100B). (2) To ensure the stability and robustness of the recommendation system, it is essential to control computational complexity FLOPs carefully. Considering the above differences with LLM, we can draw a conclusion that: for a RecSys model, compared to model parameters, the computational complexity FLOPs is a more expensive factor that requires careful control. In this paper, we propose our milestone work, MARM (Memory Augmented Recommendation Model), which explores a new cache scaling-laws successfully.

**Authors**: Yi Xu, Ziming Mao, Xiangxi Mo, Shu Liu, Ion Stoica

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T09:50:41Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of LLMs has revolutionized natural language processing and AI analysis, but their increasing size and memory demands present significant challenges. A common solution is to spill over to CPU memory; however, traditional GPU-CPU memory swapping often results in higher latency and lower throughput.   This paper introduces Pie, an LLM inference framework that addresses these challenges with performance-transparent swapping and adaptive expansion. By leveraging predictable memory access patterns and the high bandwidth of modern hardware like the NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, Pie enables concurrent data swapping without affecting foreground computation, expanding effective memory without added latency. Adaptive expansion dynamically adjusts CPU memory allocation based on real-time information, optimizing memory usage and performance under varying conditions.   Pie maintains low computation latency, high throughput, and high elasticity. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Pie achieves optimal swapping policy during cache warmup and effectively balances increased memory capacity with negligible impact on computation. With its extended capacity, Pie outperforms vLLM by up to 1.9X in throughput and 2X in latency. Additionally, Pie can reduce GPU memory usage by up to 1.67X while maintaining the same performance. Compared to FlexGen, an offline profiling-based swapping solution, Pie achieves magnitudes lower latency and 9.4X higher throughput.

### Pkd-tree: Parallel $k$d-tree with Batch Updates
**Authors**: Ziyang Men, Zheqi Shen, Yan Gu, Yihan Sun

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T08:25:31Z

**Summary**: The $k$d-tree is one of the most widely used data structures to manage multi-dimensional data. Due to the ever-growing data volume, it is imperative to consider parallelism in $k$d-trees. However, we observed challenges in existing parallel kd-tree implementations, for both constructions and updates.   The goal of this paper is to develop efficient in-memory $k$d-trees by supporting high parallelism and cache-efficiency. We propose the Pkd-tree (Parallel $k$d-tree), a parallel $k$d-tree that is efficient both in theory and in practice. The Pkd-tree supports parallel tree construction, batch update (insertion and deletion), and various queries including k-nearest neighbor search, range query, and range count. We proved that our algorithms have strong theoretical bounds in work (sequential time complexity), span (parallelism), and cache complexity. Our key techniques include 1) an efficient construction algorithm that optimizes work, span, and cache complexity simultaneously, and 2) reconstruction-based update algorithms that guarantee the tree to be weight-balanced. With the new algorithmic insights and careful engineering effort, we achieved a highly optimized implementation of the Pkd-tree.   We tested Pkd-tree with various synthetic and real-world datasets, including both uniform and highly skewed data. We compare the Pkd-tree with state-of-the-art parallel $k$d-tree implementations. In all tests, with better or competitive query performance, Pkd-tree is much faster in construction and updates consistently than all baselines. We released our code.

### Not All Heads Matter: A Head-Level KV Cache Compression Method with   Integrated Retrieval and Reasoning
**Authors**: Yu Fu, Zefan Cai, Abedelkadir Asi, Wayne Xiong, Yue Dong, Wen Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T01:56:11Z

**Summary**: Key-Value (KV) caching is a common technique to enhance the computational efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs), but its memory overhead grows rapidly with input length. Prior work has shown that not all tokens are equally important for text generation, proposing layer-level KV cache compression to selectively retain key information. Recognizing the distinct roles of attention heads in generation, we propose HeadKV, a head-level KV cache compression method, and HeadKV-R2, which leverages a novel contextual reasoning ability estimation for compression. Our approach operates at the level of individual heads, estimating their importance for contextual QA tasks that require both retrieval and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks (LongBench, LooGLE), model architectures (e.g., Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct), and long-context abilities tests demonstrate that our head-level KV cache compression significantly outperforms strong baselines, particularly in low-resource settings (KV size = 64 & 128). Notably, our method retains just 1.5% of the KV cache while achieving 97% of the performance of the full KV cache on the contextual question answering benchmark.Codes are available at https://github.com/FYYFU/HeadKV

### ProactivePIM: Accelerating Weight-Sharing Embedding Layer with PIM for   Scalable Recommendation System
**Authors**: Youngsuk Kim, Junghwan Lim, Hyuk-Jae Lee, Chae Eun Rhee

**Updated**: 2024-11-13T16:33:33Z

**Summary**: The personalized recommendation system's continuous size growth poses new challenges for model inference. Although weight-sharing algorithms have been proposed to reduce embedding table capacity, they increase memory access. Recent advancements in processing-in-memory (PIM) successfully enhance the recommendation system's throughput by exploiting memory parallelism, but our analysis shows that those algorithms introduce CPU-PIM communication overhead into prior PIM systems, compromising the PIM throughput. We propose ProactivePIM, a specialized memory architecture integrated with PIM technology tailored to accelerate the weight-sharing algorithms. ProacitvePIM integrates an SRAM cache within the PIM with an efficient prefetching scheme to leverage a unique locality of the algorithm and eliminate CPU-PIM communication.

### Joint Model Caching and Resource Allocation in Generative AI-Enabled   Wireless Edge Networks
**Authors**: Zhang Liu, Hongyang Du, Lianfen Huang, Zhibin Gao, Dusit Niyato

**Updated**: 2024-11-13T15:07:15Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative tool, enabling customized and personalized AI-generated content (AIGC) services. However, GenAI models with billions of parameters require substantial memory capacity and computational power for deployment and execution, presenting significant challenges to resource-limited edge networks. In this paper, we address the joint model caching and resource allocation problem in GenAI-enabled wireless edge networks. Our objective is to balance the trade-off between delivering high-quality AIGC and minimizing the delay in AIGC service provisioning. To tackle this problem, we employ a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning approach, capable of efficiently determining optimal model caching and resource allocation decisions for AIGC services in response to user mobility and time-varying channel conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that DDPG achieves a higher model hit ratio and provides superior-quality, lower-latency AIGC services compared to other benchmark solutions.

**Authors**: Yuda An, Shushu Yi, Bo Mao, Qiao Li, Mingzhe Zhang, Ke Zhou, Nong Xiao, Guangyu Sun, Xiaolin Wang, Yingwei Luo, Jie Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-13T03:28:44Z

**Summary**: Compute Express Link (CXL) serves as a rising industry standard, delivering high-speed cache-coherent links to a variety of devices, including host CPUs, computational accelerators, and memory devices. It is designed to promote system scalability, enable peer-to-peer exchanges, and accelerate data transmissions. To achieve these objectives, the most recent CXL protocol has brought forth several innovative features, such as port-focused routing, device-handled coherence, and PCIe 6.0 compatibility. However, due to the limited availability of hardware prototypes and simulators compatible with CXL, earlier CXL research has largely depended on emulating CXL devices using remote NUMA nodes. Unfortunately, these NUMA-based emulators have difficulties in accurately representing the new features due to fundamental differences in hardware and protocols. Moreover, the absence of support for non-tree topology and PCIe links makes it complex to merely adapt existing simulators for CXL simulation. To overcome these problems, we introduce ESF, a simulation framework specifically designed for CXL systems. ESF has been developed to accurately reflect the unique features of the latest CXL protocol from the ground up. It uses a specialized interconnect layer to facilitate connections within a wide range of system topologies and also includes key components to carry out specific functions required by these features. By utilizing ESF, we thoroughly investigate various aspects of CXL systems, including system topology, device-handled coherence, and the effects of PCIe characteristics, leading to important findings that can guide the creation of high-performance CXL systems. The ESF source codes are fully open-source and can be accessed at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ESF-1CE3.

**Authors**: Jacopo Tagliabue, Ryan Curtin, Ciro Greco

**Updated**: 2024-11-12T21:50:03Z

**Summary**: Data pre-processing pipelines are the bread and butter of any successful AI project. We introduce a novel programming model for pipelines in a data lakehouse, allowing users to interact declaratively with assets in object storage. Motivated by real-world industry usage patterns, we exploit these new abstractions with a columnar and differential cache to maximize iteration speed for data scientists, who spent most of their time in pre-processing - adding or removing features, restricting or relaxing time windows, wrangling current or older datasets. We show how the new cache works transparently across programming languages, schemas and time windows, and provide preliminary evidence on its efficiency on standard data workloads.

### SKVQ: Sliding-window Key and Value Cache Quantization for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Haojie Duanmu, Zhihang Yuan, Xiuhong Li, Jiangfei Duan, Xingcheng Zhang, Dahua Lin

**Updated**: 2024-11-12T08:18:45Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can now handle longer sequences of tokens, enabling complex tasks like book understanding and generating lengthy novels. However, the key-value (KV) cache required for LLMs consumes substantial memory as context length increasing, becoming the bottleneck for deployment. In this paper, we present a strategy called SKVQ, which stands for sliding-window KV cache quantization, to address the issue of extremely low bitwidth KV cache quantization. To achieve this, SKVQ rearranges the channels of the KV cache in order to improve the similarity of channels in quantization groups, and applies clipped dynamic quantization at the group level. Additionally, SKVQ ensures that the most recent window tokens in the KV cache are preserved with high precision. This helps maintain the accuracy of a small but important portion of the KV cache.SKVQ achieves high compression ratios while maintaining accuracy. Our evaluation on LLMs demonstrates that SKVQ surpasses previous quantization approaches, allowing for quantization of the KV cache to 2-bit keys and 1.5-bit values with minimal loss of accuracy. With SKVQ, it is possible to process context lengths of up to 1M on an 80GB memory GPU for a 7b model and up to 7 times faster decoding.

### Leveraging Previous Steps: A Training-free Fast Solver for Flow   Diffusion
**Authors**: Kaiyu Song, Hanjiang Lai

**Updated**: 2024-11-12T08:17:15Z

**Summary**: Flow diffusion models (FDMs) have recently shown potential in generation tasks due to the high generation quality. However, the current ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver for FDMs, e.g., the Euler solver, still suffers from slow generation since ODE solvers need many number function evaluations (NFE) to keep high-quality generation. In this paper, we propose a novel training-free flow-solver to reduce NFE while maintaining high-quality generation. The key insight for the flow-solver is to leverage the previous steps to reduce the NFE, where a cache is created to reuse these results from the previous steps. Specifically, the Taylor expansion is first used to approximate the ODE. To calculate the high-order derivatives of Taylor expansion, the flow-solver proposes to use the previous steps and a polynomial interpolation to approximate it, where the number of orders we could approximate equals the number of previous steps we cached. We also prove that the flow-solver has a more minor approximation error and faster generation speed. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom, LSUN-Church, ImageNet, and real text-to-image generation prove the efficiency of the flow-solver. Specifically, the flow-solver improves the FID-30K from 13.79 to 6.75, from 46.64 to 19.49 with $\text{NFE}=10$ on CIFAR-10 and LSUN-Church, respectively.

### WDMoE: Wireless Distributed Mixture of Experts for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Nan Xue, Yaping Sun, Zhiyong Chen, Meixia Tao, Xiaodong Xu, Liang Qian, Shuguang Cui, Wenjun Zhang, Ping Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-11T02:48:00Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various natural language processing tasks, but the role of wireless networks in supporting LLMs has not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we propose a wireless distributed Mixture of Experts (WDMoE) architecture to enable collaborative deployment of LLMs across edge servers at the base station (BS) and mobile devices in wireless networks. Specifically, we decompose the MoE layer in LLMs by placing the gating network and the preceding neural network layer at BS, while distributing the expert networks among the devices. This deployment leverages the parallel inference capabilities of expert networks on mobile devices, effectively utilizing the limited computing and caching resources of these devices. Accordingly, we develop a performance metric for WDMoE-based LLMs, which accounts for both model capability and latency. To minimize the latency while maintaining accuracy, we jointly optimize expert selection and bandwidth allocation based on the performance metric. Moreover, we build a hardware testbed using NVIDIA Jetson kits to validate the effectiveness of WDMoE. Both theoretical simulations and practical hardware experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the latency without compromising LLM performance.

### Anchor Attention, Small Cache: Code Generation with Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Xiangyu Zhang, Yu Zhou, Guang Yang, Harald C. Gall, Taolue Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-11T02:47:05Z

**Summary**: The development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized automated code generation. However, their high demand of computation resources has hindered a broader deployment and raised environmental concerns. A common strategy for diminishing computational demands is to cache Key-Value (KV) states from the attention mechanism which is adopted predominately by mainstream LLMs. It can mitigate the need of repeated attention computations, but brings significant memory overhead. Current practices in NLP often use sparse attention which may, unfortunately, lead to substantial inaccuracies, or hallucinations, in code generation tasks. In this paper, we analyze the attention weights distribution within code generation models via an empirical study, uncovering a sparsity pattern, i.e., the aggregation of information at specific anchor points. Based on this observation, we propose a novel approach, AnchorCoder, which features token-wise anchor attention designed to extract and compress the contextual information, and layer-wise anchor attention enabling cross-layer communication to mitigate the issue of excessive superposition caused by the compression. The extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of AnchorCoder, which can consistently achieve a significant (at least 70%) reduction in KV cache requirements, while preserving the majority of model's performance.

### An Efficient Memory Module for Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning
**Authors**: Dong Li, Aijia Zhang, Junqi Gao, Biqing Qi

**Updated**: 2024-11-11T01:53:14Z

**Summary**: Incremental graph learning has gained significant attention for its ability to address the catastrophic forgetting problem in graph representation learning. However, traditional methods often rely on a large number of labels for node classification, which is impractical in real-world applications. This makes few-shot incremental learning on graphs a pressing need. Current methods typically require extensive training samples from meta-learning to build memory and perform intensive fine-tuning of GNN parameters, leading to high memory consumption and potential loss of previously learned knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Mecoin, an efficient method for building and maintaining memory. Mecoin employs Structured Memory Units to cache prototypes of learned categories, as well as Memory Construction Modules to update these prototypes for new categories through interactions between the nodes and the cached prototypes. Additionally, we have designed a Memory Representation Adaptation Module to store probabilities associated with each class prototype, reducing the need for parameter fine-tuning and lowering the forgetting rate. When a sample matches its corresponding class prototype, the relevant probabilities are retrieved from the MRaM. Knowledge is then distilled back into the GNN through a Graph Knowledge Distillation Module, preserving the model's memory. We analyze the effectiveness of Mecoin in terms of generalization error and explore the impact of different distillation strategies on model performance through experiments and VC-dimension analysis. Compared to other related works, Mecoin shows superior performance in accuracy and forgetting rate. Our code is publicly available on the https://github.com/Arvin0313/Mecoin-GFSCIL.git .

**Authors**: Amy Yang, Jingyi Yang, Aya Ibrahim, Xinfeng Xie, Bangsheng Tang, Grigory Sizov, Jeremy Reizenstein, Jongsoo Park, Jianyu Huang

**Updated**: 2024-11-10T23:04:12Z

**Summary**: We present context parallelism for long-context large language model inference, which achieves near-linear scaling for long-context prefill latency with up to 128 H100 GPUs across 16 nodes. Particularly, our method achieves 1M context prefill with Llama3 405B model in 77s (93% parallelization efficiency, 63% FLOPS utilization) and 128K context prefill in 3.8s. We develop two lossless exact ring attention variants: pass-KV and pass-Q to cover a wide range of use cases with the state-of-the-art performance: full prefill, persistent KV prefill and decode. Benchmarks on H100 GPU hosts inter-connected with RDMA and TCP both show similar scalability for long-context prefill, demonstrating that our method scales well using common commercial data center with medium-to-low inter-host bandwidth.

### GastCoCo: Graph Storage and Coroutine-Based Prefetch Co-Design for   Dynamic Graph Processing
**Authors**: Hongfu Li

**Updated**: 2024-11-10T15:58:07Z

**Summary**: An efficient data structure is fundamental to meeting the growing demands in dynamic graph processing. However, the dual requirements for graph computation efficiency (with contiguous structures) and graph update efficiency (with linked list-like structures) present a conflict in the design principles of graph structures. After experimental studies of existing state-of-the-art dynamic graph structures, we observe that the overhead of cache misses accounts for a major portion of the graph computation time. This paper presents GastCoCo, a system with graph storage and coroutine-based prefetch co-design. By employing software prefetching via stackless coroutines and introducing a prefetch-friendly data structure CBList, GastCoCo significantly alleviates the performance degradation caused by cache misses. Our results show that GastCoCo outperforms state-of-the-art graph storage systems by 1.3x - 180x in graph updates and 1.4x - 41.1x in graph computation.

### Ada-VE: Training-Free Consistent Video Editing Using Adaptive Motion   Prior
**Authors**: Tanvir Mahmud, Mustafa Munir, Radu Marculescu, Diana Marculescu

**Updated**: 2024-11-10T10:08:37Z

**Summary**: Video-to-video synthesis poses significant challenges in maintaining character consistency, smooth temporal transitions, and preserving visual quality during fast motion. While recent fully cross-frame self-attention mechanisms have improved character consistency across multiple frames, they come with high computational costs and often include redundant operations, especially for videos with higher frame rates. To address these inefficiencies, we propose an adaptive motion-guided cross-frame attention mechanism that selectively reduces redundant computations. This enables a greater number of cross-frame attentions over more frames within the same computational budget, thereby enhancing both video quality and temporal coherence. Our method leverages optical flow to focus on moving regions while sparsely attending to stationary areas, allowing for the joint editing of more frames without increasing computational demands. Traditional frame interpolation techniques struggle with motion blur and flickering in intermediate frames, which compromises visual fidelity. To mitigate this, we introduce KV-caching for jointly edited frames, reusing keys and values across intermediate frames to preserve visual quality and maintain temporal consistency throughout the video. With our adaptive cross-frame self-attention approach, we achieve a threefold increase in the number of keyframes processed compared to existing methods, all within the same computational budget as fully cross-frame attention baselines. This results in significant improvements in prediction accuracy and temporal consistency, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches. Code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/tanvir-utexas/AdaVE/tree/main

**Authors**: Song Yu, Shufeng Gong, Qian Tao, Sijie Shen, Yanfeng Zhang, Wenyuan Yu, Pengxi Liu, Zhixin Zhang, Hongfu Li, Xiaojian Luo, Ge Yu, Jingren Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-11-10T08:31:18Z

**Summary**: The growing volume of graph data may exhaust the main memory. It is crucial to design a disk-based graph storage system to ingest updates and analyze graphs efficiently. However, existing dynamic graph storage systems suffer from read or write amplification and face the challenge of optimizing both read and write performance simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose LSMGraph, a novel dynamic graph storage system that combines the write-friendly LSM-tree and the read-friendly CSR. It leverages the multi-level structure of LSM-trees to optimize write performance while utilizing the compact CSR structures embedded in the LSM-trees to boost read performance. LSMGraph uses a new memory structure, MemGraph, to efficiently cache graph updates and uses a multi-level index to speed up reads within the multi-level structure. Furthermore, LSMGraph incorporates a vertex-grained version control mechanism to mitigate the impact of LSM-tree compaction on read performance and ensure the correctness of concurrent read and write operations. Our evaluation shows that LSMGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (graph) storage systems on both graph update and graph analytical workloads.

### EcoServe: Maximizing Multi-Resource Utilization with SLO Guarantees in   LLM Serving
**Authors**: Haiying Shen, Tanmoy Sen

**Updated**: 2024-11-10T05:12:51Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to grow, reducing costs and alleviating GPU demands has become increasingly critical. However, existing schedulers primarily target either GPU compute or Key-Value Cache (KVC) utilization, failing to fully optimize both GPU compute and KVC usage during each iteration or guarantee timely KVC allocations when needed. To address these challenges, we conducted a trace-based experimental analysis and made insightful observations, leading to the design of a system called EcoServe. EcoServe maximizes multi-resource utilization while ensuring service-level objective (SLO) guarantees in LLM serving. To enable adding prompts to a batch to maximize GPU utilization in each iteration, EcoServe maintains separate waiting queues for prompt processing tasks (PTs) and generation tasks (GTs). It batches GTs with the same predicted response lengths (RL) to save scheduling time and allocates KVC space for the predicted RL to avoid KVC allocation failures. It further has a novel KVC pipelining method, allowing sharing allocated but unused KVC space to enhance KVC utilization. In addition, it prioritizes queued requests that occupy more KVC to release KVC earlier and satisfy request service-level-objective (SLO). Experimental results demonstrate that EcoServe increases throughput by up to 4$\times$ with the same level of latency, generates up to 91\% lower job completion time and up to 91\% higher SLO satisfaction ratio compared to vLLM. It also reduces the number of GPUs used in DistServe by up to 78\% while maintaining the same level of goodput.

### Eigen Attention: Attention in Low-Rank Space for KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Utkarsh Saxena, Gobinda Saha, Sakshi Choudhary, Kaushik Roy

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:29:33Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the domain of natural language processing due to their impressive reasoning abilities. Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the context lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex tasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new bottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen Attention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby reducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we demonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache sizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop in performance. Code is available at https://github.com/UtkarshSaxena1/EigenAttn.

### AcceLLM: Accelerating LLM Inference using Redundancy for Load Balancing   and Data Locality
**Authors**: Ilias Bournias, Lukas Cavigelli, Georgios Zacharopoulos

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T13:24:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference on large-scale systems is expected to dominate future cloud infrastructures. Efficient LLM inference in cloud environments with numerous AI accelerators is challenging, necessitating extensive optimizations for optimal performance. Current systems batch prefill and decoding to boost throughput but encounter latency issues, while others disaggregate these phases, leading to resource underutilization. We propose AcceLLM, a novel method addressing latency and load balancing, inspired by the cache data management. It strategically utilizes redundant data to enhance inference via load balancing and optimal hardware use. Simulated evaluations on Nvidia H100 GPU and Huawei Ascend 910B2 show AcceLLM surpasses state-of-the-art systems up to 30% in latency and efficiency, handling diverse workloads effectively.

### GPT Semantic Cache: Reducing LLM Costs and Latency via Semantic   Embedding Caching
**Authors**: Sajal Regmi, Chetan Phakami Pun

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T02:21:19Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT (Radford et al., 2019), have significantly advanced artificial intelligence by enabling sophisticated natural language understanding and generation. However, the high computational and financial costs associated with frequent API calls to these models present a substantial bottleneck, especially for applications like customer service chatbots that handle repetitive queries. In this paper, we introduce GPT Semantic Cache, a method that leverages semantic caching of query embeddings in in-memory storage (Redis). By storing embeddings of user queries, our approach efficiently identifies semantically similar questions, allowing for the retrieval of pre-generated responses without redundant API calls to the LLM. This technique reduces operational costs and improves response times, enhancing the efficiency of LLM-powered applications.

### Loki: Low-rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention
**Authors**: Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, Soheil Feizi, Abhinav Bhatele

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T18:58:50Z

**Summary**: Inference on large language models (LLMs) can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in LLM inference contributes significantly to these costs, which has sparked an interest in approximating the self-attention computation to reduce such costs. In this work, we propose to approximate self-attention by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to speed up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs while maintaining the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.

### BitNet a4.8: 4-bit Activations for 1-bit LLMs
**Authors**: Hongyu Wang, Shuming Ma, Furu Wei

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T18:41:50Z

**Summary**: Recent research on the 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BitNet b1.58, presents a promising direction for reducing the inference cost of LLMs while maintaining their performance. In this work, we introduce BitNet a4.8, enabling 4-bit activations for 1-bit LLMs. BitNet a4.8 employs a hybrid quantization and sparsification strategy to mitigate the quantization errors introduced by the outlier channels. Specifically, we utilize 4-bit activations for inputs to the attention and feed-forward network layers, while sparsifying intermediate states followed with 8-bit quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BitNet a4.8 achieves performance comparable to BitNet b1.58 with equivalent training costs, while being faster in inference with enabling 4-bit (INT4/FP4) kernels. Additionally, BitNet a4.8 activates only 55% of parameters and supports 3-bit KV cache, further enhancing the efficiency of large-scale LLM deployment and inference.

### Adaptive Caching for Faster Video Generation with Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Kumara Kahatapitiya, Haozhe Liu, Sen He, Ding Liu, Menglin Jia, Chenyang Zhang, Michael S. Ryoo, Tian Xie

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T17:06:32Z

**Summary**: Generating temporally-consistent high-fidelity videos can be computationally expensive, especially over longer temporal spans. More-recent Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) -- despite making significant headway in this context -- have only heightened such challenges as they rely on larger models and heavier attention mechanisms, resulting in slower inference speeds. In this paper, we introduce a training-free method to accelerate video DiTs, termed Adaptive Caching (AdaCache), which is motivated by the fact that "not all videos are created equal": meaning, some videos require fewer denoising steps to attain a reasonable quality than others. Building on this, we not only cache computations through the diffusion process, but also devise a caching schedule tailored to each video generation, maximizing the quality-latency trade-off. We further introduce a Motion Regularization (MoReg) scheme to utilize video information within AdaCache, essentially controlling the compute allocation based on motion content. Altogether, our plug-and-play contributions grant significant inference speedups (e.g. up to 4.7x on Open-Sora 720p - 2s video generation) without sacrificing the generation quality, across multiple video DiT baselines.

### JC5A: Service Delay Minimization for Aerial MEC-assisted Industrial   Cyber-Physical Systems
**Authors**: Geng Sun, Jiaxu Wu, Long He, Jiacheng Wang, Dusit Niyato, Abbas Jamalipour, Shiwen Mao

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T14:59:44Z

**Summary**: In the era of the sixth generation (6G) and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), an industrial cyber-physical system (ICPS) drives the proliferation of sensor devices and computing-intensive tasks. To address the limited resources of IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and cost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs). However, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and computation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges, including the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources, stringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board energy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative aerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing capabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a service delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP). Since the SDMOP is proved to be an NP-hard problem, we propose a joint computation offloading, caching, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control approach (JC5A). Specifically, JC5A consists of a block successive upper bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUMM) for computation offloading and service caching, a convex optimization-based method for communication and computation resource allocation, and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method for UAV trajectory control. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence and polynomial complexity of JC5A. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior system performance compared to the benchmark approaches and algorithms.

### CapS-Adapter: Caption-based MultiModal Adapter in Zero-Shot   Classification
**Authors**: Qijie Wang, Guandu Liu, Bin Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T09:33:40Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in vision-language foundational models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated significant strides in zero-shot classification. However, the extensive parameterization of models like CLIP necessitates a resource-intensive fine-tuning process. In response, TIP-Adapter and SuS-X have introduced training-free methods aimed at bolstering the efficacy of downstream tasks. While these approaches incorporate support sets to maintain data distribution consistency between knowledge cache and test sets, they often fall short in terms of generalization on the test set, particularly when faced with test data exhibiting substantial distributional variations. In this work, we present CapS-Adapter, an innovative method that employs a caption-based support set, effectively harnessing both image and caption features to exceed existing state-of-the-art techniques in training-free scenarios. CapS-Adapter adeptly constructs support sets that closely mirror target distributions, utilizing instance-level distribution features extracted from multimodal large models. By leveraging CLIP's single and cross-modal strengths, CapS-Adapter enhances predictive accuracy through the use of multimodal support sets. Our method achieves outstanding zero-shot classification results across 19 benchmark datasets, improving accuracy by 2.19\% over the previous leading method. Our contributions are substantiated through extensive validation on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance and robust generalization capabilities. Our code is made publicly available at https://github.com/WLuLi/CapS-Adapter.

### HEXA-MoE: Efficient and Heterogeneous-aware MoE Acceleration with ZERO   Computation Redundancy
**Authors**: Shuqing Luo, Jie Peng, Pingzhi Li, Tianlong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T06:40:40Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a practical approach to scale up parameters for the Transformer model to achieve better generalization while maintaining a sub-linear increase in computation overhead. Current MoE models are mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it usually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy communication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore developing a \texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \texttt{EX}pert \texttt{A}llocation framework, \textbf{\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing efficiency. It contains two components: ($1$) \textit{Expert-Specific Operators}. We replace the typical general matrix multiplication or grouped matrix multiplication interfaces with our operators, which allows the computing to be performed in an in-place manner with \textbf{ZERO} redundancy. ($2$) \textit{Adaptive Data- and Model-Centric Configurations} for different workload scales. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline-shared cache on each device to tackle the heavy memory consumption in the existing data-centric MoE library. Comprehensive experiments on the Swin-MoE benchmark consistently reveal the effectiveness of our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} framework, i.e., reducing $10\%\sim48\%$ memory consumption and achieving $0.5\sim4.3\times$ speed up compared to current state-of-the-art MoE libraries. Furthermore, we examine our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} with heterogeneous devices for both data- and model-centric settings. Promising results show that employing optimal parallel configuration with \texttt{HEXA-MoE} on heterogeneous devices can substantially minimize overall latency. Codes are available at https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/HEXA-MoE.

### Reducing Hyperparameter Tuning Costs in ML, Vision and Language Model   Training Pipelines via Memoization-Awareness
**Authors**: Abdelmajid Essofi, Ridwan Salahuddeen, Munachiso Nwadike, Elnura Zhalieva, Kun Zhang, Eric Xing, Willie Neiswanger, Qirong Ho

**Updated**: 2024-11-06T07:53:04Z

**Summary**: The training or fine-tuning of machine learning, vision, and language models is often implemented as a pipeline: a sequence of stages encompassing data preparation, model training and evaluation. In this paper, we exploit pipeline structures to reduce the cost of hyperparameter tuning for model training/fine-tuning, which is particularly valuable for language models given their high costs in GPU-days. We propose a "memoization-aware" Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm, EEIPU, that works in tandem with a pipeline caching system, allowing it to evaluate significantly more hyperparameter candidates per GPU-day than other tuning algorithms. The result is better-quality hyperparameters in the same amount of search time, or equivalently, reduced search time to reach the same hyperparameter quality. In our benchmarks on machine learning (model ensembles), vision (convolutional architecture) and language (T5 architecture) pipelines, we compare EEIPU against recent BO algorithms: EEIPU produces an average of $103\%$ more hyperparameter candidates (within the same budget), and increases the validation metric by an average of $108\%$ more than other algorithms (where the increase is measured starting from the end of warm-up iterations).

### The Early Bird Catches the Leak: Unveiling Timing Side Channels in LLM   Serving Systems
**Authors**: Linke Song, Zixuan Pang, Wenhao Wang, Zihao Wang, XiaoFeng Wang, Hongbo Chen, Wei Song, Yier Jin, Dan Meng, Rui Hou

**Updated**: 2024-11-06T07:12:55Z

**Summary**: The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.

### HOBBIT: A Mixed Precision Expert Offloading System for Fast MoE   Inference
**Authors**: Peng Tang, Jiacheng Liu, Xiaofeng Hou, Yifei Pu, Jing Wang, Pheng-Ann Heng, Chao Li, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-11-06T01:49:45Z

**Summary**: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has demonstrated significant advantages in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), offering enhanced capabilities with reduced inference costs. However, deploying MoE-based LLMs on memoryconstrained edge devices remains challenging due to their substantial memory requirements. While existing expertoffloading methods alleviate the memory requirements, they often incur significant expert-loading costs or compromise model accuracy. We present HOBBIT, a mixed precision expert offloading system to enable flexible and efficient MoE inference. Our key insight is that dynamically replacing less critical cache-miss experts with low precision versions can substantially reduce expert-loading latency while preserving model accuracy. HOBBIT introduces three innovative techniques that map the natural hierarchy of MoE computation: (1) a token-level dynamic expert loading mechanism, (2) a layer-level adaptive expert prefetching technique, and (3) a sequence-level multidimensional expert caching policy. These innovations fully leverage the benefits of mixedprecision expert inference. By implementing HOBBIT on top of the renowned LLM inference framework Llama.cpp, we evaluate its performance across different edge devices with representative MoE models. The results demonstrate that HOBBIT achieves up to a 9.93x speedup in decoding compared to state-of-the-art MoE offloading systems.

**Updated**: 2024-11-05T08:34:44Z

**Summary**: Non-terrestrial networks (NTN) have emerged as a transformative solution to bridge the digital divide and deliver essential services to remote and underserved areas. In this context, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations offer remarkable potential for efficient cache content broadcast in remote regions, thereby extending the reach of digital services. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN. Despite wide coverage, the varying NTN transmission capabilities must be carefully aligned with each content placement to maximize broadcast efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN, positioning NTN as a complement to TN for achieving optimal content broadcasting. Specifically, we dynamically select content for placement via NTN links. This selection is based on popularity and suitability for delivery through NTN, while considering the orbital motion of LEO satellites. Our system-level case studies, based on a practical LEO constellation, demonstrate the significant improvement in placement speed compared to existing methods, which neglect network mobility. We also demonstrate that NTN links significantly outperform standalone wireless TN solutions, particularly in the early stages of content delivery. This advantage is amplified when there is a higher correlation of content popularity across geographical regions.

### TokenSelect: Efficient Long-Context Inference and Length Extrapolation   for LLMs via Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection
**Authors**: Wei Wu, Zhuoshi Pan, Chao Wang, Liyi Chen, Yunchu Bai, Kun Fu, Zheng Wang, Hui Xiong

**Updated**: 2024-11-05T07:56:24Z

**Summary**: With the development of large language models (LLMs), the ability to handle longer contexts has become a key capability for Web applications such as cross-document understanding and LLM-powered search systems. However, this progress faces two major challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues hinder the application of LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a model-agnostic, training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using Query-Key dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a small number of critical KV cache tokens in the attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we designed the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented efficient dot product kernel, significantly reducing the overhead of token selection. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to 23.84x speedup in attention computation and up to 2.28x acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.

**Authors**: Yuhan Liu, Esha Choukse, Shan Lu, Junchen Jiang, Madan Musuvathi

**Updated**: 2024-11-05T05:41:41Z

**Summary**: In multi-agent systems utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), communication between agents traditionally relies on natural language. This communication often includes the full context of the query so far, which can introduce significant prefill-phase latency, especially with long contexts.   We introduce DroidSpeak, a novel framework to target this cross-LLM communication by leveraging the reuse of intermediate data, such as input embeddings (E-cache) and key-value caches (KV-cache). We efficiently bypass the need to reprocess entire contexts for fine-tuned versions of the same foundational model. This approach allows faster context integration while maintaining the quality of task performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate DroidSpeak's ability to significantly accelerate inter-agent communication, achieving up to a 2.78x speedup in prefill latency with negligible loss in accuracy. Our findings underscore the potential to create more efficient and scalable multi-agent systems.

### Kilovolt Pyroelectric Voltage Generation and Electrostatic Actuation   With Fluidic Heating
**Authors**: Di Ni, Ved Gund, Landon Ivy, Amit Lal

**Updated**: 2024-11-04T17:21:58Z

**Summary**: Integrated micro power generators are crucial components for micro robotic platforms to demonstrate untethered operation and to achieve autonomy. Current micro robotic electrostatic actuators typically require hundreds to thousands of voltages to output sufficient work. Pyroelectricity is one such source of high voltages that can be scaled to small form factors. This paper demonstrates a distributed pyroelectric high voltage generation mechanism to power kV actuators using alternating exposure of crystals to hot and cold water (300C to 900C water temperature). Using this fluidic temperature control, a pyroelectrically generated voltage of 2470 V was delivered to a 2 pF storage capacitor yielding a 6.10 {\mu}J stored energy. A maximum energy of 17.46 {\mu}J was delivered to a 47 pF capacitor at 861 V. The recirculating water can be used to heat a distributed array of converters to generate electricity in distant robotic actuator sections. The development of this distributed system would enable untethered micro-robot to be operated with a flexible body and free of battery recharging, which advances its applications in the real world.

### TME-Box: Scalable In-Process Isolation through Intel TME-MK Memory   Encryption
**Authors**: Martin Unterguggenberger, Lukas Lamster, David Schrammel, Martin Schwarzl, Stefan Mangard

**Updated**: 2024-11-04T12:14:07Z

**Summary**: Efficient cloud computing relies on in-process isolation to optimize performance by running workloads within a single process. Without heavy-weight process isolation, memory safety errors pose a significant security threat by allowing an adversary to extract or corrupt the private data of other co-located tenants. Existing in-process isolation mechanisms are not suitable for modern cloud requirements, e.g., MPK's 16 protection domains are insufficient to isolate thousands of cloud workers per process. Consequently, cloud service providers have a strong need for lightweight in-process isolation on commodity x86 machines.   This paper presents TME-Box, a novel isolation technique that enables fine-grained and scalable sandboxing on commodity x86 CPUs. By repurposing Intel TME-MK, which is intended for the encryption of virtual machines, TME-Box offers lightweight and efficient in-process isolation. TME-Box enforces that sandboxes use their designated encryption keys for memory interactions through compiler instrumentation. This cryptographic isolation enables fine-grained access control, from single cache lines to full pages, and supports flexible data relocation. In addition, the design of TME-Box allows the efficient isolation of up to 32K concurrent sandboxes. We present a performance-optimized TME-Box prototype, utilizing x86 segment-based addressing, that showcases geomean performance overheads of 5.2 % for data isolation and 9.7 % for code and data isolation, evaluated with the SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite.

### Diversity in Network-Friendly Recommendations
**Authors**: Evangelia Tzimpimpaki, Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos

**Updated**: 2024-11-04T09:40:27Z

**Summary**: In recent years, the Internet has been dominated by content-rich platforms, employing recommendation systems to provide users with more appealing content (e.g., videos in YouTube, movies in Netflix). While traditional content recommendations are oblivious to network conditions, the paradigm of Network-Friendly Recommendations (NFR) has recently emerged, favoring content that improves network performance (e.g. cached near the user), while still being appealing to the user. However, NFR algorithms sometimes achieve their goal by shrinking the pool of content recommended to users. The undesirable side-effect is reduced content diversity, a phenomenon known as ``content/filter bubble''. This reduced diversity is problematic for both users, who are prevented from exploring a broader range of content, and content creators (e.g. YouTubers) whose content may be recommended less frequently, leading to perceived unfairness. In this paper, we first investigate - using real data and state-of-the-art NFR schemes - the extent of this phenomenon. We then formulate a ``Diverse-NFR'' optimization problem (i.e., network-friendly recommendations with - sufficient - content diversity), and through a series of transformation steps, we manage to reduce it to a linear program that can be solved fast and optimally. Our findings show that Diverse-NFR can achieve high network gains (comparable to non-diverse NFR) while maintaining diversity constraints. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that incorporates diversity issues into network-friendly recommendation algorithms.

**Authors**: X. -H. Wang, G. Shu, H. Qian, X. Li, Z. Liu, Z. Jiang, H. Meng, C. Xing, Q. Zhou, H. Deng

**Updated**: 2024-11-04T02:35:03Z

**Summary**: The room temperature continuous wave (CW) very-high-frequency (VHF) gun is one of the candidates for the electron gun of the high-repetition-rate free-electron lasers (FELs). The VHF gun operates with a cathode gradient of ~ 20 MV/m and an accelerating voltage of ~ 750 kV. The gun dark current emission leads to beam loss along the FEL machine, therefore is a critical parameter for the performance of the CW gun. In this paper, we presents a systematic study of the dark current reduction of the VHF gun, including cathode region optimizations, dark current tracking simulations and measurements. Over-inserted cathode plugs were tested in two VHF guns of different acceleration gap sizes, and both demonstrated significant dark current reduction ratios of more than two orders of magnitude.

### Palu: Compressing KV-Cache with Low-Rank Projection
**Authors**: Chi-Chih Chang, Wei-Cheng Lin, Chien-Yu Lin, Chong-Yan Chen, Yu-Fang Hu, Pei-Shuo Wang, Ning-Chi Huang, Luis Ceze, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah, Kai-Chiang Wu

**Updated**: 2024-11-04T02:08:55Z

**Summary**: Post-training KV-Cache compression methods typically either sample a subset of effectual tokens or quantize the data into lower numerical bit width. However, these methods cannot exploit redundancy in the hidden dimension of the KV tensors. This paper presents a hidden dimension compression approach called Palu, a KV-Cache compression framework that utilizes low-rank projection to reduce inference-time LLM memory usage. Palu decomposes the linear layers into low-rank matrices, caches compressed intermediate states, and reconstructs the full keys and values on the fly. To improve accuracy, compression rate, and efficiency, Palu further encompasses (1) a medium-grained low-rank decomposition scheme, (2) an efficient rank search algorithm, (3) low-rank-aware quantization compatibility enhancements, and (4) optimized GPU kernels with operators fusion. Extensive experiments with popular LLMs show that Palu compresses KV-Cache by 50% while maintaining strong accuracy and delivering up to 1.89x on the RoPE-based attention module. When combined with quantization, Palu's inherent quantization-friendly design yields small to negligible extra accuracy degradation while saving additional memory than quantization-only methods and achieving up to 2.91x speedup for the RoPE-based attention. Moreover, it maintains comparable or even better accuracy (up to 1.19 lower perplexity) compared to quantization-only methods. These results demonstrate Palu's superior capability to effectively address the efficiency and memory challenges of LLM inference posed by KV-Cache.

### A Simple and Effective $L_2$ Norm-Based Strategy for KV Cache   Compression
**Authors**: Alessio Devoto, Yu Zhao, Simone Scardapane, Pasquale Minervini

**Updated**: 2024-11-03T09:42:35Z

**Summary**: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often hindered by the extensive memory requirements of the Key-Value (KV) cache, especially as context lengths increase. Existing approaches to reduce the KV cache size involve either fine-tuning the model to learn a compression strategy or leveraging attention scores to reduce the sequence length. We analyse the attention distributions in decoder-only Transformers-based models and observe that attention allocation patterns stay consistent across most layers. Surprisingly, we find a clear correlation between the $L_2$ and the attention scores over cached KV pairs, where a low $L_2$ of a key embedding usually leads to a high attention score during decoding. This finding indicates that the influence of a KV pair is potentially determined by the key embedding itself before being queried. Based on this observation, we compress the KV cache based on the $L_2$ of key embeddings. Our experimental results show that this simple strategy can reduce the KV cache size by 50% on language modelling and needle-in-a-haystack tasks and 90% on passkey retrieval tasks without losing accuracy. Moreover, without relying on the attention scores, this approach remains compatible with FlashAttention, enabling broader applicability.

### Two-Timescale Model Caching and Resource Allocation for Edge-Enabled   AI-Generated Content Services
**Authors**: Zhang Liu, Hongyang Du, Xiangwang Hou, Lianfen Huang, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, Dusit Niyato, Khaled Ben Letaief

**Updated**: 2024-11-03T07:01:13Z

**Summary**: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology, enabling customized and personalized AI-generated content (AIGC) services. In this paper, we address challenges of edge-enabled AIGC service provisioning, which remain underexplored in the literature. These services require executing GenAI models with billions of parameters, posing significant obstacles to resource-limited wireless edge. We subsequently introduce the formulation of joint model caching and resource allocation for AIGC services to balance a trade-off between AIGC quality and latency metrics. We obtain mathematical relationships of these metrics with the computational resources required by GenAI models via experimentation. Afterward, we decompose the formulation into a model caching subproblem on a long-timescale and a resource allocation subproblem on a short-timescale. Since the variables to be solved are discrete and continuous, respectively, we leverage a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm to solve the former subproblem and propose a diffusion-based deep deterministic policy gradient (D3PG) algorithm to solve the latter. The proposed D3PG algorithm makes an innovative use of diffusion models as the actor network to determine optimal resource allocation decisions. Consequently, we integrate these two learning methods within the overarching two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (T2DRL) algorithm, the performance of which is studied through comparative numerical simulations.

### Disaggregated Database Management Systems
**Authors**: Shahram Ghandeharizadeh, Philip A. Bernstein, Dhruba Borthakur, Haoyu Huang, Jai Menon, Sumit Puri

**Updated**: 2024-11-02T14:40:36Z

**Summary**: Modern applications demand high performance and cost efficient database management systems (DBMSs). Their workloads may be diverse, ranging from online transaction processing to analytics and decision support. The cloud infrastructure enables disaggregation of monolithic DBMSs into components that facilitate software-hardware co-design. This is realized using pools of hardware resources, i.e., CPUs, GPUs, memory, FPGA, NVM, etc., connected using high-speed networks. This disaggregation trend is being adopted by cloud DBMSs because hardware re-provisioning can be achieved by simply invoking software APIs. Disaggregated DBMSs separate processing from storage, enabling each to scale elastically and independently. They may disaggregate compute usage based on functionality, e.g., compute needed for writes from compute needed for queries and compute needed for compaction. They may also use disaggregated memory, e.g., for intermediate results in a shuffle or for remote caching. The DBMS monitors the characteristics of a workload and dynamically assembles its components that are most efficient and cost effective for the workload. This paper is a summary of a panel session that discussed the capability, challenges, and opportunities of these emerging DBMSs and disaggregated hardware systems.

### CAMP: A Cost Adaptive Multi-Queue Eviction Policy for Key-Value Stores
**Authors**: Shahram Ghandeharizadeh, Sandy Irani, Jenny Lam, Jason Yap

**Updated**: 2024-11-02T13:52:49Z

**Summary**: Cost Adaptive Multi-queue eviction Policy (CAMP) is an algorithm for a general purpose key-value store (KVS) that manages key-value pairs computed by applications with different access patterns, key-value sizes, and varying costs for each key-value pair. CAMP is an approximation of the Greedy Dual Size (GDS) algorithm that can be implemented as efficiently as LRU. In particular, CAMP's eviction policies are as effective as those of GDS but require only a small fraction of the updates to an internal data structure in order to make those decisions. Similar to an implementation of LRU using queues, it adapts to changing workload patterns based on the history of requests for different key-value pairs. It is superior to LRU because it considers both the size and cost of key-value pairs to maximize the utility of the available memory across competing applications. We compare CAMP with both LRU and an alternative that requires human intervention to partition memory into pools and assign grouping of key-value pairs to different pools. The results demonstrate CAMP is as fast as LRU while outperforming both LRU and the pooled alternative. We also present results from an implementation of CAMP using Twitter's version of memcached.

### NEO: Saving GPU Memory Crisis with CPU Offloading for Online LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Xuanlin Jiang, Yang Zhou, Shiyi Cao, Ion Stoica, Minlan Yu

**Updated**: 2024-11-02T05:15:44Z

**Summary**: Online LLM inference powers many exciting applications such as intelligent chatbots and autonomous agents. Modern LLM inference engines widely rely on request batching to improve inference throughput, aiming to make it cost-efficient when running on expensive GPU accelerators. However, the limited GPU memory has largely limited the batch size achieved in practice, leaving significant GPU compute resources wasted.   We present NEO, an online LLM inference system that offloads part of attention compute and KV cache states from the GPU to the local host CPU, effectively increasing the GPU batch size and thus inference throughput. To this end, NEO proposes asymmetric GPU-CPU pipelining and load-aware scheduling to balance GPU and CPU loads and fully utilize their compute and memory resources. We evaluate NEO on a wide range of workloads (i.e., code generation, text summarization), GPUs (i.e., T4, A10G, H100), and LLM models (i.e., 7B, 8B, 70B). NEO achieves up to 7.5$\times$, 26%, and 14% higher throughput compared to GPU-only approach on T4, A10G, and H100 GPUs, respectively, while maintaining the same latency; with more powerful CPUs, NEO achieves up to 79.3% throughput gain on A10G GPU.

### XC-Cache: Cross-Attending to Cached Context for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: João Monteiro, Étienne Marcotte, Pierre-André Noël, Valentina Zantedeschi, David Vázquez, Nicolas Chapados, Christopher Pal, Perouz Taslakian

**Updated**: 2024-11-01T14:56:52Z

**Summary**: In-context learning (ICL) approaches typically leverage prompting to condition decoder-only language model generation on reference information. Just-in-time processing of a context is inefficient due to the quadratic cost of self-attention operations, and caching is desirable. However, caching transformer states can easily require almost as much space as the model parameters. When the right context isn't known in advance, caching ICL can be challenging. This work addresses these limitations by introducing models that, inspired by the encoder-decoder architecture, use cross-attention to condition generation on reference text without the prompt. More precisely, we leverage pre-trained decoder-only models and only train a small number of added layers. We use Question-Answering (QA) as a testbed to evaluate the ability of our models to perform conditional generation and observe that they outperform ICL, are comparable to fine-tuned prompted LLMs, and drastically reduce the space footprint relative to standard KV caching by two orders of magnitude.

### Block Transformer: Global-to-Local Language Modeling for Fast Inference
**Authors**: Namgyu Ho, Sangmin Bae, Taehyeon Kim, Hyunjik Jo, Yireun Kim, Tal Schuster, Adam Fisch, James Thorne, Se-Young Yun

**Updated**: 2024-11-01T08:52:18Z

**Summary**: We introduce the Block Transformer which adopts hierarchical global-to-local modeling to autoregressive transformers to mitigate the inference bottlenecks associated with self-attention. Self-attention requires the key-value (KV) cache of all previous sequences to be retrieved from memory at every decoding step to retrieve context information, leading to two primary bottlenecks during batch inference. First, there is a significant delay in obtaining the first token, as the information of the entire prompt must first be processed to prefill the KV cache. Second, computation of subsequent tokens is bottlenecked by the high memory I/O demand of fetching the entire KV cache, which grows linearly with sequence length, incurring quadratic memory reads overall. We design the Block Transformer to strategically mitigate these costs, by incorporating coarsity and locality into an integrated global-to-local architecture. At the lower layers, we aggregate tokens into fixed size blocks to apply attention across the entire sequence at coarse-grained detail, to capture the global context while minimizing KV cache overhead. At upper layers, we apply attention within each block to decode individual tokens, to model fine-grained details with a lightweight local KV cache. We pretrain vanilla and Block Transformers from scratch and demonstrate that Block Transformers reach 10--20x inference throughput compared to vanilla transformers with equivalent perplexity and zero-shot task performance. Code is available at https://github.com/itsnamgyu/block-transformer.

### Two Dimensional Hidden Surface Removal with Frame-to-frame Coherence
**Authors**: John Whitington

**Updated**: 2024-10-31T18:31:13Z

**Summary**: We describe a hidden surface removal algorithm for two-dimensional layered scenes built from arbitrary primitives, particularly suited to interaction and animation in rich scenes (for example, in illustration). The method makes use of a set-based raster representation to implement a front-to-back rendering model which analyses and dramatically reduces the amount of rasterization and composition required to render a scene. The method is extended to add frame-to-frame coherence analysis and caching for interactive or animated scenes. A powerful system of primitive-combiners called filters is described, which preserves the efficiencies of the algorithm in highly complicated scenes. The set representation is extended to solve the problem of correlated mattes, leading to an efficient solution for high quality antialiasing. A prototype implementation has been prepared.

### Novel Architecture for Distributed Travel Data Integration and Service   Provision Using Microservices
**Authors**: Biman Barua, M. Shamim Kaiser

**Updated**: 2024-10-31T17:41:14Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a microservices architecture for the purpose of enhancing the flexibility and performance of an airline reservation system. The architectural design incorporates Redis cache technologies, two different messaging systems (Kafka and RabbitMQ), two types of storages (MongoDB, and PostgreSQL). It also introduces authorization techniques, including secure communication through OAuth2 and JWT which is essential with the management of high-demand travel services. According to selected indicators, the architecture provides an impressive level of data consistency at 99.5% and a latency of data propagation of less than 75 ms allowing rapid and reliable intercommunication between microservices. A system throughput of 1050 events per second was achieved so that the acceptability level was maintained even during peak time. Redis caching reduced a 92% cache hit ratio on the database thereby lowering the burden on the database and increasing the speed of response. Further improvement of the systems scalability was done through the use of Docker and Kubernetes which enabled services to be expanded horizontally to cope with the changes in demand. The error rates were very low, at 0.2% further enhancing the efficiency of the system in handling real-time data integration. This approach is suggested to meet the specific needs of the airline reservation system. It is secure, fast, scalable, all serving to improve the user experience as well as the efficiency of operations. The low latency and high data integration levels and prevaiing efficient usage of the resources demonstrates the architecture ability to offer continued support in the ever growing high demand situations.

### MemANNS: Enhancing Billion-Scale ANNS Efficiency with Practical PIM   Hardware
**Authors**: Sitian Chen, Amelie Chi Zhou, Yucheng Shi, Yusen Li, Xin Yao

**Updated**: 2024-10-31T10:45:02Z

**Summary**: In numerous production environments, Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays an indispensable role, particularly when dealing with massive datasets that can contain billions of entries. The necessity for rapid response times in these applications makes the efficiency of ANNS algorithms crucial. However, traditional ANNS approaches encounter substantial challenges at the billion-scale level. CPU-based methods are hindered by the limitations of memory bandwidth, while GPU-based methods struggle with memory capacity and resource utilization efficiency. This paper introduces MemANNS, an innovative framework that utilizes UPMEM PIM architecture to address the memory bottlenecks in ANNS algorithms at scale. We concentrate on optimizing a well-known ANNS algorithm, IVFPQ, for PIM hardware through several techniques. First, we introduce an architecture-aware strategy for data placement and query scheduling that ensures an even distribution of workload across PIM chips, thereby maximizing the use of aggregated memory bandwidth. Additionally, we have developed an efficient thread scheduling mechanism that capitalizes on PIM's multi-threading capabilities and enhances memory management to boost cache efficiency. Moreover, we have recognized that real-world datasets often feature vectors with frequently co-occurring items. To address this, we propose a novel encoding method for IVFPQ that minimizes memory accesses during query processing. Our comprehensive evaluation using actual PIM hardware and real-world datasets at the billion-scale, show that MemANNS offers a significant 4.3x increase in QPS over CPU-based Faiss, and it matches the performance of GPU-based Faiss implementations. Additionally, MemANNS improves energy efficiency, with a 2.3x enhancement in QPS/Watt compared to GPU solutions.

### ALISE: Accelerating Large Language Model Serving with Speculative   Scheduling
**Authors**: Youpeng Zhao, Jun Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-31T00:58:11Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a revolutionary advancement in the contemporary landscape of artificial general intelligence (AGI). As exemplified by ChatGPT, LLM-based applications necessitate minimal response latency and maximal throughput for inference serving. However, due to the unpredictability of LLM execution, the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling policy employed by current LLM serving systems suffers from head-of-line (HoL) blocking issues and long job response times.   In this paper, we propose a new efficient LLM inference serving framework, named ALISE. The key design paradigm of ALISE is to leverage a novel speculative scheduler by estimating the execution time for each job and exploiting such prior knowledge to assign appropriate job priority orders, thus minimizing potential queuing delays for heterogeneous workloads. Furthermore, to mitigate the memory overhead of the intermediate key-value (KV) cache, we employ a priority-based adaptive memory management protocol and quantization-based compression techniques. Evaluations demonstrate that in comparison to the state-of-the-art solution vLLM, ALISE improves the throughput of inference serving by up to 1.8x and 2.1x under the same latency constraint on the Alpaca and ShareGPT datasets, respectively.

### Superposed Decoding: Multiple Generations from a Single Autoregressive   Inference Pass
**Authors**: Ethan Shen, Alan Fan, Sarah M. Pratt, Jae Sung Park, Matthew Wallingford, Sham M. Kakade, Ari Holtzman, Ranjay Krishna, Ali Farhadi, Aditya Kusupati

**Updated**: 2024-10-30T21:22:54Z

**Summary**: Many applications today provide users with multiple auto-complete drafts as they type, including GitHub's code completion, Gmail's smart compose, and Apple's messaging auto-suggestions. Under the hood, language models support this by running an autoregressive inference pass to provide a draft. Consequently, providing $k$ drafts to the user requires running an expensive language model $k$ times. To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$ inference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that generates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference pass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token embeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the language model. At every inference step we combine the $k$ drafts with the top-$k$ tokens to get $k^2$ new drafts and cache the $k$ most likely options, using an n-gram interpolation with minimal compute overhead to filter out incoherent generations. Our experiments show that $k$ drafts from Superposed Decoding are at least as coherent and factual as Nucleus Sampling and Greedy Decoding respectively, while being at least $2.44\times$ faster for $k\ge3$. In a compute-normalized setting, user evaluations demonstrably favor text generated by Superposed Decoding over Nucleus Sampling. Superposed Decoding can also be combined with other decoding strategies, resulting in universal coverage gains when scaling inference time compute.

### Attention-Enhanced Prioritized Proximal Policy Optimization for Adaptive   Edge Caching
**Authors**: Farnaz Niknia, Ping Wang, Zixu Wang, Aakash Agarwal, Adib S. Rezaei

**Updated**: 2024-10-30T16:06:21Z

**Summary**: This paper tackles the growing issue of excessive data transmission in networks. With increasing traffic, backhaul links and core networks are under significant traffic, leading to the investigation of caching solutions at edge routers. Many existing studies utilize Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to tackle caching problems, often assuming decision points at fixed intervals; however, real-world environments are characterized by random request arrivals. Additionally, critical file attributes such as lifetime, size, and priority significantly impact the effectiveness of caching policies, yet existing research fails to integrate all these attributes in policy design. In this work, we model the caching problem using a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) to better capture the continuous-time nature of real-world applications, enabling caching decisions to be triggered by random file requests. We then introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)--based caching strategy that fully considers file attributes like lifetime, size, and priority. Simulations show that our method outperforms a recent Deep Reinforcement Learning-based technique. To further advance our research, we improved the convergence rate of PPO by prioritizing transitions within the replay buffer through an attention mechanism. This mechanism evaluates the similarity between the current state and all stored transitions, assigning higher priorities to transitions that exhibit greater similarity.

### BUZZ: Beehive-structured Sparse KV Cache with Segmented Heavy Hitters   for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Junqi Zhao, Zhijin Fang, Shu Li, Shaohui Yang, Shichao He

**Updated**: 2024-10-30T14:53:37Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are essential in natural language processing but often struggle with inference speed and computational efficiency, limiting real-time deployment. The key-value (KV) cache mechanism reduces computational overhead in transformer models, but challenges in maintaining contextual understanding remain. In this paper, we propose BUZZ, a novel KV caching algorithm that leverages structured contextual information to minimize cache memory usage while enhancing inference speed. BUZZ employs a beehive-structured sparse cache, incorporating a sliding window to capture recent information and dynamically segmenting historical tokens into chunks to prioritize important tokens in local neighborhoods. We evaluate BUZZ on four real-world datasets: CNN/Daily Mail, XSUM, Wikitext, and 10-QA. Our results demonstrate that BUZZ (1) reduces cache memory usage by $\textbf{2.5}\times$ in LLM inference while maintaining over 99% accuracy in long-text summarization, and (2) surpasses state-of-the-art performance in multi-document question answering by $\textbf{7.69%}$ under the same memory limit, where full cache methods encounter out-of-memory issues. Additionally, BUZZ achieves significant inference speedup with a $\log{n}$ time complexity. The code is available at https://github.com/JunqiZhao888/buzz-llm.

### Training-Free Exponential Context Extension via Cascading KV Cache
**Authors**: Jeffrey Willette, Heejun Lee, Youngwan Lee, Myeongjae Jeon, Sung Ju Hwang

**Updated**: 2024-10-30T03:31:09Z

**Summary**: The transformer's context window is vital for tasks such as few-shot learning and conditional generation as it preserves previous tokens for active memory. However, as the context lengths increase, the computational costs grow quadratically, hindering the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world, long sequence scenarios. Although some recent key-value caching (KV Cache) methods offer linear inference complexity, they naively manage the stored context, prematurely evicting tokens and losing valuable information. Moreover, they lack an optimized prefill/prompt stage strategy, resulting in higher latency than even quadratic attention for realistic context sizes. In response, we introduce a novel mechanism that leverages cascading sub-cache buffers to selectively retain the most relevant tokens, enabling the model to maintain longer context histories without increasing the cache size. Our approach outperforms linear caching baselines across key benchmarks, including streaming perplexity, question answering, book summarization, and passkey retrieval, where it retains better retrieval accuracy at 1M tokens after four doublings of the cache size of 65K. Additionally, our method reduces prefill stage latency by a factor of 6.8 when compared to flash attention on 1M tokens. These innovations not only enhance the computational efficiency of LLMs but also pave the way for their effective deployment in resource-constrained environments, enabling large-scale, real-time applications with significantly reduced latency.

### WaveRoRA: Wavelet Rotary Route Attention for Multivariate Time Series   Forecasting
**Authors**: Aobo Liang, Yan Sun

**Updated**: 2024-10-30T02:36:55Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Transformer-based models (Transformers) have achieved significant success in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, previous works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the frequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework to model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet domain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the analysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally, the Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic complexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing long-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism: Rotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary position embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence tokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate information from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix, offering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA to capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that WaveRoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining lower computational costs.

### Graph-GIC: A Smart and Parallelized Geomagnetically Induced Current   Modelling Algorithm Based on Graph Theory for Space Weather Applications
**Authors**: Wen Chen, Ding Yuan, Xueshang Feng, Stefaan Poedts, Zhengyang Zou, Song Feng, Yuxuan Zhu, Tong Yin

**Updated**: 2024-10-30T02:18:59Z

**Summary**: Geomagnetically Induced Current (GIC) refers to the electromagnetic response of the Earth and its conductive modern infrastructures to space weather and would pose a significant threat to high-voltage power grids designed for the alternative current operation. To assess the impact of space weather on the power grid, one needs to calculate the GIC on a national or continental scale. In this study, we developed a smart and parallelized GIC modelling algorithm, Graph GIC. This algorithm deploys a graph representing a power grid in a single-line diagram, in which substations/transformers act as nodes and transmission lines as edges. With these denotations, a power grid and its electric parameters are mathematically represented with an adjacency matrix and an admittance matrix. We used sparse matrix and parallelisation techniques to expedite the intensive computation in cases of large-scale power grids. The Graph GIC was validated with a benchmark grid, applied to the GIC calculation of the 500 kV power grid of Guangdong, China, and conducted preliminary analysis on the grid's susceptibility to geomagnetic storms. The Graph GIC algorithm has the advantage of an intuitive and highly scalable graph representation of a power grid at any scale. It achieves high-accuracy calculation and a speedup of about 18 times after parallelisation. This algorithm could be applied to assess the impact of space weather on a power grid up to continental scales and could be incorporated into global space weather modelling frameworks.

### VL-Cache: Sparsity and Modality-Aware KV Cache Compression for   Vision-Language Model Inference Acceleration
**Authors**: Dezhan Tu, Danylo Vashchilenko, Yuzhe Lu, Panpan Xu

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T20:04:34Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a versatile set of tasks. A key challenge in accelerating VLMs is storing and accessing the large Key-Value (KV) cache that encodes long visual contexts, such as images or videos. While existing KV cache compression methods are effective for Large Language Models (LLMs), directly migrating them to VLMs yields suboptimal accuracy and speedup. To bridge the gap, we propose VL-Cache, a novel KV cache compression recipe tailored for accelerating VLM inference. In this paper, we first investigate the unique sparsity pattern of VLM attention by distinguishing visual and text tokens in prefill and decoding phases. Based on these observations, we introduce a layer-adaptive sparsity-aware cache budget allocation method that effectively distributes the limited cache budget across different layers, further reducing KV cache size without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we develop a modality-aware token scoring policy to better evaluate the token importance. Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that retaining only 10% of KV cache achieves accuracy comparable to that with full cache. In a speed benchmark, our method accelerates end-to-end latency of generating 100 tokens by up to 2.33x and speeds up decoding by up to 7.08x, while reducing the memory footprint of KV cache in GPU by 90%.

### Model Tells You What to Discard: Adaptive KV Cache Compression for LLMs
**Authors**: Suyu Ge, Yunan Zhang, Liyuan Liu, Minjia Zhang, Jiawei Han, Jianfeng Gao

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T18:26:09Z

**Summary**: In this study, we introduce adaptive KV cache compression, a plug-and-play method that reduces the memory footprint of generative inference for Large Language Models (LLMs). Different from the conventional KV cache that retains key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss. We will release our code and the compatible CUDA kernel for reproducibility.

### Ripple: Accelerating LLM Inference on Smartphones with Correlation-Aware   Neuron Management
**Authors**: Tuowei Wang, Ruwen Fan, Minxing Huang, Zixu Hao, Kun Li, Ting Cao, Youyou Lu, Yaoxue Zhang, Ju Ren

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T17:33:19Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet deploying them on mobile devices remains an arduous challenge due to their extensive computational and memory demands. While lightweight LLMs have been developed to fit mobile environments, they suffer from degraded model accuracy. In contrast, sparsity-based techniques minimize DRAM usage by selectively transferring only relevant neurons to DRAM while retaining the full model in external storage, such as flash. However, such approaches are critically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with severe IOPS constraints.   In this paper, we propose Ripple, a novel approach that accelerates LLM inference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory. Ripple leverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons frequently activated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access and optimize data transfer efficiency. Our approach incorporates a two-stage solution: an offline stage that reorganizes neuron placement based on co-activation patterns, and an online stage that employs tailored data access and caching strategies to align well with hardware characteristics. Evaluations conducted on a variety of smartphones and LLMs demonstrate that Ripple achieves up to 5.93x improvements in I/O latency compared to the state-of-the-art. As the first solution to optimize storage placement under sparsity, Ripple explores a new optimization space at the intersection of sparsity-driven algorithm and storage-level system co-design in LLM inference.

### Modeling and Monitoring of Indoor Populations using Sparse Positioning   Data (Extension)
**Authors**: Xiao Li, Huan Li, Hua Lu, Christian S. Jensen

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T16:55:23Z

**Summary**: In large venues like shopping malls and airports, knowledge on the indoor populations fuels applications such as business analytics, venue management, and safety control. In this work, we provide means of modeling populations in partitions of indoor space offline and of monitoring indoor populations continuously, by using indoor positioning data. However, the low-sampling rates of indoor positioning render the data temporally and spatially sparse, which in turn renders the offline capture of indoor populations challenging. It is even more challenging to continuously monitor indoor populations, as positioning data may be missing or not ready yet at the current moment. To address these challenges, we first enable probabilistic modeling of populations in indoor space partitions as Normal distributions. Based on that, we propose two learning-based estimators for on-the-fly prediction of population distributions. Leveraging the prediction-based schemes, we provide a unified continuous query processing framework for a type of query that enables continuous monitoring of populated partitions. The framework encompasses caching and result validity mechanisms to reduce cost and maintain monitoring effectiveness. Extensive experiments on two real data sets show that the proposed estimators are able to outperform the state-of-the-art alternatives and that the query processing framework is effective and efficient.

### ProMoE: Fast MoE-based LLM Serving using Proactive Caching
**Authors**: Xiaoniu Song, Zihang Zhong, Rong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T15:31:27Z

**Summary**: The promising applications of large language models are often constrained by the limited GPU memory capacity available on edge devices. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models help mitigate this issue by activating only a subset of the model's parameters during computation, allowing the unused parameters to be offloaded to host memory and reducing overall GPU memory demand. However, existing cache-based offloading solutions handle cache misses reactively and significantly impact system performance. In this paper, we propose ProMoE, a novel proactive caching system that leverages intermediate model results to predict subsequent parameter usage. By proactively fetching experts in advance, ProMoE removes the loading time from the critical path and diminishes the performance overhead of offloading. Our evaluations demonstrate that ProMoE achieves an average speedup of 2.13x and 2.84x in the prefill and decode stages respectively, compared to existing offloading solutions.

### The Impact of Inference Acceleration Strategies on Bias of LLMs
**Authors**: Elisabeth Kirsten, Ivan Habernal, Vedant Nanda, Muhammad Bilal Zafar

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T15:19:13Z

**Summary**: Last few years have seen unprecedented advances in capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These advancements promise to deeply benefit a vast array of application domains. However, due to their immense size, performing inference with LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent work has proposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g., quantization, pruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the inference cost and latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of the predictive performance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we explore another critical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model generations due to inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of metrics, we probe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of outputs before and after inference acceleration shows significant change in bias. Worryingly, these bias effects are complex and unpredictable. A combination of an acceleration strategy and bias type may show little bias change in one model but may lead to a large effect in another. Our results highlight a need for in-depth and case-by-case evaluation of model bias after it has been modified to accelerate inference.

### LoongServe: Efficiently Serving Long-Context Large Language Models with   Elastic Sequence Parallelism
**Authors**: Bingyang Wu, Shengyu Liu, Yinmin Zhong, Peng Sun, Xuanzhe Liu, Xin Jin

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T13:04:42Z

**Summary**: The context window of large language models (LLMs) is rapidly increasing, leading to a huge variance in resource usage between different requests as well as between different phases of the same request. Restricted by static parallelism strategies, existing LLM serving systems cannot efficiently utilize the underlying resources to serve variable-length requests in different phases. To address this problem, we propose a new parallelism paradigm, elastic sequence parallelism (ESP), to elastically adapt to the variance between different requests and phases. Based on ESP, we design and build LoongServe, an LLM serving system that (1) improves computation efficiency by elastically adjusting the degree of parallelism in real-time, (2) improves communication efficiency by reducing key-value cache migration overhead and overlapping partial decoding communication with computation, and (3) improves GPU memory efficiency by reducing key-value cache fragmentation across instances. Our evaluation under diverse real-world datasets shows that LoongServe improves the maximum throughput by up to 3.85$\times$ compared to the chunked prefill and 5.81$\times$ compared to the prefill-decoding disaggregation.

### ASVD: Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition for Compressing   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhihang Yuan, Yuzhang Shang, Yue Song, Qiang Wu, Yan Yan, Guangyu Sun

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T12:28:58Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a new post-training compression paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate their wider adoption. We delve into LLM weight low-rank decomposition, and find that the challenges of this task stem from the distribution variance in the LLM activations and the sensitivity difference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by transforming the weight matrix based on the activation distribution. This transformation allows the outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into the transformed weight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers. In this way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the success of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced. ASVD can further achieve 50% KV cache reductions without performance drop in a training-free manner. Code is anonymously available in supplementary materials.

### Dynamic Content Caching with Waiting Costs via Restless Multi-Armed   Bandits
**Authors**: Ankita Koley, Chandramani Singh

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T12:03:14Z

**Summary**: We consider a system with a local cache connected to a backend server and an end user population. A set of contents are stored at the the server where they continuously get updated. The local cache keeps copies, potentially stale, of a subset of the contents. The users make content requests to the local cache which either can serve the local version if available or can fetch a fresh version or can wait for additional requests before fetching and serving a fresh version. Serving a stale version of a content incurs an age-of-version(AoV) dependent ageing cost, fetching it from the server incurs a fetching cost, and making a request wait incurs a per unit time waiting cost. We focus on the optimal actions subject to the cache capacity constraint at each decision epoch, aiming at minimizing the long term average cost. We pose the problem as a Restless Multi-armed Bandit(RMAB) Problem and propose a Whittle index based policy which is known to be asymptotically optimal. We explicitly characterize the Whittle indices. We numerically evaluate the proposed policy and also compare it to a greedy policy. We show that it is close to the optimal policy and substantially outperforms the greedy policy.

### QuaRot: Outlier-Free 4-Bit Inference in Rotated LLMs
**Authors**: Saleh Ashkboos, Amirkeivan Mohtashami, Maximilian L. Croci, Bo Li, Pashmina Cameron, Martin Jaggi, Dan Alistarh, Torsten Hoefler, James Hensman

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T11:09:12Z

**Summary**: We introduce QuaRot, a new Quantization scheme based on Rotations, which is able to quantize LLMs end-to-end, including all weights, activations, and KV cache in 4 bits. QuaRot rotates LLMs in a way that removes outliers from the hidden state without changing the output, making quantization easier. This computational invariance is applied to the hidden state (residual) of the LLM, as well as to the activations of the feed-forward components, aspects of the attention mechanism, and to the KV cache. The result is a quantized model where all matrix multiplications are performed in 4 bits, without any channels identified for retention in higher precision. Our 4-bit quantized LLaMa2-70B model has losses of at most 0.47 WikiText-2 perplexity and retains 99% of the zero-shot performance. We also show that QuaRot can provide lossless 6 and 8 bit LLaMa2 models without any calibration data using round-to-nearest quantization. Code is available at: https://github.com/spcl/QuaRot.

### Unleashing the Potential of the Diffusion Model in Few-shot Semantic   Segmentation
**Authors**: Muzhi Zhu, Yang Liu, Zekai Luo, Chenchen Jing, Hao Chen, Guangkai Xu, Xinlong Wang, Chunhua Shen

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T04:21:30Z

**Summary**: The Diffusion Model has not only garnered noteworthy achievements in the realm of image generation but has also demonstrated its potential as an effective pretraining method utilizing unlabeled data. Drawing from the extensive potential unveiled by the Diffusion Model in both semantic correspondence and open vocabulary segmentation, our work initiates an investigation into employing the Latent Diffusion Model for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation. Recently, inspired by the in-context learning ability of large language models, Few-shot Semantic Segmentation has evolved into In-context Segmentation tasks, morphing into a crucial element in assessing generalist segmentation models. In this context, we concentrate on Few-shot Semantic Segmentation, establishing a solid foundation for the future development of a Diffusion-based generalist model for segmentation. Our initial focus lies in understanding how to facilitate interaction between the query image and the support image, resulting in the proposal of a KV fusion method within the self-attention framework. Subsequently, we delve deeper into optimizing the infusion of information from the support mask and simultaneously re-evaluating how to provide reasonable supervision from the query mask. Based on our analysis, we establish a simple and effective framework named DiffewS, maximally retaining the original Latent Diffusion Model's generative framework and effectively utilizing the pre-training prior. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the previous SOTA models in multiple settings.

### Symmetric Locality: Definition and Initial Results

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T02:52:24Z

**Summary**: In this short paper, we characterize symmetric locality. In designing algorithms, compilers, and systems, data movement is a common bottleneck in high-performance computation, in which we improve cache and memory performance. We study a special type of data reuse in the form of repeated traversals, or re-traversals, which are based on the symmetric group. The cyclic and sawtooth traces are previously known results in symmetric locality, and in this work, we would like to generalize this result for any re-traversal. Then, we also provide an abstract framework for applications in compiler design and machine learning models to improve the memory performance of certain programs.

### ShadowKV: KV Cache in Shadows for High-Throughput Long-Context LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Hanshi Sun, Li-Wen Chang, Wenlei Bao, Size Zheng, Ningxin Zheng, Xin Liu, Harry Dong, Yuejie Chi, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-28T19:08:12Z

**Summary**: With the widespread deployment of long-context large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing demand for efficient support of high-throughput inference. However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence length, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each token generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs. While various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up inference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to sufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding latency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a high-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key cache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger batch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV employs an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV pairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks, including RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and Qwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\times$ larger batch sizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\times$ on an A100 GPU without sacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite batch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory. The code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/ShadowKV.

### Online Weighted Paging with Unknown Weights
**Authors**: Orin Levy, Noam Touitou, Aviv Rosenberg

**Updated**: 2024-10-28T17:57:40Z

**Summary**: Online paging is a fundamental problem in the field of online algorithms, in which one maintains a cache of $k$ slots as requests for fetching pages arrive online. In the weighted variant of this problem, each page has its own fetching cost; a substantial line of work on this problem culminated in an (optimal) $O(\log k)$-competitive randomized algorithm, due to Bansal, Buchbinder and Naor (FOCS'07).   Existing work for weighted paging assumes that page weights are known in advance, which is not always the case in practice. For example, in multi-level caching architectures, the expected cost of fetching a memory block is a function of its probability of being in a mid-level cache rather than the main memory. This complex property cannot be predicted in advance; over time, however, one may glean information about page weights through sampling their fetching cost multiple times.   We present the first algorithm for online weighted paging that does not know page weights in advance, but rather learns from weight samples. In terms of techniques, this requires providing (integral) samples to a fractional solver, requiring a delicate interface between this solver and the randomized rounding scheme; we believe that our work can inspire online algorithms to other problems that involve cost sampling.

### Rethinking Programmed I/O for Fast Devices, Cheap Cores, and Coherent   Interconnects
**Authors**: Anastasiia Ruzhanskaia, Pengcheng Xu, David Cock, Timothy Roscoe

**Updated**: 2024-10-28T16:42:11Z

**Summary**: Conventional wisdom holds that an efficient interface between an OS running on a CPU and a high-bandwidth I/O device should be based on Direct Memory Access (DMA), descriptor rings, and interrupts: DMA offloads transfers from the CPU, descriptor rings provide buffering and queuing, and interrupts facilitate asynchronous interaction between cores and device with a lightweight notification mechanism. In this paper we question this wisdom in the light of modern hardware and workloads, particularly in cloud servers. Like others before us, we argue that the assumptions that led to this model are obsolete, and in many use-cases use of Programmed I/O (PIO), where the CPU explicitly transfers data and control information to and from a device via loads and stores, actually results in a more efficient system. However, unlike others to date, we push this idea further and show, in a real implementation, the gains in average and tail latency for fine-grained communication achievable using an open cache-coherence protocol which exposes cache transitions to a smart device. We show this using three use-cases: fine-grained RPC-style invocation of functions on an accelerator, offloading of operators in a streaming dataflow engine, and a network interface targeting for serverless functions, comparing our use of coherence with both traditional DMA-style interaction and a highly-optimized implementation using PIO over PCI Express (PCIe).

**Authors**: Zhuoming Chen, Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Zihao Ye, Yang Zhou, Jianyu Zhang, Niklas Nolte, Yuandong Tian, Matthijs Douze, Leon Bottou, Zhihao Jia, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-28T14:44:22Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with long context windows have gained significant attention. However, the KV cache, stored to avoid re-computation, becomes a bottleneck. Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself suffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention is not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding throughput by $1.9\sim3.9\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 110ms decoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a context of 96k tokens. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/MagicPIG}.

### Skip2-LoRA: A Lightweight On-device DNN Fine-tuning Method for Low-cost   Edge Devices
**Authors**: Hiroki Matsutani, Masaaki Kondo, Kazuki Sunaga, Radu Marculescu

**Updated**: 2024-10-28T14:35:12Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes Skip2-LoRA as a lightweight fine-tuning method for deep neural networks to address the gap between pre-trained and deployed models. In our approach, trainable LoRA (low-rank adaptation) adapters are inserted between the last layer and every other layer to enhance the network expressive power while keeping the backward computation cost low. This architecture is well-suited to cache intermediate computation results of the forward pass and then can skip the forward computation of seen samples as training epochs progress. We implemented the combination of the proposed architecture and cache, denoted as Skip2-LoRA, and tested it on a $15 single board computer. Our results show that Skip2-LoRA reduces the fine-tuning time by 90.0% on average compared to the counterpart that has the same number of trainable parameters while preserving the accuracy, while taking only a few seconds on the microcontroller board.

### Beyond Autoregression: Fast LLMs via Self-Distillation Through Time
**Authors**: Justin Deschenaux, Caglar Gulcehre

**Updated**: 2024-10-28T13:56:30Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive (AR) Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across numerous tasks. However, the AR modeling paradigm presents certain limitations; for instance, contemporary autoregressive LLMs are trained to generate one token at a time, which can result in noticeable latency. Recent advances have indicated that search and repeated sampling can enhance performance in various applications, such as theorem proving, code generation, and alignment, by utilizing greater computational resources during inference. In this study, we demonstrate that diffusion language models are capable of generating at least 32 tokens simultaneously, while exceeding the performance of AR models in text quality and on the LAMBADA natural language understanding benchmark. This outcome is achieved through a novel distillation method for discrete diffusion models, which reduces the number of inference steps by a factor of 32-64. Practically, our models, even without caching, can generate tokens at a rate that is up to 8 times faster than AR models employing KV caching, and we anticipate further improvements with the inclusion of caching. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for diffusion language models with up to 860M parameters.

### SparseTem: Boosting the Efficiency of CNN-Based Video Encoders by   Exploiting Temporal Continuity
**Authors**: Kunyun Wang, Jieru Zhao, Shuo Yang, Wenchao Ding, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-10-28T07:13:25Z

**Summary**: Deep learning models have become pivotal in the field of video processing and is increasingly critical in practical applications such as autonomous driving and object detection. Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated their power, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain a highly efficient and high-performance choice for feature extraction and encoding. However, the intensive computational demands of convolution operations hinder its broader adoption as a video encoder. Given the inherent temporal continuity in video frames, changes between consecutive frames are minimal, allowing for the skipping of redundant computations. This technique, which we term as Diff Computation, presents two primary challenges. First, Diff Computation requires to cache intermediate feature maps to ensure the correctness of non-linear computations, leading to significant memory consumption. Second, the imbalance of sparsity among layers, introduced by Diff Computation, incurs accuracy degradation. To address these issues, we propose a memory-efficient scheduling method to eliminate memory overhead and an online adjustment mechanism to minimize accuracy degradation. We integrate these techniques into our framework, SparseTem, to seamlessly support various CNN-based video encoders. SparseTem achieves speedup of 1.79x for EfficientDet and 4.72x for CRNN, with minimal accuracy drop and no additional memory overhead. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SparseTem sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively utilizing temporal continuity to accelerate CNN-based video encoders.

### Accelerating Transformer Pre-training with 2:4 Sparsity
**Authors**: Yuezhou Hu, Kang Zhao, Weiyu Huang, Jianfei Chen, Jun Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-10-27T14:40:08Z

**Summary**: Training large transformers is slow, but recent innovations on GPU architecture give us an advantage. NVIDIA Ampere GPUs can execute a fine-grained 2:4 sparse matrix multiplication twice as fast as its dense equivalent. In the light of this property, we comprehensively investigate the feasibility of accelerating feed-forward networks (FFNs) of transformers in pre-training. First, we define a ``flip rate'' to monitor the stability of a 2:4 training process. Utilizing this metric, we propose three techniques to preserve accuracy: to modify the sparse-refined straight-through estimator by applying the masked decay term on gradients, to determine a feasible decay factor in warm-up stage, and to enhance the model's quality by a dense fine-tuning procedure near the end of pre-training. Besides, we devise two techniques to practically accelerate training: to calculate transposable 2:4 masks by convolution, and to accelerate gated activation functions by reducing GPU L2 cache miss. Experiments show that our 2:4 sparse training algorithm achieves similar convergence to dense training algorithms on several transformer pre-training tasks, while actual acceleration can be observed on different shapes of transformer block apparently. Our toolkit is available at https://github.com/huyz2023/2by4-pretrain.

### On the I/O Complexity of the CYK Algorithm and of a Family of Related DP   Algorithms
**Authors**: Lorenzo De Stefani, Vedant Gupta

**Updated**: 2024-10-27T04:31:35Z

**Summary**: Asymptotically tight lower bounds are derived for the Input/Output (I/O) complexity of a class of dynamic programming algorithms including matrix chain multiplication, optimal polygon triangulation, and the construction of optimal binary search trees. Assuming no recomputation of intermediate values, we establish an $\Omega\left(\frac{n^3}{\sqrt{M}B}\right)$ I/O lower bound, where $n$ denotes the size of the input and $M$ denotes the size of the available fast memory (cache). When recomputation is allowed, we show the same bound holds for $M < cn$, where $c$ is a positive constant. In the case where $M \ge 2n$, we show an $\Omega\left(n/B\right)$ I/O lower bound. We also discuss algorithms for which the number of executed I/O operations matches asymptotically each of the presented lower bounds, which are thus asymptotically tight.   Additionally, we refine our general method to obtain a lower bound for the I/O complexity of the Cocke-Younger-Kasami algorithm, where the size of the grammar impacts the I/O complexity. An upper bound with asymptotically matching performance in many cases is also provided.

### Resource-Aware Hierarchical Federated Learning in Wireless Video Caching   Networks
**Authors**: Md Ferdous Pervej, Andreas F. Molisch

**Updated**: 2024-10-26T22:19:04Z

**Summary**: Backhaul traffic congestion caused by the video traffic of a few popular files can be alleviated by storing the to-be-requested content at various levels in wireless video caching networks. Typically, content service providers (CSPs) own the content, and the users request their preferred content from the CSPs using their (wireless) internet service providers (ISPs). As these parties do not reveal their private information and business secrets, traditional techniques may not be readily used to predict the dynamic changes in users' future demands. Motivated by this, we propose a novel resource-aware hierarchical federated learning (RawHFL) solution for predicting user's future content requests. A practical data acquisition technique is used that allows the user to update its local training dataset based on its requested content. Besides, since networking and other computational resources are limited, considering that only a subset of the users participate in the model training, we derive the convergence bound of the proposed algorithm. Based on this bound, we minimize a weighted utility function for jointly configuring the controllable parameters to train the RawHFL energy efficiently under practical resource constraints. Our extensive simulation results validate the proposed algorithm's superiority, in terms of test accuracy and energy cost, over existing baselines.

### AdaNeg: Adaptive Negative Proxy Guided OOD Detection with   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Yabin Zhang, Lei Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-26T11:20:02Z

**Summary**: Recent research has shown that pre-trained vision-language models are effective at identifying out-of-distribution (OOD) samples by using negative labels as guidance. However, employing consistent negative labels across different OOD datasets often results in semantic misalignments, as these text labels may not accurately reflect the actual space of OOD images. To overcome this issue, we introduce \textit{adaptive negative proxies}, which are dynamically generated during testing by exploring actual OOD images, to align more closely with the underlying OOD label space and enhance the efficacy of negative proxy guidance. Specifically, our approach utilizes a feature memory bank to selectively cache discriminative features from test images, representing the targeted OOD distribution. This facilitates the creation of proxies that can better align with specific OOD datasets. While task-adaptive proxies average features to reflect the unique characteristics of each dataset, the sample-adaptive proxies weight features based on their similarity to individual test samples, exploring detailed sample-level nuances. The final score for identifying OOD samples integrates static negative labels with our proposed adaptive proxies, effectively combining textual and visual knowledge for enhanced performance. Our method is training-free and annotation-free, and it maintains fast testing speed. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, abbreviated as AdaNeg. Notably, on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark, our AdaNeg significantly outperforms existing methods, with a 2.45\% increase in AUROC and a 6.48\% reduction in FPR95. Codes are available at \url{https://github.com/YBZh/OpenOOD-VLM}.

### Lightweight, Secure and Stateful Serverless Computing with PSL
**Authors**: Alexander Thomas, Shubham Mishra, Kaiyuan Chen, John Kubiatowicz

**Updated**: 2024-10-25T23:17:56Z

**Summary**: We present PSL, a lightweight, secure and stateful Function-as-a-Serivce (FaaS) framework for Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). The framework provides rich programming language support on heterogeneous TEE hardware for statically compiled binaries and/or WebAssembly (WASM) bytecodes, with a familiar Key-Value Store (KVS) interface to secure, performant, network-embedded storage. It achieves near-native execution speeds by utilizing the dynamic memory mapping capabilities of Intel SGX2 to create an in-enclave WASM runtime with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. PSL is designed to efficiently operate within an asynchronous environment with a distributed tamper-proof confidential storage system, assuming minority failures. The system exchanges eventually-consistent state updates across nodes while utilizing release-consistent locking mechanisms to enhance transactional capabilities. The execution of PSL is up to 3.7x faster than the state-of-the-art SGX WASM runtime. PSL reaches 95k ops/s with YCSB 100% read workload and 89k ops/s with 50% read/write workload. We demonstrate the scalability and adaptivity of PSL through a case study of secure and distributed training of deep neural networks.

### LoCoCo: Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression
**Authors**: Ruisi Cai, Yuandong Tian, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-25T21:09:59Z

**Summary**: This paper tackles the memory hurdle of processing long context sequences in Large Language Models (LLMs), by presenting a novel approach, Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression (LoCoCo). LoCoCo employs only a fixed-size Key-Value (KV) cache, and can enhance efficiency in both inference and fine-tuning stages. Diverging from prior methods that selectively drop KV pairs based on heuristics, LoCoCo leverages a data-driven adaptive fusion technique, blending previous KV pairs with incoming tokens to minimize the loss of contextual information and ensure accurate attention modeling. This token integration is achieved through injecting one-dimensional convolutional kernels that dynamically calculate mixing weights for each KV cache slot. Designed for broad compatibility with existing LLM frameworks, LoCoCo allows for straightforward "drop-in" integration without needing architectural modifications, while incurring minimal tuning overhead. Experiments demonstrate that LoCoCo maintains consistently outstanding performance across various context lengths and can achieve a high context compression rate during both inference and fine-tuning phases. During inference, we successfully compressed up to 3482 tokens into a 128-size KV cache, while retaining comparable performance to the full sequence - an accuracy improvement of up to 0.2791 compared to baselines at the same cache size. During post-training tuning, we also effectively extended the context length from 4K to 32K using a KV cache of fixed size 512, achieving performance similar to fine-tuning with entire sequences.

### FutureFill: Fast Generation from Convolutional Sequence Models
**Authors**: Naman Agarwal, Xinyi Chen, Evan Dogariu, Vlad Feinberg, Daniel Suo, Peter Bartlett, Elad Hazan

**Updated**: 2024-10-25T19:45:33Z

**Summary**: We address the challenge of efficient auto-regressive generation in sequence prediction models by introducing FutureFill - a method for fast generation that applies to any sequence prediction algorithm based on convolutional operators. Our approach reduces the generation time requirement from quadratic to quasilinear relative to the context length. Additionally, FutureFill requires a prefill cache sized only by the number of tokens generated, which is smaller than the cache requirements for standard convolutional and attention-based models. We validate our theoretical findings with experimental evidence demonstrating correctness and efficiency gains in a synthetic generation task.

### RobustKV: Defending Large Language Models against Jailbreak Attacks via   KV Eviction
**Authors**: Tanqiu Jiang, Zian Wang, Jiacheng Liang, Changjiang Li, Yuhui Wang, Ting Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-25T19:18:22Z

**Summary**: Jailbreak attacks circumvent LLMs' built-in safeguards by concealing harmful queries within jailbreak prompts. While existing defenses primarily focus on mitigating the effects of jailbreak prompts, they often prove inadequate as jailbreak prompts can take arbitrary, adaptive forms. This paper presents RobustKV, a novel defense that adopts a fundamentally different approach by selectively removing critical tokens of harmful queries from key-value (KV) caches. Intuitively, for a jailbreak prompt to be effective, its tokens must achieve sufficient `importance' (as measured by attention scores), which inevitably lowers the importance of tokens in the concealed harmful query. Thus, by strategically evicting the KVs of the lowest-ranked tokens, RobustKV diminishes the presence of the harmful query in the KV cache, thus preventing the LLM from generating malicious responses. Extensive evaluation using benchmark datasets and models demonstrates that RobustKV effectively counters state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks while maintaining the LLM's general performance on benign queries. Moreover, RobustKV creates an intriguing evasiveness dilemma for adversaries, forcing them to balance between evading RobustKV and bypassing the LLM's built-in safeguards. This trade-off contributes to RobustKV's robustness against adaptive attacks. (warning: this paper contains potentially harmful content generated by LLMs.)

### Fast Inference for Augmented Large Language Models
**Authors**: Rana Shahout, Cong Liang, Shiji Xin, Qianru Lao, Yong Cui, Minlan Yu, Michael Mitzenmacher

**Updated**: 2024-10-25T19:18:00Z

**Summary**: Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance the capabilities of standalone LLMs by integrating external data sources through API calls. In interactive LLM applications, efficient scheduling is crucial for maintaining low request completion times, directly impacting user engagement. However, these augmentations introduce scheduling challenges due to the need to manage limited memory for cached information (KV caches). As a result, traditional size-based scheduling algorithms, such as Shortest Job First (SJF), become less effective at minimizing completion times. Existing work focuses only on handling requests during API calls by preserving, discarding, or swapping memory without considering how to schedule requests with API calls. In this paper, we propose LAMPS, a novel LLM inference framework for augmented LLMs. LAMPS minimizes request completion time through a unified scheduling approach that considers the total length of requests and their handling strategies during API calls. Recognizing that LLM inference is memory-bound, our approach ranks requests based on their consumption of memory over time, which depends on both the output sizes and how a request is managed during its API calls. To implement our scheduling, LAMPS predicts the strategy that minimizes memory waste of a request during its API calls, aligning with but improving upon existing approaches. We also propose starvation prevention techniques and optimizations to mitigate the overhead of our scheduling. We implement LAMPS on top of vLLM and evaluate its performance against baseline LLM inference systems, demonstrating improvements in end-to-end latency by 27%-85% and reductions in TTFT by 4%-96% compared to the existing augmented-LLM system, with even greater gains over vLLM.

### KVQuant: Towards 10 Million Context Length LLM Inference with KV Cache   Quantization
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sehoon Kim, Hiva Mohammadzadeh, Michael W. Mahoney, Yakun Sophia Shao, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2024-10-25T18:29:43Z

**Summary**: LLMs are seeing growing use for applications which require large context windows, and with these large context windows KV cache activations surface as the dominant contributor to memory consumption during inference. Quantization is a promising approach for compressing KV cache activations; however, existing solutions fail to represent activations accurately in sub-4-bit precision. Our work, KVQuant, facilitates low precision KV cache quantization by incorporating several novel methods: (i) Per-Channel Key Quantization, where we adjust the dimension along which we quantize the Key activations to better match the distribution; (ii) Pre-RoPE Key Quantization, where we quantize Key activations before the rotary positional embedding to mitigate its impact on quantization; (iii) Non-Uniform KV Cache Quantization, where we derive per-layer sensitivity-weighted non-uniform datatypes that better represent the distributions; and (iv) Per-Vector Dense-and-Sparse Quantization, where we isolate outliers separately for each vector to minimize skews in quantization ranges. By applying our method to the LLaMA, Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral models, we achieve < 0.1 perplexity degradation with 3-bit quantization on both Wikitext-2 and C4, outperforming existing approaches. Our method enables serving LLaMA-7B with a context length of up to 1 million on a single A100-80GB GPU and up to 10 million on an 8-GPU system. We develop custom CUDA kernels for KVQuant, showing that we can achieve up to ~1.7x speedups, compared to baseline fp16 matrix-vector multiplications, for the LLaMA-7B model.

### FasterCache: Training-Free Video Diffusion Model Acceleration with High   Quality
**Authors**: Zhengyao Lv, Chenyang Si, Junhao Song, Zhenyu Yang, Yu Qiao, Ziwei Liu, Kwan-Yee K. Wong

**Updated**: 2024-10-25T07:24:38Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present \textbf{\textit{FasterCache}}, a novel training-free strategy designed to accelerate the inference of video diffusion models with high-quality generation. By analyzing existing cache-based methods, we observe that \textit{directly reusing adjacent-step features degrades video quality due to the loss of subtle variations}. We further perform a pioneering investigation of the acceleration potential of classifier-free guidance (CFG) and reveal significant redundancy between conditional and unconditional features within the same timestep. Capitalizing on these observations, we introduce FasterCache to substantially accelerate diffusion-based video generation. Our key contributions include a dynamic feature reuse strategy that preserves both feature distinction and temporal continuity, and CFG-Cache which optimizes the reuse of conditional and unconditional outputs to further enhance inference speed without compromising video quality. We empirically evaluate FasterCache on recent video diffusion models. Experimental results show that FasterCache can significantly accelerate video generation (\eg 1.67$\times$ speedup on Vchitect-2.0) while keeping video quality comparable to the baseline, and consistently outperform existing methods in both inference speed and video quality.

### Read-ME: Refactorizing LLMs as Router-Decoupled Mixture of Experts with   System Co-Design
**Authors**: Ruisi Cai, Yeonju Ro, Geon-Woo Kim, Peihao Wang, Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi, Aditya Akella, Zhangyang Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-24T19:48:51Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has led to the adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures that dynamically leverage specialized subnetworks for improved efficiency and performance. Despite their benefits, MoE models face significant challenges during inference, including inefficient memory management and suboptimal batching, due to misaligned design choices between the model architecture and the system policies. Furthermore, the conventional approach of training MoEs from scratch is increasingly prohibitive in terms of cost. In this paper, we propose a novel framework Read-ME that transforms pre-trained dense LLMs into smaller MoE models (in contrast to "upcycling" generalist MoEs), avoiding the high costs of ground-up training. Our approach employs activation sparsity to extract experts. To compose experts, we examine the widely-adopted layer-wise router design and show its redundancy, and thus we introduce the pre-gating router decoupled from the MoE backbone that facilitates system-friendly pre-computing and lookahead scheduling, enhancing expert-aware batching and caching. Our codesign therefore addresses critical gaps on both the algorithmic and system fronts, establishing a scalable and efficient alternative for LLM inference in resource-constrained settings. Read-ME outperforms other popular open-source dense models of similar scales, achieving improvements of up to 10.1% on MMLU, and improving mean end-to-end latency up to 6.1%. Codes are available at: https://github.com/VITA-Group/READ-ME.

### KVSharer: Efficient Inference via Layer-Wise Dissimilar KV Cache Sharing
**Authors**: Yifei Yang, Zouying Cao, Qiguang Chen, Libo Qin, Dongjie Yang, Hai Zhao, Zhi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-24T08:06:41Z

**Summary**: The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly expanded model sizes, resulting in substantial GPU memory requirements during inference. The key and value storage of the attention map in the KV (key-value) cache accounts for more than 80\% of this memory consumption. Nowadays, most existing KV cache compression methods focus on intra-layer compression within a single Transformer layer but few works consider layer-wise compression. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play method called \textit{KVSharer}, which shares the KV cache between layers to achieve layer-wise compression. Rather than intuitively sharing based on higher similarity, we discover a counterintuitive phenomenon: sharing dissimilar KV caches better preserves the model performance. Experiments show that \textit{KVSharer} can reduce KV cache computation by 30\%, thereby lowering memory consumption without significantly impacting model performance and it can also achieve at least 1.3 times generation acceleration. Additionally, we verify that \textit{KVSharer} is compatible with existing intra-layer KV cache compression methods, and combining both can further save memory.

### The Nature of Mathematical Modeling and Probabilistic Optimization   Engineering in Generative AI
**Authors**: Fulu Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-24T05:29:20Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we give an in-depth analysis on the mathematical problem formulations and the probabilistic optimization explorations for some of the key components in Transformer model [33] in the field of generative AI. We explore and discuss some potential further enhancement for current state of the art methods for some key underlying technologies of generative AI models from algorithmic and probabilistic optimization perspective. In particular, we present an optimal solution for sub-word encoding (SWE) based on similar initial settings as that of byte-pair encoding (BPE) algorithm in [9] with similar objectives as that of WordPiece approach in [28, 31] to maximize the likelihood of the training data. We also present cross entropy optimization method to optimize hyperparameters for word2vec model [17]. In addition, we propose a factored combination of rotary positional encoding (RoPE) [32] and attention with linear biases (ALiBi) [23] with a harmonic series. We also present a probabilistic FlashAttention [6, 7] (PrFlashAttention) method with a probability distribution over block distances in the matrix to decide which block is likely to participate in a given round of attention computation while maintaining the lower triangle shape of the tensor for autoregressive language models by re-shaping the tensors. Finally, we present staircase adaptive quantization (SAQ) of key-value (KV) cache for multi-query attention (MQA) based on the framework presented in [16] to have gradual quantization degradation while achieving reasonable model quality and cost savings.

### Digital Network Twins for Next-generation Wireless: Creation,   Optimization, and Challenges
**Authors**: Yuchen Liu, Zhiyuan Peng, Zifan Zhang, Hanzhi Yu, Mingzhe Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-23T16:25:22Z

**Summary**: Digital network twins (DNTs), by representing a physical network using a virtual model, offer significant benefits such as streamlined network development, enhanced productivity, and cost reduction for next-generation (nextG) communication infrastructure. Existing works mainly describe the deployment of DNT technologies in various service sections.The full life cycle of DNTs for telecommunication has not yet been comprehensively studied, particularly in the aspects of fine-grained creation, real-time adaptation, resource-efficient deployment, and security protection.

**Authors**: Muhammed Golec, Guneet Kaur Walia, Mohit Kumar, Felix Cuadrado, Sukhpal Singh Gill, Steve Uhlig

**Updated**: 2024-10-23T15:44:09Z

**Summary**: Recently, academics and the corporate sector have paid attention to serverless computing, which enables dynamic scalability and an economic model. In serverless computing, users only pay for the time they actually use resources, enabling zero scaling to optimise cost and resource utilisation. However, this approach also introduces the serverless cold start problem. Researchers have developed various solutions to address the cold start problem, yet it remains an unresolved research area. In this article, we propose a systematic literature review on clod start latency in serverless computing. Furthermore, we create a detailed taxonomy of approaches to cold start latency, which we use to investigate existing techniques for reducing the cold start time and frequency. We have classified the current studies on cold start latency into several categories such as caching and application-level optimisation-based solutions, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)-based solutions. Moreover, we have analyzed the impact of cold start latency on quality of service, explored current cold start latency mitigation methods, datasets, and implementation platforms, and classified them into categories based on their common characteristics and features. Finally, we outline the open challenges and highlight the possible future directions.

### ExpertFlow: Optimized Expert Activation and Token Allocation for   Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Inference
**Authors**: Xin He, Shunkang Zhang, Yuxin Wang, Haiyan Yin, Zihao Zeng, Shaohuai Shi, Zhenheng Tang, Xiaowen Chu, Ivor Tsang, Ong Yew Soon

**Updated**: 2024-10-23T15:24:54Z

**Summary**: Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, while outperforming dense Large Language Models (LLMs) in terms of performance, face significant deployment challenges during inference due to their high memory demands. Existing offloading techniques, which involve swapping activated and idle experts between the GPU and CPU, often suffer from rigid expert caching mechanisms. These mechanisms fail to adapt to dynamic routing, leading to inefficient cache utilization, or incur prohibitive costs for prediction training. To tackle these inference-specific challenges, we introduce ExpertFlow, a comprehensive system specifically designed to enhance inference efficiency by accommodating flexible routing and enabling efficient expert scheduling between CPU and GPU. This reduces overhead and boosts system performance. Central to our approach is a predictive routing path-based offloading mechanism that utilizes a lightweight predictor to accurately forecast routing paths before computation begins. This proactive strategy allows for real-time error correction in expert caching, significantly increasing cache hit ratios and reducing the frequency of expert transfers, thereby minimizing I/O overhead. Additionally, we implement a dynamic token scheduling strategy that optimizes MoE inference by rearranging input tokens across different batches. This method not only reduces the number of activated experts per batch but also improves computational efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpertFlow achieves up to 93.72\% GPU memory savings and enhances inference speed by 2 to 10 times compared to baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and utility as a robust solution for resource-constrained inference scenarios.

**Authors**: Daniel Ekpo, Mara Levy, Saksham Suri, Chuong Huynh, Abhinav Shrivastava

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T18:59:51Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) offer potential for robot task planning, but challenges remain due to VLMs' tendency to generate incorrect action sequences. To address these limitations, we propose VeriGraph, a novel framework that integrates VLMs for robotic planning while verifying action feasibility. VeriGraph employs scene graphs as an intermediate representation, capturing key objects and spatial relationships to improve plan verification and refinement. The system generates a scene graph from input images and uses it to iteratively check and correct action sequences generated by an LLM-based task planner, ensuring constraints are respected and actions are executable. Our approach significantly enhances task completion rates across diverse manipulation scenarios, outperforming baseline methods by 58% for language-based tasks and 30% for image-based tasks.

### LLaVA-o1: Let Vision Language Models Reason Step-by-Step
**Authors**: Guowei Xu, Peng Jin, Li Hao, Yibing Song, Lichao Sun, Li Yuan

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T18:58:31Z

**Summary**: Large language models have demonstrated substantial advancements in reasoning capabilities, particularly through inference-time scaling, as illustrated by models such as OpenAI's o1. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-o1, a novel VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-o1 independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-o1 to achieve marked improvements in precision on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we compile the LLaVA-o1-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose an inference-time stage-level beam search method, which enables effective inference-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and a simple yet effective inference time scaling method, LLaVA-o1 not only outperforms its base model by 8.9% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.

### M-VAR: Decoupled Scale-wise Autoregressive Modeling for High-Quality   Image Generation
**Authors**: Sucheng Ren, Yaodong Yu, Nataniel Ruiz, Feng Wang, Alan Yuille, Cihang Xie

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T18:54:42Z

**Summary**: There exists recent work in computer vision, named VAR, that proposes a new autoregressive paradigm for image generation. Diverging from the vanilla next-token prediction, VAR structurally reformulates the image generation into a coarse to fine next-scale prediction. In this paper, we show that this scale-wise autoregressive framework can be effectively decoupled into \textit{intra-scale modeling}, which captures local spatial dependencies within each scale, and \textit{inter-scale modeling}, which models cross-scale relationships progressively from coarse-to-fine scales. This decoupling structure allows to rebuild VAR in a more computationally efficient manner. Specifically, for intra-scale modeling -- crucial for generating high-fidelity images -- we retain the original bidirectional self-attention design to ensure comprehensive modeling; for inter-scale modeling, which semantically connects different scales but is computationally intensive, we apply linear-complexity mechanisms like Mamba to substantially reduce computational overhead. We term this new framework M-VAR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models in both image quality and generation speed. For example, our 1.5B model, with fewer parameters and faster inference speed, outperforms the largest VAR-d30-2B. Moreover, our largest model M-VAR-d32 impressively registers 1.78 FID on ImageNet 256$\times$256 and outperforms the prior-art autoregressive models LlamaGen/VAR by 0.4/0.19 and popular diffusion models LDM/DiT by 1.82/0.49, respectively. Code is avaiable at \url{https://github.com/OliverRensu/MVAR}.

### Mitigating Parameter Degeneracy using Joint Conditional Diffusion Model   for WECC Composite Load Model in Power Systems
**Authors**: Feiqin Zhu, Dmitrii Torbunov, Yihui Ren, Zhongjing Jiang, Tianqiao Zhao, Amirthagunaraj Yogarathnam, Meng Yue

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T18:53:08Z

**Summary**: Data-driven modeling for dynamic systems has gained widespread attention in recent years. Its inverse formulation, parameter estimation, aims to infer the inherent model parameters from observations. However, parameter degeneracy, where different combinations of parameters yield the same observable output, poses a critical barrier to accurately and uniquely identifying model parameters. In the context of WECC composite load model (CLM) in power systems, utility practitioners have observed that CLM parameters carefully selected for one fault event may not perform satisfactorily in another fault. Here, we innovate a joint conditional diffusion model-based inverse problem solver (JCDI), that incorporates a joint conditioning architecture with simultaneous inputs of multi-event observations to improve parameter generalizability. Simulation studies on the WECC CLM show that the proposed JCDI effectively reduces uncertainties of degenerate parameters, thus the parameter estimation error is decreased by 42.1% compared to a single-event learning scheme. This enables the model to achieve high accuracy in predicting power trajectories under different fault events, including electronic load tripping and motor stalling, outperforming standard deep reinforcement learning and supervised learning approaches. We anticipate this work will contribute to mitigating parameter degeneracy in system dynamics, providing a general parameter estimation framework across various scientific domains.

### SN 2023adsy -- a normal Type Ia Supernova at z=2.9, discovered by JWST
**Authors**: Jozsef Vinko, Eniko Regos

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T18:50:27Z

**Summary**: SN 2023adsy, a Type Ia supernova discovered by JWST at z = 2.9, was found to be a peculiar event, being extremely red and faint, but showing very similar rest-frame light curve decline rate to the majority of low-redshift SNe Ia. In this paper we show that the red color and faint peak magnitude could be explained by significant reddening/extinction due to dust in the host galaxy. If host galaxy extinction is accounted for, the parameters of the best-fit light curve templates in the SALT3-NIR model are compatible with a slowly declining, but still normal SN Ia. Comparison of the inferred luminosity distance with the prediction of the LambdaCDM cosmology (assuming H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc and OmegaM = 0.315) on the Hubble-diagram suggests no significant evolution of the SN Ia peak luminosity at z > 2 redshifts. It is also shown that the discovery of a single SN Ia between 2 < z < 3 within the area of the JADES survey during 1 year is consistent with the current estimates for the SN Ia rates at such redshifts.

### Treat Visual Tokens as Text? But Your MLLM Only Needs Fewer Efforts to   See
**Authors**: Zeliang Zhang, Phu Pham, Wentian Zhao, Kun Wan, Yu-Jhe Li, Jianing Zhou, Daniel Miranda, Ajinkya Kale, Chenliang Xu

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T18:43:23Z

**Summary**: By treating visual tokens from visual encoders as text tokens, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across diverse visual understanding tasks, leveraging the robust architectures of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, as token counts grow, the quadratic scaling of computation in LLMs introduces a significant efficiency bottleneck, impeding further scalability. Although recent approaches have explored pruning visual tokens or employing lighter LLM architectures, the computational overhead from an increasing number of visual tokens remains a substantial challenge.   In this study, we investigate the redundancy in visual computation at both the parameter and computational pattern levels within LLaVA, a representative MLLM, and introduce a suite of streamlined strategies to enhance efficiency. These include neighbor-aware visual token attention, pruning of inactive visual attention heads, and selective layer dropping for visual computations. By implementing these strategies in LLaVA, we achieve a reduction in computational demands of 88% while maintaining model performance across key benchmarks. Additionally, we validate the existence of visual computational redundancy in other MLLMs, such as Qwen2-VL-7B and InternVL-2.0-4B/8B/26B. These results present a novel pathway for MLLMs to handle dense visual tokens with minimal computational costs. Code and model checkpoints will be released to support further research.

### Evaluating Creativity and Deception in Large Language Models: A   Simulation Framework for Multi-Agent Balderdash
**Authors**: Parsa Hejabi, Elnaz Rahmati, Alireza S. Ziabari, Preni Golazizian, Jesse Thomason, Morteza Dehghani

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T18:42:48Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex tasks and interactive environments, yet their creativity remains underexplored. This paper introduces a simulation framework utilizing the game Balderdash to evaluate both the creativity and logical reasoning of LLMs. In Balderdash, players generate fictitious definitions for obscure terms to deceive others while identifying correct definitions. Our framework enables multiple LLM agents to participate in this game, assessing their ability to produce plausible definitions and strategize based on game rules and history. We implemented a centralized game engine featuring various LLMs as participants and a judge LLM to evaluate semantic equivalence. Through a series of experiments, we analyzed the performance of different LLMs, examining metrics such as True Definition Ratio, Deception Ratio, and Correct Guess Ratio. The results provide insights into the creative and deceptive capabilities of LLMs, highlighting their strengths and areas for improvement. Specifically, the study reveals that infrequent vocabulary in LLMs' input leads to poor reasoning on game rules and historical context (https://github.com/ParsaHejabi/Simulation-Framework-for-Multi-Agent-Balderdash).

### Large Language Model-Based Interpretable Machine Learning Control in   Building Energy Systems
**Authors**: Liang Zhang, Zhelun Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T18:34:42Z

**Summary**: The potential of Machine Learning Control (MLC) in HVAC systems is hindered by its opaque nature and inference mechanisms, which is challenging for users and modelers to fully comprehend, ultimately leading to a lack of trust in MLC-based decision-making. To address this challenge, this paper investigates and explores Interpretable Machine Learning (IML), a branch of Machine Learning (ML) that enhances transparency and understanding of models and their inferences, to improve the credibility of MLC and its industrial application in HVAC systems. Specifically, we developed an innovative framework that combines the principles of Shapley values and the in-context learning feature of Large Language Models (LLMs). While the Shapley values are instrumental in dissecting the contributions of various features in ML models, LLM provides an in-depth understanding of the non-data-driven or rule-based elements in MLC; combining them, LLM further packages these insights into a coherent, human-understandable narrative. The paper presents a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of the developed IML framework for model predictive control-based precooling under demand response events in a virtual testbed. The results indicate that the developed framework generates and explains the control signals in accordance with the rule-based rationale.

**Authors**: Jianfeng Chi, Ujjwal Karn, Hongyuan Zhan, Eric Smith, Javier Rando, Yiming Zhang, Kate Plawiak, Zacharie Delpierre Coudert, Kartikeya Upasani, Mahesh Pasupuleti

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T18:34:07Z

**Summary**: We introduce Llama Guard 3 Vision, a multimodal LLM-based safeguard for human-AI conversations that involves image understanding: it can be used to safeguard content for both multimodal LLM inputs (prompt classification) and outputs (response classification). Unlike the previous text-only Llama Guard versions (Inan et al., 2023; Llama Team, 2024b,a), it is specifically designed to support image reasoning use cases and is optimized to detect harmful multimodal (text and image) prompts and text responses to these prompts. Llama Guard 3 Vision is fine-tuned on Llama 3.2-Vision and demonstrates strong performance on the internal benchmarks using the MLCommons taxonomy. We also test its robustness against adversarial attacks. We believe that Llama Guard 3 Vision serves as a good starting point to build more capable and robust content moderation tools for human-AI conversation with multimodal capabilities.

### Swarm Characteristics Classification Using Neural Networks
**Authors**: Donald W. Peltier III, Isaac Kaminer, Abram Clark, Marko Orescanin

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T18:31:46Z

**Summary**: Understanding the characteristics of swarming autonomous agents is critical for defense and security applications. This article presents a study on using supervised neural network time series classification (NN TSC) to predict key attributes and tactics of swarming autonomous agents for military contexts. Specifically, NN TSC is applied to infer two binary attributes - communication and proportional navigation - which combine to define four mutually exclusive swarm tactics. We identify a gap in literature on using NNs for swarm classification and demonstrate the effectiveness of NN TSC in rapidly deducing intelligence about attacking swarms to inform counter-maneuvers. Through simulated swarm-vs-swarm engagements, we evaluate NN TSC performance in terms of observation window requirements, noise robustness, and scalability to swarm size. Key findings show NNs can predict swarm behaviors with 97% accuracy using short observation windows of 20 time steps, while also demonstrating graceful degradation down to 80% accuracy under 50% noise, as well as excellent scalability to swarm sizes from 10 to 100 agents. These capabilities are promising for real-time decision-making support in defense scenarios by rapidly inferring insights about swarm behavior.

### Causal Inference under Network Interference Using a Mixture of   Randomized Experiments
**Authors**: Yiming Jiang, He Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T18:19:41Z

**Summary**: In randomized experiments, the classic Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) posits that the outcome for one experimental unit is unaffected by the treatment assignments of other units. However, this assumption is frequently violated in settings such as online marketplaces and social networks, where interference between units is common. We address the estimation of the total treatment effect in a network interference model by employing a mixed randomization design that combines two widely used experimental methods: Bernoulli randomization, where treatment is assigned independently to each unit, and cluster-based randomization, where treatment is assigned at the aggregate level. The mixed randomization design simultaneously incorporates both methods, thereby mitigating the bias present in cluster-based designs. We propose an unbiased estimator for the total treatment effect under this mixed design and show that its variance is bounded by $O(d^2 n^{-1} p^{-1} (1-p)^{-1})$, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the network, $n$ is the network size, and $p$ is the treatment probability. Additionally, we establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{1.5} n^{-1} p^{-1} (1-p)^{-1})$ for the variance of any mixed design. Moreover, when the interference weights on the network's edges are unknown, we propose a weight-invariant design that achieves a variance bound of $O(d^3 n^{-1} p^{-1} (1-p)^{-1})$, which is aligned with the estimator introduced by Cortez-Rodriguez et al. (2023) under similar conditions.

### Guaranteed Bounds on Posterior Distributions of Discrete Probabilistic   Programs with Loops
**Authors**: Fabian Zaiser, Andrzej S. Murawski, C. -H. Luke Ong

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T18:01:40Z

**Summary**: We study the problem of bounding the posterior distribution of discrete probabilistic programs with unbounded support, loops, and conditioning. Loops pose the main difficulty in this setting: even if exact Bayesian inference is possible, the state of the art requires user-provided loop invariant templates. By contrast, we aim to find guaranteed bounds, which sandwich the true distribution. They are fully automated, applicable to more programs and provide more provable guarantees than approximate sampling-based inference. Since lower bounds can be obtained by unrolling loops, the main challenge is upper bounds, and we attack it in two ways. The first is called residual mass semantics, which is a flat bound based on the residual probability mass of a loop. The approach is simple, efficient, and has provable guarantees.   The main novelty of our work is the second approach, called geometric bound semantics. It operates on a novel family of distributions, called eventually geometric distributions (EGDs), and can bound the distribution of loops with a new form of loop invariants called contraction invariants. The invariant synthesis problem reduces to a system of polynomial inequality constraints, which is a decidable problem with automated solvers. If a solution exists, it yields an exponentially decreasing bound on the whole distribution, and can therefore bound moments and tail asymptotics as well, not just probabilities as in the first approach.   Both semantics enjoy desirable theoretical properties. In particular, we prove soundness and convergence, i.e. the bounds converge to the exact posterior as loops are unrolled further. On the practical side, we describe Diabolo, a fully-automated implementation of both semantics, and evaluate them on a variety of benchmarks from the literature, demonstrating their general applicability and the utility of the resulting bounds.

### Reproducible Aggregation of Sample-Split Statistics
**Authors**: David M. Ritzwoller, Joseph P. Romano

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T17:41:13Z

**Summary**: Statistical inference is often simplified by sample-splitting. This simplification comes at the cost of the introduction of randomness not native to the data. We propose a simple procedure for sequentially aggregating statistics constructed with multiple splits of the same sample. The user specifies a bound and a nominal error rate. If the procedure is implemented twice on the same data, the nominal error rate approximates the chance that the results differ by more than the bound. We illustrate the application of the procedure to several widely applied econometric methods.

### A Survey of Event Causality Identification: Principles, Taxonomy,   Challenges, and Assessment
**Authors**: Zefan Zeng, Qing Cheng, Xingchen Hu, Yuehang Si, Zhong Liu

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T17:19:42Z

**Summary**: Event Causality Identification (ECI) has become a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), aimed at automatically extracting causalities from textual data. In this survey, we systematically address the foundational principles, technical frameworks, and challenges of ECI, offering a comprehensive taxonomy to categorize and clarify current research methodologies, as well as a quantitative assessment of existing models. We first establish a conceptual framework for ECI, outlining key definitions, problem formulations, and evaluation standards. Our taxonomy classifies ECI methods according to the two primary tasks of sentence-level (SECI) and document-level (DECI) event causality identification. For SECI, we examine feature pattern-based matching, deep semantic encoding, causal knowledge pre-training and prompt-based fine-tuning, and external knowledge enhancement methods. For DECI, we highlight approaches focused on event graph reasoning and prompt-based techniques to address the complexity of cross-sentence causal inference. Additionally, we analyze the strengths, limitations, and open challenges of each approach. We further conduct an extensive quantitative evaluation of various ECI methods on two benchmark datasets. Finally, we explore future research directions, highlighting promising pathways to overcome current limitations and broaden ECI applications.

### Interactive Cycle Model -- The Linkage Combination among Automatic   Speech Recognition, Large Language Models and Smart Glasses
**Authors**: Libo Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T17:11:13Z

**Summary**: This research proposes the interaction loop model "ASR-LLM-Smart Glasses", which model combines automatic speech recognition, large language model and smart glasses to facilitate seamless human-computer interaction. And the methodology of this research involves decomposing the interaction process into different stages and elements. Speech is captured and processed by ASR, then analyzed and interpreted by LLM. The results are then transmitted to smart glasses for display. The feedback loop is complete when the user interacts with the displayed data. Mathematical formulas are used to quantify the performance of the model that revolves around core evaluation points: accuracy, coherence, and latency during ASR speech-to-text conversion. The research results are provided theoretically to test and evaluate the feasibility and performance of the model. Although such human-computer interaction products have not yet appeared in the industry, the performance indicators of this model in enhancing user experience in fields that rely on human-computer interaction have also verified its utility as a technology to promote human-computer interaction. In addition, this research pioneered the idea of integrating cutting-edge technologies such as generative pre-trained Transformer models into unique interaction models, LLM provides raw value through powerful evaluation techniques and innovative use, which provides a new perspective to evaluate and enhanced human-computer interaction.

### Bias Unveiled: Investigating Social Bias in LLM-Generated Code
**Authors**: Lin Ling, Fazle Rabbi, Song Wang, Jinqiu Yang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T16:55:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of automated code generation. However, a notable research gap exists in the evaluation of social biases that may be present in the code produced by LLMs. To solve this issue, we propose a novel fairness framework, i.e., Solar, to assess and mitigate the social biases of LLM-generated code. Specifically, Solar can automatically generate test cases for quantitatively uncovering social biases of the auto-generated code by LLMs. To quantify the severity of social biases in generated code, we develop a dataset that covers a diverse set of social problems. We applied Solar and the crafted dataset to four state-of-the-art LLMs for code generation. Our evaluation reveals severe bias in the LLM-generated code from all the subject LLMs. Furthermore, we explore several strategies for bias mitigation, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, combining positive role-playing with CoT prompting and iterative prompting. Our experiments show that iterative prompting can effectively reduce social bias in LLM-generated code by up to 90%. Solar is highly extensible to evaluate new social problems.

### The Silicon Ceiling: Auditing GPT's Race and Gender Biases in Hiring
**Authors**: Lena Armstrong, Abbey Liu, Stephen MacNeil, Danaë Metaxa

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T16:53:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being introduced in workplace settings, with the goals of improving efficiency and fairness. However, concerns have arisen regarding these models' potential to reflect or exacerbate social biases and stereotypes. This study explores the potential impact of LLMs on hiring practices. To do so, we conduct an AI audit of race and gender biases in one commonly-used LLM, OpenAI's GPT-3.5, taking inspiration from the history of traditional offline resume audits. We conduct two studies using names with varied race and gender connotations: resume assessment (Study 1) and resume generation (Study 2). In Study 1, we ask GPT to score resumes with 32 different names (4 names for each combination of the 2 gender and 4 racial groups) and two anonymous options across 10 occupations and 3 evaluation tasks (overall rating, willingness to interview, and hireability). We find that the model reflects some biases based on stereotypes. In Study 2, we prompt GPT to create resumes (10 for each name) for fictitious job candidates. When generating resumes, GPT reveals underlying biases; women's resumes had occupations with less experience, while Asian and Hispanic resumes had immigrant markers, such as non-native English and non-U.S. education and work experiences. Our findings contribute to a growing body of literature on LLM biases, particularly in workplace contexts.

**Authors**: Yanzhi Wang, Chu Wang, Jinhong Wu, Ziyang Yu, Qi Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T16:40:43Z

**Summary**: Fault diagnosis technology supports the healthy operation of mechanical equipment. However, the variations conditions during the operation of mechanical equipment lead to significant disparities in data distribution, posing challenges to fault diagnosis. Furthermore, when deploying applications, traditional methods often encounter issues such as latency and data security. Therefore, conducting fault diagnosis and deploying application methods under cross-operating conditions holds significant value. This paper proposes a domain adaptation-based lightweight fault diagnosis framework for edge computing scenarios. Incorporating the local maximum mean discrepancy into knowledge transfer aligns the feature distributions of different domains in a high-dimensional feature space, to discover a common feature space across domains. The acquired fault diagnosis expertise from the cloud-model is transferred to the lightweight edge-model using adaptation knowledge transfer methods. While ensuring real-time diagnostic capabilities, accurate fault diagnosis is achieved across working conditions. We conducted validation experiments on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX kit. In terms of diagnostic performance, the proposed method significantly improved diagnostic accuracy, with average increases of 34.44% and 17.33% compared to the comparison method, respectively. Regarding lightweight effectiveness, proposed method achieved an average inference speed increase of 80.47%. Additionally, compared to the cloud-model, the parameter count of the edge-model decreased by 96.37%, while the Flops decreased by 83.08%.

**Authors**: Pasquale De Rosa, Yérom-David Bromberg, Pascal Felber, Djob Mvondo, Valerio Schiavoni

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T16:36:21Z

**Summary**: In machine learning (ML), the inference phase is the process of applying pre-trained models to new, unseen data with the objective of making predictions. During the inference phase, end-users interact with ML services to gain insights, recommendations, or actions based on the input data. For this reason, serving strategies are nowadays crucial for deploying and managing models in production environments effectively. These strategies ensure that models are available, scalable, reliable, and performant for real-world applications, such as time series forecasting, image classification, natural language processing, and so on. In this paper, we evaluate the performances of five widely-used model serving frameworks (TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, MLServer, MLflow, and BentoML) under four different scenarios (malware detection, cryptocoin prices forecasting, image classification, and sentiment analysis). We demonstrate that TensorFlow Serving is able to outperform all the other frameworks in serving deep learning (DL) models. Moreover, we show that DL-specific frameworks (TensorFlow Serving and TorchServe) display significantly lower latencies than the three general-purpose ML frameworks (BentoML, MLFlow, and MLServer).

### Number it: Temporal Grounding Videos like Flipping Manga
**Authors**: Yongliang Wu, Xinting Hu, Yuyang Sun, Yizhou Zhou, Wenbo Zhu, Fengyun Rao, Bernt Schiele, Xu Yang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T16:32:34Z

**Summary**: Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) have made remarkable advancements in comprehending video content for QA dialogue. However, they struggle to extend this visual understanding to tasks requiring precise temporal localization, known as Video Temporal Grounding (VTG). To address this gap, we introduce Number-Prompt (NumPro), a novel method that empowers Vid-LLMs to bridge visual comprehension with temporal grounding by adding unique numerical identifiers to each video frame. Treating a video as a sequence of numbered frame images, NumPro transforms VTG into an intuitive process: flipping through manga panels in sequence. This allows Vid-LLMs to "read" event timelines, accurately linking visual content with corresponding temporal information. Our experiments demonstrate that NumPro significantly boosts VTG performance of top-tier Vid-LLMs without additional computational cost. Furthermore, fine-tuning on a NumPro-enhanced dataset defines a new state-of-the-art for VTG, surpassing previous top-performing methods by up to 6.9\% in mIoU for moment retrieval and 8.5\% in mAP for highlight detection. The code will be available at https://github.com/yongliang-wu/NumPro.

### Open LLMs are Necessary for Current Private Adaptations and Outperform   their Closed Alternatives
**Authors**: Vincent Hanke, Tom Blanchard, Franziska Boenisch, Iyiola Emmanuel Olatunji, Michael Backes, Adam Dziedzic

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T16:23:17Z

**Summary**: While open Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress, they still fall short of matching the performance of their closed, proprietary counterparts, making the latter attractive even for the use on highly private data. Recently, various new methods have been proposed to adapt closed LLMs to private data without leaking private information to third parties and/or the LLM provider. In this work, we analyze the privacy protection and performance of the four most recent methods for private adaptation of closed LLMs. By examining their threat models and thoroughly comparing their performance under different privacy levels according to differential privacy (DP), various LLM architectures, and multiple datasets for classification and generation tasks, we find that: (1) all the methods leak query data, i.e., the (potentially sensitive) user data that is queried at inference time, to the LLM provider, (2) three out of four methods also leak large fractions of private training data to the LLM provider while the method that protects private data requires a local open LLM, (3) all the methods exhibit lower performance compared to three private gradient-based adaptation methods for local open LLMs, and (4) the private adaptation methods for closed LLMs incur higher monetary training and query costs than running the alternative methods on local open LLMs. This yields the conclusion that, to achieve truly privacy-preserving LLM adaptations that yield high performance and more privacy at lower costs, taking into account current methods and models, one should use open LLMs.

### M3TR: Generalist HD Map Construction with Variable Map Priors
**Authors**: Fabian Immel, Richard Fehler, Frank Bieder, Jan-Hendrik Pauls, Christoph Stiller

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T16:14:48Z

**Summary**: Autonomous vehicles require road information for their operation, usually in form of HD maps. Since offline maps eventually become outdated or may only be partially available, online HD map construction methods have been proposed to infer map information from live sensor data. A key issue remains how to exploit such partial or outdated map information as a prior. We introduce M3TR (Multi-Masking Map Transformer), a generalist approach for HD map construction both with and without map priors. We address shortcomings in ground truth generation for Argoverse 2 and nuScenes and propose the first realistic scenarios with semantically diverse map priors. Examining various query designs, we use an improved method for integrating prior map elements into a HD map construction model, increasing performance by +4.3 mAP. Finally, we show that training across all prior scenarios yields a single Generalist model, whose performance is on par with previous Expert models that can handle only one specific type of map prior. M3TR thus is the first model capable of leveraging variable map priors, making it suitable for real-world deployment. Code is available at https://github.com/immel-f/m3tr

### Planar Novikov-Shubin invariant for adjacency matrices of structured   directed dense random graphs
**Authors**: Torben Krüger, David Renfrew

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T16:08:19Z

**Summary**: The Novikov-Shubin invariant associated to a graph provides information about the accumulation of eigenvalues of the corresponding adjacency matrix close to the origin. For a directed graph these eigenvalues lie in the complex plane and having a finite value for the planar Novikov-Shubin invariant indicates a polynomial behaviour of the eigenvalue density as a function of the distance to zero. We provide a complete description of these invariants for dense random digraphs with constant batch sizes, i.e. for the directed stochastic block model. The invariants depend only on which batches in the graph are connected by non-zero edge densities. We present an explicit finite step algorithm for their computation. For the proof we identify the asymptotic spectral density with the distribution of a $\mathbb{C}^K$-valued circular element in operator-valued free probability theory. We determine the spectral density in the bulk regime by solving the associated Dyson equation and infer the singular behaviour of this density close to the origin by determining the exponents associated to the power law with which the resolvent entries of the adjacency matrix that corresponds to the individual batches diverge to infinity or converge to zero.

### Static network structure cannot stabilize cooperation among Large   Language Model agents
**Authors**: Jin Han, Balaraju Battu, Ivan Romić, Talal Rahwan, Petter Holme

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T15:52:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model human social behavior, with recent research exploring their ability to simulate social dynamics. Here, we test whether LLMs mirror human behavior in social dilemmas, where individual and collective interests conflict. Humans generally cooperate more than expected in laboratory settings, showing less cooperation in well-mixed populations but more in fixed networks. In contrast, LLMs tend to exhibit greater cooperation in well-mixed settings. This raises a key question: Are LLMs about to emulate human behavior in cooperative dilemmas on networks? In this study, we examine networked interactions where agents repeatedly engage in the Prisoner's Dilemma within both well-mixed and structured network configurations, aiming to identify parallels in cooperative behavior between LLMs and humans. Our findings indicate critical distinctions: while humans tend to cooperate more within structured networks, LLMs display increased cooperation mainly in well-mixed environments, with limited adjustment to networked contexts. Notably, LLM cooperation also varies across model types, illustrating the complexities of replicating human-like social adaptability in artificial agents. These results highlight a crucial gap: LLMs struggle to emulate the nuanced, adaptive social strategies humans deploy in fixed networks. Unlike human participants, LLMs do not alter their cooperative behavior in response to network structures or evolving social contexts, missing the reciprocity norms that humans adaptively employ. This limitation points to a fundamental need in future LLM design -- to integrate a deeper comprehension of social norms, enabling more authentic modeling of human-like cooperation and adaptability in networked environments.

### Multidimensional Byte Pair Encoding: Shortened Sequences for Improved   Visual Data Generation
**Authors**: Tim Elsner, Paula Usinger, Julius Nehring-Wirxel, Gregor Kobsik, Victor Czech, Yanjiang He, Isaak Lim, Leif Kobbelt

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T15:36:48Z

**Summary**: In language processing, transformers benefit greatly from text being condensed. This is achieved through a larger vocabulary that captures word fragments instead of plain characters. This is often done with Byte Pair Encoding. In the context of images, tokenisation of visual data is usually limited to regular grids obtained from quantisation methods, without global content awareness. Our work improves tokenisation of visual data by bringing Byte Pair Encoding from 1D to multiple dimensions, as a complementary add-on to existing compression. We achieve this through counting constellations of token pairs and replacing the most frequent token pair with a newly introduced token. The multidimensionality only increases the computation time by a factor of 2 for images, making it applicable even to large datasets like ImageNet within minutes on consumer hardware. This is a lossless preprocessing step. Our evaluation shows improved training and inference performance of transformers on visual data achieved by compressing frequent constellations of tokens: The resulting sequences are shorter, with more uniformly distributed information content, e.g. condensing empty regions in an image into single tokens. As our experiments show, these condensed sequences are easier to process. We additionally introduce a strategy to amplify this compression further by clustering the vocabulary.

### Scaling Law for Post-training after Model Pruning
**Authors**: Xiaodong Chen, Yuxuan Hu, Jing Zhang, Xiaokang Zhang, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T15:28:42Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) based on the Transformer architecture are widely employed across various domains and tasks. However, their increasing size imposes significant hardware demands, limiting practical deployment. To mitigate this, model pruning techniques have been developed to create more efficient models while maintaining high performance. Despite this, post-training after pruning is crucial for performance recovery and can be resource-intensive. This paper investigates the post-training requirements of pruned LLMs and introduces a scaling law to determine the optimal amount of post-training data. Post-training experiments with the Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5 series models, pruned using depth pruning, width pruning, and 2:4 semi-structured pruning, show that higher pruning ratios necessitate more post-training data for performance recovery, whereas larger LLMs require less. The proposed scaling law predicts a model's loss based on its parameter counts before and after pruning, as well as the post-training token counts. Furthermore, we find that the scaling law established from smaller LLMs can be reliably extrapolated to larger LLMs. This work provides valuable insights into the post-training of pruned LLMs and offers a practical scaling law for optimizing post-training data usage.

### Partial Scene Text Retrieval
**Authors**: Hao Wang, Minghui Liao, Zhouyi Xie, Wenyu Liu, Xiang Bai

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T15:08:04Z

**Summary**: The task of partial scene text retrieval involves localizing and searching for text instances that are the same or similar to a given query text from an image gallery. However, existing methods can only handle text-line instances, leaving the problem of searching for partial patches within these text-line instances unsolved due to a lack of patch annotations in the training data. To address this issue, we propose a network that can simultaneously retrieve both text-line instances and their partial patches. Our method embeds the two types of data (query text and scene text instances) into a shared feature space and measures their cross-modal similarities. To handle partial patches, our proposed approach adopts a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach to learn their similarities with query text, without requiring extra annotations. However, constructing bags, which is a standard step of conventional MIL approaches, can introduce numerous noisy samples for training, and lower inference speed. To address this issue, we propose a Ranking MIL (RankMIL) approach to adaptively filter those noisy samples. Additionally, we present a Dynamic Partial Match Algorithm (DPMA) that can directly search for the target partial patch from a text-line instance during the inference stage, without requiring bags. This greatly improves the search efficiency and the performance of retrieving partial patches. The source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/lanfeng4659/PSTR.

### Optimization-based Prompt Injection Attack to LLM-as-a-Judge
**Authors**: Jiawen Shi, Zenghui Yuan, Yinuo Liu, Yue Huang, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun, Neil Zhenqiang Gong

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T14:57:28Z

**Summary**: LLM-as-a-Judge uses a large language model (LLM) to select the best response from a set of candidates for a given question. LLM-as-a-Judge has many applications such as LLM-powered search, reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF), and tool selection. In this work, we propose JudgeDeceiver, an optimization-based prompt injection attack to LLM-as-a-Judge. JudgeDeceiver injects a carefully crafted sequence into an attacker-controlled candidate response such that LLM-as-a-Judge selects the candidate response for an attacker-chosen question no matter what other candidate responses are. Specifically, we formulate finding such sequence as an optimization problem and propose a gradient based method to approximately solve it. Our extensive evaluation shows that JudgeDeceive is highly effective, and is much more effective than existing prompt injection attacks that manually craft the injected sequences and jailbreak attacks when extended to our problem. We also show the effectiveness of JudgeDeceiver in three case studies, i.e., LLM-powered search, RLAIF, and tool selection. Moreover, we consider defenses including known-answer detection, perplexity detection, and perplexity windowed detection. Our results show these defenses are insufficient, highlighting the urgent need for developing new defense strategies. Our implementation is available at this repository: https://github.com/ShiJiawenwen/JudgeDeceiver.

### Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays versus Models of High Energy Hadronic   Interactions
**Authors**: Blaž Bortolato, Jernej F. Kamenik, Michele Tammaro

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T14:36:46Z

**Summary**: We evaluate the consistency of hadronic interaction models in the CORSIKA simulation package with publicly available fluorescence telescope data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. By comparing the first few central moments of the extended air shower depth maximum distributions, as extracted from measured events, to those predicted by the best-fit inferred compositions, we derive a statistical measure of the consistency of a given hadronic model with data. To mitigate possible systematic biases, we include all primaries up to iron, compensate for the differences between the measured and simulated energy spectra of cosmic rays and account for other known systematic effects. Additionally, we study the effects of including higher central moments in the fit and project our results to larger statistics.

### Bayesian Adaptive Tucker Decompositions for Tensor Factorization
**Authors**: Federica Stolf, Antonio Canale

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T14:24:38Z

**Summary**: Tucker tensor decomposition offers a more effective representation for multiway data compared to the widely used PARAFAC model. However, its flexibility brings the challenge of selecting the appropriate latent multi-rank. To overcome the issue of pre-selecting the latent multi-rank, we introduce a Bayesian adaptive Tucker decomposition model that infers the multi-rank automatically via an infinite increasing shrinkage prior. The model introduces local sparsity in the core tensor, inducing rich and at the same time parsimonious dependency structures. Posterior inference proceeds via an efficient adaptive Gibbs sampler, supporting both continuous and binary data and allowing for straightforward missing data imputation when dealing with incomplete multiway data. We discuss fundamental properties of the proposed modeling framework, providing theoretical justification. Simulation studies and applications to chemometrics and complex ecological data offer compelling evidence of its advantages over existing tensor factorization methods.

### An Empirical Study on LLM-based Agents for Automated Bug Fixing
**Authors**: Xiangxin Meng, Zexiong Ma, Pengfei Gao, Chao Peng

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T14:19:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based Agents have been applied to fix bugs automatically, demonstrating the capability in addressing software defects by engaging in development environment interaction, iterative validation and code modification. However, systematic analysis of these agent and non-agent systems remain limited, particularly regarding performance variations among top-performing ones. In this paper, we examine seven proprietary and open-source systems on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark for automated bug fixing. We first assess each system's overall performance, noting instances solvable by all or none of these sytems, and explore why some instances are uniquely solved by specific system types. We also compare fault localization accuracy at file and line levels and evaluate bug reproduction capabilities, identifying instances solvable only through dynamic reproduction. Through analysis, we concluded that further optimization is needed in both the LLM itself and the design of Agentic flow to improve the effectiveness of the Agent in bug fixing.

### Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Variance Decomposition with Linear Optimal   Transport
**Authors**: Michael Wilson, Tom Needham, Anuj Srivastava

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T14:10:52Z

**Summary**: Wasserstein distances form a family of metrics on spaces of probability measures that have recently seen many applications. However, statistical analysis in these spaces is complex due to the nonlinearity of Wasserstein spaces. One potential solution to this problem is Linear Optimal Transport (LOT). This method allows one to find a Euclidean embedding, called LOT embedding, of measures in some Wasserstein spaces, but some information is lost in this embedding. So, to understand whether statistical analysis relying on LOT embeddings can make valid inferences about original data, it is helpful to quantify how well these embeddings describe that data. To answer this question, we present a decomposition of the Fr\'echet variance of a set of measures in the 2-Wasserstein space, which allows one to compute the percentage of variance explained by LOT embeddings of those measures. We then extend this decomposition to the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein setting. We also present several experiments that explore the relationship between the dimension of the LOT embedding, the percentage of variance explained by the embedding, and the classification accuracy of machine learning classifiers built on the embedded data. We use the MNIST handwritten digits dataset, IMDB-50000 dataset, and Diffusion Tensor MRI images for these experiments. Our results illustrate the effectiveness of low dimensional LOT embeddings in terms of the percentage of variance explained and the classification accuracy of models built on the embedded data.

### Q-VLM: Post-training Quantization for Large Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Changyuan Wang, Ziwei Wang, Xiuwei Xu, Yansong Tang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T13:57:06Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we propose a post-training quantization framework of large vision-language models (LVLMs) for efficient multi-modal inference. Conventional quantization methods sequentially search the layer-wise rounding functions by minimizing activation discretization errors, which fails to acquire optimal quantization strategy without considering cross-layer dependency. On the contrary, we mine the cross-layer dependency that significantly influences discretization errors of the entire vision-language model, and embed this dependency into optimal quantization strategy searching with low search cost. Specifically, we observe the strong correlation between the activation entropy and the cross-layer dependency concerning output discretization errors. Therefore, we employ the entropy as the proxy to partition blocks optimally, which aims to achieve satisfying trade-offs between discretization errors and the search cost. Moreover, we optimize the visual encoder to disentangle the cross-layer dependency for fine-grained decomposition of search space, so that the search cost is further reduced without harming the quantization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method compresses the memory by 2.78x and increase generate speed by 1.44x about 13B LLaVA model without performance degradation on diverse multi-modal reasoning tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/ChangyuanWang17/QVLM.

### Agentic LLMs in the Supply Chain: Towards Autonomous Multi-Agent   Consensus-Seeking
**Authors**: Valeria Jannelli, Stefan Schoepf, Matthias Bickel, Torbjørn Netland, Alexandra Brintrup

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T13:33:10Z

**Summary**: This paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate consensus-seeking in supply chain management (SCM), where frequent decisions on problems such as inventory levels and delivery times require coordination among companies. Traditional SCM relies on human consensus in decision-making to avoid emergent problems like the bullwhip effect. Some routine consensus processes, especially those that are time-intensive and costly, can be automated. Existing solutions for automated coordination have faced challenges due to high entry barriers locking out SMEs, limited capabilities, and limited adaptability in complex scenarios. However, recent advances in Generative AI, particularly LLMs, show promise in overcoming these barriers. LLMs, trained on vast datasets can negotiate, reason, and plan, facilitating near-human-level consensus at scale with minimal entry barriers. In this work, we identify key limitations in existing approaches and propose autonomous LLM agents to address these gaps. We introduce a series of novel, supply chain-specific consensus-seeking frameworks tailored for LLM agents and validate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study in inventory management. To accelerate progress within the SCM community, we open-source our code, providing a foundation for further advancements in LLM-powered autonomous supply chain solutions.

### Evaluating the role of `Constitutions' for learning from AI feedback
**Authors**: Saskia Redgate, Andrew M. Bean, Adam Mahdi

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T13:16:11Z

**Summary**: The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have led to their use as substitutes for human feedback for training and assessing other LLMs. These methods often rely on `constitutions', written guidelines which a critic model uses to provide feedback and improve generations. We investigate how the choice of constitution affects feedback quality by using four different constitutions to improve patient-centered communication in medical interviews. In pairwise comparisons conducted by 215 human raters, we found that detailed constitutions led to better results regarding emotive qualities. However, none of the constitutions outperformed the baseline in learning more practically-oriented skills related to information gathering and provision. Our findings indicate that while detailed constitutions should be prioritised, there are possible limitations to the effectiveness of AI feedback as a reward signal in certain areas.

### Compound-QA: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Compound Questions
**Authors**: Yutao Hou, Yajing Luo, Zhiwen Ruan, Hongru Wang, Weifeng Ge, Yun Chen, Guanhua Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T13:12:29Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across various tasks, prompting researchers to develop diverse evaluation benchmarks. However, existing benchmarks typically measure the ability of LLMs to respond to individual questions, neglecting the complex interactions in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce Compound Question Synthesis (CQ-Syn) to create the Compound-QA benchmark, focusing on compound questions with multiple sub-questions. This benchmark is derived from existing QA datasets, annotated with proprietary LLMs and verified by humans for accuracy. It encompasses five categories: Factual-Statement, Cause-and-Effect, Hypothetical-Analysis, Comparison-and-Selection, and Evaluation-and-Suggestion. It evaluates the LLM capability in terms of three dimensions including understanding, reasoning, and knowledge. Our assessment of eight open-source LLMs using Compound-QA reveals distinct patterns in their responses to compound questions, which are significantly poorer than those to non-compound questions. Additionally, we investigate various methods to enhance LLMs performance on compound questions. The results indicate that these approaches significantly improve the models' comprehension and reasoning abilities on compound questions.

### BONE: a unifying framework for Bayesian online learning in   non-stationary environments
**Authors**: Gerardo Duran-Martin, Leandro Sánchez-Betancourt, Alexander Y. Shestopaloff, Kevin Murphy

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T12:52:02Z

**Summary**: We propose a unifying framework for methods that perform Bayesian online learning in non-stationary environments. We call the framework BONE, which stands for (B)ayesian (O)nline learning in (N)on-stationary (E)nvironments. BONE provides a common structure to tackle a variety of problems, including online continual learning, prequential forecasting, and contextual bandits. The framework requires specifying three modelling choices: (i) a model for measurements (e.g., a neural network), (ii) an auxiliary process to model non-stationarity (e.g., the time since the last changepoint), and (iii) a conditional prior over model parameters (e.g., a multivariate Gaussian). The framework also requires two algorithmic choices, which we use to carry out approximate inference under this framework: (i) an algorithm to estimate beliefs (posterior distribution) about the model parameters given the auxiliary variable, and (ii) an algorithm to estimate beliefs about the auxiliary variable. We show how this modularity allows us to write many different existing methods as instances of BONE; we also use this framework to propose a new method. We then experimentally compare existing methods with our proposed new method on several datasets; we provide insights into the situations that make one method more suitable than another for a given task.

### Do Large Language Models Truly Grasp Mathematics? An Empirical   Exploration From Cognitive Psychology
**Authors**: Wei Xie, Shuoyoucheng Ma, Zhenhua Wang, Enze Wang, Kai Chen, Xiaobing Sun, Baosheng Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T12:46:30Z

**Summary**: The cognitive mechanism by which Large Language Models (LLMs) solve mathematical problems remains a widely debated and unresolved issue. Currently, there is little interpretable experimental evidence that connects LLMs' problem-solving with human cognitive psychology.To determine if LLMs possess human-like mathematical reasoning, we modified the problems used in the human Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT). Our results show that, even with the use of Chains of Thought (CoT) prompts, mainstream LLMs, including the latest o1 model (noted for its reasoning capabilities), have a high error rate when solving these modified CRT problems. Specifically, the average accuracy rate dropped by up to 50% compared to the original questions.Further analysis of LLMs' incorrect answers suggests that they primarily rely on pattern matching from their training data, which aligns more with human intuition (System 1 thinking) rather than with human-like reasoning (System 2 thinking). This finding challenges the belief that LLMs have genuine mathematical reasoning abilities comparable to humans. As a result, this work may adjust overly optimistic views on LLMs' progress towards artificial general intelligence.

### An Effective Framework to Help Large Language Models Handle   Numeric-involved Long-context Tasks
**Authors**: Yijiong Yu

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T12:39:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling long texts and have almost perfect performance in traditional retrieval tasks. However, their performance significantly degrades when it comes to numerical calculations in the long-context. Numeric-involved long-context tasks typically cannot be addressed by current LLMs in normal settings due to their inherent limitations in simultaneously handling complex and massive information. Some CoT like prompting methods can improve accuracy but demands massive output tokens, which is costly and slow. To address this issue, we propose a workflow, which decompose a numeric-involved long-context task into 4 low-level subtasks: judging, extracting and processing with code and conclusion. The former 2 subtasks is relatively simple, which allows us to use smaller models for efficiently processing long context. When numerical calculations are required, we use code generated by LLMs to avoid the disadvantage of LLM not being good at calculations. The results in 2 numeric-involved long-context benchmarks demonstrate our workflow can not only improve accuracy, but also significantly reduce the cost of API calls.

**Authors**: Jianhua Gao, Bingjie Liu, Yizhuo Wang, Weixing Ji, Hua Huang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T12:33:58Z

**Summary**: Owing to the diverse scales and varying distributions of sparse matrices arising from practical problems, a multitude of choices are present in the design and implementation of sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV). Researchers have proposed many machine learning-based optimization methods for SpMV. However, these efforts only support one area of sparse matrix format selection, SpMV algorithm selection, or parameter configuration, and rarely consider a large amount of time overhead associated with feature extraction, model inference, and compression format conversion. This paper introduces a machine learning-based cascaded prediction method for SpMV computations that spans various computing stages and hierarchies. Besides, an asynchronous and concurrent computing model has been designed and implemented for runtime model prediction and iterative algorithm solving on heterogeneous computing platforms. It not only offers comprehensive support for the iterative algorithm-solving process leveraging machine learning technology, but also effectively mitigates the preprocessing overheads. Experimental results demonstrate that the cascaded prediction introduced in this paper accelerates SpMV by 1.33x on average, and the iterative algorithm, enhanced by cascaded prediction and asynchronous execution, optimizes by 2.55x on average.

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T12:23:12Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we review legal testing methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs), using the OPENAI o1 model as a case study to evaluate the performance of large models in applying legal provisions. We compare current state-of-the-art LLMs, including open-source, closed-source, and legal-specific models trained specifically for the legal domain. Systematic tests are conducted on English and Chinese legal cases, and the results are analyzed in depth. Through systematic testing of legal cases from common law systems and China, this paper explores the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in understanding and applying legal texts, reasoning through legal issues, and predicting judgments. The experimental results highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in legal applications, particularly in terms of challenges related to the interpretation of legal language and the accuracy of legal reasoning. Finally, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of various types of models, offering valuable insights and references for the future application of AI in the legal field.

### Prompting and Fine-tuning Large Language Models for Automated Code   Review Comment Generation
**Authors**: Md. Asif Haider, Ayesha Binte Mostofa, Sk. Sabit Bin Mosaddek, Anindya Iqbal, Toufique Ahmed

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T12:01:38Z

**Summary**: Generating accurate code review comments remains a significant challenge due to the inherently diverse and non-unique nature of the task output. Large language models pretrained on both programming and natural language data tend to perform well in code-oriented tasks. However, large-scale pretraining is not always feasible due to its environmental impact and project-specific generalizability issues. In this work, first we fine-tune open-source Large language models (LLM) in parameter-efficient, quantized low-rank (QLoRA) fashion on consumer-grade hardware to improve review comment generation. Recent studies demonstrate the efficacy of augmenting semantic metadata information into prompts to boost performance in other code-related tasks. To explore this in code review activities, we also prompt proprietary, closed-source LLMs augmenting the input code patch with function call graphs and code summaries. Both of our strategies improve the review comment generation performance, with function call graph augmented few-shot prompting on the GPT-3.5 model surpassing the pretrained baseline by around 90% BLEU-4 score on the CodeReviewer dataset. Moreover, few-shot prompted Gemini-1.0 Pro, QLoRA fine-tuned Code Llama and Llama 3.1 models achieve competitive results (ranging from 25% to 83% performance improvement) on this task. An additional human evaluation study further validates our experimental findings, reflecting real-world developers' perceptions of LLM-generated code review comments based on relevant qualitative metrics.

**Authors**: Jan Hansen-Palmus, Michael Truong Le, Oliver Hausdörfer, Alok Verma

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T10:47:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have pushed the frontier of artificial intelligence but are comprised of hundreds of billions of parameters and operations. For faster inference latency, LLMs are deployed on multiple hardware accelerators through various Model Parallelism strategies. Our paper looks into the details on one such strategy - Tensor Parallel - and proposes to reduce latency by compressing inter-accelerator communication. We leverage fine grained quantization techniques to compress selected activations by 3.5 - 4.5x. Our proposed method leads up to 2x reduction of time-to-first-token (TTFT) with negligible model performance degradation.

**Authors**: Wang Qun, Liu Yang, Lin Qingquan, Jiang Ling

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T10:01:52Z

**Summary**: We introduce Xmodel-1.5, a novel 1-billion-parameter multilingual large model pretrained on approximately 2 trillion tokens. The model demonstrates strong performance across several languages, with particularly notable results in Thai, Arabic, and French, alongside its effectiveness in Chinese and English. In addition, we contribute to the research community by releasing a Thai evaluation dataset, which includes hundreds of questions annotated by students from Chulalongkorn University's School of Integrated Innovation. While the results are promising, we acknowledge that there is still room for improvement. We hope this work advances ongoing efforts in multilingual AI research and promotes better cross-linguistic understanding in various natural language processing tasks. Our models and code are publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/XiaoduoAILab/XmodelLM.

### Understanding The Effect Of Temperature On Alignment With Human Opinions
**Authors**: Maja Pavlovic, Massimo Poesio

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T09:50:27Z

**Summary**: With the increasing capabilities of LLMs, recent studies focus on understanding whose opinions are represented by them and how to effectively extract aligned opinion distributions. We conducted an empirical analysis of three straightforward methods for obtaining distributions and evaluated the results across a variety of metrics. Our findings suggest that sampling and log-probability approaches with simple parameter adjustments can return better aligned outputs in subjective tasks compared to direct prompting. Yet, assuming models reflect human opinions may be limiting, highlighting the need for further research on how human subjectivity affects model uncertainty.

### Layer Importance and Hallucination Analysis in Large Language Models via   Enhanced Activation Variance-Sparsity
**Authors**: Zichen Song, Sitan Huang, Yuxin Wu, Zhongfeng Kang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T09:33:47Z

**Summary**: Evaluating the importance of different layers in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for optimizing model performance and interpretability. This paper first explores layer importance using the Activation Variance-Sparsity Score (AVSS), which combines normalized activation variance and sparsity to quantify each layer's contribution to overall model performance. By ranking layers based on AVSS and pruning the least impactful 25\%, our experiments on tasks such as question answering, language modeling, and sentiment classification show that over 90\% of the original performance is retained, highlighting potential redundancies in LLM architectures. Building on AVSS, we propose an enhanced version tailored to assess hallucination propensity across layers (EAVSS). This improved approach introduces Hallucination-Specific Activation Variance (HSAV) and Hallucination-Specific Sparsity (HSS) metrics, allowing precise identification of hallucination-prone layers. By incorporating contrastive learning on these layers, we effectively mitigate hallucination generation, contributing to more robust and efficient LLMs(The maximum performance improvement is 12\%). Our results on the NQ, SciQ, TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and WikiQA datasets demonstrate the efficacy of this method, offering a comprehensive framework for both layer importance evaluation and hallucination mitigation in LLMs.

### Dockformer: A transformer-based molecular docking paradigm for   large-scale virtual screening
**Authors**: Zhangfan Yang, Junkai Ji, Shan He, Jianqiang Li, Ruibin Bai, Zexuan Zhu, Yew Soon Ong

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T09:31:52Z

**Summary**: Molecular docking enables virtual screening of compound libraries to identify potential ligands that target proteins of interest, a crucial step in drug development; however, as the size of the compound library increases, the computational complexity of traditional docking models increases. Deep learning algorithms can provide data-driven research and development models to increase the speed of the docking process. Unfortunately, few models can achieve superior screening performance compared to that of traditional models. Therefore, a novel deep learning-based docking approach named Dockformer is introduced in this study. Dockformer leverages multimodal information to capture the geometric topology and structural knowledge of molecules and can directly generate binding conformations with the corresponding confidence measures in an end-to-end manner. The experimental results show that Dockformer achieves success rates of 90.53\% and 82.71\% on the PDBbind core set and PoseBusters benchmarks, respectively, and more than a 100-fold increase in the inference process speed, outperforming almost all state-of-the-art docking methods. In addition, the ability of Dockformer to identify the main protease inhibitors of coronaviruses is demonstrated in a real-world virtual screening scenario. Considering its high docking accuracy and screening efficiency, Dockformer can be regarded as a powerful and robust tool in the field of drug design.

### Explanation of the exceptionally strong timing noise of PSR J0337+1715   by a circum-ternary planet and consequences for gravity tests
**Authors**: Guillaume Voisin, Ismaël Cognard, Melaine Saillenfest, Thomas Tauris, Norbert Wex, Lucas Guillemot, Gilles Theureau, P. C. C. Freire, Michael Kramer

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T09:31:23Z

**Summary**: Context: Timing of pulsar PSR J0337+1715 provides a unique opportunity to test the strong equivalence principle (SEP) with a strongly self-gravitating object. This is due to its unique situation in a triple stellar system with two white dwarfs.   Aims: Our previous study suggested the presence of a strong low-frequency signal in the timing residuals. We set out to model it on a longer dataset in order to determine its nature and improve accuracy.   Methods: Three models are considered: chromatic or achromatic red-noise, and a small planet in a hierarchical orbit with the triple stellar system. These models are implemented in our numerical timing model. We perform Bayesian inference of posterior distributions. Best fits are compared using information-theoretic criteria.   Results: Chromatic red noise from dispersion-measure variations is ruled out. Achromatic red noise or a planet in keplerian orbit provide the best fits. If it is red noise then it appears exceptionally strong. Assuming the presence of a planet, we obtain a marginal detection of mutual interactions which allows us to constrain its mass to $\sim 0.5 M_{\rm Moon}$ as well as its inclination. The latter is intriguingly coincident with a Kozai resonance. We show that a longer observation span will ultimately lead to a clear signature of the planet model due to its mutual interactions with the triple system. We produce new limits on SEP violation: $|\Delta| < 1.5\cdot 10^{-6}$ or $|\Delta| < 2.3\cdot 10^{-6}$ at 95\% confidence level under the planet or red-noise hypothesis, respectively. This model dependence emphasises the need for additional data and model selection. As a by-product, we estimate a rather low supernova kick velocity of $\sim 110-125 \rm km/s$, strengthening the idea that it is a necessary condition for the formation of pulsar triple systems.

### EchoMimicV2: Towards Striking, Simplified, and Semi-Body Human Animation
**Authors**: Rang Meng, Xingyu Zhang, Yuming Li, Chenguang Ma

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T09:23:18Z

**Summary**: Recent work on human animation usually involves audio, pose, or movement maps conditions, thereby achieves vivid animation quality. However, these methods often face practical challenges due to extra control conditions, cumbersome condition injection modules, or limitation to head region driving. Hence, we ask if it is possible to achieve striking half-body human animation while simplifying unnecessary conditions. To this end, we propose a half-body human animation method, dubbed EchoMimicV2, that leverages a novel Audio-Pose Dynamic Harmonization strategy, including Pose Sampling and Audio Diffusion, to enhance half-body details, facial and gestural expressiveness, and meanwhile reduce conditions redundancy. To compensate for the scarcity of half-body data, we utilize Head Partial Attention to seamlessly accommodate headshot data into our training framework, which can be omitted during inference, providing a free lunch for animation. Furthermore, we design the Phase-specific Denoising Loss to guide motion, detail, and low-level quality for animation in specific phases, respectively. Besides, we also present a novel benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of half-body human animation. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that EchoMimicV2 surpasses existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T09:17:40Z

**Summary**: Climate change poses an urgent global threat, needing the rapid identification and deployment of innovative solutions. We hypothesise that many of these solutions already exist within scientific literature but remain underutilised. To address this gap, this study employs a curated dataset sourced from OpenAlex, a comprehensive repository of scientific papers. Utilising Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT4-o from OpenAI, we evaluate title-abstract pairs from scientific papers on seven dimensions, covering climate change mitigation potential, stage of technological development, and readiness for deployment. The outputs of the language models are then compared with human evaluations to assess their effectiveness in identifying promising yet overlooked climate innovations. Our findings suggest that these LLM-based models can effectively augment human expertise, uncovering climate solutions that are potentially impactful but with far greater speed, throughput and consistency. Here, we focused on UK-based solutions, but the workflow is region-agnostic. This work contributes to the discovery of neglected innovations in scientific literature and demonstrates the potential of AI in enhancing climate action strategies.

### A novel family of beta mixture models for the differential analysis of   DNA methylation data: an application to prostate cancer
**Authors**: Koyel Majumdar, Romina Silva, Antoinette Sabrina Perry, Ronald William Watson, Andrea Rau, Florence Jaffrezic, Thomas Brendan Murphy, Isobel Claire Gormley

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T09:01:57Z

**Summary**: Identifying differentially methylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites between benign and tumour samples can assist in understanding disease. However, differential analysis of bounded DNA methylation data often requires data transformation, reducing biological interpretability. To address this, a family of beta mixture models (BMMs) is proposed that (i) objectively infers methylation state thresholds and (ii) identifies differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) given untransformed, beta-valued methylation data. The BMMs achieve this through model-based clustering of CpG sites and by employing parameter constraints, facilitating application to different study settings. Inference proceeds via an expectation-maximisation algorithm, with an approximate maximization step providing tractability and computational feasibility.   Performance of the BMMs is assessed through thorough simulation studies, and the BMMs are used for differential analyses of DNA methylation data from a prostate cancer study. Intuitive and biologically interpretable methylation state thresholds are inferred and DMCs are identified, including those related to genes such as GSTP1, RASSF1 and RARB, known for their role in prostate cancer development. Gene ontology analysis of the DMCs revealed significant enrichment in cancer-related pathways, demonstrating the utility of BMMs to reveal biologically relevant insights. An R package betaclust facilitates widespread use of BMMs.

### DiffLoRA: Generating Personalized Low-Rank Adaptation Weights with   Diffusion
**Authors**: Yujia Wu, Yiming Shi, Jiwei Wei, Chengwei Sun, Yang Yang, Heng Tao Shen

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T08:36:51Z

**Summary**: Personalized text-to-image generation has gained significant attention for its capability to generate high-fidelity portraits of specific identities conditioned on user-defined prompts. Existing methods typically involve test-time fine-tuning or incorporating an additional pre-trained branch. However, these approaches struggle to simultaneously address efficiency, identity fidelity, and the preservation of the model's original generative capabilities. In this paper, we propose DiffLoRA, an efficient method that leverages the diffusion model as a hypernetwork to predict personalized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights based on the reference images. By incorporating these LoRA weights into the off-the-shelf text-to-image model, DiffLoRA enables zero-shot personalization during inference, eliminating the need for post-processing optimization. Moreover, we introduce a novel identity-oriented LoRA weights construction pipeline to facilitate the training process of DiffLoRA. The dataset generated through this pipeline enables DiffLoRA to produce consistently high-quality LoRA weights. Notably, the distinctive properties of the diffusion model enhance the generation of superior weights by employing probabilistic modeling to capture intricate structural patterns and thoroughly explore the weight space. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that DiffLoRA outperforms existing personalization approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving both time efficiency and maintaining identity fidelity throughout the personalization process.

### EveGuard: Defeating Vibration-based Side-Channel Eavesdropping with   Audio Adversarial Perturbations
**Authors**: Jung-Woo Chang, Ke Sun, David Xia, Xinyu Zhang, Farinaz Koushanfar

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T08:32:03Z

**Summary**: Vibrometry-based side channels pose a significant privacy risk, exploiting sensors like mmWave radars, light sensors, and accelerometers to detect vibrations from sound sources or proximate objects, enabling speech eavesdropping. Despite various proposed defenses, these involve costly hardware solutions with inherent physical limitations. This paper presents EveGuard, a software-driven defense framework that creates adversarial audio, protecting voice privacy from side channels without compromising human perception. We leverage the distinct sensing capabilities of side channels and traditional microphones where side channels capture vibrations and microphones record changes in air pressure, resulting in different frequency responses. EveGuard first proposes a perturbation generator model (PGM) that effectively suppresses sensor-based eavesdropping while maintaining high audio quality. Second, to enable end-to-end training of PGM, we introduce a new domain translation task called Eve-GAN for inferring an eavesdropped signal from a given audio. We further apply few-shot learning to mitigate the data collection overhead for Eve-GAN training. Our extensive experiments show that EveGuard achieves a protection rate of more than 97 percent from audio classifiers and significantly hinders eavesdropped audio reconstruction. We further validate the performance of EveGuard across three adaptive attack mechanisms. We have conducted a user study to verify the perceptual quality of our perturbed audio.

### VMID: A Multimodal Fusion LLM Framework for Detecting and Identifying   Misinformation of Short Videos
**Authors**: Weihao Zhong, Yinhao Xiao, Minghui Xu, Xiuzhen Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T08:20:26Z

**Summary**: Short video platforms have become important channels for news dissemination, offering a highly engaging and immediate way for users to access current events and share information. However, these platforms have also emerged as significant conduits for the rapid spread of misinformation, as fake news and rumors can leverage the visual appeal and wide reach of short videos to circulate extensively among audiences. Existing fake news detection methods mainly rely on single-modal information, such as text or images, or apply only basic fusion techniques, limiting their ability to handle the complex, multi-layered information inherent in short videos. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel fake news detection method based on multimodal information, designed to identify misinformation through a multi-level analysis of video content. This approach effectively utilizes different modal representations to generate a unified textual description, which is then fed into a large language model for comprehensive evaluation. The proposed framework successfully integrates multimodal features within videos, significantly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of fake news detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy, robustness, and utilization of multimodal information, achieving an accuracy of 90.93%, which is significantly higher than the best baseline model (SV-FEND) at 81.05%. Furthermore, case studies provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of the approach in accurately distinguishing between fake news, debunking content, and real incidents, highlighting its reliability and robustness in real-world applications.

### Approximate Probabilistic Inference for Time-Series Data A Robust Latent   Gaussian Model With Temporal Awareness
**Authors**: Anton Johansson, Arunselvan Ramaswamy

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T08:17:22Z

**Summary**: The development of robust generative models for highly varied non-stationary time series data is a complex yet important problem. Traditional models for time series data prediction, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are inefficient and generalize poorly as they cannot capture complex temporal relationships. In this paper, we present a probabilistic generative model that can be trained to capture temporal information, and that is robust to data errors. We call it Time Deep Latent Gaussian Model (tDLGM). Its novel architecture is inspired by Deep Latent Gaussian Model (DLGM). Our model is trained to minimize a loss function based on the negative log loss. One contributing factor to Time Deep Latent Gaussian Model (tDLGM) robustness is our regularizer, which accounts for data trends. Experiments conducted show that tDLGM is able to reconstruct and generate complex time series data, and that it is robust against to noise and faulty data.

### XLSR-Mamba: A Dual-Column Bidirectional State Space Model for Spoofing   Attack Detection
**Authors**: Yang Xiao, Rohan Kumar Das

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T08:13:51Z

**Summary**: Transformers and their variants have achieved great success in speech processing. However, their multi-head self-attention mechanism is computationally expensive. Therefore, one novel selective state space model, Mamba, has been proposed as an alternative. Building on its success in automatic speech recognition, we apply Mamba for spoofing attack detection. Mamba is well-suited for this task as it can capture the artifacts in spoofed speech signals by handling long-length sequences. However, Mamba's performance may suffer when it is trained with limited labeled data. To mitigate this, we propose combining a new structure of Mamba based on a dual-column architecture with self-supervised learning, using the pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 model. The experiments show that our proposed approach achieves competitive results and faster inference on the ASVspoof 2021 LA and DF datasets, and on the more challenging In-the-Wild dataset, it emerges as the strongest candidate for spoofing attack detection. The code will be publicly released in due course.

### Information Extraction from Clinical Notes: Are We Ready to Switch to   Large Language Models?
**Authors**: Yan Hu, Xu Zuo, Yujia Zhou, Xueqing Peng, Jimin Huang, Vipina K. Keloth, Vincent J. Zhang, Ruey-Ling Weng, Qingyu Chen, Xiaoqian Jiang, Kirk E. Roberts, Hua Xu

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T07:54:19Z

**Summary**: Backgrounds: Information extraction (IE) is critical in clinical natural language processing (NLP). While large language models (LLMs) excel on generative tasks, their performance on extractive tasks remains debated. Methods: We investigated Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) using 1,588 clinical notes from four sources (UT Physicians, MTSamples, MIMIC-III, and i2b2). We developed an annotated corpus covering 4 clinical entities and 16 modifiers, and compared instruction-tuned LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 against BiomedBERT in terms of performance, generalizability, computational resources, and throughput to BiomedBERT. Results: LLaMA models outperformed BiomedBERT across datasets. With sufficient training data, LLaMA showed modest improvements (1% on NER, 1.5-3.7% on RE); improvements were larger with limited training data. On unseen i2b2 data, LLaMA-3-70B outperformed BiomedBERT by 7% (F1) on NER and 4% on RE. However, LLaMA models required more computing resources and ran up to 28 times slower. We implemented "Kiwi," a clinical IE package featuring both models, available at https://kiwi.clinicalnlp.org/. Conclusion: This study is among the first to develop and evaluate a comprehensive clinical IE system using open-source LLMs. Results indicate that LLaMA models outperform BiomedBERT for clinical NER and RE but with higher computational costs and lower throughputs. These findings highlight that choosing between LLMs and traditional deep learning methods for clinical IE applications should remain task-specific, taking into account both performance metrics and practical considerations such as available computing resources and the intended use case scenarios.

### Reliable Interval Estimation for the Fidelity of Entangled States in   Scenarios with General Noise
**Authors**: Liangzhong Ruan, Bas Dirkse

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T07:44:09Z

**Summary**: Fidelity estimation for entangled states constitutes an essential building block for quality control and error detection in quantum networks. Nonetheless, quantum networks often encounter heterogeneous and correlated noise, leading to excessive uncertainty in the estimated fidelity. In this paper, the uncertainty associated with the estimated fidelity under conditions of general noise is constrained by jointly employing random sampling, a thought experiment, and Bayesian inference, resulting in a credible interval for fidelity that is valid in the presence of general noise. The proposed credible interval incorporates all even moments of the posterior distribution to enhance estimation accuracy. Factors influencing the estimation accuracy are identified and analyzed. Specifically, the issue of excessive measurements is addressed, emphasizing the necessity of properly determining the measurement ratio for fidelity estimation under general noise conditions.

### Semiparametric inference for impulse response functions using   double/debiased machine learning
**Authors**: Daniele Ballinari, Alexander Wehrli

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T07:42:02Z

**Summary**: We introduce a double/debiased machine learning (DML) estimator for the impulse response function (IRF) in settings where a time series of interest is subjected to multiple discrete treatments, assigned over time, which can have a causal effect on future outcomes. The proposed estimator can rely on fully nonparametric relations between treatment and outcome variables, opening up the possibility to use flexible machine learning approaches to estimate IRFs. To this end, we extend the theory of DML from an i.i.d. to a time series setting and show that the proposed DML estimator for the IRF is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed at the parametric rate, allowing for semiparametric inference for dynamic effects in a time series setting. The properties of the estimator are validated numerically in finite samples by applying it to learn the IRF in the presence of serial dependence in both the confounder and observation innovation processes. We also illustrate the methodology empirically by applying it to the estimation of the effects of macroeconomic shocks.

### Graph-based Complexity for Causal Effect by Empirical Plug-in
**Authors**: Rina Dechter, Annie Raichev, Alexander Ihler, Jin Tian

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T07:42:01Z

**Summary**: This paper focuses on the computational complexity of computing empirical plug-in estimates for causal effect queries. Given a causal graph and observational data, any identifiable causal query can be estimated from an expression over the observed variables, called the estimand. The estimand can then be evaluated by plugging in probabilities computed empirically from data. In contrast to conventional wisdom, which assumes that high dimensional probabilistic functions will lead to exponential evaluation time of the estimand. We show that computation can be done efficiently, potentially in time linear in the data size, depending on the estimand's hypergraph.   In particular, we show that both the treewidth and hypertree width of the estimand's structure bound the evaluation complexity of the plug-in estimands, analogous to their role in the complexity of probabilistic inference in graphical models. Often, the hypertree width provides a more effective bound, since the empirical distributions are sparse.

### Orca: Enhancing Role-Playing Abilities of Large Language Models by   Integrating Personality Traits
**Authors**: Yuxuan Huang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T07:35:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models has catalyzed the development of personalized dialogue systems, numerous role-playing conversational agents have emerged. While previous research predominantly focused on enhancing the model's capability to follow instructions by designing character profiles, neglecting the psychological factors that drive human conversations. In this paper, we propose Orca, a framework for data processing and training LLMs of custom characters by integrating personality traits. Orca comprises four stages: (1) Personality traits inferring, leverage LLMs to infer user's BigFive personality trait reports and scores. (2) Data Augment, simulate user's profile, background story, and psychological activities. (3) Dataset construction, personality-conditioned instruction prompting (PCIP) to stimulate LLMs. (4) Modeling and Training, personality-conditioned instruction tuning (PTIT and PSIT), using the generated data to enhance existing open-source LLMs. We introduce OrcaBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the quality of content generated by LLMs on social platforms across multiple scales. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves superior performance on this benchmark, demonstrating its excellence and effectiveness in perceiving personality traits that significantly improve role-playing abilities. Our Code is available at https://github.com/Aipura/Orca.

### Hyper-multi-step: The Truth Behind Difficult Long-context Tasks
**Authors**: Yijiong Yu, Ma Xiufa, Fang Jianwei, Zhi Xu, Su Guangyao, Wang Jiancheng, Yongfeng Huang, Zhixiao Qi, Wei Wang, Weifeng Liu, Ran Chen, Ji Pei

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T07:07:38Z

**Summary**: Long-context language models (LCLM), characterized by their extensive context window, is becoming increasingly popular. Meanwhile, many long-context benchmarks present challenging tasks that even the most advanced LCLMs struggle to complete. However, the underlying sources of various challenging long-context tasks have seldom been studied. To bridge this gap, we conduct experiments to indicate their difficulty stems primarily from two basic issues: "multi-matching retrieval," which requires the simultaneous retrieval of multiple items, and "logic-based retrieval," which necessitates logical judgment within retrieval criteria. These two problems, while seemingly straightforward, actually exceed the capabilities of LCLMs because they are proven to be hyper-multi-step (demanding numerous steps to solve) in nature. This finding could explain why LLMs struggle with more advanced long-context tasks, providing a more accurate perspective for rethinking solutions for them.

### A fully precessing higher-mode surrogate model of effective-one-body   waveforms
**Authors**: Bhooshan Gadre, Michael Pürrer, Scott E. Field, Serguei Ossokine, Vijay Varma

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T06:51:26Z

**Summary**: We present a surrogate model of \texttt{SEOBNRv4PHM}, a fully precessing time-domain effective-one-body waveform model including subdominant modes. We follow an approach similar to that used to build recent numerical relativity surrogate models. Our surrogate is 5000M in duration, covers mass-ratios up to 1:20 and dimensionless spin magnitudes up to 0.8. Validating the surrogate against an independent test set we find that the bulk of the surrogate errors is less than $\sim 1\%$ in mismatch, which is similar to the modelling error of \texttt{SEOBNRv4PHM} itself. At high total mass a few percent of configurations can exceed this threshold if they are highly precessing and they exceed a mass-ratio of 1:4. This surrogate is nearly two orders of magnitude faster than the underlying time-domain \texttt{SEOBNRv4PHM} model and can be evaluated in $\sim 50$ ms. Bayesian inference analyses with \texttt{SEOBNRv4PHM} are typically very computationally demanding and can take from weeks to months to complete. The two order of magnitude speedup attained by our surrogate model enables practical parameter estimation analyses with this waveform family. This is \emph{crucial} because Bayesian inference allows us to recover the masses and spins of binary black hole mergers given a model of the emitted gravitational waveform along with a description of the noise.

### Evaluating and Enhancing Large Language Models for Conversational   Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs
**Authors**: Yuxuan Huang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T06:48:58Z

**Summary**: The development of large language models (LLMs) has been catalyzed by advancements in pre-training techniques. These models have demonstrated robust reasoning capabilities through manually designed prompts. In this work, we evaluate the conversational reasoning capabilities of the current state-of-the-art LLM (GPT-4) on knowledge graphs (KGs). However, the performance of LLMs is constrained due to a lack of KG environment awareness and the difficulties in developing effective optimization mechanisms for intermediary reasoning stages. We further introduce LLM-ARK, a LLM grounded KG reasoning agent designed to deliver precise and adaptable predictions on KG paths. LLM-ARK leverages Full Textual Environment (FTE) prompt to assimilate state information within each reasoning step. We reframe the challenge of multi-hop reasoning on the KG as a sequential decision-making task. Utilizing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) online policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm, our model is optimized to learn from rich reward signals. Additionally, we conduct an evaluation of our model and GPT-4 on the OpenDialKG dataset. The experimental results reveal that LLaMA-2-7B-ARK outperforms the current state-of-the-art model by 5.28 percentage points, with a performance rate of 36.39% on the target@1 evaluation metric. Meanwhile, GPT-4 scored 14.91%, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/Aipura/LLM-ARK) for further access.

### HistoLens: An LLM-Powered Framework for Multi-Layered Analysis of   Historical Texts -- A Case Application of Yantie Lun
**Authors**: Yifan Zeng

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T06:21:13Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes HistoLens, a multi-layered analysis framework for historical texts based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Using the important Western Han dynasty text "Yantie Lun" as a case study, we demonstrate the framework's potential applications in historical research and education. HistoLens integrates NLP technology (especially LLMs), including named entity recognition, knowledge graph construction, and geographic information visualization. The paper showcases how HistoLens explores Western Han culture in "Yantie Lun" through multi-dimensional, visual, and quantitative methods, focusing particularly on the influence of Confucian and Legalist thoughts on political, economic, military, and ethnic. We also demonstrate how HistoLens constructs a machine teaching scenario using LLMs for explainable analysis, based on a dataset of Confucian and Legalist ideas extracted with LLM assistance. This approach offers novel and diverse perspectives for studying historical texts like "Yantie Lun" and provides new auxiliary tools for history education. The framework aims to equip historians and learners with LLM-assisted tools to facilitate in-depth, multi-layered analysis of historical texts and foster innovation in historical education.

**Authors**: Vincenzo de Martino, Joel Castaño, Fabio Palomba, Xavier Franch, Silverio Martínez-Fernández

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T06:08:57Z

**Summary**: Context: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly transformed Software Engineering (SE) by providing innovative methods for analyzing software repositories. Objectives: Our objective is to establish a practical framework for future SE researchers needing to enhance the data collection and dataset while conducting software repository mining studies using LLMs. Method: This experience report shares insights from two previous repository mining studies, focusing on the methodologies used for creating, refining, and validating prompts that enhance the output of LLMs, particularly in the context of data collection in empirical studies.

### Large Language Models as User-Agents for Evaluating   Task-Oriented-Dialogue Systems
**Authors**: Taaha Kazi, Ruiliang Lyu, Sizhe Zhou, Dilek Hakkani-Tur, Gokhan Tur

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T06:05:45Z

**Summary**: Traditionally, offline datasets have been used to evaluate task-oriented dialogue (TOD) models. These datasets lack context awareness, making them suboptimal benchmarks for conversational systems. In contrast, user-agents, which are context-aware, can simulate the variability and unpredictability of human conversations, making them better alternatives as evaluators. Prior research has utilized large language models (LLMs) to develop user-agents. Our work builds upon this by using LLMs to create user-agents for the evaluation of TOD systems. This involves prompting an LLM, using in-context examples as guidance, and tracking the user-goal state. Our evaluation of diversity and task completion metrics for the user-agents shows improved performance with the use of better prompts. Additionally, we propose methodologies for the automatic evaluation of TOD models within this dynamic framework.

### Steering AI-Driven Personalization of Scientific Text for General   Audiences
**Authors**: Taewook Kim, Dhruv Agarwal, Jordan Ackerman, Manaswi Saha

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T05:55:23Z

**Summary**: Digital media platforms (e.g., social media, science blogs) offer opportunities to communicate scientific content to general audiences at scale. However, these audiences vary in their scientific expertise, literacy levels, and personal backgrounds, making effective science communication challenging. To address this challenge, we designed TranSlider, an AI-powered tool that generates personalized translations of scientific text based on individual user profiles (e.g., hobbies, location, and education). Our tool features an interactive slider that allows users to steer the degree of personalization from 0 (weakly relatable) to 100 (strongly relatable), leveraging LLMs to generate the translations with given degrees. Through an exploratory study with 15 participants, we investigated both the utility of these AI-personalized translations and how interactive reading features influenced users' understanding and reading experiences. We found that participants who preferred higher degrees of personalization appreciated the relatable and contextual translations, while those who preferred lower degrees valued concise translations with subtle contextualization. Furthermore, participants reported the compounding effect of multiple translations on their understanding of scientific content. Given these findings, we discuss several implications of AI-personalized translation tools in facilitating communication in collaborative contexts.

**Authors**: Thang M. Pham, Phat T. Nguyen, Seunghyun Yoon, Viet Dac Lai, Franck Dernoncourt, Trung Bui

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T04:44:34Z

**Summary**: While small language models (SLMs) show promises for mobile deployment, their real-world performance and applications on smartphones remains underexplored. We present SlimLM, a series of SLMs optimized for document assistance tasks on mobile devices. Through extensive experiments on a Samsung Galaxy S24, we identify the optimal trade-offs between model size (ranging from 125M to 7B parameters), context length, and inference time for efficient on-device processing. SlimLM is pre-trained on SlimPajama-627B and fine-tuned on DocAssist, our constructed dataset for summarization, question answering and suggestion tasks. Our smallest model demonstrates efficient performance on S24, while larger variants offer enhanced capabilities within mobile constraints. We evaluate SlimLM against existing SLMs, showing comparable or superior performance and offering a benchmark for future research in on-device language models. We also provide an Android application, offering practical insights into SLM deployment. Our findings provide valuable insights and illuminate the capabilities of running advanced language models on high-end smartphones, potentially reducing server costs and enhancing privacy through on-device processing.

### Zero-shot Voice Conversion with Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Songting Liu

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T04:43:44Z

**Summary**: Zero-shot voice conversion aims to transform a source speech utterance to match the timbre of a reference speech from an unseen speaker. Traditional approaches struggle with timbre leakage, insufficient timbre representation, and mismatches between training and inference tasks. We propose Seed-VC, a novel framework that addresses these issues by introducing an external timbre shifter during training to perturb the source speech timbre, mitigating leakage and aligning training with inference. Additionally, we employ a diffusion transformer that leverages the entire reference speech context, capturing fine-grained timbre features through in-context learning. Experiments demonstrate that Seed-VC outperforms strong baselines like OpenVoice and CosyVoice, achieving higher speaker similarity and lower word error rates in zero-shot voice conversion tasks. We further extend our approach to zero-shot singing voice conversion by incorporating fundamental frequency (F0) conditioning, resulting in comparative performance to current state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of Seed-VC in overcoming core challenges, paving the way for more accurate and versatile voice conversion systems.

### A Dynamic LLM-Powered Agent Network for Task-Oriented Agent   Collaboration
**Authors**: Zijun Liu, Yanzhe Zhang, Peng Li, Yang Liu, Diyi Yang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T04:30:04Z

**Summary**: Recent studies show that collaborating multiple large language model (LLM) powered agents is a promising way for task solving. However, current approaches are constrained by using a fixed number of agents and static communication structures. In this work, we propose automatically selecting a team of agents from candidates to collaborate in a dynamic communication structure toward different tasks and domains. Specifically, we build a framework named Dynamic LLM-Powered Agent Network ($\textbf{DyLAN}$) for LLM-powered agent collaboration, operating a two-stage paradigm: (1) Team Optimization and (2) Task Solving. During the first stage, we utilize an $\textit{agent selection}$ algorithm, based on an unsupervised metric called $\textit{Agent Importance Score}$, enabling the selection of best agents according to their contributions in a preliminary trial, oriented to the given task. Then, in the second stage, the selected agents collaborate dynamically according to the query. Empirically, we demonstrate that DyLAN outperforms strong baselines in code generation, decision-making, general reasoning, and arithmetic reasoning tasks with moderate computational cost. On specific subjects in MMLU, selecting a team of agents in the team optimization stage improves accuracy by up to 25.0% in DyLAN.

### Refined and Segmented Price Sentiment Indices from Survey Comments
**Authors**: Masahiro Suzuki, Hiroki Sakaji

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T04:22:21Z

**Summary**: We aim to enhance a price sentiment index and to more precisely understand price trends from the perspective of not only consumers but also businesses. We extract comments related to prices from the Economy Watchers Survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan and classify price trends using a large language model (LLM). We classify whether the survey sample reflects the perspective of consumers or businesses, and whether the comments pertain to goods or services by utilizing information on the fields of comments and the industries of respondents included in the Economy Watchers Survey. From these classified price-related comments, we construct price sentiment indices not only for a general purpose but also for more specific objectives by combining perspectives on consumers and prices, as well as goods and services. It becomes possible to achieve a more accurate classification of price directions by employing a LLM for classification. Furthermore, integrating the outputs of multiple LLMs suggests the potential for the better performance of the classification. The use of more accurately classified comments allows for the construction of an index with a higher correlation to existing indices than previous studies. We demonstrate that the correlation of the price index for consumers, which has a larger sample size, is further enhanced by selecting comments for aggregation based on the industry of the survey respondents.

### BAdam: A Memory Efficient Full Parameter Optimization Method for Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Qijun Luo, Hengxu Yu, Xiao Li

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T04:17:35Z

**Summary**: This work presents BAdam, an optimization method that leverages the block coordinate descent (BCD) framework with Adam's update rule. BAdam offers a memory efficient approach to the full parameter finetuning of large language models. We conduct a theoretical convergence analysis for BAdam in the deterministic case. Experimentally, we apply BAdam to finetune the Llama 3-8B and Llama 3-70B models using a single RTX3090-24GB GPU and 4 A100-80GB GPUs, respectively. The results confirm BAdam's efficiency in terms of memory usage, running time, and optimization capability. Furthermore, the downstream performance evaluation based on MT-bench and math benchmarks shows that BAdam outperforms existing memory efficient baselines such as LoRA. It also demonstrates that BAdam can achieve comparable or even superior performance compared to Adam. Finally, the ablation study using SGD's update rule illustrates the suitability of BCD for finetuning LLMs. Our code can be easily integrated into any PyTorch-based codebase and is available at https://github.com/Ledzy/BAdam.

### JRadiEvo: A Japanese Radiology Report Generation Model Enhanced by   Evolutionary Optimization of Model Merging
**Authors**: Kaito Baba, Ryota Yagi, Junichiro Takahashi, Risa Kishikawa, Satoshi Kodera

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T04:16:50Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), foundational models (FMs) have seen significant advancements. Healthcare is one of the most crucial application areas for these FMs, given the significant time and effort required for physicians to analyze large volumes of patient data. Recent efforts have focused on adapting multimodal FMs to the medical domain through techniques like instruction-tuning, leading to the development of medical foundation models (MFMs). However, these approaches typically require large amounts of training data to effectively adapt models to the medical field. Moreover, most existing models are trained on English datasets, limiting their practicality in non-English-speaking regions where healthcare professionals and patients are not always fluent in English. The need for translation introduces additional costs and inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{J}apanese \textbf{Radi}ology report generation model enhanced by \textbf{Evo}lutionary optimization of model merging (JRadiEvo). This is the first attempt to extend a non-medical vision-language foundation model to the medical domain through evolutionary optimization of model merging. We successfully created a model that generates accurate Japanese reports from X-ray images using only 50 translated samples from publicly available data. This model, developed with highly efficient use of limited data, outperformed leading models from recent research trained on much larger datasets. Additionally, with only 8 billion parameters, this relatively compact foundation model can be deployed locally within hospitals, making it a practical solution for environments where APIs and other external services cannot be used due to strict privacy and security requirements.

### Is Precise Recovery Necessary? A Task-Oriented Imputation Approach for   Time Series Forecasting on Variable Subset
**Authors**: Qi Hao, Runchang Liang, Yue Gao, Hao Dong, Wei Fan, Lu Jiang, Pengyang Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T04:00:54Z

**Summary**: Variable Subset Forecasting (VSF) refers to a unique scenario in multivariate time series forecasting, where available variables in the inference phase are only a subset of the variables in the training phase. VSF presents significant challenges as the entire time series may be missing, and neither inter- nor intra-variable correlations persist. Such conditions impede the effectiveness of traditional imputation methods, primarily focusing on filling in individual missing data points. Inspired by the principle of feature engineering that not all variables contribute positively to forecasting, we propose Task-Oriented Imputation for VSF (TOI-VSF), a novel framework shifts the focus from accurate data recovery to directly support the downstream forecasting task. TOI-VSF incorporates a self-supervised imputation module, agnostic to the forecasting model, designed to fill in missing variables while preserving the vital characteristics and temporal patterns of time series data. Additionally, we implement a joint learning strategy for imputation and forecasting, ensuring that the imputation process is directly aligned with and beneficial to the forecasting objective. Extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate the superiority of TOI-VSF, outperforming baseline methods by $15\%$ on average.

### Effective Generative AI: The Human-Algorithm Centaur
**Authors**: Soroush Saghafian, Lihi Idan

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T03:48:07Z

**Summary**: Advanced analytics science methods have enabled combining the power of artificial and human intelligence, creating \textit{centaurs} that allow superior decision-making. Centaurs are hybrid human-algorithm models that combine both formal analytics and human intuition in a symbiotic manner within their learning and reasoning process. We argue that the future of AI development and use in many domains needs to focus more on centaurs as opposed to other AI approaches. This paradigm shift towards centaur-based AI methods raises some fundamental questions: How are centaurs different from other human-in-the-loop methods? What are the most effective methods for creating centaurs? When should centaurs be used, and when should the lead be given to pure AI models? Doesn't the incorporation of human intuition -- which at times can be misleading -- in centaurs' decision-making process degrade its performance compared to pure AI methods? This work aims to address these fundamental questions, focusing on recent advancements in generative AI, and especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), as a main case study to illustrate centaurs' critical essentiality to future AI endeavors.

### Motion-Grounded Video Reasoning: Understanding and Perceiving Motion at   Pixel Level
**Authors**: Andong Deng, Tongjia Chen, Shoubin Yu, Taojiannan Yang, Lincoln Spencer, Yapeng Tian, Ajmal Saeed Mian, Mohit Bansal, Chen Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T03:45:09Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce Motion-Grounded Video Reasoning, a new motion understanding task that requires generating visual answers (video segmentation masks) according to the input question, and hence needs implicit spatiotemporal reasoning and grounding. This task extends existing spatiotemporal grounding work focusing on explicit action/motion grounding, to a more general format by enabling implicit reasoning via questions. To facilitate the development of the new task, we collect a large-scale dataset called GROUNDMORE, which comprises 1,715 video clips, 249K object masks that are deliberately designed with 4 question types (Causal, Sequential, Counterfactual, and Descriptive) for benchmarking deep and comprehensive motion reasoning abilities. GROUNDMORE uniquely requires models to generate visual answers, providing a more concrete and visually interpretable response than plain texts. It evaluates models on both spatiotemporal grounding and reasoning, fostering to address complex challenges in motion-related video reasoning, temporal perception, and pixel-level understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a novel baseline model named Motion-Grounded Video Reasoning Assistant (MORA). MORA incorporates the multimodal reasoning ability from the Multimodal LLM, the pixel-level perception capability from the grounding model (SAM), and the temporal perception ability from a lightweight localization head. MORA achieves respectable performance on GROUNDMORE outperforming the best existing visual grounding baseline model by an average of 21.5% relatively. We hope this novel and challenging task will pave the way for future advancements in robust and general motion understanding via video reasoning segmentation

### LLMs are Imperfect, Then What? An Empirical Study on LLM Failures in   Software Engineering
**Authors**: Jiessie Tie, Bingsheng Yao, Tianshi Li, Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed, Dakuo Wang, Shurui Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T03:29:41Z

**Summary**: Software engineers are integrating AI assistants into their workflows to enhance productivity and reduce cognitive strain. However, experiences vary significantly, with some engineers finding large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, beneficial, while others consider them counterproductive. Researchers also found that ChatGPT's answers included incorrect information. Given the fact that LLMs are still imperfect, it is important to understand how to best incorporate LLMs into the workflow for software engineering (SE) task completion. Therefore, we conducted an observational study with 22 participants using ChatGPT as a coding assistant in a non-trivial SE task to understand the practices, challenges, and opportunities for using LLMs for SE tasks. We identified the cases where ChatGPT failed, their root causes, and the corresponding mitigation solutions used by users. These findings contribute to the overall understanding and strategies for human-AI interaction on SE tasks. Our study also highlights future research and tooling support directions.

### ORLM: A Customizable Framework in Training Large Models for Automated   Optimization Modeling
**Authors**: Chenyu Huang, Zhengyang Tang, Dongdong Ge, Shixi Hu, Ruoqing Jiang, Benyou Wang, Zizhuo Wang, Xin Zheng

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T03:25:40Z

**Summary**: Optimization modeling and solving play a critical role in the application of Operations Research (OR) tools to address real-world problems, yet they pose challenges and require extensive expertise from OR experts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), new opportunities have emerged to streamline and automate these tasks. However, current research predominantly relies on closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4, along with extensive prompt engineering techniques. This reliance stems from the scarcity of high-quality training datasets for optimization modeling, resulting in elevated costs, prolonged processing times, and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, our work is the first to propose a viable path for training open-source LLMs that are capable of optimization modeling as well as developing and executing solver codes, eventually leading to a superior ability for automating optimization modeling and solving. Particularly, we introduce a semi-automated data synthesis framework designed for optimization modeling issues, named OR-Instruct. This framework merges the training data requirements of large models with the unique characteristics of optimization modeling problems, and allows for customizable enhancements tailored to specific scenarios or modeling types. To evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, we present the IndustryOR benchmark, the inaugural industrial standard for evaluating LLMs in solving practical OR problems. Utilizing data synthesized through OR-Instruct, we train various open-source LLMs with a capacity of 7 billion parameters (dubbed ORLMs). The resulting model demonstrates significantly enhanced optimization modeling capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance across the NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR benchmarks. Our code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/Cardinal-Operations/ORLM}.

### How Does Vision-Language Adaptation Impact the Safety of Vision Language   Models?
**Authors**: Seongyun Lee, Geewook Kim, Jiyeon Kim, Hyunji Lee, Hoyeon Chang, Sue Hyun Park, Minjoon Seo

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T03:20:57Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language adaptation (VL adaptation) transforms Large Language Models (LLMs) into Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for multimodal tasks, but this process often compromises the inherent safety capabilities embedded in the original LLMs. Despite potential harmfulness due to weakened safety measures, in-depth analysis on the effects of VL adaptation on safety remains under-explored. This study examines how VL adaptation influences safety and evaluates the impact of safety fine-tuning methods. Our analysis reveals that safety degradation occurs during VL adaptation, even when the training data is safe. While safety tuning techniques like supervised fine-tuning with safety datasets or reinforcement learning from human feedback mitigate some risks, they still lead to safety degradation and a reduction in helpfulness due to over-rejection issues. Further analysis of internal model weights suggests that VL adaptation may impact certain safety-related layers, potentially lowering overall safety levels. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that the objectives of VL adaptation and safety tuning are divergent, which often results in their simultaneous application being suboptimal. To address this, we suggest the weight merging approach as an optimal solution effectively reducing safety degradation while maintaining helpfulness. These insights help guide the development of more reliable and secure LVLMs for real-world applications.

**Authors**: Heejong Bong, Colin B. Fogarty, Elizaveta Levina, Ji Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T03:14:45Z

**Summary**: In network settings, interference between units makes causal inference more challenging as outcomes may depend on the treatments received by others in the network. Typical estimands in network settings focus on treatment effects aggregated across individuals in the population. We propose a framework for estimating node-wise counterfactual means, allowing for more granular insights into the impact of network structure on treatment effect heterogeneity. We develop a doubly robust and non-parametric estimation procedure, KECENI (Kernel Estimation of Causal Effect under Network Interference), which offers consistency and asymptotic normality under network dependence. The utility of this method is demonstrated through an application to microfinance data, revealing the impact of network characteristics on treatment effects.

### DiffFNO: Diffusion Fourier Neural Operator
**Authors**: Xiaoyi Liu, Hao Tang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T03:14:11Z

**Summary**: We introduce DiffFNO, a novel diffusion framework for arbitrary-scale super-resolution strengthened by a Weighted Fourier Neural Operator (WFNO). Mode Re-balancing in WFNO effectively captures critical frequency components, significantly improving the reconstruction of high-frequency image details that are crucial for super-resolution tasks. Gated Fusion Mechanism (GFM) adaptively complements WFNO's spectral features with spatial features from an Attention-based Neural Operator (AttnNO). This enhances the network's capability to capture both global structures and local details. Adaptive Time-Step (ATS) ODE solver, a deterministic sampling strategy, accelerates inference without sacrificing output quality by dynamically adjusting integration step sizes ATS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffFNO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, outperforming existing methods across various scaling factors by a margin of 2 to 4 dB in PSNR, including those beyond the training distribution. It also achieves this at lower inference time. Our approach sets a new standard in super-resolution, delivering both superior accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Sequential Gaussian Variational Inference for Nonlinear State Estimation   and Its Application in Robot Navigation
**Authors**: Min-Won Seo, Solmaz S. Kia

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T03:13:00Z

**Summary**: Probabilistic state estimation is essential for robots navigating uncertain environments. Accurately and efficiently managing uncertainty in estimated states is key to robust robotic operation. However, nonlinearities in robotic platforms pose significant challenges that require advanced estimation techniques. Gaussian variational inference (GVI) offers an optimization perspective on the estimation problem, providing analytically tractable solutions and efficiencies derived from the geometry of Gaussian space. We propose a Sequential Gaussian Variational Inference (S-GVI) method to address nonlinearity and provide efficient sequential inference processes. Our approach integrates sequential Bayesian principles into the GVI framework, which are addressed using statistical approximations and gradient updates on the information geometry. Validations through simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate significant improvements in state estimation over the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation method.

### AMXFP4: Taming Activation Outliers with Asymmetric Microscaling   Floating-Point for 4-bit LLM Inference
**Authors**: Janghwan Lee, Jiwoong Park, Jinseok Kim, Yongjik Kim, Jungju Oh, Jinwook Oh, Jungwook Choi

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T03:11:19Z

**Summary**: Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context lengths has increased the need for efficient low-bit quantization to manage their substantial computational demands. However, reducing precision to 4 bits frequently degrades performance due to activation outliers. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Microscaling 4-bit Floating-Point (AMXFP4) for efficient LLM inference. This novel data format leverages asymmetric shared scales to mitigate outliers while naturally capturing the asymmetry introduced by group-wise quantization. Unlike conventional 4-bit quantization methods that rely on data rotation and costly calibration, AMXFP4 uses asymmetric shared scales for direct 4-bit casting, achieving near-ideal quantization accuracy across various LLM tasks, including multi-turn conversations, long-context reasoning, and visual question answering. Our AMXFP4 format significantly outperforms MXFP4 and other leading quantization techniques, enabling robust, calibration-free 4-bit inference.

### LLM-assisted Explicit and Implicit Multi-interest Learning Framework for   Sequential Recommendation
**Authors**: Shutong Qiao, Chen Gao, Yong Li, Hongzhi Yin

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T02:53:36Z

**Summary**: Multi-interest modeling in current recommender systems (RS) is mainly based on user behavioral data, capturing user interest preferences from multiple dimensions. However, since behavioral data is implicit and often highly sparse, it is challenging to understand users' complex and diverse interests. Recent studies have shown that the rich semantic information in the text can effectively supplement the deficiencies of behavioral data. Despite this, it is still difficult for small models to directly extract semantic features associated with users' deep interests. That is, how to effectively align semantics with behavioral information to form a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of user interests has become a critical research problem. To address this, we propose an LLM-assisted explicit and implicit multi-interest learning framework (named EIMF) to model user interests on two levels: behavior and semantics. The framework consists of two parts: Implicit Behavioral Interest Module (IBIM) and Explicit Semantic Interest Module (ESIM). The traditional multi-interest RS model in IBIM can learn users' implicit behavioral interests from interactions with items. In ESIM, we first adopt a clustering algorithm to select typical samples and design a prompting strategy on LLM to obtain explicit semantic interests. Furthermore, in the training phase, the semantic interests of typical samples can enhance the representation learning of behavioral interests based on the multi-task learning on semantic prediction and modality alignment. Therefore, in the inference stage, accurate recommendations can be achieved with only the user's behavioral data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EIMF framework, which effectively and efficiently combines small models with LLM to improve the accuracy of multi-interest modeling.

### Investigation of the non-thermal X-ray emission from the supernova   remnant CTB 37B hosting the magnetar CXOU J171405.7$-$381031
**Authors**: Chanho Kim, Jaegeun Park, Hongjun An, Kaya Mori, Stephen P. Reynolds, Samar Safi-Harb, Shuo Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T02:50:17Z

**Summary**: We present a detailed X-ray investigation of a region (S1) exhibiting non-thermal X-ray emission within the supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 37B hosting the magnetar CXOU J171405.7$-$381031. Previous analyses modeled this emission with a power law (PL), inferring various values for the photon index ($\Gamma$) and absorbing column density ($N_{\rm H}$). Based on these, S1 was suggested to be the SNR shell, a background pulsar wind nebula (PWN), or an interaction region between the SNR and a molecular cloud. Our analysis of a larger dataset favors a steepening (broken or curved PL) spectrum over a straight PL, with the best-fit broken power-law (BPL) parameters of $\Gamma=1.23\pm0.23$ and $2.24\pm0.16$ below and above a break at $5.57\pm0.52$ keV, respectively. However, a simple PL or srcut model cannot be definitively ruled out. For the BPL model, the inferred $N_{\rm H}=(4.08\pm0.72)\times 10^{22}\rm \ cm^{-2}$ towards S1 is consistent with that of the SNR, suggesting a physical association. The BPL-inferred spectral break $\Delta \Gamma \approx 1$ and hard $\Gamma$ can be naturally explained by a non-thermal bremsstrahlung (NTB) model. We present an evolutionary NTB model that reproduces the observed spectrum, which indicates the presence of sub-relativistic electrons within S1. However, alternate explanations for S1, an unrelated PWN or the SNR shock with unusually efficient acceleration, cannot be ruled out. We discuss these explanations and their implications for gamma-ray emission from CTB 37B, and describe future observations that could settle the origin of S1.

**Authors**: Mohammad Rifqi Farhansyah, Muhammad Zuhdi Fikri Johari, Afinzaki Amiral, Ayu Purwarianti, Kumara Ari Yuana, Derry Tanti Wijaya

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T02:42:59Z

**Summary**: Indonesia is one of the most diverse countries linguistically. However, despite this linguistic diversity, Indonesian languages remain underrepresented in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research and technologies. In the past two years, several efforts have been conducted to construct NLP resources for Indonesian languages. However, most of these efforts have been focused on creating manual resources thus difficult to scale to more languages. Although many Indonesian languages do not have a web presence, locally there are resources that document these languages well in printed forms such as books, magazines, and newspapers. Digitizing these existing resources will enable scaling of Indonesian language resource construction to many more languages. In this paper, we propose an alternative method of creating datasets by digitizing documents, which have not previously been used to build digital language resources in Indonesia. DriveThru is a platform for extracting document content utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques in its system to provide language resource building with less manual effort and cost. This paper also studies the utility of current state-of-the-art LLM for post-OCR correction to show the capability of increasing the character accuracy rate (CAR) and word accuracy rate (WAR) compared to off-the-shelf OCR.

### Similarity-aware Syncretic Latent Diffusion Model for Medical Image   Translation with Representation Learning
**Authors**: Tingyi Lin, Pengju Lyu, Jie Zhang, Yuqing Wang, Cheng Wang, Jianjun Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T02:32:57Z

**Summary**: Non-contrast CT (NCCT) imaging may reduce image contrast and anatomical visibility, potentially increasing diagnostic uncertainty. In contrast, contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) facilitates the observation of regions of interest (ROI). Leading generative models, especially the conditional diffusion model, demonstrate remarkable capabilities in medical image modality transformation. Typical conditional diffusion models commonly generate images with guidance of segmentation labels for medical modal transformation. Limited access to authentic guidance and its low cardinality can pose challenges to the practical clinical application of conditional diffusion models. To achieve an equilibrium of generative quality and clinical practices, we propose a novel Syncretic generative model based on the latent diffusion model for medical image translation (S$^2$LDM), which can realize high-fidelity reconstruction without demand of additional condition during inference. S$^2$LDM enhances the similarity in distinct modal images via syncretic encoding and diffusing, promoting amalgamated information in the latent space and generating medical images with more details in contrast-enhanced regions. However, syncretic latent spaces in the frequency domain tend to favor lower frequencies, commonly locate in identical anatomic structures. Thus, S$^2$LDM applies adaptive similarity loss and dynamic similarity to guide the generation and supplements the shortfall in high-frequency details throughout the training process. Quantitative experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach in medical image translation. Our code will release lately.

### Planning by Simulation: Motion Planning with Learning-based Parallel   Scenario Prediction for Autonomous Driving
**Authors**: Tian Niu, Kaizhao Zhang, Zhongxue Gan, Wenchao Ding

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T02:18:35Z

**Summary**: Planning safe trajectories for autonomous vehicles is essential for operational safety but remains extremely challenging due to the complex interactions among traffic participants. Recent autonomous driving frameworks have focused on improving prediction accuracy to explicitly model these interactions. However, some methods overlook the significant influence of the ego vehicle's planning on the possible trajectories of other agents, which can alter prediction accuracy and lead to unsafe planning decisions. In this paper, we propose a novel motion Planning approach by Simulation with learning-based parallel scenario prediction (PS). PS deduces predictions iteratively based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), jointly inferring scenarios that cooperate with the ego vehicle's planning set. Our method simulates possible scenes and calculates their costs after the ego vehicle executes potential actions. To balance and prune unreasonable actions and scenarios, we adopt MCTS as the foundation to explore possible future interactions encoded within the prediction network. Moreover, the query-centric trajectory prediction streamlines our scene generation, enabling a sophisticated framework that captures the mutual influence between other agents' predictions and the ego vehicle's planning. We evaluate our framework on the Argoverse 2 dataset, and the results demonstrate that our approach effectively achieves parallel ego vehicle planning.

### Automated Clinical Data Extraction with Knowledge Conditioned LLMs
**Authors**: Diya Li, Asim Kadav, Aijing Gao, Rui Li, Richard Bourgon

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T02:07:34Z

**Summary**: The extraction of lung lesion information from clinical and medical imaging reports is crucial for research on and clinical care of lung-related diseases. Large language models (LLMs) can be effective at interpreting unstructured text in reports, but they often hallucinate due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge, leading to reduced accuracy and posing challenges for use in clinical settings. To address this, we propose a novel framework that aligns generated internal knowledge with external knowledge through in-context learning (ICL). Our framework employs a retriever to identify relevant units of internal or external knowledge and a grader to evaluate the truthfulness and helpfulness of the retrieved internal-knowledge rules, to align and update the knowledge bases. Experiments with expert-curated test datasets demonstrate that this ICL approach can increase the F1 score for key fields (lesion size, margin and solidity) by an average of 12.9% over existing ICL methods.

**Authors**: Olga Movilla Miangolarra, Asmaa Eldesoukey, Ander Movilla Miangolarra, Tryphon T. Georgiou

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T02:01:32Z

**Summary**: Reaction-diffusion equations are commonly used to model a diverse array of complex systems, including biological, chemical, and physical processes. Typically, these models are phenomenological, requiring the fitting of parameters to experimental data. In the present work, we introduce a novel formalism to construct reaction-diffusion models that is grounded in the principle of maximum entropy. This new formalism aims to incorporate various types of experimental data, including ensemble currents, distributions at different points in time, or moments of such. To this end, we expand the framework of Schr\"odinger bridges and Maximum Caliber problems to nonlinear interacting systems. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach by modeling the evolution of (i) a morphogen across the fin of a zebrafish and (ii) the population of two varieties of toads in Poland, so as to match the experimental data.

### A Hybrid Artificial Intelligence System for Automated EEG Background   Analysis and Report Generation
**Authors**: Chin-Sung Tung, Sheng-Fu Liang, Shu-Feng Chang, Chung-Ping Young

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T01:49:17Z

**Summary**: Electroencephalography (EEG) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various neurological disorders. However, small hospitals and clinics often lack advanced EEG signal analysis systems and are prone to misinterpretation in manual EEG reading. This study proposes an innovative hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) system for automatic interpretation of EEG background activity and report generation. The system combines deep learning models for posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) prediction, unsupervised artifact removal, and expert-designed algorithms for abnormality detection. For PDR prediction, 1530 labeled EEGs were used, and the best ensemble model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.237, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.359, an accuracy of 91.8% within a 0.6Hz error, and an accuracy of 99% within a 1.2Hz error. The AI system significantly outperformed neurologists in detecting generalized background slowing (p = 0.02; F1: AI 0.93, neurologists 0.82) and demonstrated improved focal abnormality detection, although not statistically significant (p = 0.79; F1: AI 0.71, neurologists 0.55). Validation on both an internal dataset and the Temple University Abnormal EEG Corpus showed consistent performance (F1: 0.884 and 0.835, respectively; p = 0.66), demonstrating generalizability. The use of large language models (LLMs) for report generation demonstrated 100% accuracy, verified by three other independent LLMs. This hybrid AI system provides an easily scalable and accurate solution for EEG interpretation in resource-limited settings, assisting neurologists in improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing misdiagnosis rates.

### LLM-Powered AI Tutors with Personas for d/Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing   Online Learners
**Authors**: Haocong Cheng, Si Chen, Christopher Perdriau, Yun Huang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T01:48:08Z

**Summary**: Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) using artificial intelligence (AI) technology have shown promise in supporting learners with diverse abilities; however, they often fail to meet the specific communication needs and cultural nuances needed by d/Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) learners. As large language models (LLMs) provide new opportunities to incorporate personas to AI-based tutors and support dynamic interactive dialogue, this paper explores how DHH learners perceive LLM-powered ITS with different personas and identified design suggestions for improving the interaction. We developed an interface that allows DHH learners to interact with ChatGPT and three LLM-powered AI tutors with different experiences in DHH education while the learners watch an educational video. A user study with 16 DHH participants showed that they perceived conversations with the AI tutors who had DHH education experiences to be more human-like and trustworthy due to the tutors' cultural knowledge of DHH communities. Participants also suggested providing more transparency regarding the tutors' background information to clarify each AI tutor's position within the DHH community. We discuss design implications for more inclusive LLM-based systems, such as supports for the multimodality of sign language.

### The Impact of Astrophysical Priors on Parameter Inference for GW230529
**Authors**: Debatri Chattopadhyay, Sama Al-Shammari, Fabio Antonini, Stephen Fairhurst, Benjamin Miles, Vivien Raymond

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T01:32:51Z

**Summary**: We investigate the effects of prior selection on the inferred mass and spin parameters of the neutron star-black hole merger GW230529\_181500. Specifically, we explore models motivated by astrophysical considerations, including massive binary and pulsar evolution. We examine mass and spin distributions of neutron stars constrained by radio pulsar observations, alongside black hole spin observations from previous gravitational wave detections. We show that the inferred mass distribution highly depends upon the spin prior. Specifically, under the most restrictive, binary stellar evolution models, we obtain narrower distributions of masses with a black hole mass of $4.3^{+0.1}_{-0.1}\,M_{\odot}$and neutron star mass of $1.3^{+0.03}_{-0.03}\,M_{\odot}$ where, somewhat surprisingly, it is the prior on component spins which has the greatest impact on the inferred mass distributions. Re-weighting using neutron star mass and spin priors from observations of radio pulsars, with black hole spins from observations of gravitational waves, yields the black hole and the neutron star masses to be $3.8^{+0.5}_{-0.6} \,M_\odot$ and $1.4^{+0.2}_{-0.1} \,M_\odot$ respectively. The sequence of compact object formation -- whether the neutron star or the black hole formed first -- cannot be determined at the observed signal-to-noise ratio. However, there is no evidence that the black hole was tidally spun up.

### DeepOSets: Non-Autoregressive In-Context Learning of Supervised Learning   Operators
**Authors**: Shao-Ting Chiu, Junyuan Hong, Ulisses Braga-Neto

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T01:09:27Z

**Summary**: We introduce DeepSets Operator Networks (DeepOSets), an efficient, non-autoregressive neural network architecture for in-context operator learning. In-context learning allows a trained machine learning model to learn from a user prompt without further training. DeepOSets adds in-context learning capabilities to Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) by combining it with the DeepSets architecture. As the first non-autoregressive model for in-context operator learning, DeepOSets allow the user prompt to be processed in parallel, leading to significant computational savings. Here, we present the application of DeepOSets in the problem of learning supervised learning algorithms, which are operators mapping a finite-dimensional space of labeled data into an infinite-dimensional hypothesis space of prediction functions. In an empirical comparison with a popular autoregressive (transformer-based) model for in-context learning of linear regression in one and five dimensions, DeepOSets reduced the number of model weights by several orders of magnitude and required a fraction of training and inference time. Furthermore, DeepOSets proved to be less sensitive to noise, significantly outperforming the transformer model in noisy settings.

### Uncertainty Propagation within Chained Models for Machine Learning   Reconstruction of Neutrino-LAr Interactions
**Authors**: D. Douglas, A. Mishra, D. Ratner, F. Petersen

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T01:01:44Z

**Summary**: Sequential or chained models are increasingly prevalent in machine learning for scientific applications, due to their flexibility and ease of development. Chained models are particularly useful when a task is separable into distinct steps with a hierarchy of meaningful intermediate representations. In reliability-critical tasks, it is important to quantify the confidence of model inferences. However, chained models pose an additional challenge for uncertainty quantification, especially when input uncertainties need to be propagated. In such cases, a fully uncertainty-aware chain of models is required, where each step accepts a probability distribution over the input space, and produces a probability distribution over the output space. In this work, we present a case study for adapting a single model within an existing chain, designed for reconstruction within neutrino-Argon interactions, developed for neutrino oscillation experiments such as MicroBooNE, ICARUS, and the future DUNE experiment. We test the performance of an input uncertainty-enabled model against an uncertainty-blinded model using a method for generating synthetic noise. By comparing these two, we assess the increase in inference quality achieved by exposing models to upstream uncertainty estimates.

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T00:15:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) represent a transformative class of AI tools capable of revolutionizing various aspects of healthcare by generating human-like responses across diverse contexts and adapting to novel tasks following human instructions. Their potential application spans a broad range of medical tasks, such as clinical documentation, matching patients to clinical trials, and answering medical questions. In this primer paper, we propose an actionable guideline to help healthcare professionals more efficiently utilize LLMs in their work, along with a set of best practices. This approach consists of several main phases, including formulating the task, choosing LLMs, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and deployment. We start with the discussion of critical considerations in identifying healthcare tasks that align with the core capabilities of LLMs and selecting models based on the selected task and data, performance requirements, and model interface. We then review the strategies, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, to adapt standard LLMs to specialized medical tasks. Deployment considerations, including regulatory compliance, ethical guidelines, and continuous monitoring for fairness and bias, are also discussed. By providing a structured step-by-step methodology, this tutorial aims to equip healthcare professionals with the tools necessary to effectively integrate LLMs into clinical practice, ensuring that these powerful technologies are applied in a safe, reliable, and impactful manner.

### ConSmax: Hardware-Friendly Alternative Softmax with Learnable Parameters
**Authors**: Shiwei Liu, Guanchen Tao, Yifei Zou, Derek Chow, Zichen Fan, Kauna Lei, Bangfei Pan, Dennis Sylvester, Gregory Kielian, Mehdi Saligane

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T00:09:44Z

**Summary**: The self-attention mechanism distinguishes transformer-based large language models (LLMs) apart from convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Despite the performance improvement, achieving real-time LLM inference on silicon remains challenging due to the extensive use of Softmax in self-attention. In addition to the non-linearity, the low arithmetic intensity significantly limits processing parallelism, especially when working with longer contexts. To address this challenge, we propose Constant Softmax (ConSmax), a software-hardware co-design that serves as an efficient alternative to Softmax. ConSmax utilizes differentiable normalization parameters to eliminate the need for maximum searching and denominator summation in Softmax. This approach enables extensive parallelization while still executing the essential functions of Softmax. Moreover, a scalable ConSmax hardware design with a bitwidth-split look-up table (LUT) can achieve lossless non-linear operations and support mixed-precision computing. Experimental results show that ConSmax achieves a minuscule power consumption of 0.2mW and an area of 0.0008mm^2 at 1250MHz working frequency in 16nm FinFET technology. For open-source contribution, we further implement our design with the OpenROAD toolchain under SkyWater's 130nm CMOS technology. The corresponding power is 2.69mW and the area is 0.007mm^2. ConSmax achieves 3.35x power savings and 2.75x area savings in 16nm technology, and 3.15x power savings and 4.14x area savings with the open-source EDA toolchain. In the meantime, it also maintains comparable accuracy on the GPT-2 model and the WikiText103 dataset. The project is available at https://github.com/ReaLLMASIC/ConSmax

**Authors**: Daniel Ekpo, Mara Levy, Saksham Suri, Chuong Huynh, Abhinav Shrivastava

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T18:59:51Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) offer potential for robot task planning, but challenges remain due to VLMs' tendency to generate incorrect action sequences. To address these limitations, we propose VeriGraph, a novel framework that integrates VLMs for robotic planning while verifying action feasibility. VeriGraph employs scene graphs as an intermediate representation, capturing key objects and spatial relationships to improve plan verification and refinement. The system generates a scene graph from input images and uses it to iteratively check and correct action sequences generated by an LLM-based task planner, ensuring constraints are respected and actions are executable. Our approach significantly enhances task completion rates across diverse manipulation scenarios, outperforming baseline methods by 58% for language-based tasks and 30% for image-based tasks.

### Treat Visual Tokens as Text? But Your MLLM Only Needs Fewer Efforts to   See
**Authors**: Zeliang Zhang, Phu Pham, Wentian Zhao, Kun Wan, Yu-Jhe Li, Jianing Zhou, Daniel Miranda, Ajinkya Kale, Chenliang Xu

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T18:43:23Z

**Summary**: By treating visual tokens from visual encoders as text tokens, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across diverse visual understanding tasks, leveraging the robust architectures of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, as token counts grow, the quadratic scaling of computation in LLMs introduces a significant efficiency bottleneck, impeding further scalability. Although recent approaches have explored pruning visual tokens or employing lighter LLM architectures, the computational overhead from an increasing number of visual tokens remains a substantial challenge.   In this study, we investigate the redundancy in visual computation at both the parameter and computational pattern levels within LLaVA, a representative MLLM, and introduce a suite of streamlined strategies to enhance efficiency. These include neighbor-aware visual token attention, pruning of inactive visual attention heads, and selective layer dropping for visual computations. By implementing these strategies in LLaVA, we achieve a reduction in computational demands of 88% while maintaining model performance across key benchmarks. Additionally, we validate the existence of visual computational redundancy in other MLLMs, such as Qwen2-VL-7B and InternVL-2.0-4B/8B/26B. These results present a novel pathway for MLLMs to handle dense visual tokens with minimal computational costs. Code and model checkpoints will be released to support further research.

**Authors**: Parsa Hejabi, Elnaz Rahmati, Alireza S. Ziabari, Preni Golazizian, Jesse Thomason, Morteza Dehghani

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T18:42:48Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex tasks and interactive environments, yet their creativity remains underexplored. This paper introduces a simulation framework utilizing the game Balderdash to evaluate both the creativity and logical reasoning of LLMs. In Balderdash, players generate fictitious definitions for obscure terms to deceive others while identifying correct definitions. Our framework enables multiple LLM agents to participate in this game, assessing their ability to produce plausible definitions and strategize based on game rules and history. We implemented a centralized game engine featuring various LLMs as participants and a judge LLM to evaluate semantic equivalence. Through a series of experiments, we analyzed the performance of different LLMs, examining metrics such as True Definition Ratio, Deception Ratio, and Correct Guess Ratio. The results provide insights into the creative and deceptive capabilities of LLMs, highlighting their strengths and areas for improvement. Specifically, the study reveals that infrequent vocabulary in LLMs' input leads to poor reasoning on game rules and historical context (https://github.com/ParsaHejabi/Simulation-Framework-for-Multi-Agent-Balderdash).

### Large Language Model-Based Interpretable Machine Learning Control in   Building Energy Systems
**Authors**: Liang Zhang, Zhelun Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T18:34:42Z

**Summary**: The potential of Machine Learning Control (MLC) in HVAC systems is hindered by its opaque nature and inference mechanisms, which is challenging for users and modelers to fully comprehend, ultimately leading to a lack of trust in MLC-based decision-making. To address this challenge, this paper investigates and explores Interpretable Machine Learning (IML), a branch of Machine Learning (ML) that enhances transparency and understanding of models and their inferences, to improve the credibility of MLC and its industrial application in HVAC systems. Specifically, we developed an innovative framework that combines the principles of Shapley values and the in-context learning feature of Large Language Models (LLMs). While the Shapley values are instrumental in dissecting the contributions of various features in ML models, LLM provides an in-depth understanding of the non-data-driven or rule-based elements in MLC; combining them, LLM further packages these insights into a coherent, human-understandable narrative. The paper presents a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of the developed IML framework for model predictive control-based precooling under demand response events in a virtual testbed. The results indicate that the developed framework generates and explains the control signals in accordance with the rule-based rationale.

**Authors**: Jianfeng Chi, Ujjwal Karn, Hongyuan Zhan, Eric Smith, Javier Rando, Yiming Zhang, Kate Plawiak, Zacharie Delpierre Coudert, Kartikeya Upasani, Mahesh Pasupuleti

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T18:34:07Z

**Summary**: We introduce Llama Guard 3 Vision, a multimodal LLM-based safeguard for human-AI conversations that involves image understanding: it can be used to safeguard content for both multimodal LLM inputs (prompt classification) and outputs (response classification). Unlike the previous text-only Llama Guard versions (Inan et al., 2023; Llama Team, 2024b,a), it is specifically designed to support image reasoning use cases and is optimized to detect harmful multimodal (text and image) prompts and text responses to these prompts. Llama Guard 3 Vision is fine-tuned on Llama 3.2-Vision and demonstrates strong performance on the internal benchmarks using the MLCommons taxonomy. We also test its robustness against adversarial attacks. We believe that Llama Guard 3 Vision serves as a good starting point to build more capable and robust content moderation tools for human-AI conversation with multimodal capabilities.

**Authors**: Rokas Gipiškis, Ayrton San Joaquin, Ze Shen Chin, Adrian Regenfuß, Ariel Gil, Koen Holtman

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T17:18:57Z

**Summary**: There is an urgent need to identify both short and long-term risks from newly emerging types of Artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as available risk management measures. In response, and to support global efforts in regulating AI and writing safety standards, we compile an extensive catalog of risk sources and risk management measures for general-purpose AI (GPAI) systems, complete with descriptions and supporting examples where relevant. This work involves identifying technical, operational, and societal risks across model development, training, and deployment stages, as well as surveying established and experimental methods for managing these risks. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first of its kind to provide extensive documentation of both GPAI risk sources and risk management measures that are descriptive, self-contained and neutral with respect to any existing regulatory framework. This work intends to help AI providers, standards experts, researchers, policymakers, and regulators in identifying and mitigating systemic risks from GPAI systems. For this reason, the catalog is released under a public domain license for ease of direct use by stakeholders in AI governance and standards.

### Interactive Cycle Model -- The Linkage Combination among Automatic   Speech Recognition, Large Language Models and Smart Glasses
**Authors**: Libo Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T17:11:13Z

**Summary**: This research proposes the interaction loop model "ASR-LLM-Smart Glasses", which model combines automatic speech recognition, large language model and smart glasses to facilitate seamless human-computer interaction. And the methodology of this research involves decomposing the interaction process into different stages and elements. Speech is captured and processed by ASR, then analyzed and interpreted by LLM. The results are then transmitted to smart glasses for display. The feedback loop is complete when the user interacts with the displayed data. Mathematical formulas are used to quantify the performance of the model that revolves around core evaluation points: accuracy, coherence, and latency during ASR speech-to-text conversion. The research results are provided theoretically to test and evaluate the feasibility and performance of the model. Although such human-computer interaction products have not yet appeared in the industry, the performance indicators of this model in enhancing user experience in fields that rely on human-computer interaction have also verified its utility as a technology to promote human-computer interaction. In addition, this research pioneered the idea of integrating cutting-edge technologies such as generative pre-trained Transformer models into unique interaction models, LLM provides raw value through powerful evaluation techniques and innovative use, which provides a new perspective to evaluate and enhanced human-computer interaction.

### Bias Unveiled: Investigating Social Bias in LLM-Generated Code
**Authors**: Lin Ling, Fazle Rabbi, Song Wang, Jinqiu Yang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T16:55:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of automated code generation. However, a notable research gap exists in the evaluation of social biases that may be present in the code produced by LLMs. To solve this issue, we propose a novel fairness framework, i.e., Solar, to assess and mitigate the social biases of LLM-generated code. Specifically, Solar can automatically generate test cases for quantitatively uncovering social biases of the auto-generated code by LLMs. To quantify the severity of social biases in generated code, we develop a dataset that covers a diverse set of social problems. We applied Solar and the crafted dataset to four state-of-the-art LLMs for code generation. Our evaluation reveals severe bias in the LLM-generated code from all the subject LLMs. Furthermore, we explore several strategies for bias mitigation, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, combining positive role-playing with CoT prompting and iterative prompting. Our experiments show that iterative prompting can effectively reduce social bias in LLM-generated code by up to 90%. Solar is highly extensible to evaluate new social problems.

### The Silicon Ceiling: Auditing GPT's Race and Gender Biases in Hiring
**Authors**: Lena Armstrong, Abbey Liu, Stephen MacNeil, Danaë Metaxa

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T16:53:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being introduced in workplace settings, with the goals of improving efficiency and fairness. However, concerns have arisen regarding these models' potential to reflect or exacerbate social biases and stereotypes. This study explores the potential impact of LLMs on hiring practices. To do so, we conduct an AI audit of race and gender biases in one commonly-used LLM, OpenAI's GPT-3.5, taking inspiration from the history of traditional offline resume audits. We conduct two studies using names with varied race and gender connotations: resume assessment (Study 1) and resume generation (Study 2). In Study 1, we ask GPT to score resumes with 32 different names (4 names for each combination of the 2 gender and 4 racial groups) and two anonymous options across 10 occupations and 3 evaluation tasks (overall rating, willingness to interview, and hireability). We find that the model reflects some biases based on stereotypes. In Study 2, we prompt GPT to create resumes (10 for each name) for fictitious job candidates. When generating resumes, GPT reveals underlying biases; women's resumes had occupations with less experience, while Asian and Hispanic resumes had immigrant markers, such as non-native English and non-U.S. education and work experiences. Our findings contribute to a growing body of literature on LLM biases, particularly in workplace contexts.

### Number it: Temporal Grounding Videos like Flipping Manga
**Authors**: Yongliang Wu, Xinting Hu, Yuyang Sun, Yizhou Zhou, Wenbo Zhu, Fengyun Rao, Bernt Schiele, Xu Yang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T16:32:34Z

**Summary**: Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) have made remarkable advancements in comprehending video content for QA dialogue. However, they struggle to extend this visual understanding to tasks requiring precise temporal localization, known as Video Temporal Grounding (VTG). To address this gap, we introduce Number-Prompt (NumPro), a novel method that empowers Vid-LLMs to bridge visual comprehension with temporal grounding by adding unique numerical identifiers to each video frame. Treating a video as a sequence of numbered frame images, NumPro transforms VTG into an intuitive process: flipping through manga panels in sequence. This allows Vid-LLMs to "read" event timelines, accurately linking visual content with corresponding temporal information. Our experiments demonstrate that NumPro significantly boosts VTG performance of top-tier Vid-LLMs without additional computational cost. Furthermore, fine-tuning on a NumPro-enhanced dataset defines a new state-of-the-art for VTG, surpassing previous top-performing methods by up to 6.9\% in mIoU for moment retrieval and 8.5\% in mAP for highlight detection. The code will be available at https://github.com/yongliang-wu/NumPro.

### Open LLMs are Necessary for Current Private Adaptations and Outperform   their Closed Alternatives
**Authors**: Vincent Hanke, Tom Blanchard, Franziska Boenisch, Iyiola Emmanuel Olatunji, Michael Backes, Adam Dziedzic

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T16:23:17Z

**Summary**: While open Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress, they still fall short of matching the performance of their closed, proprietary counterparts, making the latter attractive even for the use on highly private data. Recently, various new methods have been proposed to adapt closed LLMs to private data without leaking private information to third parties and/or the LLM provider. In this work, we analyze the privacy protection and performance of the four most recent methods for private adaptation of closed LLMs. By examining their threat models and thoroughly comparing their performance under different privacy levels according to differential privacy (DP), various LLM architectures, and multiple datasets for classification and generation tasks, we find that: (1) all the methods leak query data, i.e., the (potentially sensitive) user data that is queried at inference time, to the LLM provider, (2) three out of four methods also leak large fractions of private training data to the LLM provider while the method that protects private data requires a local open LLM, (3) all the methods exhibit lower performance compared to three private gradient-based adaptation methods for local open LLMs, and (4) the private adaptation methods for closed LLMs incur higher monetary training and query costs than running the alternative methods on local open LLMs. This yields the conclusion that, to achieve truly privacy-preserving LLM adaptations that yield high performance and more privacy at lower costs, taking into account current methods and models, one should use open LLMs.

### M3TR: Generalist HD Map Construction with Variable Map Priors
**Authors**: Fabian Immel, Richard Fehler, Frank Bieder, Jan-Hendrik Pauls, Christoph Stiller

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T16:14:48Z

**Summary**: Autonomous vehicles require road information for their operation, usually in form of HD maps. Since offline maps eventually become outdated or may only be partially available, online HD map construction methods have been proposed to infer map information from live sensor data. A key issue remains how to exploit such partial or outdated map information as a prior. We introduce M3TR (Multi-Masking Map Transformer), a generalist approach for HD map construction both with and without map priors. We address shortcomings in ground truth generation for Argoverse 2 and nuScenes and propose the first realistic scenarios with semantically diverse map priors. Examining various query designs, we use an improved method for integrating prior map elements into a HD map construction model, increasing performance by +4.3 mAP. Finally, we show that training across all prior scenarios yields a single Generalist model, whose performance is on par with previous Expert models that can handle only one specific type of map prior. M3TR thus is the first model capable of leveraging variable map priors, making it suitable for real-world deployment. Code is available at https://github.com/immel-f/m3tr

### Static network structure cannot stabilize cooperation among Large   Language Model agents
**Authors**: Jin Han, Balaraju Battu, Ivan Romić, Talal Rahwan, Petter Holme

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T15:52:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model human social behavior, with recent research exploring their ability to simulate social dynamics. Here, we test whether LLMs mirror human behavior in social dilemmas, where individual and collective interests conflict. Humans generally cooperate more than expected in laboratory settings, showing less cooperation in well-mixed populations but more in fixed networks. In contrast, LLMs tend to exhibit greater cooperation in well-mixed settings. This raises a key question: Are LLMs about to emulate human behavior in cooperative dilemmas on networks? In this study, we examine networked interactions where agents repeatedly engage in the Prisoner's Dilemma within both well-mixed and structured network configurations, aiming to identify parallels in cooperative behavior between LLMs and humans. Our findings indicate critical distinctions: while humans tend to cooperate more within structured networks, LLMs display increased cooperation mainly in well-mixed environments, with limited adjustment to networked contexts. Notably, LLM cooperation also varies across model types, illustrating the complexities of replicating human-like social adaptability in artificial agents. These results highlight a crucial gap: LLMs struggle to emulate the nuanced, adaptive social strategies humans deploy in fixed networks. Unlike human participants, LLMs do not alter their cooperative behavior in response to network structures or evolving social contexts, missing the reciprocity norms that humans adaptively employ. This limitation points to a fundamental need in future LLM design -- to integrate a deeper comprehension of social norms, enabling more authentic modeling of human-like cooperation and adaptability in networked environments.

### Systolic Arrays and Structured Pruning Co-design for Efficient   Transformers in Edge Systems
**Authors**: Pedro Palacios, Rafael Medina, Jean-Luc Rouas, Giovanni Ansaloni, David Atienza

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T15:40:49Z

**Summary**: Efficient deployment of resource-intensive transformers on edge devices necessitates cross-stack optimization. We thus study the interrelation between structured pruning and systolic acceleration, matching the size of pruned blocks with the systolic array dimensions. In this setting, computations of pruned weight blocks can be skipped, reducing run-time and energy consumption, but potentially impacting quality of service (QoS). To evaluate the trade-offs between systolic array size and sparsity opportunities, we present a novel co-design framework that integrates algorithmic optimization, system simulation, and hardware design. Targeting speech recognition using transformers as a case study, we analyze how configuration choices across the stack affect performance metrics. Results demonstrate that structured pruning on systems featuring systolic array acceleration can effectively increase performance, while maintaining high QoS levels. Up to 26% system-wide speedups due to structured pruning were measured, with only 1.4% word error rate degradation on the standard Librispeech dataset.

### Scaling Law for Post-training after Model Pruning
**Authors**: Xiaodong Chen, Yuxuan Hu, Jing Zhang, Xiaokang Zhang, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T15:28:42Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) based on the Transformer architecture are widely employed across various domains and tasks. However, their increasing size imposes significant hardware demands, limiting practical deployment. To mitigate this, model pruning techniques have been developed to create more efficient models while maintaining high performance. Despite this, post-training after pruning is crucial for performance recovery and can be resource-intensive. This paper investigates the post-training requirements of pruned LLMs and introduces a scaling law to determine the optimal amount of post-training data. Post-training experiments with the Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5 series models, pruned using depth pruning, width pruning, and 2:4 semi-structured pruning, show that higher pruning ratios necessitate more post-training data for performance recovery, whereas larger LLMs require less. The proposed scaling law predicts a model's loss based on its parameter counts before and after pruning, as well as the post-training token counts. Furthermore, we find that the scaling law established from smaller LLMs can be reliably extrapolated to larger LLMs. This work provides valuable insights into the post-training of pruned LLMs and offers a practical scaling law for optimizing post-training data usage.

### Optimization-based Prompt Injection Attack to LLM-as-a-Judge
**Authors**: Jiawen Shi, Zenghui Yuan, Yinuo Liu, Yue Huang, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun, Neil Zhenqiang Gong

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T14:57:28Z

**Summary**: LLM-as-a-Judge uses a large language model (LLM) to select the best response from a set of candidates for a given question. LLM-as-a-Judge has many applications such as LLM-powered search, reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF), and tool selection. In this work, we propose JudgeDeceiver, an optimization-based prompt injection attack to LLM-as-a-Judge. JudgeDeceiver injects a carefully crafted sequence into an attacker-controlled candidate response such that LLM-as-a-Judge selects the candidate response for an attacker-chosen question no matter what other candidate responses are. Specifically, we formulate finding such sequence as an optimization problem and propose a gradient based method to approximately solve it. Our extensive evaluation shows that JudgeDeceive is highly effective, and is much more effective than existing prompt injection attacks that manually craft the injected sequences and jailbreak attacks when extended to our problem. We also show the effectiveness of JudgeDeceiver in three case studies, i.e., LLM-powered search, RLAIF, and tool selection. Moreover, we consider defenses including known-answer detection, perplexity detection, and perplexity windowed detection. Our results show these defenses are insufficient, highlighting the urgent need for developing new defense strategies. Our implementation is available at this repository: https://github.com/ShiJiawenwen/JudgeDeceiver.

### An Empirical Study on LLM-based Agents for Automated Bug Fixing
**Authors**: Xiangxin Meng, Zexiong Ma, Pengfei Gao, Chao Peng

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T14:19:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based Agents have been applied to fix bugs automatically, demonstrating the capability in addressing software defects by engaging in development environment interaction, iterative validation and code modification. However, systematic analysis of these agent and non-agent systems remain limited, particularly regarding performance variations among top-performing ones. In this paper, we examine seven proprietary and open-source systems on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark for automated bug fixing. We first assess each system's overall performance, noting instances solvable by all or none of these sytems, and explore why some instances are uniquely solved by specific system types. We also compare fault localization accuracy at file and line levels and evaluate bug reproduction capabilities, identifying instances solvable only through dynamic reproduction. Through analysis, we concluded that further optimization is needed in both the LLM itself and the design of Agentic flow to improve the effectiveness of the Agent in bug fixing.

### Agentic LLMs in the Supply Chain: Towards Autonomous Multi-Agent   Consensus-Seeking
**Authors**: Valeria Jannelli, Stefan Schoepf, Matthias Bickel, Torbjørn Netland, Alexandra Brintrup

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T13:33:10Z

**Summary**: This paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate consensus-seeking in supply chain management (SCM), where frequent decisions on problems such as inventory levels and delivery times require coordination among companies. Traditional SCM relies on human consensus in decision-making to avoid emergent problems like the bullwhip effect. Some routine consensus processes, especially those that are time-intensive and costly, can be automated. Existing solutions for automated coordination have faced challenges due to high entry barriers locking out SMEs, limited capabilities, and limited adaptability in complex scenarios. However, recent advances in Generative AI, particularly LLMs, show promise in overcoming these barriers. LLMs, trained on vast datasets can negotiate, reason, and plan, facilitating near-human-level consensus at scale with minimal entry barriers. In this work, we identify key limitations in existing approaches and propose autonomous LLM agents to address these gaps. We introduce a series of novel, supply chain-specific consensus-seeking frameworks tailored for LLM agents and validate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study in inventory management. To accelerate progress within the SCM community, we open-source our code, providing a foundation for further advancements in LLM-powered autonomous supply chain solutions.

### On-demand 5G Private Networks using a Mobile Cell
**Authors**: André Coelho, José Ruela, Gonçalo Queirós, Ricardo Trancoso, Paulo Furtado Correia, Filipe Ribeiro, Helder Fontes, Rui Campos, Manuel Ricardo

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T13:29:54Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes the Mobile Cell (MC) concept for on-demand 5G private networks. The MC is designed to extend, restore, and reinforce 5G wireless coverage and network capacity on-demand, especially in areas with temporary communications needs or where it is costly or not possible to deploy a permanent fixed infrastructure. The design of the MC as well as the development, integration, and deployment in 5G private networks are discussed.   The Mobile Cell concept can be applied in multiple real-world environments, including seaports and application scenarios. Similarly to critical hubs in the global supply chain, seaports require reliable, high-performance wireless communications to increase efficiency and manage dynamic operations in real-time. Current communications solutions in seaports typically rely on Wi-Fi and wired-based technologies. Wired-based technologies lack the necessary flexibility for dynamic environments. Wi-Fi is susceptible to interference from other systems operating in the same frequency bands. An MC operating in a licensed, interference-free spectrum is a promising solution to overcome these limitations and provide improved Quality of Service when using the 5G technology.

### Channel-Adaptive Wireless Image Semantic Transmission with Learnable   Prompts
**Authors**: Liang Zhang, Danlan Huang, Xinyi Zhou, Feng Ding, Sheng Wu, Zhiqing Wei

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T13:28:17Z

**Summary**: Recent developments in Deep learning based Joint Source-Channel Coding (DeepJSCC) have demonstrated impressive capabilities within wireless semantic communications system. However, existing DeepJSCC methodologies exhibit limited generalization ability across varying channel conditions, necessitating the preparation of multiple models. Optimal performance is only attained when the channel status during testing aligns precisely with the training channel status, which is very inconvenient for real-life applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel DeepJSCC framework, termed Prompt JSCC (PJSCC), which incorporates a learnable prompt to implicitly integrate the physical channel state into the transmission system. Specifically, the Channel State Prompt (CSP) module is devised to generate prompts based on diverse SNR and channel distribution models. Through the interaction of latent image features with channel features derived from the CSP module, the DeepJSCC process dynamically adapts to varying channel conditions without necessitating retraining. Comparative analyses against leading DeepJSCC methodologies and traditional separate coding approaches reveal that the proposed PJSCC achieves optimal image reconstruction performance across different SNR settings and various channel models, as assessed by Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Learning-based Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) metrics. Furthermore, in real-world scenarios, PJSCC shows excellent memory efficiency and scalability, rendering it readily deployable on resource-constrained platforms to facilitate semantic communications.

### Evaluating the role of `Constitutions' for learning from AI feedback
**Authors**: Saskia Redgate, Andrew M. Bean, Adam Mahdi

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T13:16:11Z

**Summary**: The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have led to their use as substitutes for human feedback for training and assessing other LLMs. These methods often rely on `constitutions', written guidelines which a critic model uses to provide feedback and improve generations. We investigate how the choice of constitution affects feedback quality by using four different constitutions to improve patient-centered communication in medical interviews. In pairwise comparisons conducted by 215 human raters, we found that detailed constitutions led to better results regarding emotive qualities. However, none of the constitutions outperformed the baseline in learning more practically-oriented skills related to information gathering and provision. Our findings indicate that while detailed constitutions should be prioritised, there are possible limitations to the effectiveness of AI feedback as a reward signal in certain areas.

### Compound-QA: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Compound Questions
**Authors**: Yutao Hou, Yajing Luo, Zhiwen Ruan, Hongru Wang, Weifeng Ge, Yun Chen, Guanhua Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T13:12:29Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across various tasks, prompting researchers to develop diverse evaluation benchmarks. However, existing benchmarks typically measure the ability of LLMs to respond to individual questions, neglecting the complex interactions in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce Compound Question Synthesis (CQ-Syn) to create the Compound-QA benchmark, focusing on compound questions with multiple sub-questions. This benchmark is derived from existing QA datasets, annotated with proprietary LLMs and verified by humans for accuracy. It encompasses five categories: Factual-Statement, Cause-and-Effect, Hypothetical-Analysis, Comparison-and-Selection, and Evaluation-and-Suggestion. It evaluates the LLM capability in terms of three dimensions including understanding, reasoning, and knowledge. Our assessment of eight open-source LLMs using Compound-QA reveals distinct patterns in their responses to compound questions, which are significantly poorer than those to non-compound questions. Additionally, we investigate various methods to enhance LLMs performance on compound questions. The results indicate that these approaches significantly improve the models' comprehension and reasoning abilities on compound questions.

### Do Large Language Models Truly Grasp Mathematics? An Empirical   Exploration From Cognitive Psychology
**Authors**: Wei Xie, Shuoyoucheng Ma, Zhenhua Wang, Enze Wang, Kai Chen, Xiaobing Sun, Baosheng Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T12:46:30Z

**Summary**: The cognitive mechanism by which Large Language Models (LLMs) solve mathematical problems remains a widely debated and unresolved issue. Currently, there is little interpretable experimental evidence that connects LLMs' problem-solving with human cognitive psychology.To determine if LLMs possess human-like mathematical reasoning, we modified the problems used in the human Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT). Our results show that, even with the use of Chains of Thought (CoT) prompts, mainstream LLMs, including the latest o1 model (noted for its reasoning capabilities), have a high error rate when solving these modified CRT problems. Specifically, the average accuracy rate dropped by up to 50% compared to the original questions.Further analysis of LLMs' incorrect answers suggests that they primarily rely on pattern matching from their training data, which aligns more with human intuition (System 1 thinking) rather than with human-like reasoning (System 2 thinking). This finding challenges the belief that LLMs have genuine mathematical reasoning abilities comparable to humans. As a result, this work may adjust overly optimistic views on LLMs' progress towards artificial general intelligence.

### An Effective Framework to Help Large Language Models Handle   Numeric-involved Long-context Tasks
**Authors**: Yijiong Yu

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T12:39:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling long texts and have almost perfect performance in traditional retrieval tasks. However, their performance significantly degrades when it comes to numerical calculations in the long-context. Numeric-involved long-context tasks typically cannot be addressed by current LLMs in normal settings due to their inherent limitations in simultaneously handling complex and massive information. Some CoT like prompting methods can improve accuracy but demands massive output tokens, which is costly and slow. To address this issue, we propose a workflow, which decompose a numeric-involved long-context task into 4 low-level subtasks: judging, extracting and processing with code and conclusion. The former 2 subtasks is relatively simple, which allows us to use smaller models for efficiently processing long context. When numerical calculations are required, we use code generated by LLMs to avoid the disadvantage of LLM not being good at calculations. The results in 2 numeric-involved long-context benchmarks demonstrate our workflow can not only improve accuracy, but also significantly reduce the cost of API calls.

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T12:23:12Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we review legal testing methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs), using the OPENAI o1 model as a case study to evaluate the performance of large models in applying legal provisions. We compare current state-of-the-art LLMs, including open-source, closed-source, and legal-specific models trained specifically for the legal domain. Systematic tests are conducted on English and Chinese legal cases, and the results are analyzed in depth. Through systematic testing of legal cases from common law systems and China, this paper explores the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in understanding and applying legal texts, reasoning through legal issues, and predicting judgments. The experimental results highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in legal applications, particularly in terms of challenges related to the interpretation of legal language and the accuracy of legal reasoning. Finally, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of various types of models, offering valuable insights and references for the future application of AI in the legal field.

### Interpretable Concept-Based Memory Reasoning
**Authors**: David Debot, Pietro Barbiero, Francesco Giannini, Gabriele Ciravegna, Michelangelo Diligenti, Giuseppe Marra

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T12:05:27Z

**Summary**: The lack of transparency in the decision-making processes of deep learning systems presents a significant challenge in modern artificial intelligence (AI), as it impairs users' ability to rely on and verify these systems. To address this challenge, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have made significant progress by incorporating human-interpretable concepts into deep learning architectures. This approach allows predictions to be traced back to specific concept patterns that users can understand and potentially intervene on. However, existing CBMs' task predictors are not fully interpretable, preventing a thorough analysis and any form of formal verification of their decision-making process prior to deployment, thereby raising significant reliability concerns. To bridge this gap, we introduce Concept-based Memory Reasoner (CMR), a novel CBM designed to provide a human-understandable and provably-verifiable task prediction process. Our approach is to model each task prediction as a neural selection mechanism over a memory of learnable logic rules, followed by a symbolic evaluation of the selected rule. The presence of an explicit memory and the symbolic evaluation allow domain experts to inspect and formally verify the validity of certain global properties of interest for the task prediction process. Experimental results demonstrate that CMR achieves better accuracy-interpretability trade-offs to state-of-the-art CBMs, discovers logic rules consistent with ground truths, allows for rule interventions, and allows pre-deployment verification.

### Prompting and Fine-tuning Large Language Models for Automated Code   Review Comment Generation
**Authors**: Md. Asif Haider, Ayesha Binte Mostofa, Sk. Sabit Bin Mosaddek, Anindya Iqbal, Toufique Ahmed

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T12:01:38Z

**Summary**: Generating accurate code review comments remains a significant challenge due to the inherently diverse and non-unique nature of the task output. Large language models pretrained on both programming and natural language data tend to perform well in code-oriented tasks. However, large-scale pretraining is not always feasible due to its environmental impact and project-specific generalizability issues. In this work, first we fine-tune open-source Large language models (LLM) in parameter-efficient, quantized low-rank (QLoRA) fashion on consumer-grade hardware to improve review comment generation. Recent studies demonstrate the efficacy of augmenting semantic metadata information into prompts to boost performance in other code-related tasks. To explore this in code review activities, we also prompt proprietary, closed-source LLMs augmenting the input code patch with function call graphs and code summaries. Both of our strategies improve the review comment generation performance, with function call graph augmented few-shot prompting on the GPT-3.5 model surpassing the pretrained baseline by around 90% BLEU-4 score on the CodeReviewer dataset. Moreover, few-shot prompted Gemini-1.0 Pro, QLoRA fine-tuned Code Llama and Llama 3.1 models achieve competitive results (ranging from 25% to 83% performance improvement) on this task. An additional human evaluation study further validates our experimental findings, reflecting real-world developers' perceptions of LLM-generated code review comments based on relevant qualitative metrics.

### Communication Compression for Tensor Parallel LLM Inference
**Authors**: Jan Hansen-Palmus, Michael Truong Le, Oliver Hausdörfer, Alok Verma

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T10:47:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have pushed the frontier of artificial intelligence but are comprised of hundreds of billions of parameters and operations. For faster inference latency, LLMs are deployed on multiple hardware accelerators through various Model Parallelism strategies. Our paper looks into the details on one such strategy - Tensor Parallel - and proposes to reduce latency by compressing inter-accelerator communication. We leverage fine grained quantization techniques to compress selected activations by 3.5 - 4.5x. Our proposed method leads up to 2x reduction of time-to-first-token (TTFT) with negligible model performance degradation.

**Authors**: Wang Qun, Liu Yang, Lin Qingquan, Jiang Ling

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T10:01:52Z

**Summary**: We introduce Xmodel-1.5, a novel 1-billion-parameter multilingual large model pretrained on approximately 2 trillion tokens. The model demonstrates strong performance across several languages, with particularly notable results in Thai, Arabic, and French, alongside its effectiveness in Chinese and English. In addition, we contribute to the research community by releasing a Thai evaluation dataset, which includes hundreds of questions annotated by students from Chulalongkorn University's School of Integrated Innovation. While the results are promising, we acknowledge that there is still room for improvement. We hope this work advances ongoing efforts in multilingual AI research and promotes better cross-linguistic understanding in various natural language processing tasks. Our models and code are publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/XiaoduoAILab/XmodelLM.

### Understanding The Effect Of Temperature On Alignment With Human Opinions
**Authors**: Maja Pavlovic, Massimo Poesio

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T09:50:27Z

**Summary**: With the increasing capabilities of LLMs, recent studies focus on understanding whose opinions are represented by them and how to effectively extract aligned opinion distributions. We conducted an empirical analysis of three straightforward methods for obtaining distributions and evaluated the results across a variety of metrics. Our findings suggest that sampling and log-probability approaches with simple parameter adjustments can return better aligned outputs in subjective tasks compared to direct prompting. Yet, assuming models reflect human opinions may be limiting, highlighting the need for further research on how human subjectivity affects model uncertainty.

### Layer Importance and Hallucination Analysis in Large Language Models via   Enhanced Activation Variance-Sparsity
**Authors**: Zichen Song, Sitan Huang, Yuxin Wu, Zhongfeng Kang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T09:33:47Z

**Summary**: Evaluating the importance of different layers in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for optimizing model performance and interpretability. This paper first explores layer importance using the Activation Variance-Sparsity Score (AVSS), which combines normalized activation variance and sparsity to quantify each layer's contribution to overall model performance. By ranking layers based on AVSS and pruning the least impactful 25\%, our experiments on tasks such as question answering, language modeling, and sentiment classification show that over 90\% of the original performance is retained, highlighting potential redundancies in LLM architectures. Building on AVSS, we propose an enhanced version tailored to assess hallucination propensity across layers (EAVSS). This improved approach introduces Hallucination-Specific Activation Variance (HSAV) and Hallucination-Specific Sparsity (HSS) metrics, allowing precise identification of hallucination-prone layers. By incorporating contrastive learning on these layers, we effectively mitigate hallucination generation, contributing to more robust and efficient LLMs(The maximum performance improvement is 12\%). Our results on the NQ, SciQ, TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and WikiQA datasets demonstrate the efficacy of this method, offering a comprehensive framework for both layer importance evaluation and hallucination mitigation in LLMs.

### KuaiFormer: Transformer-Based Retrieval at Kuaishou
**Authors**: Chi Liu, Jiangxia Cao, Rui Huang, Kai Zheng, Qiang Luo, Kun Gai, Guorui Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T09:20:46Z

**Summary**: In large-scale content recommendation systems, retrieval serves as the initial stage in the pipeline, responsible for selecting thousands of candidate items from billions of options to pass on to ranking modules. Traditionally, the dominant retrieval method has been Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) dual-tower structure. However, applying transformer in retrieval tasks has been the focus of recent research, though real-world industrial deployment still presents significant challenges. In this paper, we introduce KuaiFormer, a novel transformer-based retrieval framework deployed in a large-scale content recommendation system. KuaiFormer fundamentally redefines the retrieval process by shifting from conventional score estimation tasks (such as click-through rate estimate) to a transformer-driven Next Action Prediction paradigm. This shift enables more effective real-time interest acquisition and multi-interest extraction, significantly enhancing retrieval performance. KuaiFormer has been successfully integrated into Kuaishou App's short-video recommendation system since May 2024, serving over 400 million daily active users and resulting in a marked increase in average daily usage time of Kuaishou users. We provide insights into both the technical and business aspects of deploying transformer in large-scale recommendation systems, addressing practical challenges encountered during industrial implementation. Our findings offer valuable guidance for engineers and researchers aiming to leverage transformer models to optimize large-scale content recommendation systems.

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T09:17:40Z

**Summary**: Climate change poses an urgent global threat, needing the rapid identification and deployment of innovative solutions. We hypothesise that many of these solutions already exist within scientific literature but remain underutilised. To address this gap, this study employs a curated dataset sourced from OpenAlex, a comprehensive repository of scientific papers. Utilising Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT4-o from OpenAI, we evaluate title-abstract pairs from scientific papers on seven dimensions, covering climate change mitigation potential, stage of technological development, and readiness for deployment. The outputs of the language models are then compared with human evaluations to assess their effectiveness in identifying promising yet overlooked climate innovations. Our findings suggest that these LLM-based models can effectively augment human expertise, uncovering climate solutions that are potentially impactful but with far greater speed, throughput and consistency. Here, we focused on UK-based solutions, but the workflow is region-agnostic. This work contributes to the discovery of neglected innovations in scientific literature and demonstrates the potential of AI in enhancing climate action strategies.

### VMID: A Multimodal Fusion LLM Framework for Detecting and Identifying   Misinformation of Short Videos
**Authors**: Weihao Zhong, Yinhao Xiao, Minghui Xu, Xiuzhen Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T08:20:26Z

**Summary**: Short video platforms have become important channels for news dissemination, offering a highly engaging and immediate way for users to access current events and share information. However, these platforms have also emerged as significant conduits for the rapid spread of misinformation, as fake news and rumors can leverage the visual appeal and wide reach of short videos to circulate extensively among audiences. Existing fake news detection methods mainly rely on single-modal information, such as text or images, or apply only basic fusion techniques, limiting their ability to handle the complex, multi-layered information inherent in short videos. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel fake news detection method based on multimodal information, designed to identify misinformation through a multi-level analysis of video content. This approach effectively utilizes different modal representations to generate a unified textual description, which is then fed into a large language model for comprehensive evaluation. The proposed framework successfully integrates multimodal features within videos, significantly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of fake news detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy, robustness, and utilization of multimodal information, achieving an accuracy of 90.93%, which is significantly higher than the best baseline model (SV-FEND) at 81.05%. Furthermore, case studies provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of the approach in accurately distinguishing between fake news, debunking content, and real incidents, highlighting its reliability and robustness in real-world applications.

### Information Extraction from Clinical Notes: Are We Ready to Switch to   Large Language Models?
**Authors**: Yan Hu, Xu Zuo, Yujia Zhou, Xueqing Peng, Jimin Huang, Vipina K. Keloth, Vincent J. Zhang, Ruey-Ling Weng, Qingyu Chen, Xiaoqian Jiang, Kirk E. Roberts, Hua Xu

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T07:54:19Z

**Summary**: Backgrounds: Information extraction (IE) is critical in clinical natural language processing (NLP). While large language models (LLMs) excel on generative tasks, their performance on extractive tasks remains debated. Methods: We investigated Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) using 1,588 clinical notes from four sources (UT Physicians, MTSamples, MIMIC-III, and i2b2). We developed an annotated corpus covering 4 clinical entities and 16 modifiers, and compared instruction-tuned LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 against BiomedBERT in terms of performance, generalizability, computational resources, and throughput to BiomedBERT. Results: LLaMA models outperformed BiomedBERT across datasets. With sufficient training data, LLaMA showed modest improvements (1% on NER, 1.5-3.7% on RE); improvements were larger with limited training data. On unseen i2b2 data, LLaMA-3-70B outperformed BiomedBERT by 7% (F1) on NER and 4% on RE. However, LLaMA models required more computing resources and ran up to 28 times slower. We implemented "Kiwi," a clinical IE package featuring both models, available at https://kiwi.clinicalnlp.org/. Conclusion: This study is among the first to develop and evaluate a comprehensive clinical IE system using open-source LLMs. Results indicate that LLaMA models outperform BiomedBERT for clinical NER and RE but with higher computational costs and lower throughputs. These findings highlight that choosing between LLMs and traditional deep learning methods for clinical IE applications should remain task-specific, taking into account both performance metrics and practical considerations such as available computing resources and the intended use case scenarios.

### Orca: Enhancing Role-Playing Abilities of Large Language Models by   Integrating Personality Traits
**Authors**: Yuxuan Huang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T07:35:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models has catalyzed the development of personalized dialogue systems, numerous role-playing conversational agents have emerged. While previous research predominantly focused on enhancing the model's capability to follow instructions by designing character profiles, neglecting the psychological factors that drive human conversations. In this paper, we propose Orca, a framework for data processing and training LLMs of custom characters by integrating personality traits. Orca comprises four stages: (1) Personality traits inferring, leverage LLMs to infer user's BigFive personality trait reports and scores. (2) Data Augment, simulate user's profile, background story, and psychological activities. (3) Dataset construction, personality-conditioned instruction prompting (PCIP) to stimulate LLMs. (4) Modeling and Training, personality-conditioned instruction tuning (PTIT and PSIT), using the generated data to enhance existing open-source LLMs. We introduce OrcaBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the quality of content generated by LLMs on social platforms across multiple scales. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves superior performance on this benchmark, demonstrating its excellence and effectiveness in perceiving personality traits that significantly improve role-playing abilities. Our Code is available at https://github.com/Aipura/Orca.

### Hyper-multi-step: The Truth Behind Difficult Long-context Tasks
**Authors**: Yijiong Yu, Ma Xiufa, Fang Jianwei, Zhi Xu, Su Guangyao, Wang Jiancheng, Yongfeng Huang, Zhixiao Qi, Wei Wang, Weifeng Liu, Ran Chen, Ji Pei

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T07:07:38Z

**Summary**: Long-context language models (LCLM), characterized by their extensive context window, is becoming increasingly popular. Meanwhile, many long-context benchmarks present challenging tasks that even the most advanced LCLMs struggle to complete. However, the underlying sources of various challenging long-context tasks have seldom been studied. To bridge this gap, we conduct experiments to indicate their difficulty stems primarily from two basic issues: "multi-matching retrieval," which requires the simultaneous retrieval of multiple items, and "logic-based retrieval," which necessitates logical judgment within retrieval criteria. These two problems, while seemingly straightforward, actually exceed the capabilities of LCLMs because they are proven to be hyper-multi-step (demanding numerous steps to solve) in nature. This finding could explain why LLMs struggle with more advanced long-context tasks, providing a more accurate perspective for rethinking solutions for them.

### Evaluating and Enhancing Large Language Models for Conversational   Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs
**Authors**: Yuxuan Huang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T06:48:58Z

**Summary**: The development of large language models (LLMs) has been catalyzed by advancements in pre-training techniques. These models have demonstrated robust reasoning capabilities through manually designed prompts. In this work, we evaluate the conversational reasoning capabilities of the current state-of-the-art LLM (GPT-4) on knowledge graphs (KGs). However, the performance of LLMs is constrained due to a lack of KG environment awareness and the difficulties in developing effective optimization mechanisms for intermediary reasoning stages. We further introduce LLM-ARK, a LLM grounded KG reasoning agent designed to deliver precise and adaptable predictions on KG paths. LLM-ARK leverages Full Textual Environment (FTE) prompt to assimilate state information within each reasoning step. We reframe the challenge of multi-hop reasoning on the KG as a sequential decision-making task. Utilizing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) online policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm, our model is optimized to learn from rich reward signals. Additionally, we conduct an evaluation of our model and GPT-4 on the OpenDialKG dataset. The experimental results reveal that LLaMA-2-7B-ARK outperforms the current state-of-the-art model by 5.28 percentage points, with a performance rate of 36.39% on the target@1 evaluation metric. Meanwhile, GPT-4 scored 14.91%, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/Aipura/LLM-ARK) for further access.

### HistoLens: An LLM-Powered Framework for Multi-Layered Analysis of   Historical Texts -- A Case Application of Yantie Lun
**Authors**: Yifan Zeng

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T06:21:13Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes HistoLens, a multi-layered analysis framework for historical texts based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Using the important Western Han dynasty text "Yantie Lun" as a case study, we demonstrate the framework's potential applications in historical research and education. HistoLens integrates NLP technology (especially LLMs), including named entity recognition, knowledge graph construction, and geographic information visualization. The paper showcases how HistoLens explores Western Han culture in "Yantie Lun" through multi-dimensional, visual, and quantitative methods, focusing particularly on the influence of Confucian and Legalist thoughts on political, economic, military, and ethnic. We also demonstrate how HistoLens constructs a machine teaching scenario using LLMs for explainable analysis, based on a dataset of Confucian and Legalist ideas extracted with LLM assistance. This approach offers novel and diverse perspectives for studying historical texts like "Yantie Lun" and provides new auxiliary tools for history education. The framework aims to equip historians and learners with LLM-assisted tools to facilitate in-depth, multi-layered analysis of historical texts and foster innovation in historical education.

### Experiences from Using LLMs for Repository Mining Studies in Empirical   Software Engineering
**Authors**: Vincenzo de Martino, Joel Castaño, Fabio Palomba, Xavier Franch, Silverio Martínez-Fernández

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T06:08:57Z

**Summary**: Context: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly transformed Software Engineering (SE) by providing innovative methods for analyzing software repositories. Objectives: Our objective is to establish a practical framework for future SE researchers needing to enhance the data collection and dataset while conducting software repository mining studies using LLMs. Method: This experience report shares insights from two previous repository mining studies, focusing on the methodologies used for creating, refining, and validating prompts that enhance the output of LLMs, particularly in the context of data collection in empirical studies.

### Large Language Models as User-Agents for Evaluating   Task-Oriented-Dialogue Systems
**Authors**: Taaha Kazi, Ruiliang Lyu, Sizhe Zhou, Dilek Hakkani-Tur, Gokhan Tur

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T06:05:45Z

**Summary**: Traditionally, offline datasets have been used to evaluate task-oriented dialogue (TOD) models. These datasets lack context awareness, making them suboptimal benchmarks for conversational systems. In contrast, user-agents, which are context-aware, can simulate the variability and unpredictability of human conversations, making them better alternatives as evaluators. Prior research has utilized large language models (LLMs) to develop user-agents. Our work builds upon this by using LLMs to create user-agents for the evaluation of TOD systems. This involves prompting an LLM, using in-context examples as guidance, and tracking the user-goal state. Our evaluation of diversity and task completion metrics for the user-agents shows improved performance with the use of better prompts. Additionally, we propose methodologies for the automatic evaluation of TOD models within this dynamic framework.

**Authors**: Taewook Kim, Dhruv Agarwal, Jordan Ackerman, Manaswi Saha

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T05:55:23Z

**Summary**: Digital media platforms (e.g., social media, science blogs) offer opportunities to communicate scientific content to general audiences at scale. However, these audiences vary in their scientific expertise, literacy levels, and personal backgrounds, making effective science communication challenging. To address this challenge, we designed TranSlider, an AI-powered tool that generates personalized translations of scientific text based on individual user profiles (e.g., hobbies, location, and education). Our tool features an interactive slider that allows users to steer the degree of personalization from 0 (weakly relatable) to 100 (strongly relatable), leveraging LLMs to generate the translations with given degrees. Through an exploratory study with 15 participants, we investigated both the utility of these AI-personalized translations and how interactive reading features influenced users' understanding and reading experiences. We found that participants who preferred higher degrees of personalization appreciated the relatable and contextual translations, while those who preferred lower degrees valued concise translations with subtle contextualization. Furthermore, participants reported the compounding effect of multiple translations on their understanding of scientific content. Given these findings, we discuss several implications of AI-personalized translation tools in facilitating communication in collaborative contexts.

**Authors**: Sneihil Gopal, David Griffith, Richard A. Rouil, Chunmei Liu

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T05:08:56Z

**Summary**: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) initiative, characterized by open interfaces and AI/ML-capable RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), facilitates effective spectrum sharing among RANs. In this context, we introduce AdapShare, an ORAN-compatible solution leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL) for intent-based spectrum management, with the primary goal of minimizing resource surpluses or deficits in RANs. By employing RL agents, AdapShare intelligently learns network demand patterns and uses them to allocate resources. We demonstrate the efficacy of AdapShare in the spectrum sharing scenario between LTE and NR networks, incorporating real-world LTE resource usage data and synthetic NR usage data to demonstrate its practical use. We use the average surplus or deficit and fairness index to measure the system's performance in various scenarios. AdapShare outperforms a quasi-static resource allocation scheme based on long-term network demand statistics, particularly when available resources are scarce or exceed the aggregate demand from the networks. Lastly, we present a high-level O-RAN compatible architecture using RL agents, which demonstrates the seamless integration of AdapShare into real-world deployment scenarios.

**Authors**: Thang M. Pham, Phat T. Nguyen, Seunghyun Yoon, Viet Dac Lai, Franck Dernoncourt, Trung Bui

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T04:44:34Z

**Summary**: While small language models (SLMs) show promises for mobile deployment, their real-world performance and applications on smartphones remains underexplored. We present SlimLM, a series of SLMs optimized for document assistance tasks on mobile devices. Through extensive experiments on a Samsung Galaxy S24, we identify the optimal trade-offs between model size (ranging from 125M to 7B parameters), context length, and inference time for efficient on-device processing. SlimLM is pre-trained on SlimPajama-627B and fine-tuned on DocAssist, our constructed dataset for summarization, question answering and suggestion tasks. Our smallest model demonstrates efficient performance on S24, while larger variants offer enhanced capabilities within mobile constraints. We evaluate SlimLM against existing SLMs, showing comparable or superior performance and offering a benchmark for future research in on-device language models. We also provide an Android application, offering practical insights into SLM deployment. Our findings provide valuable insights and illuminate the capabilities of running advanced language models on high-end smartphones, potentially reducing server costs and enhancing privacy through on-device processing.

### A Dynamic LLM-Powered Agent Network for Task-Oriented Agent   Collaboration
**Authors**: Zijun Liu, Yanzhe Zhang, Peng Li, Yang Liu, Diyi Yang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T04:30:04Z

**Summary**: Recent studies show that collaborating multiple large language model (LLM) powered agents is a promising way for task solving. However, current approaches are constrained by using a fixed number of agents and static communication structures. In this work, we propose automatically selecting a team of agents from candidates to collaborate in a dynamic communication structure toward different tasks and domains. Specifically, we build a framework named Dynamic LLM-Powered Agent Network ($\textbf{DyLAN}$) for LLM-powered agent collaboration, operating a two-stage paradigm: (1) Team Optimization and (2) Task Solving. During the first stage, we utilize an $\textit{agent selection}$ algorithm, based on an unsupervised metric called $\textit{Agent Importance Score}$, enabling the selection of best agents according to their contributions in a preliminary trial, oriented to the given task. Then, in the second stage, the selected agents collaborate dynamically according to the query. Empirically, we demonstrate that DyLAN outperforms strong baselines in code generation, decision-making, general reasoning, and arithmetic reasoning tasks with moderate computational cost. On specific subjects in MMLU, selecting a team of agents in the team optimization stage improves accuracy by up to 25.0% in DyLAN.

### Refined and Segmented Price Sentiment Indices from Survey Comments
**Authors**: Masahiro Suzuki, Hiroki Sakaji

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T04:22:21Z

**Summary**: We aim to enhance a price sentiment index and to more precisely understand price trends from the perspective of not only consumers but also businesses. We extract comments related to prices from the Economy Watchers Survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan and classify price trends using a large language model (LLM). We classify whether the survey sample reflects the perspective of consumers or businesses, and whether the comments pertain to goods or services by utilizing information on the fields of comments and the industries of respondents included in the Economy Watchers Survey. From these classified price-related comments, we construct price sentiment indices not only for a general purpose but also for more specific objectives by combining perspectives on consumers and prices, as well as goods and services. It becomes possible to achieve a more accurate classification of price directions by employing a LLM for classification. Furthermore, integrating the outputs of multiple LLMs suggests the potential for the better performance of the classification. The use of more accurately classified comments allows for the construction of an index with a higher correlation to existing indices than previous studies. We demonstrate that the correlation of the price index for consumers, which has a larger sample size, is further enhanced by selecting comments for aggregation based on the industry of the survey respondents.

### BAdam: A Memory Efficient Full Parameter Optimization Method for Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Qijun Luo, Hengxu Yu, Xiao Li

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T04:17:35Z

**Summary**: This work presents BAdam, an optimization method that leverages the block coordinate descent (BCD) framework with Adam's update rule. BAdam offers a memory efficient approach to the full parameter finetuning of large language models. We conduct a theoretical convergence analysis for BAdam in the deterministic case. Experimentally, we apply BAdam to finetune the Llama 3-8B and Llama 3-70B models using a single RTX3090-24GB GPU and 4 A100-80GB GPUs, respectively. The results confirm BAdam's efficiency in terms of memory usage, running time, and optimization capability. Furthermore, the downstream performance evaluation based on MT-bench and math benchmarks shows that BAdam outperforms existing memory efficient baselines such as LoRA. It also demonstrates that BAdam can achieve comparable or even superior performance compared to Adam. Finally, the ablation study using SGD's update rule illustrates the suitability of BCD for finetuning LLMs. Our code can be easily integrated into any PyTorch-based codebase and is available at https://github.com/Ledzy/BAdam.

### JRadiEvo: A Japanese Radiology Report Generation Model Enhanced by   Evolutionary Optimization of Model Merging
**Authors**: Kaito Baba, Ryota Yagi, Junichiro Takahashi, Risa Kishikawa, Satoshi Kodera

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T04:16:50Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), foundational models (FMs) have seen significant advancements. Healthcare is one of the most crucial application areas for these FMs, given the significant time and effort required for physicians to analyze large volumes of patient data. Recent efforts have focused on adapting multimodal FMs to the medical domain through techniques like instruction-tuning, leading to the development of medical foundation models (MFMs). However, these approaches typically require large amounts of training data to effectively adapt models to the medical field. Moreover, most existing models are trained on English datasets, limiting their practicality in non-English-speaking regions where healthcare professionals and patients are not always fluent in English. The need for translation introduces additional costs and inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{J}apanese \textbf{Radi}ology report generation model enhanced by \textbf{Evo}lutionary optimization of model merging (JRadiEvo). This is the first attempt to extend a non-medical vision-language foundation model to the medical domain through evolutionary optimization of model merging. We successfully created a model that generates accurate Japanese reports from X-ray images using only 50 translated samples from publicly available data. This model, developed with highly efficient use of limited data, outperformed leading models from recent research trained on much larger datasets. Additionally, with only 8 billion parameters, this relatively compact foundation model can be deployed locally within hospitals, making it a practical solution for environments where APIs and other external services cannot be used due to strict privacy and security requirements.

### Effective Generative AI: The Human-Algorithm Centaur
**Authors**: Soroush Saghafian, Lihi Idan

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T03:48:07Z

**Summary**: Advanced analytics science methods have enabled combining the power of artificial and human intelligence, creating \textit{centaurs} that allow superior decision-making. Centaurs are hybrid human-algorithm models that combine both formal analytics and human intuition in a symbiotic manner within their learning and reasoning process. We argue that the future of AI development and use in many domains needs to focus more on centaurs as opposed to other AI approaches. This paradigm shift towards centaur-based AI methods raises some fundamental questions: How are centaurs different from other human-in-the-loop methods? What are the most effective methods for creating centaurs? When should centaurs be used, and when should the lead be given to pure AI models? Doesn't the incorporation of human intuition -- which at times can be misleading -- in centaurs' decision-making process degrade its performance compared to pure AI methods? This work aims to address these fundamental questions, focusing on recent advancements in generative AI, and especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), as a main case study to illustrate centaurs' critical essentiality to future AI endeavors.

### Motion-Grounded Video Reasoning: Understanding and Perceiving Motion at   Pixel Level
**Authors**: Andong Deng, Tongjia Chen, Shoubin Yu, Taojiannan Yang, Lincoln Spencer, Yapeng Tian, Ajmal Saeed Mian, Mohit Bansal, Chen Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T03:45:09Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce Motion-Grounded Video Reasoning, a new motion understanding task that requires generating visual answers (video segmentation masks) according to the input question, and hence needs implicit spatiotemporal reasoning and grounding. This task extends existing spatiotemporal grounding work focusing on explicit action/motion grounding, to a more general format by enabling implicit reasoning via questions. To facilitate the development of the new task, we collect a large-scale dataset called GROUNDMORE, which comprises 1,715 video clips, 249K object masks that are deliberately designed with 4 question types (Causal, Sequential, Counterfactual, and Descriptive) for benchmarking deep and comprehensive motion reasoning abilities. GROUNDMORE uniquely requires models to generate visual answers, providing a more concrete and visually interpretable response than plain texts. It evaluates models on both spatiotemporal grounding and reasoning, fostering to address complex challenges in motion-related video reasoning, temporal perception, and pixel-level understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a novel baseline model named Motion-Grounded Video Reasoning Assistant (MORA). MORA incorporates the multimodal reasoning ability from the Multimodal LLM, the pixel-level perception capability from the grounding model (SAM), and the temporal perception ability from a lightweight localization head. MORA achieves respectable performance on GROUNDMORE outperforming the best existing visual grounding baseline model by an average of 21.5% relatively. We hope this novel and challenging task will pave the way for future advancements in robust and general motion understanding via video reasoning segmentation

### LLMs are Imperfect, Then What? An Empirical Study on LLM Failures in   Software Engineering
**Authors**: Jiessie Tie, Bingsheng Yao, Tianshi Li, Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed, Dakuo Wang, Shurui Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T03:29:41Z

**Summary**: Software engineers are integrating AI assistants into their workflows to enhance productivity and reduce cognitive strain. However, experiences vary significantly, with some engineers finding large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, beneficial, while others consider them counterproductive. Researchers also found that ChatGPT's answers included incorrect information. Given the fact that LLMs are still imperfect, it is important to understand how to best incorporate LLMs into the workflow for software engineering (SE) task completion. Therefore, we conducted an observational study with 22 participants using ChatGPT as a coding assistant in a non-trivial SE task to understand the practices, challenges, and opportunities for using LLMs for SE tasks. We identified the cases where ChatGPT failed, their root causes, and the corresponding mitigation solutions used by users. These findings contribute to the overall understanding and strategies for human-AI interaction on SE tasks. Our study also highlights future research and tooling support directions.

### ORLM: A Customizable Framework in Training Large Models for Automated   Optimization Modeling
**Authors**: Chenyu Huang, Zhengyang Tang, Dongdong Ge, Shixi Hu, Ruoqing Jiang, Benyou Wang, Zizhuo Wang, Xin Zheng

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T03:25:40Z

**Summary**: Optimization modeling and solving play a critical role in the application of Operations Research (OR) tools to address real-world problems, yet they pose challenges and require extensive expertise from OR experts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), new opportunities have emerged to streamline and automate these tasks. However, current research predominantly relies on closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4, along with extensive prompt engineering techniques. This reliance stems from the scarcity of high-quality training datasets for optimization modeling, resulting in elevated costs, prolonged processing times, and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, our work is the first to propose a viable path for training open-source LLMs that are capable of optimization modeling as well as developing and executing solver codes, eventually leading to a superior ability for automating optimization modeling and solving. Particularly, we introduce a semi-automated data synthesis framework designed for optimization modeling issues, named OR-Instruct. This framework merges the training data requirements of large models with the unique characteristics of optimization modeling problems, and allows for customizable enhancements tailored to specific scenarios or modeling types. To evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, we present the IndustryOR benchmark, the inaugural industrial standard for evaluating LLMs in solving practical OR problems. Utilizing data synthesized through OR-Instruct, we train various open-source LLMs with a capacity of 7 billion parameters (dubbed ORLMs). The resulting model demonstrates significantly enhanced optimization modeling capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance across the NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR benchmarks. Our code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/Cardinal-Operations/ORLM}.

### How Does Vision-Language Adaptation Impact the Safety of Vision Language   Models?
**Authors**: Seongyun Lee, Geewook Kim, Jiyeon Kim, Hyunji Lee, Hoyeon Chang, Sue Hyun Park, Minjoon Seo

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T03:20:57Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language adaptation (VL adaptation) transforms Large Language Models (LLMs) into Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for multimodal tasks, but this process often compromises the inherent safety capabilities embedded in the original LLMs. Despite potential harmfulness due to weakened safety measures, in-depth analysis on the effects of VL adaptation on safety remains under-explored. This study examines how VL adaptation influences safety and evaluates the impact of safety fine-tuning methods. Our analysis reveals that safety degradation occurs during VL adaptation, even when the training data is safe. While safety tuning techniques like supervised fine-tuning with safety datasets or reinforcement learning from human feedback mitigate some risks, they still lead to safety degradation and a reduction in helpfulness due to over-rejection issues. Further analysis of internal model weights suggests that VL adaptation may impact certain safety-related layers, potentially lowering overall safety levels. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that the objectives of VL adaptation and safety tuning are divergent, which often results in their simultaneous application being suboptimal. To address this, we suggest the weight merging approach as an optimal solution effectively reducing safety degradation while maintaining helpfulness. These insights help guide the development of more reliable and secure LVLMs for real-world applications.

### A Graph-based Strategic Sensor Deployment Approach for k-coverage in WSN
**Authors**: Lakshmikanta Sau, Priyadarshi Mukherjee, Sasthi C. Ghosh

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T03:20:24Z

**Summary**: This paper studies a graph-based sensor deployment approach in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Specifically, in today's world, where sensors are everywhere, detecting various attributes like temperature and movement, their deteriorating lifetime is indeed a very concerning issue. In many scenarios, these sensors are placed in extremely remote areas, where maintenance becomes challenging. As a result, it is not very wise to depend on a single sensor to obtain data from a particular terrain or place. Hence, multiple sensors are deployed in these places, such that no problem arises if one or few of them fail. In this work, this problem of intelligent placement of sensors is modelled from the graph theoretic point of view. We propose a new sensor deployment approach here, which results in lesser sensor density per unit area and less number of sensors as compared to the existing benchmark schemes. Finally, the numerical results also support our claims and provide insights regarding the selection of parameters that enhance the system performance.

### AMXFP4: Taming Activation Outliers with Asymmetric Microscaling   Floating-Point for 4-bit LLM Inference
**Authors**: Janghwan Lee, Jiwoong Park, Jinseok Kim, Yongjik Kim, Jungju Oh, Jinwook Oh, Jungwook Choi

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T03:11:19Z

**Summary**: Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context lengths has increased the need for efficient low-bit quantization to manage their substantial computational demands. However, reducing precision to 4 bits frequently degrades performance due to activation outliers. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Microscaling 4-bit Floating-Point (AMXFP4) for efficient LLM inference. This novel data format leverages asymmetric shared scales to mitigate outliers while naturally capturing the asymmetry introduced by group-wise quantization. Unlike conventional 4-bit quantization methods that rely on data rotation and costly calibration, AMXFP4 uses asymmetric shared scales for direct 4-bit casting, achieving near-ideal quantization accuracy across various LLM tasks, including multi-turn conversations, long-context reasoning, and visual question answering. Our AMXFP4 format significantly outperforms MXFP4 and other leading quantization techniques, enabling robust, calibration-free 4-bit inference.

### LLM-assisted Explicit and Implicit Multi-interest Learning Framework for   Sequential Recommendation
**Authors**: Shutong Qiao, Chen Gao, Yong Li, Hongzhi Yin

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T02:53:36Z

**Summary**: Multi-interest modeling in current recommender systems (RS) is mainly based on user behavioral data, capturing user interest preferences from multiple dimensions. However, since behavioral data is implicit and often highly sparse, it is challenging to understand users' complex and diverse interests. Recent studies have shown that the rich semantic information in the text can effectively supplement the deficiencies of behavioral data. Despite this, it is still difficult for small models to directly extract semantic features associated with users' deep interests. That is, how to effectively align semantics with behavioral information to form a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of user interests has become a critical research problem. To address this, we propose an LLM-assisted explicit and implicit multi-interest learning framework (named EIMF) to model user interests on two levels: behavior and semantics. The framework consists of two parts: Implicit Behavioral Interest Module (IBIM) and Explicit Semantic Interest Module (ESIM). The traditional multi-interest RS model in IBIM can learn users' implicit behavioral interests from interactions with items. In ESIM, we first adopt a clustering algorithm to select typical samples and design a prompting strategy on LLM to obtain explicit semantic interests. Furthermore, in the training phase, the semantic interests of typical samples can enhance the representation learning of behavioral interests based on the multi-task learning on semantic prediction and modality alignment. Therefore, in the inference stage, accurate recommendations can be achieved with only the user's behavioral data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EIMF framework, which effectively and efficiently combines small models with LLM to improve the accuracy of multi-interest modeling.

### DriveThru: a Document Extraction Platform and Benchmark Datasets for   Indonesian Local Language Archives
**Authors**: Mohammad Rifqi Farhansyah, Muhammad Zuhdi Fikri Johari, Afinzaki Amiral, Ayu Purwarianti, Kumara Ari Yuana, Derry Tanti Wijaya

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T02:42:59Z

**Summary**: Indonesia is one of the most diverse countries linguistically. However, despite this linguistic diversity, Indonesian languages remain underrepresented in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research and technologies. In the past two years, several efforts have been conducted to construct NLP resources for Indonesian languages. However, most of these efforts have been focused on creating manual resources thus difficult to scale to more languages. Although many Indonesian languages do not have a web presence, locally there are resources that document these languages well in printed forms such as books, magazines, and newspapers. Digitizing these existing resources will enable scaling of Indonesian language resource construction to many more languages. In this paper, we propose an alternative method of creating datasets by digitizing documents, which have not previously been used to build digital language resources in Indonesia. DriveThru is a platform for extracting document content utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques in its system to provide language resource building with less manual effort and cost. This paper also studies the utility of current state-of-the-art LLM for post-OCR correction to show the capability of increasing the character accuracy rate (CAR) and word accuracy rate (WAR) compared to off-the-shelf OCR.

### Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning via Domain Adaptation and Reward   Augmented Imitation
**Authors**: Yihong Guo, Yixuan Wang, Yuanyuan Shi, Pan Xu, Anqi Liu

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T02:35:20Z

**Summary**: Training a policy in a source domain for deployment in the target domain under a dynamics shift can be challenging, often resulting in performance degradation. Previous work tackles this challenge by training on the source domain with modified rewards derived by matching distributions between the source and the target optimal trajectories. However, pure modified rewards only ensure the behavior of the learned policy in the source domain resembles trajectories produced by the target optimal policies, which does not guarantee optimal performance when the learned policy is actually deployed to the target domain. In this work, we propose to utilize imitation learning to transfer the policy learned from the reward modification to the target domain so that the new policy can generate the same trajectories in the target domain. Our approach, Domain Adaptation and Reward Augmented Imitation Learning (DARAIL), utilizes the reward modification for domain adaptation and follows the general framework of generative adversarial imitation learning from observation (GAIfO) by applying a reward augmented estimator for the policy optimization step. Theoretically, we present an error bound for our method under a mild assumption regarding the dynamics shift to justify the motivation of our method. Empirically, our method outperforms the pure modified reward method without imitation learning and also outperforms other baselines in benchmark off-dynamics environments.

### Automated Clinical Data Extraction with Knowledge Conditioned LLMs
**Authors**: Diya Li, Asim Kadav, Aijing Gao, Rui Li, Richard Bourgon

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T02:07:34Z

**Summary**: The extraction of lung lesion information from clinical and medical imaging reports is crucial for research on and clinical care of lung-related diseases. Large language models (LLMs) can be effective at interpreting unstructured text in reports, but they often hallucinate due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge, leading to reduced accuracy and posing challenges for use in clinical settings. To address this, we propose a novel framework that aligns generated internal knowledge with external knowledge through in-context learning (ICL). Our framework employs a retriever to identify relevant units of internal or external knowledge and a grader to evaluate the truthfulness and helpfulness of the retrieved internal-knowledge rules, to align and update the knowledge bases. Experiments with expert-curated test datasets demonstrate that this ICL approach can increase the F1 score for key fields (lesion size, margin and solidity) by an average of 12.9% over existing ICL methods.

**Authors**: Chin-Sung Tung, Sheng-Fu Liang, Shu-Feng Chang, Chung-Ping Young

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T01:49:17Z

**Summary**: Electroencephalography (EEG) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various neurological disorders. However, small hospitals and clinics often lack advanced EEG signal analysis systems and are prone to misinterpretation in manual EEG reading. This study proposes an innovative hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) system for automatic interpretation of EEG background activity and report generation. The system combines deep learning models for posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) prediction, unsupervised artifact removal, and expert-designed algorithms for abnormality detection. For PDR prediction, 1530 labeled EEGs were used, and the best ensemble model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.237, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.359, an accuracy of 91.8% within a 0.6Hz error, and an accuracy of 99% within a 1.2Hz error. The AI system significantly outperformed neurologists in detecting generalized background slowing (p = 0.02; F1: AI 0.93, neurologists 0.82) and demonstrated improved focal abnormality detection, although not statistically significant (p = 0.79; F1: AI 0.71, neurologists 0.55). Validation on both an internal dataset and the Temple University Abnormal EEG Corpus showed consistent performance (F1: 0.884 and 0.835, respectively; p = 0.66), demonstrating generalizability. The use of large language models (LLMs) for report generation demonstrated 100% accuracy, verified by three other independent LLMs. This hybrid AI system provides an easily scalable and accurate solution for EEG interpretation in resource-limited settings, assisting neurologists in improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing misdiagnosis rates.

### LLM-Powered AI Tutors with Personas for d/Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing   Online Learners
**Authors**: Haocong Cheng, Si Chen, Christopher Perdriau, Yun Huang

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T01:48:08Z

**Summary**: Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) using artificial intelligence (AI) technology have shown promise in supporting learners with diverse abilities; however, they often fail to meet the specific communication needs and cultural nuances needed by d/Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) learners. As large language models (LLMs) provide new opportunities to incorporate personas to AI-based tutors and support dynamic interactive dialogue, this paper explores how DHH learners perceive LLM-powered ITS with different personas and identified design suggestions for improving the interaction. We developed an interface that allows DHH learners to interact with ChatGPT and three LLM-powered AI tutors with different experiences in DHH education while the learners watch an educational video. A user study with 16 DHH participants showed that they perceived conversations with the AI tutors who had DHH education experiences to be more human-like and trustworthy due to the tutors' cultural knowledge of DHH communities. Participants also suggested providing more transparency regarding the tutors' background information to clarify each AI tutor's position within the DHH community. We discuss design implications for more inclusive LLM-based systems, such as supports for the multimodality of sign language.

### EHRMamba: Towards Generalizable and Scalable Foundation Models for   Electronic Health Records
**Authors**: Adibvafa Fallahpour, Mahshid Alinoori, Wenqian Ye, Xu Cao, Arash Afkanpour, Amrit Krishnan

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T00:24:00Z

**Summary**: Transformers have significantly advanced the modeling of Electronic Health Records (EHR), yet their deployment in real-world healthcare is limited by several key challenges. Firstly, the quadratic computational cost and insufficient context length of these models hinder hospitals' ability in processing the extensive medical histories typical in EHR data. Additionally, existing models employ separate finetuning for each clinical task, complicating maintenance in healthcare environments. Moreover, these models focus exclusively on either clinical prediction or EHR forecasting, lacking proficiency in both tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EHRMamba, a robust foundation model built on the Mamba architecture. EHRMamba can process sequences up to 300% longer than previous models due to its linear computational cost. We also introduce a novel approach to Multitask Prompted Finetuning (MPF) for EHR data, which enables EHRMamba to simultaneously learn multiple clinical tasks in a single finetuning phase, significantly enhancing deployment and cross-task generalization. Furthermore, our model leverages the HL7 FHIR data standard to simplify integration into existing hospital systems. Alongside EHRMamba, we open-source Odyssey, a toolkit designed to support the development and deployment of EHR foundation models, with an emphasis on data standardization and interpretability. Our evaluations on the MIMIC-IV dataset demonstrate that EHRMamba advances state-of-the-art performance across 6 major clinical tasks and excels in EHR forecasting, marking a significant leap forward in the field.

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T00:15:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) represent a transformative class of AI tools capable of revolutionizing various aspects of healthcare by generating human-like responses across diverse contexts and adapting to novel tasks following human instructions. Their potential application spans a broad range of medical tasks, such as clinical documentation, matching patients to clinical trials, and answering medical questions. In this primer paper, we propose an actionable guideline to help healthcare professionals more efficiently utilize LLMs in their work, along with a set of best practices. This approach consists of several main phases, including formulating the task, choosing LLMs, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and deployment. We start with the discussion of critical considerations in identifying healthcare tasks that align with the core capabilities of LLMs and selecting models based on the selected task and data, performance requirements, and model interface. We then review the strategies, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, to adapt standard LLMs to specialized medical tasks. Deployment considerations, including regulatory compliance, ethical guidelines, and continuous monitoring for fairness and bias, are also discussed. By providing a structured step-by-step methodology, this tutorial aims to equip healthcare professionals with the tools necessary to effectively integrate LLMs into clinical practice, ensuring that these powerful technologies are applied in a safe, reliable, and impactful manner.

### ConSmax: Hardware-Friendly Alternative Softmax with Learnable Parameters
**Authors**: Shiwei Liu, Guanchen Tao, Yifei Zou, Derek Chow, Zichen Fan, Kauna Lei, Bangfei Pan, Dennis Sylvester, Gregory Kielian, Mehdi Saligane

**Updated**: 2024-11-15T00:09:44Z

**Summary**: The self-attention mechanism distinguishes transformer-based large language models (LLMs) apart from convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Despite the performance improvement, achieving real-time LLM inference on silicon remains challenging due to the extensive use of Softmax in self-attention. In addition to the non-linearity, the low arithmetic intensity significantly limits processing parallelism, especially when working with longer contexts. To address this challenge, we propose Constant Softmax (ConSmax), a software-hardware co-design that serves as an efficient alternative to Softmax. ConSmax utilizes differentiable normalization parameters to eliminate the need for maximum searching and denominator summation in Softmax. This approach enables extensive parallelization while still executing the essential functions of Softmax. Moreover, a scalable ConSmax hardware design with a bitwidth-split look-up table (LUT) can achieve lossless non-linear operations and support mixed-precision computing. Experimental results show that ConSmax achieves a minuscule power consumption of 0.2mW and an area of 0.0008mm^2 at 1250MHz working frequency in 16nm FinFET technology. For open-source contribution, we further implement our design with the OpenROAD toolchain under SkyWater's 130nm CMOS technology. The corresponding power is 2.69mW and the area is 0.007mm^2. ConSmax achieves 3.35x power savings and 2.75x area savings in 16nm technology, and 3.15x power savings and 4.14x area savings with the open-source EDA toolchain. In the meantime, it also maintains comparable accuracy on the GPT-2 model and the WikiText103 dataset. The project is available at https://github.com/ReaLLMASIC/ConSmax

### Dense Connector for MLLMs
**Authors**: Huanjin Yao, Wenhao Wu, Taojiannan Yang, YuXin Song, Mengxi Zhang, Haocheng Feng, Yifan Sun, Zhiheng Li, Wanli Ouyang, Jingdong Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T23:53:05Z

**Summary**: Do we fully leverage the potential of visual encoder in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)? The recent outstanding performance of MLLMs in multimodal understanding has garnered broad attention from both academia and industry. In the current MLLM rat race, the focus seems to be predominantly on the linguistic side. We witness the rise of larger and higher-quality instruction datasets, as well as the involvement of larger-sized LLMs. Yet, scant attention has been directed towards the visual signals utilized by MLLMs, often assumed to be the final high-level features extracted by a frozen visual encoder. In this paper, we introduce the Dense Connector - a simple, effective, and plug-and-play vision-language connector that significantly enhances existing MLLMs by leveraging multi-layer visual features, with minimal additional computational overhead. Building on this, we also propose the Efficient Dense Connector, which achieves performance comparable to LLaVA-v1.5 with only 25% of the visual tokens. Furthermore, our model, trained solely on images, showcases remarkable zero-shot capabilities in video understanding as well. Experimental results across various vision encoders, image resolutions, training dataset scales, varying sizes of LLMs (2.7B->70B), and diverse architectures of MLLMs (e.g., LLaVA-v1.5, LLaVA-NeXT and Mini-Gemini) validate the versatility and scalability of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 19 image and video benchmarks. We hope that this work will provide valuable experience and serve as a basic module for future MLLM development. Code is available at https://github.com/HJYao00/DenseConnector .

**Authors**: Sanghyun Byun, Kayvan Shah, Ayushi Gang, Christopher Apton, Jacob Song, Woo Seong Chung

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T23:11:45Z

**Summary**: Many state-of-the-art computer vision architectures leverage U-Net for its adaptability and efficient feature extraction. However, the multi-resolution convolutional design often leads to significant computational demands, limiting deployment on edge devices. We present a streamlined alternative: a 1D convolutional encoder that retains accuracy while enhancing its suitability for edge applications. Our novel encoder architecture achieves semantic segmentation through channel-wise 1D convolutions combined with pixel-unshuffle operations. By incorporating PixelShuffle, known for improving accuracy in super-resolution tasks while reducing computational load, OneNet captures spatial relationships without requiring 2D convolutions, reducing parameters by up to 47%. Additionally, we explore a fully 1D encoder-decoder that achieves a 71% reduction in size, albeit with some accuracy loss. We benchmark our approach against U-Net variants across diverse mask-generation tasks, demonstrating that it preserves accuracy effectively. Although focused on image segmentation, this architecture is adaptable to other convolutional applications. Code for the project is available at https://github.com/shbyun080/OneNet .

### Real-time Adapting Routing (RAR): Improving Efficiency Through   Continuous Learning in Software Powered by Layered Foundation Models
**Authors**: Kirill Vasilevski, Dayi Lin, Ahmed Hassan

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T23:02:30Z

**Summary**: To balance the quality and inference cost of a Foundation Model (FM, such as large language models (LLMs)) powered software, people often opt to train a routing model that routes requests to FMs with different sizes and capabilities. Existing routing models rely on learning the optimal routing decision from carefully curated data, require complex computations to be updated, and do not consider the potential evolution of weaker FMs. In this paper, we propose Real-time Adaptive Routing (RAR), an approach to continuously adapt FM routing decisions while using guided in-context learning to enhance the capabilities of weaker FM. The goal is to reduce reliance on stronger, more expensive FMs. We evaluate our approach on different subsets of the popular MMLU benchmark. Over time, our approach routes 50.2% fewer requests to computationally expensive models while maintaining around 90.5% of the general response quality. In addition, the guides generated from stronger models have shown intra-domain generalization and led to a better quality of responses compared to an equivalent approach with a standalone weaker FM.

### A Benchmark for Long-Form Medical Question Answering
**Authors**: Pedram Hosseini, Jessica M. Sin, Bing Ren, Bryceton G. Thomas, Elnaz Nouri, Ali Farahanchi, Saeed Hassanpour

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T22:54:38Z

**Summary**: There is a lack of benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in long-form medical question answering (QA). Most existing medical QA evaluation benchmarks focus on automatic metrics and multiple-choice questions. While valuable, these benchmarks fail to fully capture or assess the complexities of real-world clinical applications where LLMs are being deployed. Furthermore, existing studies on evaluating long-form answer generation in medical QA are primarily closed-source, lacking access to human medical expert annotations, which makes it difficult to reproduce results and enhance existing baselines. In this work, we introduce a new publicly available benchmark featuring real-world consumer medical questions with long-form answer evaluations annotated by medical doctors. We performed pairwise comparisons of responses from various open and closed-source medical and general-purpose LLMs based on criteria such as correctness, helpfulness, harmfulness, and bias. Additionally, we performed a comprehensive LLM-as-a-judge analysis to study the alignment between human judgments and LLMs. Our preliminary results highlight the strong potential of open LLMs in medical QA compared to leading closed models.

### CLIMB: A Benchmark of Clinical Bias in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yubo Zhang, Shudi Hou, Mingyu Derek Ma, Wei Wang, Muhao Chen, Jieyu Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T22:51:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to clinical decision-making. However, their potential to exhibit bias poses significant risks to clinical equity. Currently, there is a lack of benchmarks that systematically evaluate such clinical bias in LLMs. While in downstream tasks, some biases of LLMs can be avoided such as by instructing the model to answer "I'm not sure...", the internal bias hidden within the model still lacks deep studies. We introduce CLIMB (shorthand for A Benchmark of Clinical Bias in Large Language Models), a pioneering comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both intrinsic (within LLMs) and extrinsic (on downstream tasks) bias in LLMs for clinical decision tasks. Notably, for intrinsic bias, we introduce a novel metric, AssocMAD, to assess the disparities of LLMs across multiple demographic groups. Additionally, we leverage counterfactual intervention to evaluate extrinsic bias in a task of clinical diagnosis prediction. Our experiments across popular and medically adapted LLMs, particularly from the Mistral and LLaMA families, unveil prevalent behaviors with both intrinsic and extrinsic bias. This work underscores the critical need to mitigate clinical bias and sets a new standard for future evaluations of LLMs' clinical bias.

### Evaluating Gender Bias in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Michael Döll, Markus Döhring, Andreas Müller

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T22:23:13Z

**Summary**: Gender bias in artificial intelligence has become an important issue, particularly in the context of language models used in communication-oriented applications. This study examines the extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit gender bias in pronoun selection in occupational contexts. The analysis evaluates the models GPT-4, GPT-4o, PaLM 2 Text Bison and Gemini 1.0 Pro using a self-generated dataset. The jobs considered include a range of occupations, from those with a significant male presence to those with a notable female concentration, as well as jobs with a relatively equal gender distribution. Three different sentence processing methods were used to assess potential gender bias: masked tokens, unmasked sentences, and sentence completion. In addition, the LLMs suggested names of individuals in specific occupations, which were then examined for gender distribution. The results show a positive correlation between the models' pronoun choices and the gender distribution present in U.S. labor force data. Female pronouns were more often associated with female-dominated occupations, while male pronouns were more often associated with male-dominated occupations. Sentence completion showed the strongest correlation with actual gender distribution, while name generation resulted in a more balanced 'politically correct' gender distribution, albeit with notable variations in predominantly male or female occupations. Overall, the prompting method had a greater impact on gender distribution than the model selection itself, highlighting the complexity of addressing gender bias in LLMs. The findings highlight the importance of prompting in gender mapping.

### Security and Privacy Challenges of Large Language Models: A Survey
**Authors**: Badhan Chandra Das, M. Hadi Amini, Yanzhao Wu

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T22:20:49Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities and contributed to multiple fields, such as generating and summarizing text, language translation, and question-answering. Nowadays, LLM is becoming a very popular tool in computerized language processing tasks, with the capability to analyze complicated linguistic patterns and provide relevant and appropriate responses depending on the context. While offering significant advantages, these models are also vulnerable to security and privacy attacks, such as jailbreaking attacks, data poisoning attacks, and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leakage attacks. This survey provides a thorough review of the security and privacy challenges of LLMs for both training data and users, along with the application-based risks in various domains, such as transportation, education, and healthcare. We assess the extent of LLM vulnerabilities, investigate emerging security and privacy attacks for LLMs, and review the potential defense mechanisms. Additionally, the survey outlines existing research gaps in this domain and highlights future research directions.

### Architect: Generating Vivid and Interactive 3D Scenes with Hierarchical   2D Inpainting
**Authors**: Yian Wang, Xiaowen Qiu, Jiageng Liu, Zhehuan Chen, Jiting Cai, Yufei Wang, Tsun-Hsuan Wang, Zhou Xian, Chuang Gan

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T22:15:48Z

**Summary**: Creating large-scale interactive 3D environments is essential for the development of Robotics and Embodied AI research. Current methods, including manual design, procedural generation, diffusion-based scene generation, and large language model (LLM) guided scene design, are hindered by limitations such as excessive human effort, reliance on predefined rules or training datasets, and limited 3D spatial reasoning ability. Since pre-trained 2D image generative models better capture scene and object configuration than LLMs, we address these challenges by introducing Architect, a generative framework that creates complex and realistic 3D embodied environments leveraging diffusion-based 2D image inpainting. In detail, we utilize foundation visual perception models to obtain each generated object from the image and leverage pre-trained depth estimation models to lift the generated 2D image to 3D space. Our pipeline is further extended to a hierarchical and iterative inpainting process to continuously generate placement of large furniture and small objects to enrich the scene. This iterative structure brings the flexibility for our method to generate or refine scenes from various starting points, such as text, floor plans, or pre-arranged environments.

### Learning Parameter Sharing with Tensor Decompositions and Sparsity
**Authors**: Cem Üyük, Mike Lasby, Mohamed Yassin, Utku Evci, Yani Ioannou

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T21:29:58Z

**Summary**: Large neural networks achieve remarkable performance, but their size hinders deployment on resource-constrained devices. While various compression techniques exist, parameter sharing remains relatively unexplored. This paper introduces Fine-grained Parameter Sharing (FiPS), a novel algorithm that leverages the relationship between parameter sharing, tensor decomposition, and sparsity to efficiently compress large vision transformer models. FiPS employs a shared base and sparse factors to represent shared neurons across multi-layer perception (MLP) modules. Shared parameterization is initialized via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and optimized by minimizing block-wise reconstruction error. Experiments demonstrate that FiPS compresses DeiT-B and Swin-L MLPs to 25-40% of their original parameter count while maintaining accuracy within 1 percentage point of the original models.

### Beyond Static Tools: Evaluating Large Language Models for Cryptographic   Misuse Detection
**Authors**: Zohaib Masood, Miguel Vargas Martin

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T19:33:08Z

**Summary**: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software development is rapidly growing, with developers increasingly relying on these models for coding assistance, including security-critical tasks. Our work presents a comprehensive comparison between traditional static analysis tools for cryptographic API misuse detection-CryptoGuard, CogniCrypt, and Snyk Code-and the LLMs-GPT and Gemini. Using benchmark datasets (OWASP, CryptoAPI, and MASC), we evaluate the effectiveness of each tool in identifying cryptographic misuses. Our findings show that GPT 4-o-mini surpasses current state-of-the-art static analysis tools on the CryptoAPI and MASC datasets, though it lags on the OWASP dataset. Additionally, we assess the quality of LLM responses to determine which models provide actionable and accurate advice, giving developers insights into their practical utility for secure coding. This study highlights the comparative strengths and limitations of static analysis versus LLM-driven approaches, offering valuable insights into the evolving role of AI in advancing software security practices.

### Evaluating the Predictive Capacity of ChatGPT for Academic Peer Review   Outcomes Across Multiple Platforms
**Authors**: Mike Thelwall, Abdullah Yaghi

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T19:20:33Z

**Summary**: While previous studies have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can predict peer review outcomes to some extent, this paper builds on that by introducing two new contexts and employing a more robust method - averaging multiple ChatGPT scores. The findings that averaging 30 ChatGPT predictions, based on reviewer guidelines and using only the submitted titles and abstracts, failed to predict peer review outcomes for F1000Research (Spearman's rho=0.00). However, it produced mostly weak positive correlations with the quality dimensions of SciPost Physics (rho=0.25 for validity, rho=0.25 for originality, rho=0.20 for significance, and rho = 0.08 for clarity) and a moderate positive correlation for papers from the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) (rho=0.38). Including the full text of articles significantly increased the correlation for ICLR (rho=0.46) and slightly improved it for F1000Research (rho=0.09), while it had variable effects on the four quality dimension correlations for SciPost LaTeX files. The use of chain-of-thought system prompts slightly increased the correlation for F1000Research (rho=0.10), marginally reduced it for ICLR (rho=0.37), and further decreased it for SciPost Physics (rho=0.16 for validity, rho=0.18 for originality, rho=0.18 for significance, and rho=0.05 for clarity). Overall, the results suggest that in some contexts, ChatGPT can produce weak pre-publication quality assessments. However, the effectiveness of these assessments and the optimal strategies for employing them vary considerably across different platforms, journals, and conferences. Additionally, the most suitable inputs for ChatGPT appear to differ depending on the platform.

### LLM Hallucination Reasoning with Zero-shot Knowledge Test
**Authors**: Seongmin Lee, Hsiang Hsu, Chun-Fu Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T18:55:26Z

**Summary**: LLM hallucination, where LLMs occasionally generate unfaithful text, poses significant challenges for their practical applications. Most existing detection methods rely on external knowledge, LLM fine-tuning, or hallucination-labeled datasets, and they do not distinguish between different types of hallucinations, which are crucial for improving detection performance. We introduce a new task, Hallucination Reasoning, which classifies LLM-generated text into one of three categories: aligned, misaligned, and fabricated. Our novel zero-shot method assesses whether LLM has enough knowledge about a given prompt and text. Our experiments conducted on new datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in hallucination reasoning and underscore its importance for enhancing detection performance.

### Squeezed Attention: Accelerating Long Context Length LLM Inference
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sehoon Kim, Hiva Mohammadzadeh, Monishwaran Maheswaran, June Paik, Michael W. Mahoney, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T18:54:19Z

**Summary**: Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input prompts to perform complex downstream tasks like document analysis and code generation. For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose Squeezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of the keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded during inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important keys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to identify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement optimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively evaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and up to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models.

### Quantitative Assessment of Intersectional Empathetic Bias and   Understanding
**Authors**: Vojtech Formanek, Ondrej Sotolar

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T18:35:19Z

**Summary**: A growing amount of literature critiques the current operationalizations of empathy based on loose definitions of the construct. Such definitions negatively affect dataset quality, model robustness, and evaluation reliability. We propose an empathy evaluation framework that operationalizes empathy close to its psychological origins. The framework measures the variance in responses of LLMs to prompts using existing metrics for empathy and emotional valence. The variance is introduced through the controlled generation of the prompts by varying social biases affecting context understanding, thus impacting empathetic understanding. The control over generation ensures high theoretical validity of the constructs in the prompt dataset. Also, it makes high-quality translation, especially into languages that currently have little-to-no way of evaluating empathy or bias, such as the Slavonic family, more manageable. Using chosen LLMs and various prompt types, we demonstrate the empathy evaluation with the framework, including multiple-choice answers and free generation. The variance in our initial evaluation sample is small and we were unable to measure convincing differences between the empathetic understanding in contexts given by different social groups. However, the results are promising because the models showed significant alterations their reasoning chains needed to capture the relatively subtle changes in the prompts. This provides the basis for future research into the construction of the evaluation sample and statistical methods for measuring the results.

**Authors**: David López-Pérez, Nicola Piovesan, Giovanni Geraci

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T18:31:16Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a new system model to evaluate the capacity and power consumption of multi-layer 6G networks utilising the upper mid-band (FR3). The model captures heterogeneous 4G, 5G, and 6G deployments, analyzing their performance under different deployment strategies. Our results show that strategic 6G deployments, non-co-located with existing 5G sites, significantly enhance throughput, with median and peak user rates of 300 Mbps and exceeding 1 Gbps, respectively. We also emphasize the importance of priority-based cell reselection and beam configuration to fully leverage 6G capabilities. While 6G implementation increases power consumption by 33%, non-colocated deployments strike a balance between performance and power consumption.

### Verifiable by Design: Aligning Language Models to Quote from   Pre-Training Data
**Authors**: Jingyu Zhang, Marc Marone, Tianjian Li, Benjamin Van Durme, Daniel Khashabi

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T18:27:39Z

**Summary**: To trust the fluent generations of large language models (LLMs), humans must be able to verify their correctness against trusted, external sources. Recent efforts, such as providing citations via retrieved documents or post-hoc provenance, enhance verifiability but provide no guarantees on their correctness. To address these limitations, we tackle the verifiability goal with a different philosophy: trivializing the verification process by developing models that quote verbatim statements from trusted sources in their pre-training data. We propose Quote-Tuning, which demonstrates the feasibility of aligning models to quote. The core of Quote-Tuning is a fast membership inference function that efficiently verifies text against trusted corpora. We leverage this tool to design a reward function to quantify quotes in model responses, and curate datasets for preference learning. Experiments show that Quote-Tuning significantly increases verbatim quotes from high-quality documents by up to 130% relative to base models while maintaining response quality. Quote-Tuning is applicable in different tasks, generalizes to out-of-domain data and diverse model families, and provides additional benefits to truthfulness. Our method not only serves as a hassle-free method to increase quoting but also opens up avenues for improving LLM trustworthiness through better verifiability.

### How do Machine Learning Models Change?
**Authors**: Joel Castaño, Rafael Cabañas, Antonio Salmerón, David Lo, Silverio Martínez-Fernández

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T18:14:32Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of Machine Learning (ML) models and their open-source implementations has transformed Artificial Intelligence research and applications. Platforms like Hugging Face (HF) enable the development, sharing, and deployment of these models, fostering an evolving ecosystem. While previous studies have examined aspects of models hosted on platforms like HF, a comprehensive longitudinal study of how these models change remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by utilizing both repository mining and longitudinal analysis methods to examine over 200,000 commits and 1,200 releases from over 50,000 models on HF. We replicate and extend an ML change taxonomy for classifying commits and utilize Bayesian networks to uncover patterns in commit and release activities over time. Our findings indicate that commit activities align with established data science methodologies, such as CRISP-DM, emphasizing iterative refinement and continuous improvement. Additionally, release patterns tend to consolidate significant updates, particularly in documentation, distinguishing between granular changes and milestone-based releases. Furthermore, projects with higher popularity prioritize infrastructure enhancements early in their lifecycle, and those with intensive collaboration practices exhibit improved documentation standards. These and other insights enhance the understanding of model changes on community platforms and provide valuable guidance for best practices in model maintenance.

### AutoDefense: Multi-Agent LLM Defense against Jailbreak Attacks
**Authors**: Yifan Zeng, Yiran Wu, Xiao Zhang, Huazheng Wang, Qingyun Wu

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T18:14:00Z

**Summary**: Despite extensive pre-training in moral alignment to prevent generating harmful information, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In this paper, we propose AutoDefense, a multi-agent defense framework that filters harmful responses from LLMs. With the response-filtering mechanism, our framework is robust against different jailbreak attack prompts, and can be used to defend different victim models. AutoDefense assigns different roles to LLM agents and employs them to complete the defense task collaboratively. The division in tasks enhances the overall instruction-following of LLMs and enables the integration of other defense components as tools. With AutoDefense, small open-source LMs can serve as agents and defend larger models against jailbreak attacks. Our experiments show that AutoDefense can effectively defense against different jailbreak attacks, while maintaining the performance at normal user request. For example, we reduce the attack success rate on GPT-3.5 from 55.74% to 7.95% using LLaMA-2-13b with a 3-agent system. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/XHMY/AutoDefense.

### VRSD: Rethinking Similarity and Diversity for Retrieval in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Hang Gao, Yongfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T18:01:10Z

**Summary**: Vector retrieval algorithms are essential for semantic queries within the rapidly evolving landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs). The ability to retrieve vectors that satisfy both similarity and diversity criteria substantially enhances the performance of LLMs. Although Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) is widely employed in retrieval scenarios requiring relevance and diversity, variations in the parameter $\lambda$ lead to fluctuations that complicate the optimization trajectory in vector spaces. This obscures the direction of improvement and highlights the lack of a robust theoretical analysis regarding similarity and diversity constraints in retrieval processes. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that characterizes both constraints through the relationship between the sum vector and the query vector. The proximity of these vectors ensures the similarity constraint, while requiring individual vectors within the sum vector to diverge in their alignment with the query vector satisfies the diversity constraint. We first formulate a new combinatorial optimization problem, selecting k vectors from a candidate set such that their sum vector maximally aligns with the query vector, and demonstrate that this problem is NP-complete. This result underscores the inherent difficulty of simultaneously achieving similarity and diversity in vector retrieval, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for future research. Subsequently, we present the heuristic algorithm Vectors Retrieval with Similarity and Diversity, VRSD, which features a clear optimization objective and eliminates the need for preset parameters. VRSD also achieves a modest reduction in time complexity compared to MMR. Empirical validation confirms that VRSD significantly outperforms MMR across various datasets.

### Local deployment of large-scale music AI models on commodity hardware
**Authors**: Xun Zhou, Charlie Ruan, Zihe Zhao, Tianqi Chen, Chris Donahue

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T17:49:27Z

**Summary**: We present the MIDInfinite, a web application capable of generating symbolic music using a large-scale generative AI model locally on commodity hardware. Creating this demo involved porting the Anticipatory Music Transformer, a large language model (LLM) pre-trained on the Lakh MIDI dataset, to the Machine Learning Compilation (MLC) framework. Once the model is ported, MLC facilitates inference on a variety of runtimes including C++, mobile, and the browser. We envision that MLC has the potential to bridge the gap between the landscape of increasingly capable music AI models and technology more familiar to music software developers. As a proof of concept, we build a web application that allows users to generate endless streams of multi-instrumental MIDI in the browser, either from scratch or conditioned on a prompt. On commodity hardware (an M3 Macbook Pro), our demo can generate 51 notes per second, which is faster than real-time playback for 72.9% of generations, and increases to 86.3% with 2 seconds of upfront buffering.

### PTR: Precision-Driven Tool Recommendation for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Hang Gao, Yongfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T17:33:36Z

**Summary**: By augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools, their capacity to solve complex problems has been significantly enhanced. However, despite ongoing advancements in the parsing capabilities of LLMs, incorporating all available tools simultaneously in the prompt remains impractical due to the vast number of external tools. Consequently, it is essential to provide LLMs with a precise set of tools tailored to the specific task, considering both quantity and quality. Current tool retrieval methods primarily focus on refining the ranking list of tools and directly packaging a fixed number of top-ranked tools as the tool set. However, these approaches often fail to equip LLMs with the optimal set of tools prior to execution, since the optimal number of tools for different tasks could be different, resulting in inefficiencies such as redundant or unsuitable tools, which impede immediate access to the most relevant tools. This paper addresses the challenge of recommending precise toolsets for LLMs. We introduce the problem of tool recommendation, define its scope, and propose a novel Precision-driven Tool Recommendation (PTR) approach. PTR captures an initial, concise set of tools by leveraging historical tool bundle usage and dynamically adjusts the tool set by performing tool matching, culminating in a multi-view-based tool addition. Additionally, we present a new dataset, RecTools, and a metric, TRACC, designed to evaluate the effectiveness of tool recommendation for LLMs. We further validate our design choices through comprehensive experiments, demonstrating promising accuracy across two open benchmarks and our RecTools dataset.

### LLaMA-Mesh: Unifying 3D Mesh Generation with Language Models
**Authors**: Zhengyi Wang, Jonathan Lorraine, Yikai Wang, Hang Su, Jun Zhu, Sanja Fidler, Xiaohui Zeng

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T17:08:23Z

**Summary**: This work explores expanding the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) pretrained on text to generate 3D meshes within a unified model. This offers key advantages of (1) leveraging spatial knowledge already embedded in LLMs, derived from textual sources like 3D tutorials, and (2) enabling conversational 3D generation and mesh understanding. A primary challenge is effectively tokenizing 3D mesh data into discrete tokens that LLMs can process seamlessly. To address this, we introduce LLaMA-Mesh, a novel approach that represents the vertex coordinates and face definitions of 3D meshes as plain text, allowing direct integration with LLMs without expanding the vocabulary. We construct a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset enabling pretrained LLMs to (1) generate 3D meshes from text prompts, (2) produce interleaved text and 3D mesh outputs as required, and (3) understand and interpret 3D meshes. Our work is the first to demonstrate that LLMs can be fine-tuned to acquire complex spatial knowledge for 3D mesh generation in a text-based format, effectively unifying the 3D and text modalities. LLaMA-Mesh achieves mesh generation quality on par with models trained from scratch while maintaining strong text generation performance.

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T17:01:24Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we explore the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance automated design and software development in the automotive industry. We present two case studies: a standardization compliance chatbot and a design copilot, both utilizing RAG to provide accurate, context-aware responses. We evaluate four LLMs-GPT-4o, LLAMA3, Mistral, and Mixtral -- comparing their answering accuracy and execution time. Our results demonstrate that while GPT-4 offers superior performance, LLAMA3 and Mistral also show promising capabilities for local deployment, addressing data privacy concerns in automotive applications. This study highlights the potential of RAG-augmented LLMs in improving design workflows and compliance in automotive engineering.

### Spider: Any-to-Many Multimodal LLM
**Authors**: Jinxiang Lai, Jie Zhang, Jun Liu, Jian Li, Xiaocheng Lu, Song Guo

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T16:58:19Z

**Summary**: Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have emerged as an extension of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling the integration of various modalities. However, Any-to-Any MLLMs are limited to generating pairwise modalities 'Text + X' within a single response, such as Text + {Image or Audio or Video}. To address this limitation, we introduce Spider, a novel efficient Any-to-Many Modalities Generation (AMMG) framework, which can generate an arbitrary combination of modalities 'Text + Xs', such as Text + {Image and Audio and Video}. To achieve efficient AMMG, our Spider integrates three core components: a Base Model for basic X-to-X (i.e., Any-to-Any) modality processing, a novel Efficient Decoders-Controller for controlling multimodal Decoders to generate Xs (many-modal) contents, and an Any-to-Many Instruction Template designed for producing Xs signal prompts. To train Spider, we constructed a novel Text-formatted Many-Modal (TMM) dataset, which facilitates the learning of the X-to-Xs (i.e., Any-to-Many) capability necessary for AMMG. Ultimately, the well-trained Spider generates a pseudo X-to-Xs dataset, the first-ever X-to-Xs many-modal dataset, enhancing the potential for AMMG task in future research. Overall, this work not only pushes the boundary of multimodal interaction but also provides rich data support for advancing the field.

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T16:42:19Z

**Summary**: The rise of Foundation Models (FMs) like Large Language Models (LLMs) is revolutionizing software development. Despite the impressive prototypes, transforming FMware into production-ready products demands complex engineering across various domains. A critical but overlooked aspect is performance engineering, which aims at ensuring FMware meets performance goals such as throughput and latency to avoid user dissatisfaction and financial loss. Often, performance considerations are an afterthought, leading to costly optimization efforts post-deployment. FMware's high computational resource demands highlight the need for efficient hardware use. Continuous performance engineering is essential to prevent degradation. This paper highlights the significance of Software Performance Engineering (SPE) in FMware, identifying four key challenges: cognitive architecture design, communication protocols, tuning and optimization, and deployment. These challenges are based on literature surveys and experiences from developing an in-house FMware system. We discuss problems, current practices, and innovative paths for the software engineering community.

### Efficient End-to-End 6-Dof Grasp Detection Framework for Edge Devices   with Hierarchical Heatmaps and Feature Propagation
**Authors**: Kaiqin Yang, Yixiang Dai, Guijin Wang, Siang Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T16:40:00Z

**Summary**: 6-DoF grasp detection is critically important for the advancement of intelligent embodied systems, as it provides feasible robot poses for object grasping. Various methods have been proposed to detect 6-DoF grasps through the extraction of 3D geometric features from RGBD or point cloud data. However, most of these approaches encounter challenges during real robot deployment due to their significant computational demands, which can be particularly problematic for mobile robot platforms, especially those reliant on edge computing devices. This paper presents an Efficient End-to-End Grasp Detection Network (E3GNet) for 6-DoF grasp detection utilizing hierarchical heatmap representations. E3GNet effectively identifies high-quality and diverse grasps in cluttered real-world environments. Benefiting from our end-to-end methodology and efficient network design, our approach surpasses previous methods in model inference efficiency and achieves real-time 6-Dof grasp detection on edge devices. Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a satisfactory 94% object grasping success rate.

### OOD-SEG: Out-Of-Distribution detection for image SEGmentation with   sparse multi-class positive-only annotations
**Authors**: Junwen Wang, Zhonghao Wang, Oscar MacCormac, Jonathan Shapey, Tom Vercauteren

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T16:06:30Z

**Summary**: Despite significant advancements, segmentation based on deep neural networks in medical and surgical imaging faces several challenges, two of which we aim to address in this work. First, acquiring complete pixel-level segmentation labels for medical images is time-consuming and requires domain expertise. Second, typical segmentation pipelines cannot detect out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels, leaving them prone to spurious outputs during deployment. In this work, we propose a novel segmentation approach exploiting OOD detection that learns only from sparsely annotated pixels from multiple positive-only classes. %but \emph{no background class} annotation. These multi-class positive annotations naturally fall within the in-distribution (ID) set. Unlabelled pixels may contain positive classes but also negative ones, including what is typically referred to as \emph{background} in standard segmentation formulations. Here, we forgo the need for background annotation and consider these together with any other unseen classes as part of the OOD set. Our framework can integrate, at a pixel-level, any OOD detection approaches designed for classification tasks. To address the lack of existing OOD datasets and established evaluation metric for medical image segmentation, we propose a cross-validation strategy that treats held-out labelled classes as OOD. Extensive experiments on both multi-class hyperspectral and RGB surgical imaging datasets demonstrate the robustness and generalisation capability of our proposed framework.

**Authors**: Márton Szép, Daniel Rueckert, Rüdiger von Eisenhart-Rothe, Florian Hinterwimmer

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T15:55:37Z

**Summary**: Employing pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) has become the de facto standard in Natural Language Processing (NLP) despite their extensive data requirements. Motivated by the recent surge in research focused on training LLMs with limited data, particularly in low-resource domains and languages, this paper surveys recent transfer learning approaches to optimize model performance in downstream tasks where data is scarce. We first address initial and continued pre-training strategies to better leverage prior knowledge in unseen domains and languages. We then examine how to maximize the utility of limited data during fine-tuning and few-shot learning. The final section takes a task-specific perspective, reviewing models and methods suited for different levels of data scarcity. Our goal is to provide practitioners with practical guidelines for overcoming the challenges posed by constrained data while also highlighting promising directions for future research.

**Authors**: Dimitrios Samakovlis, Stefano Albini, Rubén Rodríguez Álvarez, Denisa-Andreea Constantinescu, Pasquale Davide Schiavone, Miguel Peón-Quirós, David Atienza

**Updated**: 2024-11-14T15:52:19Z

**Summary**: Breakthroughs in ultra-low-power chip technology are transforming biomedical wearables, making it possible to monitor patients in real time with devices operating on mere {\mu}W. Although many studies have examined the power performance of commercial microcontrollers, it remains unclear which ones perform best across diverse application profiles and which hardware features are most crucial for minimizing energy consumption under varying computational loads. Identifying these features for typical wearable applications and understanding their effects on performance and energy efficiency are essential for optimizing deployment strategies and informing future hardware designs. In this work, we conduct an in-depth study of state-of-the-art (SoA) micro-controller units(MCUs) in terms of processing capability and energy efficiency using representative end-to-end SoA wearable applications. We systematically benchmark each platform across three primary application phases: idle, data acquisition, and processing, allowing a holistic assessment of the platform processing capability and overall energy efficiency across varying patient-monitoring application profiles. Our detailed analysis of performance and energy discrepancies across different platforms reveals key strengths and limitations of the current low-power hardware design and pinpoints the strengths and weaknesses of SoA MCUs. We conclude with actionable insights for wearable application designers and hardware engineers, aiming to inform future hardware design improvements and support optimal platform selection for energy-constrained biomedical applications.
