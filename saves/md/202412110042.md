 ### GPT Semantic Cache: Reducing LLM Costs and Latency via Semantic   Embedding Caching
**Authors**: Sajal Regmi, Chetan Phakami Pun

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T01:44:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling nuanced understanding and generation of human-like text across a wide range of applications. However, the high computational and financial costs associated with frequent API calls to these models present a substantial bottleneck, especially for applications like customer service chatbots that handle repetitive queries. In this paper, we introduce GPT Semantic Cache, a method that leverages semantic caching of query embeddings in in-memory storage (Redis). By storing embeddings of user queries, our approach efficiently identifies semantically similar questions, allowing for the retrieval of pre-generated responses without redundant API calls to the LLM. This technique achieves a notable reduction in operational costs while significantly enhancing response times, making it a robust solution for optimizing LLM-powered applications. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT Semantic Cache reduces API calls by up to 68.8% across various query categories, with cache hit rates ranging from 61.6% to 68.8%. Additionally, the system achieves high accuracy, with positive hit rates exceeding 97%, confirming the reliability of cached responses. This technique not only reduces operational costs, but also improves response times, enhancing the efficiency of LLM-powered applications.

**Authors**: Xianzhi Zhang, Yipeng Zhou, Di Wu, Quan Z. Sheng, Shazia Riaz, Miao Hu, Linchang Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T01:39:15Z

**Summary**: Caching content at the edge network is a popular and effective technique widely deployed to alleviate the burden of network backhaul, shorten service delay and improve service quality. However, there has been some controversy over privacy violations in caching content at the edge network. On the one hand, the multi-access open edge network provides an ideal entrance or interface for external attackers to obtain private data from edge caches by extracting sensitive information. On the other hand, privacy can be infringed on by curious edge caching providers through caching trace analysis targeting the achievement of better caching performance or higher profits. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of privacy issues in edge caching networks is vital and indispensable for creating a privacy-preserving caching service at the edge network. In this article, we are among the first to fill this gap by examining privacy-preserving techniques for caching content at the edge network. Firstly, we provide an introduction to the background of privacy-preserving edge caching (PPEC). Next, we summarize the key privacy issues and present a taxonomy for caching at the edge network from the perspective of private information. Additionally, we conduct a retrospective review of the state-of-the-art countermeasures against privacy leakage from content caching at the edge network. Finally, we conclude the survey and envision challenges for future research.

### XKV: Personalized KV Cache Memory Reduction for Long-Context LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Weizhuo Li, Zhigang Wang, Yu Gu, Ge Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-08T11:32:08Z

**Summary**: Recently the generative Large Language Model (LLM) has achieved remarkable success in numerous applications. Notably its inference generates output tokens one-by-one, leading to many redundant computations. The widely-used KV-Cache framework makes a compromise between time and space complexities. However, caching data generates the increasingly growing memory demand, that can quickly exhaust the limited memory capacity of the modern accelerator like GPUs, particularly in long-context inference tasks. Existing studies reduce memory consumption by evicting some of cached data that have less important impact on inference accuracy. But the benefit in practice is far from ideal due to the static cache allocation across different LLM network layers. This paper observes that the layer-specific cached data have very different impacts on accuracy. We quantify this difference, and give experimental and theoretical validation. We accordingly make a formal analysis and shows that customizing the cache size for each layer in a personalized manner can yield a significant memory reduction, while still providing comparable accuracy. We simulate the cache allocation as a combinatorial optimization problem and give a global optimal solution. In particular, we devise a mini- and sampling-based inference over a lightweight variant of the LLM model, so as to quickly capture the difference and then feed it into the personalized algorithms. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposals can reduce KV cache memory consumption by 61.6% on average, improve computational efficiency by 2.1x and then increase the throughput by up to 5.5x.

### Semi-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Controllable Video-to-Music   Retrieval
**Authors**: Shanti Stewart, Gouthaman KV, Lie Lu, Andrea Fanelli

**Updated**: 2024-12-08T06:37:27Z

**Summary**: Content creators often use music to enhance their videos, from soundtracks in movies to background music in video blogs and social media content. However, identifying the best music for a video can be a difficult and time-consuming task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for automatically retrieving a matching music clip for a given video, and vice versa. Our approach leverages annotated music labels, as well as the inherent artistic correspondence between visual and music elements. Distinct from previous cross-modal music retrieval works, our method combines both self-supervised and supervised training objectives. We use self-supervised and label-supervised contrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video. We show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the supervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other music annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method enables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on self-supervised vs. label information at inference time. We evaluate the learned embeddings through a variety of video-to-music and music-to-video retrieval tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully combines self-supervised and supervised objectives and is effective for controllable music-video retrieval.

### Ultrafast lattice and electron dynamics induced in a PbSe crystal by an   intense terahertz pulse
**Authors**: A. A. Melnikov, Yu. G. Selivanov, D. G. Poydashev, S. V. Chekalin

**Updated**: 2024-12-07T17:22:14Z

**Summary**: We have studied the ultrafast optical response of a PbSe crystal to an intense picosecond terahertz pulse with a peak electric field strength of up to $\sim$ 500 kV/cm. The reflectivity anisotropy signal contains oscillations at the fundamental frequency of the resonant infrared-active phonon mode as well as its second, third, and fourth harmonics. The effect is ascribed to coherent anharmonic phonons resonantly excited by the strong terahertz field. Pump terahertz pulses also induce an almost instantaneous Kerr effect and a long-lived optical anisotropy of the crystal with a characteristic decay time of $\gtrsim$ 100 ps. We consider lattice distortion and phonon-assisted side valley population as possible origins of this metastable state.

### Batch-Max: Higher LLM Throughput using Larger Batch Sizes and KV Cache   Compression
**Authors**: Michael R. Metel, Boxing Chen, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh

**Updated**: 2024-12-07T16:41:54Z

**Summary**: Several works have developed eviction policies to remove key-value (KV) pairs from the KV cache for more efficient inference. The focus has been on compressing the KV cache after the input prompt has been processed for faster token generation. In settings with limited GPU memory, and when the input context is longer than the generation length, we show that by also compressing the KV cache during the input processing phase, larger batch sizes can be used resulting in significantly higher throughput while still maintaining the original model's accuracy.

### DHA: Learning Decoupled-Head Attention from Transformer Checkpoints via   Adaptive Heads Fusion
**Authors**: Yilong Chen, Linhao Zhang, Junyuan Shang, Zhenyu Zhang, Tingwen Liu, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun

**Updated**: 2024-12-07T13:23:39Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters demonstrate impressive performance. However, the widely used Multi-Head Attention (MHA) in LLMs incurs substantial computational and memory costs during inference. While some efforts have optimized attention mechanisms by pruning heads or sharing parameters among heads, these methods often lead to performance degradation or necessitate substantial continued pre-training costs to restore performance. Based on the analysis of attention redundancy, we design a Decoupled-Head Attention (DHA) mechanism. DHA adaptively configures group sharing for key heads and value heads across various layers, achieving a better balance between performance and efficiency. Inspired by the observation of clustering similar heads, we propose to progressively transform the MHA checkpoint into the DHA model through linear fusion of similar head parameters step by step, retaining the parametric knowledge of the MHA checkpoint. We construct DHA models by transforming various scales of MHA checkpoints given target head budgets. Our experiments show that DHA remarkably requires a mere 0.25\% of the original model's pre-training budgets to achieve 97.6\% of performance while saving 75\% of KV cache. Compared to Group-Query Attention (GQA), DHA achieves a 5$\times$ training acceleration, a maximum of 13.93\% performance improvement under 0.01\% pre-training budget, and 4\% relative improvement under 0.05\% pre-training budget.

### PrefixKV: Adaptive Prefix KV Cache is What Vision Instruction-Following   Models Need for Efficient Generation
**Authors**: Ao Wang, Hui Chen, Jianchao Tan, Kefeng Zhang, Xunliang Cai, Zijia Lin, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding

**Updated**: 2024-12-07T13:23:39Z

**Summary**: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity for their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal inputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory overhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in practical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/THU-MIG/PrefixKV}.

### Spineless Traversal for Layout Invalidation
**Authors**: Marisa Kirisame, Tiezhi Wang, Pavel Panchekha

**Updated**: 2024-12-07T04:08:56Z

**Summary**: Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

### Effect of electric field on excitons in wide quantum wells
**Authors**: Shiming Zheng, E. S. Khramtsov, I. V. Ignatiev

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T19:35:52Z

**Summary**: A microscopic model of a heterostructure with a quantum well (QW) is proposed to study the exciton behavior in an external electric field. The effect of an electric field ranging from 0 to 6 kV/cm applied to the GaAs/AlGaAs QW structure in the growth direction is studied for several QWs of various widths up to 100 nm. The three-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation (SE) of exciton is numerically solved using the finite difference method. Wave functions and energies for several states of the heavy-hole and light-hole excitons are calculated. Dependencies of the exciton state energy, the binding energy, the radiative broadening, and the static dipole moment on the applied electric fields are determined. The threshold of exciton dissociation for the 100-nm QW is also determined. In addition, we found the electric-field-induced shift of the center of mass of the heavy-hole and light-hole exciton in the QWs. Finally, we have modeled reflection spectra of heterostructures with the GaAs/AlGaAs QWs in the electric field using the calculated energies and radiative broadenings of excitons.

### MC3: Memory Contention based Covert Channel Communication on Shared DRAM   System-on-Chips
**Authors**: Ismet Dagli, James Crea, Soner Seckiner, Yuanchao Xu, Selçuk Köse, Mehmet E. Belviranli

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:58:57Z

**Summary**: Shared-memory system-on-chips (SM-SoC) are ubiquitously employed by a wide-range of mobile computing platforms, including edge/IoT devices, autonomous systems and smartphones. In SM-SoCs, system-wide shared physical memory enables a convenient and financially-feasible way to make data accessible by dozens of processing units (PUs), such as CPU cores and domain specific accelerators. In this study, we investigate vulnerabilities that stem from the shared use of physical memory in such systems. Due to the diverse computational characteristics of the PUs they embed, SM-SoCs often do not employ a shared last level cache (LLC). While the literature proposes covert channel attacks for shared memory systems, high-throughput communication is currently possible by either relying on an LLC or privileged/physical access to the shared memory subsystem.   In this study, we introduce a new memory-contention based covert communication attack, MC3, which specifically targets the shared system memory in mobile SoCs. Different from existing attacks, our approach achieves high throughput communication between applications running on CPU and GPU without the need for an LLC or elevated access to the system. We extensively explore the effectiveness of our methodology by demonstrating the trade-off between the channel transmission rate and the robustness of the communication. We demonstrate the utility of MC3 on NVIDIA Orin AGX, Orin NX, and Orin Nano up to a transmit rate of 6.4 kbps with less than 1% error rate.

### SwiftDiffusion: Efficient Diffusion Model Serving with Add-on Modules
**Authors**: Suyi Li, Lingyun Yang, Xiaoxiao Jiang, Hanfeng Lu, Dakai An, Zhipeng Di, Weiyi Lu, Jiawei Chen, Kan Liu, Yinghao Yu, Tao Lan, Guodong Yang, Lin Qu, Liping Zhang, Wei Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:47:06Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) generation using diffusion models has become a blockbuster service in today's AI cloud. A production T2I service typically involves a serving workflow where a base diffusion model is augmented with various "add-on" modules, notably ControlNet and LoRA, to enhance image generation control. Compared to serving the base model alone, these add-on modules introduce significant loading and computational overhead, resulting in increased latency. In this paper, we present SwiftDiffusion, a system that efficiently serves a T2I workflow through a holistic approach. SwiftDiffusion decouples ControNet from the base model and deploys it as a separate, independently scaled service on dedicated GPUs, enabling ControlNet caching, parallelization, and sharing. To mitigate the high loading overhead of LoRA serving, SwiftDiffusion employs a bounded asynchronous LoRA loading (BAL) technique, allowing LoRA loading to overlap with the initial base model execution by up to k steps without compromising image quality. Furthermore, SwiftDiffusion optimizes base model execution with a novel latent parallelism technique. Collectively, these designs enable SwiftDiffusion to outperform the state-of-the-art T2I serving systems, achieving up to 7.8x latency reduction and 1.6x throughput improvement in serving SDXL models on H800 GPUs, without sacrificing image quality.

### Ltri-LLM: Streaming Long Context Inference for LLMs with Training-Free   Dynamic Triangular Attention Pattern
**Authors**: Hongyin Tang, Di Xiu, Lanrui Wang, Xiurui Geng, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T03:46:06Z

**Summary**: The quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism in current Large Language Models (LLMs) renders inference with long contexts prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, various approaches aim to retain critical portions of the context to optimally approximate Full Attention (FA) through Key-Value (KV) compression or Sparse Attention (SA), enabling the processing of virtually unlimited text lengths in a streaming manner. However, these methods struggle to achieve performance levels comparable to FA, particularly in retrieval tasks. In this paper, our analysis of attention head patterns reveals that LLMs' attention distributions show strong local correlations, naturally reflecting a chunking mechanism for input context. We propose Ltri-LLM framework, which divides KVs into spans, stores them in an offline index, and retrieves the relevant KVs into memory for various queries. Experimental results on popular long text benchmarks show that Ltri-LLM can achieve performance close to FA while maintaining efficient, streaming-based inference.

### One-Hop Sub-Query Result Caches for Graph Database Systems
**Authors**: Hieu Nguyen, Jun Li, Shahram Ghandeharizadeh

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T01:20:47Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a novel one-hop sub-query result cache for processing graph read transactions, gR-Txs, in a graph database system. The one-hop navigation is from a vertex using either its in-coming or out-going edges with selection predicates that filter edges and vertices. Its cache entry identifies a unique one-hop sub-query (key) and its result set consisting of immutable vertex ids (value). When processing a gR-Tx, the query processor identifies its sequence of individual one-hop sub-queries and looks up their results in the cache. A cache hit fetches less data from the storage manager and eliminates the requirement to process the one-hop sub-query. A cache miss populates the cache asynchronously and in a transactional manner, maintaining the separation of read and write paths of our transactional storage manager. A graph read and write transaction, gRW-Tx, identifies the impacted cache entries and either deletes or updates them. Our implementation of the cache is inside the graph query processing engine and transparent to a user application. We evaluate the cache using our eCommerce production workload and with rules that re-write graph queries to maximize the performance enhancements observed with the cache. Obtained results show the cache enhances 95th and 99th percentile of query response times by at least 2x and 1.63x, respectively. When combined with query re-writing, the enhancements are at least 2.33x and 4.48x, respectively. An interesting result is the significant performance enhancement observed by the indirect beneficiaries of the cache, gRW-Txs and gR-Txs that do not reference one-hop sub-queries. The cache frees system resources to expedite their processing significantly.

### Cross-Self KV Cache Pruning for Efficient Vision-Language Inference
**Authors**: Xiaohuan Pei, Tao Huang, Chang Xu

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T22:47:17Z

**Summary**: KV cache pruning has emerged as a promising technique for reducing memory and computation costs in long-context auto-regressive generation. Existing methods for vision-language models (VLMs) typically rely on self-attention scores from large language models (LLMs) to identify and prune irrelevant tokens. However, these approaches overlook the inherent distributional discrepancies between modalities, often leading to inaccurate token importance estimation and the over-pruning of critical visual tokens. To address this, we propose decomposing attention scores into intra-modality attention (within the same modality) and inter-modality attention (across modalities), enabling more precise KV cache pruning by independently managing these distinct attention types. Additionally, we introduce an n-softmax function to counteract distribution shifts caused by pruning, preserving the original smoothness of attention scores and ensuring stable performance. Our final training-free method, \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{S}elf \textbf{P}runing (CSP), achieves competitive performance compared to models with full KV caches while significantly outperforming previous pruning methods. Extensive evaluations on MileBench, a benchmark encompassing 29 multimodal datasets, demonstrate CSP's effectiveness, achieving up to a 41\% performance improvement on challenging tasks like conversational embodied dialogue while reducing the KV cache budget by 13.6\%.

### Neural Two-Level Monte Carlo Real-Time Rendering
**Authors**: Mikhail Dereviannykh, Dmitrii Klepikov, Johannes Hanika, Carsten Dachsbacher

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T22:06:23Z

**Summary**: We introduce an efficient Two-Level Monte Carlo (subset of Multi-Level Monte Carlo, MLMC) estimator for real-time rendering of scenes with global illumination. Using MLMC we split the shading integral into two parts: the radiance cache integral and the residual error integral that compensates for the bias of the first one. For the first part, we developed the Neural Incident Radiance Cache (NIRC) leveraging the power of fully-fused tiny neural networks as a building block, which is trained on the fly. The cache is designed to provide a fast and reasonable approximation of the incident radiance: an evaluation takes 2-25x less compute time than a path tracing sample. This enables us to estimate the radiance cache integral with a high number of samples and by this achieve faster convergence. For the residual error integral, we compute the difference between the NIRC predictions and the unbiased path tracing simulation. Our method makes no assumptions about the geometry, materials, or lighting of a scene and has only few intuitive hyper-parameters. We provide a comprehensive comparative analysis in different experimental scenarios. Since the algorithm is trained in an on-line fashion, it demonstrates significant noise level reduction even for dynamic scenes and can easily be combined with other importance sampling schemes and noise reduction techniques.

### p-MoD: Building Mixture-of-Depths MLLMs via Progressive Ratio Decay
**Authors**: Jun Zhang, Desen Meng, Ji Qi, Zhenpeng Huang, Tao Wu, Limin Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T18:58:03Z

**Summary**: Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. The majority of computation stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder. In this paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks. Our model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline models, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.

### SwiftKV: Fast Prefill-Optimized Inference with Knowledge-Preserving   Model Transformation
**Authors**: Aurick Qiao, Zhewei Yao, Samyam Rajbhandari, Yuxiong He

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T14:56:56Z

**Summary**: LLM inference for popular enterprise use cases, such as summarization, RAG, and code-generation, typically observes orders of magnitude longer prompt lengths than generation lengths. This characteristic leads to high cost of prefill and increased response latency. In this paper, we present SwiftKV, a novel model transformation and distillation procedure specifically designed to reduce the time and cost of processing prompt tokens while preserving high quality of generated tokens. SwiftKV combines three key mechanisms: i) SingleInputKV, which prefills later layers' KV cache using a much earlier layer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip much of the model computation, ii) AcrossKV, which merges the KV caches of neighboring layers to reduce the memory footprint and support larger batch size for higher throughput, and iii) a knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs for SwiftKV with minimal accuracy impact and low compute and data requirement. For Llama-3.1-8B and 70B, SwiftKV reduces the compute requirement of prefill by 50% and the memory requirement of the KV cache by 62.5% while incurring minimum quality degradation across a wide range of tasks. In the end-to-end inference serving using an optimized vLLM implementation, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x higher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve a staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which translates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B in 16-bit precision on 4x H100 GPUs. Our training, inference, and model implementations are open-sourced and can be found through https://huggingface.co/collections/Snowflake/swiftkv-models-674f7d7474eb789e185d31cb.

### KV Shifting Attention Enhances Language Modeling
**Authors**: Mingyu Xu, Wei Cheng, Bingning Wang, Weipeng Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T12:19:38Z

**Summary**: The current large language models are mainly based on decode-only structure transformers, which have great in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. It is generally believed that the important foundation of its ICL capability is the induction heads mechanism, which requires at least two layers attention. In order to more efficiently implement the ability of the model's induction, we revisit the induction heads mechanism and proposed a KV shifting attention. We theoretically prove that the KV shifting attention reducing the model's requirements for the depth and width of the induction heads mechanism. Our experimental results demonstrate that KV shifting attention is beneficial to learning induction heads and language modeling, which lead to better performance or faster convergence from toy models to the pre-training models with more than 10 B parameters.

### A Little Goes a Long Way: Efficient Long Context Training and Inference   with Partial Contexts
**Authors**: Suyu Ge, Xihui Lin, Yunan Zhang, Jiawei Han, Hao Peng

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T06:52:42Z

**Summary**: Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs substantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a pretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length extension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural modifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper argues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction architecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but also achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed LongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during length extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention patterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink (initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are well-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their GPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just theoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to have direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention layers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data is sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.   We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its effectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts, LongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%, compared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV cache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding speedup.

**Summary**: This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.

### F2: Designing a Key-Value Store for Large Skewed Workloads
**Authors**: Konstantinos Kanellis, Badrish Chandramouli, Shivaram Venkataraman

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T01:50:27Z

**Summary**: Many real-world workloads present a challenging set of requirements: point operations requiring high throughput, working sets much larger than main memory, and natural skew in key access patterns for both reads and writes. We find that modern key-value designs are either optimized for memory-efficiency, sacrificing high-performance (LSM-tree designs), or achieve high-performance, saturating modern NVMe SSD bandwidth, at the cost of substantial memory resources or high disk wear (CPU-optimized designs). Unfortunately these designs are not able to handle meet the challenging demands of such larger-than-memory, skewed workloads.   To this end, we present F2, a new key-value store that bridges this gap by combining the strengths of both approaches. F2 adopts a tiered, record-oriented architecture inspired by LSM-trees to effectively separate hot from cold records, while incorporating concurrent latch-free mechanisms from CPU-optimized engines to maximize performance on modern NVMe SSDs. To realize this design, we tackle key challenges and introduce several innovations, including new latch-free algorithms for multi-threaded log compaction and user operations (e.g., RMWs), as well as new components: a two-level hash index to reduce indexing overhead for cold records and a read-cache for serving read-hot data.   Detailed experimental results show that F2 matches or outperforms existing solutions, achieving on average better throughput on memory-constrained environments compared to state-of-the-art systems like RocksDB (11.75x), SplinterDB (4.52x), KVell (10.56x), LeanStore (2.04x), and FASTER (2.38x). F2 also maintains its high performance across varying workload skewness levels and memory budgets, while achieving low disk write amplification.

### Marconi: Prefix Caching for the Era of Hybrid LLMs
**Authors**: Rui Pan, Zhuang Wang, Zhen Jia, Can Karakus, Luca Zancato, Tri Dao, Yida Wang, Ravi Netravali

**Updated**: 2024-12-04T18:40:24Z

**Summary**: Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention layers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have gained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model serving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of complementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip redundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place state updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for partial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits; the effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which yield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that supports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its novel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential cache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their reuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the compute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse workloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\times$ higher token hit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix caching systems.

### Measurement of electron beam induced sample heating in SEM experiments
**Authors**: Christina Koenig, Alice Bastos da Silva Fanta, Joerg R. Jinschek

**Updated**: 2024-12-04T14:47:42Z

**Summary**: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) experiments provide detailed insights into material microstructures, enabling high-resolution imaging as well as crystallographic analysis through advanced techniques like Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD). However, the interaction of the high-energy electron beam with the material can lead to localized heating, which may significantly impact specimen integrity, especially in applications requiring prolonged beam exposure, for instance when mapping the crystal structure using EBSD. This study examines electron-beam-induced heating effects on a model metal sample (iron), directly measuring the locally deposited electron beam energy with a MEMS-based heating device and validating these measurements through simulations, including Monte Carlo and Finite Element methods. The analysis focuses on the effects of various experimental parameters such as acceleration voltage (from 5 to 30 kV), beam current (from 0.17 nA to 22 nA), dwell time (from 1$\mu$s to 1ms) and sample tilt (0{\deg} to 70{\deg}). The findings reveal that local sample temperatures can increase by up to 70 {\deg}C during EBSD experiments, primarily affected by the choice in beam current and acceleration voltage, with beam current having the most significant impact.

### ClusterKV: Manipulating LLM KV Cache in Semantic Space for Recallable   Compression
**Authors**: Guangda Liu, Chengwei Li, Jieru Zhao, Chenqi Zhang, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-12-04T10:58:27Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in a variety of applications, and the context length is rapidly increasing to handle tasks such as long-document QA and complex logical reasoning. However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency.

### Unifying KV Cache Compression for Large Language Models with LeanKV
**Authors**: Yanqi Zhang, Yuwei Hu, Runyuan Zhao, John C. S. Lui, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-04T08:51:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance but incur high serving costs due to substantial memory demands, with the key-value (KV) cache being a primary bottleneck. Existing KV cache compression methods, including quantization and pruning, struggle with limitations such as uniform treatment of keys and values and static memory allocation across attention heads. To address these challenges, we introduce LeanKV, a unified KV cache compression framework that enhances LLM serving efficiency without compromising accuracy through three innovations: (1) Hetero-KV quantization, which stores keys at a higher precision than values to reflect their greater impact on attention computations; (2) per-head dynamic sparsity, which allocates memory based on token importance per head and per request; and (3) unified KV compression, integrating mixed-precision quantization and selective pruning to enable a smooth tradeoff between model accuracy and memory efficiency. To efficiently support these techniques, LeanKV introduces systems optimizations including unified paging and on-GPU parallel memory management. Implemented on vLLM, LeanKV compresses the KV cache by $3.0\times$ to $5.0\times$ without accuracy loss and up to $11.0\times$ with under 5% accuracy loss, enhancing throughput by $1.9\times$ to $2.5\times$, and up to $6.9\times$.

### PASCAL: A Learning-aided Cooperative Bandwidth Control Policy for   Hierarchical Storage Systems
**Authors**: Xijun Li, Yunfan Zhou, Ji Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-04T05:32:12Z

**Summary**: Nowadays, the Hierarchical Storage System (HSS) is considered as an ideal model to meet the cost-performance demand. The data migration between storing tiers of HSS is the way to achieve the cost-performance goal. The bandwidth control is to limit the maximum amount of data migration. Most of previous research about HSS focus on studying the data migration policy instead of bandwidth control. However, the recent research about cache and networking optimization suggest that the bandwidth control has significant impact on the system performance. Few previous work achieves a satisfactory bandwidth control in HSS since it is hard to control bandwidth for so many data migration tasks simultaneously. In this paper, we first give a stochastic programming model to formalize the bandwidth control problem in HSS. Then we propose a learning-aided bandwidth control policy for HSS, named \Pascal{}, which learns to control the bandwidth of different data migration task in an cooperative way. We implement \Pascal{} on a commercial HSS and compare it with three strong baselines over a group of workloads. Our evaluation on the physical system shows that \Pascal{} can effectively decrease 1.95X the tail latency and greatly improve throughput stability (2X $\downarrow$ throughput jitter), and meanwhile keep the throughput at a relatively high level.

### A Multi-Functional Web Tool for Comprehensive Threat Detection Through   IP Address Analysis
**Authors**: Cebajel Tanan, Sameer G. Kulkarni, Tamal Das, Manjesh K. Hanawal

**Updated**: 2024-12-04T04:29:12Z

**Summary**: In recent years, the advances in digitalisation have also adversely contributed to the significant rise in cybercrimes. Hence, building the threat intelligence to shield against rising cybercrimes has become a fundamental requisite. Internet Protocol (IP) addresses play a crucial role in the threat intelligence and prevention of cyber crimes. However, we have noticed the lack of one-stop, free, and open-source tools that can analyse IP addresses. Hence, this work introduces a comprehensive web tool for advanced IP address characterisation. Our tool offers a wide range of features, including geolocation, blocklist check, VPN detection, proxy detection, bot detection, Tor detection, port scan, and accurate domain statistics that include the details about the name servers and registrar information. In addition, our tool calculates a confidence score based on a weighted sum of publicly accessible online results from different reliable sources to give users a dependable measure of accuracy. Further, to improve performance, our tool also incorporates a local database for caching the results, to enable fast content retrieval with minimal external Web API calls. Our tool supports domain names and IPv4 addresses, making it a multi-functional and powerful IP analyser tool for threat intelligence. Our tool is available at www.ipanalyzer.in

### cRVR: A Stackelberg Game Approach for Joint Privacy-Aware Video   Requesting and Edge Caching
**Authors**: Xianzhi Zhang, Linchang Xiao, Yipeng Zhou, Miao Hu, Di Wu, John C. S. Lui, Quan Z. Sheng

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T22:48:09Z

**Summary**: As users conveniently stream their favorite online videos, video request records are automatically stored by video content providers, which have a high chance of privacy leakage. Unfortunately, most existing privacy-enhancing approaches are not applicable for protecting user privacy in video requests, because they cannot be easily altered or distorted by users and must be visible for content providers to stream correct videos. To preserve request privacy in online video services, it is possible to request additional videos that are irrelevant to users' interests so that content providers cannot precisely infer users' interest information. However, a naive redundant requesting approach would significantly degrade the performance of edge caches and increase bandwidth overhead. In this paper, we are among the first to propose a Cache-Friendly Redundant Video Requesting (cRVR) algorithm for User Devices (UDs) and its corresponding caching algorithm for the Edge Cache (EC), which can effectively mitigate the problem of request privacy leakage with minimal impact on the EC's performance. To tackle the problem, we first develop a Stackelberg game to analyze the dedicated interaction between UDs and EC, and obtain their optimal strategies to maximize their respective utility. For UDs, the utility function is a combination of both video playback utility and privacy protection utility. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium of the Stackelberg game. Extensive experiments are conducted with real traces to demonstrate that cRVR can effectively protect video request privacy by reducing up to 59.03\% of privacy disclosure compared to baseline algorithms. Meanwhile, the caching performance of EC is only slightly affected.

### GoldFish: Serverless Actors with Short-Term Memory State for the   Edge-Cloud Continuum
**Authors**: Cynthia Marcelino, Jack Shahhoud, Stefan Nastic

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T22:02:42Z

**Summary**: Serverless Computing is a computing paradigm that provides efficient infrastructure management and elastic scalability. Serverless functions scale up or down based on demand, which means that functions are not directly addressable and rely on platform-managed invocation. Serverless stateless nature requires functions to leverage external services, such as object storage and KVS, to exchange data. Serverless actors have emerged as a solution to these issues. However, the state-of-the-art serverless lifecycle and event-trigger invocation force actors to leverage remote services to manage their state and exchange data, which impacts the performance and incurs additional costs and dependency on third-party services.   To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel serverless lifecycle model that allows short-term stateful actors, enabling actors to maintain their state between executions. Additionally, we propose a novel serverless Invocation Model that enables serverless actors to influence the processing of future messages. We present GoldFish, a lightweight WebAssembly short-term stateful serverless actor platform that provides a novel serverless actor lifecycle and invocation model. GoldFish leverages WebAssembly to provide the actors with lightweight sandbox isolation, making them suitable for the Edge-Cloud Continuum, where computational resources are limited. Experimental results show that GoldFish optimizes the data exchange latency by up to 92% and increases the throughput by up to 10x compared to OpenFaaS and Spin.

### Dynamic-LLaVA: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models via Dynamic   Vision-language Context Sparsification
**Authors**: Wenxuan Huang, Zijie Zhai, Yunhang Shen, Shaoshen Cao, Fei Zhao, Xiangfeng Xu, Zheyu Ye, Shaohui Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T16:12:09Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/Osilly/dynamic_llava .

### Value Residual Learning For Alleviating Attention Concentration In   Transformers
**Authors**: Zhanchao Zhou, Tianyi Wu, Zhiyun Jiang, Zhenzhong Lan

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T12:36:19Z

**Summary**: Transformers can capture long-range dependencies using self-attention, allowing tokens to attend to all others directly. However, stacking multiple attention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address this issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier layers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is computationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with residual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through adding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all subsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with single layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding from first layer. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer achieves equivalent validation loss with 10.4% fewer model parameters and 13.6% less training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory usage and computational cost. Besides, SVFormer reduces KV cache size by nearly half with only a small performance penalty and can be integrated with other KV-efficient methods, yielding further reductions in KV cache, with performance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate. Further visualization results suggest that Resformer and SVFormer alleviate attention concentration in deeper layers through avoiding value-state drains and enhance representation across most layers.

### Compressing KV Cache for Long-Context LLM Inference with Inter-Layer   Attention Similarity
**Authors**: Da Ma, Lu Chen, Situo Zhang, Yuxun Miao, Su Zhu, Zhi Chen, Hongshen Xu, Hanqi Li, Shuai Fan, Lei Pan, Kai Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T08:29:27Z

**Summary**: The increasing context window size in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT and LLaMA series, has improved their ability to tackle complex, long-text tasks, but at the cost of inference efficiency, particularly regarding memory and computational complexity. Existing methods, including selective token retention and window-based attention, improve efficiency but risk discarding important tokens needed for future text generation. In this paper, we propose an approach that enhances LLM efficiency without token loss by reducing the memory and computational load of less important tokens, rather than discarding them.We address two challenges: 1) investigating the distribution of important tokens in the context, discovering recent tokens are more important than distant tokens in context, and 2) optimizing resources for distant tokens by sharing attention scores across layers. The experiments show that our method saves $35\%$ KV cache without compromising the performance.

### Improving Sequential Recommender Systems with Online and In-store User   Behavior
**Authors**: Luyi Ma, Aashika Padmanabhan, Anjana Ganesh, Shengwei Tang, Jiao Chen, Xiaohan Li, Lalitesh Morishetti, Kaushiki Nag, Malay Patel, Jason Cho, Sushant Kumar, Kannan Achan

**Updated**: 2024-12-03T03:20:40Z

**Summary**: Online e-commerce platforms have been extending in-store shopping, which allows users to keep the canonical online browsing and checkout experience while exploring in-store shopping. However, the growing transition between online and in-store becomes a challenge to sequential recommender systems for future online interaction prediction due to the lack of holistic modeling of hybrid user behaviors (online and in-store). The challenges are twofold. First, combining online and in-store user behavior data into a single data schema and supporting multiple stages in the model life cycle (pre-training, training, inference, etc.) organically needs a new data pipeline design. Second, online recommender systems, which solely rely on online user behavior sequences, must be redesigned to support online and in-store user data as input under the sequential modeling setting. To overcome the first challenge, we propose a hybrid, omnichannel data pipeline to compile online and in-store user behavior data by caching information from diverse data sources. Later, we introduce a model-agnostic encoder module to the sequential recommender system to interpret the user in-store transaction and augment the modeling capacity for better online interaction prediction given the hybrid user behavior.

### Development and Application of a Decentralized Domain Name Service
**Authors**: Guang Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T20:39:56Z

**Summary**: The current Domain Name System (DNS), as a core infrastructure of the internet, exhibits several shortcomings: its centralized architecture leads to censorship risks and single points of failure, making domain name resolution vulnerable to attacks. The lack of encryption in the resolution process exposes it to DNS hijacking and cache poisoning attacks. Additionally, the high operational costs limit participation and innovation among small to medium-sized users. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Decentralized Domain Name Service (DDNS) based on blockchain (Phicoin) and distributed storage (IPFS). By leveraging the immutability of blockchain and the content verification of IPFS, the system achieves decentralized storage and distribution of domain name records, eliminating the centralized dependencies of traditional DNS. With a block time of 15 seconds, the system supports rapid broadcasting of domain name updates, significantly improving resolution efficiency. The DDNS aims to serve as a complement or backup to the existing DNS system, providing a pollution-resistant, censorship-resistant, high-performance, and low-cost domain name resolution solution, offering a new technical path for the security and stability of the internet.

### RandAR: Decoder-only Autoregressive Visual Generation in Random Orders
**Authors**: Ziqi Pang, Tianyuan Zhang, Fujun Luan, Yunze Man, Hao Tan, Kai Zhang, William T. Freeman, Yu-Xiong Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T18:59:53Z

**Summary**: We introduce RandAR, a decoder-only visual autoregressive (AR) model capable of generating images in arbitrary token orders. Unlike previous decoder-only AR models that rely on a predefined generation order, RandAR removes this inductive bias, unlocking new capabilities in decoder-only generation. Our essential design enables random order by inserting a "position instruction token" before each image token to be predicted, representing the spatial location of the next image token. Trained on randomly permuted token sequences -- a more challenging task than fixed-order generation, RandAR achieves comparable performance to its conventional raster-order counterpart. More importantly, decoder-only transformers trained from random orders acquire new capabilities. For the efficiency bottleneck of AR models, RandAR adopts parallel decoding with KV-Cache at inference time, enjoying 2.5x acceleration without sacrificing generation quality. Additionally, RandAR supports inpainting, outpainting and resolution extrapolation in a zero-shot manner. We hope RandAR inspires new directions for decoder-only visual generation models and broadens their applications across diverse scenarios. Our project page is at https://rand-ar.github.io/.

### Local and Regional Contributions to Tropospheric Ozone Concentrations
**Authors**: Callum E. Flowerday, Ryan Thalman, Jaron C. Hansen

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T16:10:26Z

**Summary**: The Wasatch Front in Utah, USA, is currently a non-attainment area for ozone according to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Nitrogen oxides ($\mathrm{NO_x = NO_2 + NO}$) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in the presence of sunlight, lead to ozone formation in the troposphere. When the rate of oxidant production, defined as the sum of $\mathrm{O_3}$ and $\mathrm{NO_2}$, is faster than the rate of $\mathrm{NO_x}$ production, a region is said to be $\mathrm{NO_x}$limited, and ozone formation will be limited by the concentration of $\mathrm{NO_x}$ species in the region. The inverse of this situation makes the region VOC-limited. Knowing whether a region is $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited or VOC-limited can aid in generating effective mitigation strategies. Understanding the background or regional contributions to ozone in a region, whether from the transport of precursors or of ozone, provides information about the lower limit for ozone concentrations that a region can achieve through regulation of local precursors. In this paper, measured oxidant and $\mathrm{NO_x}$ concentrations are analyzed from 14 counties in the state of Utah to calculate the regional and local contributions to ozone for each region. This analysis is used to determine the nature of the atmosphere in each county by identifying whether the region is VOC or $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Furthermore, this analysis is performed for each county for the years 2012 and 2022 to assess changes in the oxidative nature and quantify regional and local contributions to ozone over a 10-year period. All studied counties--except for Washington County--in Utah were found to be VOC-limited in 2012. This shifted in 2022, with most counties being either in a transitional state or $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Local contributions to ozone increased in two major counties, Cache and Salt Lake Counties, but decreased in Carbon, Davis, Duchesne, Uinta, Utah, Washington, and Weber Counties. Generally, the regional contributions to oxidant concentrations decreased across the state. A summertime spike in both regional and local contributions to oxidants was observed. Smoke from wildfires was found to increase regional contributions to oxidants and shift the local regime to be more $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited.

**Summary**: Experimental data and results of numerical simulations are presented, concerning excitation of narrowband gigahertz-range wave trains in coaxial guiding structures that are partially filled with ferromagnetic material and may involve periodically arranged metal inserts. The experiments performed confirm the possibility of exciting weakly damped electromagnetic waves by feeding high voltage, unilateral electromagnetic pulses of short duration into the line. The coax line was of outer diameter 50.5 mm, filled with an isotropic dielectric (relative dielectric constant {\epsilon} = 2.25) and a set of ferrite rings with {\epsilon}=16 and saturated-state {\mu} about 4 to 5. With a peak voltage of the primary pulse close to 160 kV and a magnetizing field of 17.5 kA/m, the parameters of the waves excited reached magnitudes as: frequency 1.89 GHz to 2.1 GHz; bandwidth 16%; VHF power at the output about 20 MW.

**Authors**: Tiancheng Zhao, Peng Liu, Xuan He, Lu Zhang, Kyusong Lee

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T11:24:20Z

**Summary**: End-to-end transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have shown exceptional performance in both closed-set and open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) tasks through the integration of language modalities. However, their demanding computational requirements have hindered their practical application in real-time object detection (OD) scenarios. In this paper, we scrutinize the limitations of two leading models in the OVDEval benchmark, OmDet and Grounding-DINO, and introduce OmDet-Turbo. This novel transformer-based real-time OVD model features an innovative Efficient Fusion Head (EFH) module designed to alleviate the bottlenecks observed in OmDet and Grounding-DINO. Notably, OmDet-Turbo-Base achieves a 100.2 frames per second (FPS) with TensorRT and language cache techniques applied. Notably, in zero-shot scenarios on COCO and LVIS datasets, OmDet-Turbo achieves performance levels nearly on par with current state-of-the-art supervised models. Furthermore, it establishes new state-of-the-art benchmarks on ODinW and OVDEval, boasting an AP of 30.1 and an NMS-AP of 26.86, respectively. The practicality of OmDet-Turbo in industrial applications is underscored by its exceptional performance on benchmark datasets and superior inference speed, positioning it as a compelling choice for real-time object detection tasks.

### Efficient LLM Inference using Dynamic Input Pruning and Cache-Aware   Masking
**Authors**: Marco Federici, Davide Belli, Mart van Baalen, Amir Jalalirad, Andrii Skliar, Bence Major, Markus Nagel, Paul Whatmough

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T11:07:51Z

**Summary**: While mobile devices provide ever more compute power, improvements in DRAM bandwidth are much slower. This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM) token generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to leverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce effective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU instead of ReLU, which result in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU activations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns are difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To circumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a predictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with minimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain some performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel cache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation magnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on mobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and throughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP achieves a 46% reduction in memory and 40% increase in throughput with $<$ 0.1 loss in perplexity.

### Memory-Efficient Training for Deep Speaker Embedding Learning in Speaker   Verification
**Authors**: Bei Liu, Yanmin Qian

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T06:57:46Z

**Summary**: Recent speaker verification (SV) systems have shown a trend toward adopting deeper speaker embedding extractors. Although deeper and larger neural networks can significantly improve performance, their substantial memory requirements hinder training on consumer GPUs. In this paper, we explore a memory-efficient training strategy for deep speaker embedding learning in resource-constrained scenarios. Firstly, we conduct a systematic analysis of GPU memory allocation during SV system training. Empirical observations show that activations and optimizer states are the main sources of memory consumption. For activations, we design two types of reversible neural networks which eliminate the need to store intermediate activations during back-propagation, thereby significantly reducing memory usage without performance loss. For optimizer states, we introduce a dynamic quantization approach that replaces the original 32-bit floating-point values with a dynamic tree-based 8-bit data type. Experimental results on VoxCeleb demonstrate that the reversible variants of ResNets and DF-ResNets can perform training without the need to cache activations in GPU memory. In addition, the 8-bit versions of SGD and Adam save 75% of memory costs while maintaining performance compared to their 32-bit counterparts. Finally, a detailed comparison of memory usage and performance indicates that our proposed models achieve up to 16.2x memory savings, with nearly identical parameters and performance compared to the vanilla systems. In contrast to the previous need for multiple high-end GPUs such as the A100, we can effectively train deep speaker embedding extractors with just one or two consumer-level 2080Ti GPUs.

### JC5A: Service Delay Minimization for Aerial MEC-assisted Industrial   Cyber-Physical Systems
**Authors**: Geng Sun, Jiaxu Wu, Zemin Sun, Long He, Jiacheng Wang, Dusit Niyato, Abbas Jamalipour, Shiwen Mao

**Updated**: 2024-12-02T06:30:04Z

**Summary**: In the era of the sixth generation (6G) and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), an industrial cyber-physical system (ICPS) drives the proliferation of sensor devices and computing-intensive tasks. To address the limited resources of IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and cost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs). However, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and computation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges, including the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources, stringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board energy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative aerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing capabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a service delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP). Since the SDMOP is proved to be an NP-hard problem, we propose a joint computation offloading, caching, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control approach (JC5A). Specifically, JC5A consists of a block successive upper bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUMM) for computation offloading and service caching, a convex optimization-based method for communication and computation resource allocation, and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method for UAV trajectory control. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence and polynomial complexity of JC5A. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior system performance compared to the benchmark approaches and algorithms.

### Optimal Power Allocation in Uplink NOMA with Simultaneous Cache-Enabled   D2D Communications
**Authors**: Aditya Powari, Daniel K. C. So

**Updated**: 2024-12-01T21:47:35Z

**Summary**: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is widely viewed as a potential candidate for providing enhanced multiple access in future mobile networks by eliminating the orthogonal distribution of radio resources amongst the users. Nevertheless, the performance of NOMA can be significantly improved by combining it with other sophisticated technologies such as wireless data caching and device-to-device (D2D) communications. In this letter, we propose a novel cellular system model which integrates uplink NOMA with cache based device-to-device (D2D) communications. The proposed system would enable a cellular user to upload data file to base station while simultaneously exchanging useful cache content with another nearby user. We maximize the system sum rate by deriving closed form solutions for optimal power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model over other potential combinations of uplink NOMA and D2D communications.

### Advanced Video Inpainting Using Optical Flow-Guided Efficient Diffusion
**Authors**: Bohai Gu, Hao Luo, Song Guo, Peiran Dong

**Updated**: 2024-12-01T15:45:26Z

**Summary**: Recently, diffusion-based methods have achieved great improvements in the video inpainting task. However, these methods still face many challenges, such as maintaining temporal consistency and the time-consuming issue. This paper proposes an advanced video inpainting framework using optical Flow-guided Efficient Diffusion, called FloED. Specifically, FloED employs a dual-branch architecture, where a flow branch first restores corrupted flow and a multi-scale flow adapter provides motion guidance to the main inpainting branch. Additionally, a training-free latent interpolation method is proposed to accelerate the multi-step denoising process using flow warping. Further introducing a flow attention cache mechanism, FLoED efficiently reduces the computational cost brought by incorporating optical flow. Comprehensive experiments in both background restoration and object removal tasks demonstrate that FloED outperforms state-of-the-art methods from the perspective of both performance and efficiency.

### SpecExec: Massively Parallel Speculative Decoding for Interactive LLM   Inference on Consumer Devices
**Authors**: Ruslan Svirschevski, Avner May, Zhuoming Chen, Beidi Chen, Zhihao Jia, Max Ryabinin

**Updated**: 2024-11-30T21:33:59Z

**Summary**: As large language models gain widespread adoption, running them efficiently becomes crucial. Recent works on LLM inference use speculative decoding to achieve extreme speedups. However, most of these works implicitly design their algorithms for high-end datacenter hardware. In this work, we ask the opposite question: how fast can we run LLMs on consumer machines? Consumer GPUs can no longer fit the largest available models (50B+ parameters) and must offload them to RAM or SSD. When running with offloaded parameters, the inference engine can process batches of hundreds or thousands of tokens at the same time as just one token, making it a natural fit for speculative decoding. We propose SpecExec (Speculative Execution), a simple parallel decoding method that can generate up to 20 tokens per target model iteration for popular LLM families. It utilizes the high spikiness of the token probabilities distribution in modern LLMs and a high degree of alignment between model output probabilities. SpecExec takes the most probable tokens continuation from the draft model to build a "cache" tree for the target model, which then gets validated in a single pass. Using SpecExec, we demonstrate inference of 50B+ parameter LLMs on consumer GPUs with RAM offloading at 4-6 tokens per second with 4-bit quantization or 2-3 tokens per second with 16-bit weights.

**Authors**: Thijs Steel, Julien Langou

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T10:21:12Z

**Summary**: We present an efficient algorithm for the application of sequences of planar rotations to a matrix. Applying such sequences efficiently is important in many numerical linear algebra algorithms for eigenvalues. Our algorithm is novel in three main ways. First, we introduce a new kernel that is optimized for register reuse in a novel way. Second, we introduce a blocking and packing scheme that improves the cache efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, we thoroughly analyze the memory operations of the algorithm which leads to important theoretical insights and makes it easier to select good parameters. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves a flop rate close to the theoretical peak on modern hardware.

### DID Link: Authentication in TLS with Decentralized Identifiers and   Verifiable Credentials
**Authors**: Sandro Rodriguez Garzon, Dennis Natusch, Artur Philipp, Axel Küpper, Hans Joachim Einsiedler, Daniela Schneider

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:48:01Z

**Summary**: Authentication in TLS is predominately carried out with X.509 digital certificates issued by certificate authorities (CA). The centralized nature of current public key infrastructures, however, comes along with severe risks, such as single points of failure and susceptibility to cyber-attacks, potentially undermining the security and trustworthiness of the entire system. With Decentralized Identifiers (DID) alongside distributed ledger technology, it becomes technically feasible to prove ownership of a unique identifier without requiring an attestation of the proof's public key by a centralized and therefore vulnerable CA. This article presents DID Link, a novel authentication scheme for TLS 1.3 that empowers entities to authenticate in a TLS-compliant way with self-issued X.509 certificates that are equipped with ledger-anchored DIDs instead of CA-issued identifiers. It facilitates the exchange of tamper-proof and 3rd-party attested claims in the form of DID-bound Verifiable Credentials after the TLS handshake to complete the authentication with a full identification of the communication partner. A prototypical implementation shows comparable TLS handshake durations of DID Link if verification material is cached and reasonable prolongations if it is obtained from a ledger. The significant speed improvement of the resulting TLS channel over a widely used, DID-based alternative transport protocol on the application layer demonstrates the potential of DID Link to become a viable solution for the establishment of secure and trustful end-to-end communication links with decentrally managed digital identities.

### InputSnatch: Stealing Input in LLM Services via Timing Side-Channel   Attacks
**Authors**: Xinyao Zheng, Husheng Han, Shangyi Shi, Qiyan Fang, Zidong Du, Xing Hu, Qi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T08:33:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and question-answering capabilities, having been widely deployed in privacy-sensitive domains like finance and medical consultation. During LLM inferences, cache-sharing methods are commonly employed to enhance efficiency by reusing cached states or responses for the same or similar inference requests. However, we identify that these cache mechanisms pose a risk of private input leakage, as the caching can result in observable variations in response times, making them a strong candidate for a timing-based attack hint.   In this study, we propose a novel timing-based side-channel attack to execute input theft in LLMs inference. The cache-based attack faces the challenge of constructing candidate inputs in a large search space to hit and steal cached user queries. To address these challenges, we propose two primary components. The input constructor employs machine learning techniques and LLM-based approaches for vocabulary correlation learning while implementing optimized search mechanisms for generalized input construction. The time analyzer implements statistical time fitting with outlier elimination to identify cache hit patterns, continuously providing feedback to refine the constructor's search strategy. We conduct experiments across two cache mechanisms and the results demonstrate that our approach consistently attains high attack success rates in various applications. Our work highlights the security vulnerabilities associated with performance optimizations, underscoring the necessity of prioritizing privacy and security alongside enhancements in LLM inference.

### BatchLLM: Optimizing Large Batched LLM Inference with Global Prefix   Sharing and Throughput-oriented Token Batching
**Authors**: Zhen Zheng, Xin Ji, Taosong Fang, Fanghao Zhou, Chuanjie Liu, Gang Peng

**Updated**: 2024-11-29T05:57:37Z

**Summary**: Many LLM tasks are performed in large batches or even offline, and the performance indictor for which is throughput. These tasks usually show the characteristic of prefix sharing, where different prompt input can partially show the common prefix. However, the existing LLM inference engines tend to optimize the streaming requests and show limitations of supporting the large batched tasks with the prefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions use the LRU-based cache to reuse the KV context of common prefix. The KV context that is about to be reused may prematurely be evicted with the implicit cache management. Even if not evicted, the lifetime of the shared KV context is extended since requests sharing the same context are not scheduled together, resulting in larger memory usage. These streaming oriented systems schedule the requests in the first-come-first-serve or similar order. As a result, the requests with larger ratio of decoding steps may be scheduled too late to be able to mix with the prefill chunks to increase the hardware utilization. Besides, the token and request number based batching can limit the size of token-batch, which keeps the GPU from saturating for the iterations dominated by decoding tokens. We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM explicitly identifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the same prefix will be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best, which also shrinks the lifetime of common KV memory. BatchLLM reorders the requests and schedules the requests with larger ratio of decoding first to better mix the decoding tokens with the latter prefill chunks and applies memory-centric token batching to enlarge the token-batch sizes, which helps to increase the GPU utilization. Extensive evaluation shows that BatchLLM outperforms vLLM by 1.1x to 2x on a set of microbenchmarks and two typical industry workloads.

### Reflecting Intelligent Surfaces-Assisted Multiple-Antenna Coded Caching
**Authors**: Xiaofan Niu, Minquan Cheng, Kai Wan, Robert Caiming Qiu, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T16:35:22Z

**Summary**: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been treated as a core technique in improving wireless propagation environments for the next generation wireless communication systems. This paper proposes a new coded caching problem, referred to as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-antenna coded caching, which is composed of a server with multiple antennas and some single-antenna cache-aided users. Different from the existing multi-antenna coded caching problems, we introduce a passive RIS (with limited number of units) into the systems to further increase the multicast gain (i.e., degrees of freedom (DoF)) in the transmission, which is done by using RIS-assisted interference nulling. That is, by using RIS, we can `erase' any path between one transmission antenna and one receive antenna. We first propose a new RIS-assisted interference nulling approach to search for the phase-shift coefficients of RIS for the sake of interference nulling, which converges faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm. After erasing some paths in each time slot, the delivery can be divided into several non-overlapping groups including transmission antennas and users, where in each group the transmission antennas serve the contained users without suffering interference from the transmissions by other groups. The division of groups for the sake of maximizing the DoF could be formulated into a combinatorial optimization problem. We propose a grouping algorithm which can find the optimal solution with low complexity, and the corresponding coded caching scheme achieving this DoF.

### Fresh Caching of Dynamic Contents using Restless Multi-armed Bandits
**Authors**: Ankita Koley, Chandramani Singh

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T14:42:54Z

**Summary**: We consider a dynamic content caching problem wherein the contents get updated at a central server, and local copies of a subset of contents are cached at a local cache associated with a Base station (BS). When a content request arrives, based on whether the content is in the local cache, the BS can decide whether to fetch the content from the central server or serve the cached version from the local cache. Fetching a content incurs a fixed fetching cost, and serving the cached version incurs an ageing cost proportional to the age-of-version (AoV) of the content. The BS has only partial information regarding AoVs of the contents. We formulate an optimal content fetching and caching problem to minimize the average cost subject to cache capacity constraints. The problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality and is provably hard to solve. We formulate this problem as a continuous time restless multi-armed bandit process (RMAB), where a single content problem of the corresponding RMAB is a partially observable Markov decision process. We reformulate the single content problem as a semi-Markov decision process, prove indexability, and provide a Whittle index based solution to this problem. Finally, we compare the performance with recent work and show that our proposed policy is optimal via simulations.

### Timestep Embedding Tells: It's Time to Cache for Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Feng Liu, Shiwei Zhang, Xiaofeng Wang, Yujie Wei, Haonan Qiu, Yuzhong Zhao, Yingya Zhang, Qixiang Ye, Fang Wan

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T12:50:05Z

**Summary**: As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are challenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising. Previous methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at uniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that differences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders selecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance between inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce Timestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach that estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs across timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs, TeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the modeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first modulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their differences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then introduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and utilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache achieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07% Vbench score) degradation of visual quality.

### MiniKV: Pushing the Limits of LLM Inference via 2-Bit   Layer-Discriminative KV Cache
**Authors**: Akshat Sharma, Hangliang Ding, Jianping Li, Neel Dani, Minjia Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-28T02:01:50Z

**Summary**: How to efficiently serve LLMs in practice has become exceptionally challenging due to their prohibitive memory and computation requirements. In this study, we investigate optimizing the KV cache, whose memory footprint poses a critical bottleneck in LLM inference, especially when dealing with long context tasks. To tackle the challenge, we introduce MiniKV, a KV cache optimization method that simultaneously preserves long context task accuracy while significantly reducing KV cache size via a novel 2-bit layer-discriminative KV cache. More importantly, we develop specialized CUDA kernels to make MiniKV compatible with FlashAttention. Experiments on a wide range of long context tasks show that MiniKV effectively achieves 86% KV cache compression ratio while recovering over 98.5% of accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while achieving excellent measured system performance improvements.

### Mixture of Cache-Conditional Experts for Efficient Mobile Device   Inference
**Authors**: Andrii Skliar, Ties van Rozendaal, Romain Lepert, Todor Boinovski, Mart van Baalen, Markus Nagel, Paul Whatmough, Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T18:59:48Z

**Summary**: Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs have recently gained attention for their ability to enhance performance by selectively engaging specialized subnetworks or "experts" for each input. However, deploying MoEs on memory-constrained devices remains challenging, particularly when generating tokens sequentially with a batch size of one, as opposed to typical high-throughput settings involving long sequences or large batches. In this work, we optimize MoE on memory-constrained devices where only a subset of expert weights fit in DRAM. We introduce a novel cache-aware routing strategy that leverages expert reuse during token generation to improve cache locality. We evaluate our approach on language modeling, MMLU, and GSM8K benchmarks and present on-device results demonstrating 2$\times$ speedups on mobile devices, offering a flexible, training-free solution to extend MoE's applicability across real-world applications.

### OASIS-UROS: Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors -- Upgraded,   Refined, and Overhauled Software
**Authors**: Oliver Maximilian Zobel, Johannes Maierhofer, Andreas Köstler, Daniel J. Rixen

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T18:09:29Z

**Summary**: OASIS-UROS continues the previously published Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors (OASIS). While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this version improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching system and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a higher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and software-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and power supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now achieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This paper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all materials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system was validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal analysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial one in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS cannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed system can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller companies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as adaptability of the hardware and software.

### cedar: Optimized and Unified Machine Learning Input Data Pipelines
**Authors**: Mark Zhao, Emanuel Adamiak, Christos Kozyrakis

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T18:05:57Z

**Summary**: The input data pipeline is an essential component of each machine learning (ML) training job. It is responsible for reading massive amounts of training data, processing batches of samples using complex transformations, and loading them onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant input data systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing data volumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data systems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in hugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources - or worse - underutilize expensive accelerators.   To address these demands, we present cedar, an optimized and unified programming framework for ML input data pipelines. cedar allows users to define input data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML frameworks and libraries. cedar introduces an extensible optimizer that systematically applies a complex combination of optimizations (e.g., offloading, caching, prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It orchestrates processing across a customizable set of local and distributed compute resources in order to improve processing performance and efficiency, all without user input. Across eight pipelines, cedar improves performance by up to 1.87x to 10.65x compared to state-of-the-art input data systems.

### FastSwitch: Optimizing Context Switching Efficiency in Fairness-aware   Large Language Model Serving
**Authors**: Ao Shen, Zhiyao Li, Mingyu Gao

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T15:07:28Z

**Summary**: Serving numerous users and requests concurrently requires good fairness in Large Language Models (LLMs) serving system. This ensures that, at the same cost, the system can meet the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of more users , such as time to first token (TTFT) and time between tokens (TBT), rather than allowing a few users to experience performance far exceeding the SLOs. To achieve better fairness, the preemption-based scheduling policy dynamically adjusts the priority of each request to maintain balance during runtime. However, existing systems tend to overly prioritize throughput, overlooking the overhead caused by preemption-induced context switching, which is crucial for maintaining fairness through priority adjustments. In this work, we identify three main challenges that result in this overhead. 1) Inadequate I/O utilization. 2) GPU idleness. 3) Unnecessary I/O transmission during multi-turn conversations. Our key insight is that the block-based KV cache memory policy in existing systems, while achieving near-zero memory waste, leads to discontinuity and insufficient granularity in the KV cache memory. To respond, we introduce FastSwitch, a fairness-aware serving system that not only aligns with existing KV cache memory allocation policy but also mitigates context switching overhead. Our evaluation shows that FastSwitch outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM with speedups of 1.4-11.2x across different tail TTFT and TBT.

### Accelerating Vision Diffusion Transformers with Skip Branches
**Authors**: Guanjie Chen, Xinyu Zhao, Yucheng Zhou, Tianlong Chen, Yu Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T14:43:46Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT), an emerging image and video generation model architecture, has demonstrated great potential because of its high generation quality and scalability properties. Despite the impressive performance, its practical deployment is constrained by computational complexity and redundancy in the sequential denoising process. While feature caching across timesteps has proven effective in accelerating diffusion models, its application to DiT is limited by fundamental architectural differences from U-Net-based approaches. Through empirical analysis of DiT feature dynamics, we identify that significant feature variation between DiT blocks presents a key challenge for feature reusability. To address this, we convert standard DiT into Skip-DiT with skip branches to enhance feature smoothness. Further, we introduce Skip-Cache which utilizes the skip branches to cache DiT features across timesteps at the inference time. We validated effectiveness of our proposal on different DiT backbones for video and image generation, showcasing skip branches to help preserve generation quality and achieve higher speedup. Experimental results indicate that Skip-DiT achieves a 1.5x speedup almost for free and a 2.2x speedup with only a minor reduction in quantitative metrics. Code is available at https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Skip-DiT.git.

### WF-VAE: Enhancing Video VAE by Wavelet-Driven Energy Flow for Latent   Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Zongjian Li, Bin Lin, Yang Ye, Liuhan Chen, Xinhua Cheng, Shenghai Yuan, Li Yuan

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T08:21:47Z

**Summary**: Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional latent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly, we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache, which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference. Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and 4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/WF-VAE.

### A Method for Building Large Language Models with Predefined KV Cache   Capacity
**Authors**: Zhonghua Yi, Ge Niu, Lei Wang, Wei Tang, Liqiu Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-27T03:07:20Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a novel approach, the Bounded-Cache Transformer (BCT), for building large language models with a predefined Key-Value (KV) cache capacity. The BCT addresses the excessive memory consumption issue in traditional KV caches by implementing a bounded-length KV cache, which is particularly suitable for the attention layers in Transformer decode-only architectures. By dynamically updating the key-value vector sequences, the BCT achieves efficient inference within limited cache capacity, significantly reducing memory usage while maintaining model performance and system throughput. Experimental results demonstrate that the BCT significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining the model's inference quality, offering a new solution for efficient inference in large language models.

### Attamba: Attending To Multi-Token States
**Authors**: Yash Akhauri, Safeen Huda, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T18:52:06Z

**Summary**: When predicting the next token in a sequence, vanilla transformers compute attention over all previous tokens, resulting in quadratic scaling of compute with sequence length. State-space models compress the entire sequence of tokens into a fixed-dimensional representation to improve efficiency, while other architectures achieve sub-quadratic complexity via low-rank projections or sparse attention patterns over the sequence. In this paper, we introduce Attamba, a novel architecture that uses state-space models to compress chunks of tokens and applies attention on these compressed key-value representations. We find that replacing key and value projections in a transformer with SSMs can improve model quality and enable flexible token chunking, resulting in 24% improved perplexity with transformer of similar KV-Cache and attention footprint, and ~4 times smaller KV-Cache and Attention FLOPs for 5% perplexity trade-off. Attamba can perform attention on chunked-sequences of variable length, enabling a smooth transition between quadratic and linear scaling, offering adaptable efficiency gains.

### STAR: Synthesis of Tailored Architectures
**Authors**: Armin W. Thomas, Rom Parnichkun, Alexander Amini, Stefano Massaroli, Michael Poli

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T18:42:42Z

**Summary**: Iterative improvement of model architectures is fundamental to deep learning: Transformers first enabled scaling, and recent advances in model hybridization have pushed the quality-efficiency frontier. However, optimizing architectures remains challenging and expensive. Current automated or manual approaches fall short, largely due to limited progress in the design of search spaces and due to the simplicity of resulting patterns and heuristics. In this work, we propose a new approach for the synthesis of tailored architectures (STAR). Our approach combines a novel search space based on the theory of linear input-varying systems, supporting a hierarchical numerical encoding into architecture genomes. STAR genomes are automatically refined and recombined with gradient-free, evolutionary algorithms to optimize for multiple model quality and efficiency metrics. Using STAR, we optimize large populations of new architectures, leveraging diverse computational units and interconnection patterns, improving over highly-optimized Transformers and striped hybrid models on the frontier of quality, parameter size, and inference cache for autoregressive language modeling.

### GaNI: Global and Near Field Illumination Aware Neural Inverse Rendering
**Authors**: Jiaye Wu, Saeed Hadadan, Geng Lin, Matthias Zwicker, David Jacobs, Roni Sengupta

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T17:28:06Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present GaNI, a Global and Near-field Illumination-aware neural inverse rendering technique that can reconstruct geometry, albedo, and roughness parameters from images of a scene captured with co-located light and camera. Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera focus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and near-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We introduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct the geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse neural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo and roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple technical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that NeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections from the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of near-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle specular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant illumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during capture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and additional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method outperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering techniques. Our approach produces significantly better reflectance and slightly better geometry than capture strategies that do not require a dark room.

### Degrees of Freedom of Cache-Aided Interference Channels Assisted by   Active Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces
**Authors**: Abolfazl Changizi, Ali H. Abdollahi Bafghi, Masoumeh Nasiri-Kenari

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T16:21:10Z

**Summary**: This paper studies cache-aided wireless networks in the presence of active intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we explore interference management in a cache-aided wireless network assisted by an active IRS, to enhance the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF). To this end, we jointly design the content placement, delivery phase, and phase shifts of the IRS and propose a one-shot achievable scheme. Our scheme exploits transmitters' cooperation, cache contents (as side information), interference alignment, and IRS capabilities, adapting to the network's parameters. We derive the achievable one-shot sum-DoF for different sizes of cache memories, network configurations, and numbers of IRS elements. Our results highlight the potential of deploying an IRS in cache-aided wireless communication systems, underscoring the enhancement of achievable DoF for various parameter regimes, particularly when the sizes of the caches (especially at the transmitters) are inadequate. Notably, we show that access to an IRS with a sufficient number of elements enables the achievement of the maximum possible DoF for various parameter regimes of interest.

**Authors**: Emanuele Aiello, Umberto Michieli, Diego Valsesia, Mete Ozay, Enrico Magli

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T15:03:14Z

**Summary**: Personalized image generation requires text-to-image generative models that capture the core features of a reference subject to allow for controlled generation across different contexts. Existing methods face challenges due to complex training requirements, high inference costs, limited flexibility, or a combination of these issues. In this paper, we introduce DreamCache, a scalable approach for efficient and high-quality personalized image generation. By caching a small number of reference image features from a subset of layers and a single timestep of the pretrained diffusion denoiser, DreamCache enables dynamic modulation of the generated image features through lightweight, trained conditioning adapters. DreamCache achieves state-of-the-art image and text alignment, utilizing an order of magnitude fewer extra parameters, and is both more computationally effective and versatile than existing models.

### Star Attention: Efficient LLM Inference over Long Sequences
**Authors**: Shantanu Acharya, Fei Jia, Boris Ginsburg

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T05:10:04Z

**Summary**: Inference with Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) on long sequences is both costly and slow due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. We introduce Star Attention, a two-phase block-sparse approximation that improves computational efficiency by sharding attention across multiple hosts while minimizing communication overhead. In the first phase, the context is processed using blockwise-local attention across hosts, in parallel. In the second phase, query and response tokens attend to all prior cached tokens through sequence-global attention. Star Attention integrates seamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs trained with global attention, reducing memory requirements and inference time by up to 11x while preserving 95-100% of accuracy.

### Efficient LLM Inference with I/O-Aware Partial KV Cache Recomputation
**Authors**: Chaoyi Jiang, Lei Gao, Hossein Entezari Zarch, Murali Annavaram

**Updated**: 2024-11-26T04:03:14Z

**Summary**: Inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally demanding. To reduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) caching is used to store intermediate activations, enabling GPUs to perform only the incremental computation required for each new token. This approach significantly lowers the computational overhead for token generation. However, the memory required for KV caching grows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A cost-effective alternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which alleviates GPU memory pressure but shifts the bottleneck to the limited bandwidth of the PCIe connection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods attempt to address these issues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or employing CPU-GPU heterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive data movement and dependence on CPU capabilities. In this paper, we introduce an efficient CPU-GPU I/O-aware LLM inference method that avoids transferring the entire KV cache from CPU to GPU by recomputing partial KV cache from activations while concurrently transferring the remaining KV cache via PCIe bus. This approach overlaps GPU recomputation with data transfer to minimize idle GPU time and maximize inference performance. Our method is fully automated by integrating a profiler module that utilizes input characteristics and system hardware information, a scheduler module to optimize the distribution of computation and communication workloads, and a runtime module to efficiently execute the derived execution plan. Experimental results show that our method achieves up to 35.8% lower latency and 46.2% higher throughput during decoding compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

### Ca2-VDM: Efficient Autoregressive Video Diffusion Model with Causal   Generation and Cache Sharing
**Authors**: Kaifeng Gao, Jiaxin Shi, Hanwang Zhang, Chunping Wang, Jun Xiao, Long Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-25T13:33:41Z

**Summary**: With the advance of diffusion models, today's video generation has achieved impressive quality. To extend the generation length and facilitate real-world applications, a majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on the last frame(s) of the previous clip. However, existing autoregressive VDMs are highly inefficient and redundant: The model must re-compute all the conditional frames that are overlapped between adjacent clips. This issue is exacerbated when the conditional frames are extended autoregressively to provide the model with long-term context. In such cases, the computational demands increase significantly (i.e., with a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the autoregression step). In this paper, we propose Ca2-VDM, an efficient autoregressive VDM with Causal generation and Cache sharing. For causal generation, it introduces unidirectional feature computation, which ensures that the cache of conditional frames can be precomputed in previous autoregression steps and reused in every subsequent step, eliminating redundant computations. For cache sharing, it shares the cache across all denoising steps to avoid the huge cache storage cost. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Ca2-VDM achieves state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative video generation results and significantly improves the generation speed.

### Analog In-Memory Computing Attention Mechanism for Fast and   Energy-Efficient Large Language Models
**Authors**: Nathan Leroux, Paul-Philipp Manea, Chirag Sudarshan, Jan Finkbeiner, Sebastian Siegel, John Paul Strachan, Emre Neftci

**Updated**: 2024-11-25T12:14:33Z

**Summary**: Transformer networks, driven by self-attention, are central to Large Language Models. In generative Transformers, self-attention uses cache memory to store token projections, avoiding recomputation at each time step. However, GPU-stored projections must be loaded into SRAM for each new generation step, causing latency and energy bottlenecks.   We present a custom self-attention in-memory computing architecture based on emerging charge-based memories called gain cells, which can be efficiently written to store new tokens during sequence generation and enable parallel analog dot-product computation required for self-attention. However, the analog gain cell circuits introduce non-idealities and constraints preventing the direct mapping of pre-trained models. To circumvent this problem, we design an initialization algorithm achieving text processing performance comparable to GPT-2 without training from scratch. Our architecture respectively reduces attention latency and energy consumption by up to two and five orders of magnitude compared to GPUs, marking a significant step toward ultra-fast, low-power generative Transformers.

### Deegen: A JIT-Capable VM Generator for Dynamic Languages
**Authors**: Haoran Xu, Fredrik Kjolstad

**Updated**: 2024-11-24T21:57:29Z

**Summary**: Building a high-performance JIT-capable VM for a dynamic language has traditionally required a tremendous amount of time, money, and expertise. We present Deegen, a meta-compiler that allows users to generate a high-performance JIT-capable VM for their own language at an engineering cost similar to writing a simple interpreter. Deegen takes in the execution semantics of the bytecodes implemented as C++ functions, and automatically generates a two-tier VM execution engine with a state-of-the-art interpreter, a state-of-the-art baseline JIT, and the tier-switching logic that connects them into a self-adaptive system.   We are the first to demonstrate the automatic generation of a JIT compiler, and the automatic generation of an interpreter that outperforms the state of the art. Our performance comes from a long list of optimizations supported by Deegen, including bytecode specialization and quickening, register pinning, tag register optimization, call inline caching, generic inline caching, JIT polymorphic IC, JIT IC inline slab, type-check removal and strength reduction, type-based slow-path extraction and outlining, JIT hot-cold code splitting, and JIT OSR-entry. These optimizations are either employed automatically, or guided by the language implementer through intuitive APIs. As a result, the disassembly of the Deegen-generated interpreter, baseline JIT, and the generated JIT code rivals the assembly code hand-written by experts in state-of-the-art VMs.   We implement LuaJIT Remake (LJR), a standard-compliant Lua 5.1 VM, using Deegen. Across 44 benchmarks, LJR's interpreter is on average 179% faster than the official PUC Lua interpreter, and 31% faster than LuaJIT's interpreter. LJR's baseline JIT has negligible startup delay, and its execution performance is on average 360% faster than PUC Lua and only 33% slower (but faster on 13/44 benchmarks) than LuaJIT's optimizing JIT.

### Chameleon: Adaptive Caching and Scheduling for Many-Adapter LLM   Inference Environments
**Authors**: Nikoleta Iliakopoulou, Jovan Stojkovic, Chloe Alverti, Tianyin Xu, Hubertus Franke, Josep Torrellas

**Updated**: 2024-11-24T16:20:57Z

**Summary**: The widespread adoption of LLMs has driven an exponential rise in their deployment, imposing substantial demands on inference clusters. These clusters must handle numerous concurrent queries for different LLM downstream tasks. To handle multi-task settings with vast LLM parameter counts, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable task-specific fine-tuning while sharing most of the base LLM model across tasks. Hence, they allow concurrent task serving with minimal memory requirements. However, existing LLM serving systems face inefficiencies: they overlook workload heterogeneity, impose high link bandwidth from frequent adapter loading, and suffer from head-of-line blocking in their schedulers. To address these challenges, we present Chameleon, a novel LLM serving system optimized for many adapter environments, that relies on two core ideas: adapter caching and adapter-aware scheduling. First, Chameleon caches popular adapters in GPU memory, minimizing the adapter loading times. Importantly, it uses the otherwise idle GPU memory, avoiding extra memory costs. Second, Chameleon uses a non-preemptive multi-queue scheduling to efficiently account for workload heterogeneity. In this way, Chameleon simultaneously prevents head of line blocking and starvation. We implement Chameleon on top of a state-of-the-art LLM serving platform and evaluate it with real-world production traces and open-source LLMs. Under high loads, Chameleon reduces P99 and P50 TTFT latency by 80.7% and 48.1%, respectively, while improving throughput by 1.5x compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

### Test-time Alignment-Enhanced Adapter for Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Baoshun Tong, Kaiyu Song, Hanjiang Lai

**Updated**: 2024-11-24T06:43:38Z

**Summary**: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) has attracted increasing attention for tackling the issue of distribution shift during the test phase. While prior methods have shown effectiveness in addressing distribution shift by adjusting classification logits, they are not optimal due to keeping text features unchanged. To address this issue, we introduce a new approach called Test-time Alignment-Enhanced Adapter (TAEA), which trains an adapter with test samples to adjust text features during the test phase. We can enhance the text-to-image alignment prediction by utilizing an adapter to adapt text features. Furthermore, we also propose to adopt the negative cache from TDA as enhancement module, which further improves the performance of TAEA. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art TTA method of pre-trained VLMs by an average of 0.75% on the out-of-distribution benchmark and 2.5% on the cross-domain benchmark, with an acceptable training time. Code will be available at https://github.com/BaoshunWq/clip-TAEA.

### Squeezed Attention: Accelerating Long Context Length LLM Inference
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sehoon Kim, Hiva Mohammadzadeh, Monishwaran Maheswaran, June Paik, Michael W. Mahoney, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2024-11-23T22:11:42Z

**Summary**: Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input prompts to perform complex downstream tasks like document analysis and code generation. For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose Squeezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of the keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded during inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important keys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to identify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement optimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively evaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and up to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models.

### TASER: Temporal Adaptive Sampling for Fast and Accurate Dynamic Graph   Representation Learning
**Authors**: Gangda Deng, Hongkuan Zhou, Hanqing Zeng, Yinglong Xia, Christopher Leung, Jianbo Li, Rajgopal Kannan, Viktor Prasanna

**Updated**: 2024-11-23T10:42:11Z

**Summary**: Recently, Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various high-impact applications, including fraud detection and content recommendation. Despite the success of TGNNs, they are prone to the prevalent noise found in real-world dynamic graphs like time-deprecated links and skewed interaction distribution. The noise causes two critical issues that significantly compromise the accuracy of TGNNs: (1) models are supervised by inferior interactions, and (2) noisy input induces high variance in the aggregated messages. However, current TGNN denoising techniques do not consider the diverse and dynamic noise pattern of each node. In addition, they also suffer from the excessive mini-batch generation overheads caused by traversing more neighbors. We believe the remedy for fast and accurate TGNNs lies in temporal adaptive sampling. In this work, we propose TASER, the first adaptive sampling method for TGNNs optimized for accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. TASER adapts its mini-batch selection based on training dynamics and temporal neighbor selection based on the contextual, structural, and temporal properties of past interactions. To alleviate the bottleneck in mini-batch generation, TASER implements a pure GPU-based temporal neighbor finder and a dedicated GPU feature cache. We evaluate the performance of TASER using two state-of-the-art backbone TGNNs. On five popular datasets, TASER outperforms the corresponding baselines by an average of 2.3% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) while achieving an average of 5.1x speedup in training time.

### HRSAM: Efficient Interactive Segmentation in High-Resolution Images
**Authors**: You Huang, Wenbin Lai, Jiayi Ji, Liujuan Cao, Shengchuan Zhang, Rongrong Ji

**Updated**: 2024-11-23T01:44:00Z

**Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced interactive segmentation but is limited by the high computational cost on high-resolution images. This requires downsampling to meet GPU constraints, sacrificing the fine-grained details needed for high-precision interactive segmentation. To address SAM's limitations, we focus on visual length extrapolation and propose a lightweight model named HRSAM. The extrapolation enables HRSAM trained on low resolutions to generalize to high resolutions. We begin by finding the link between the extrapolation and attention scores, which leads us to base HRSAM on Swin attention. We then introduce the Flexible Local Attention (FLA) framework, using CUDA-optimized Efficient Memory Attention to accelerate HRSAM. Within FLA, we implement Flash Swin attention, achieving over a 35% speedup compared to traditional Swin attention, and propose a KV-only padding mechanism to enhance extrapolation. We also develop the Cycle-scan module that uses State Space models to efficiently expand HRSAM's receptive field. We further develop the HRSAM++ within FLA by adding an anchor map, providing multi-scale data augmentation for the extrapolation and a larger receptive field at slight computational cost. Experiments show that, under standard training, HRSAMs surpass the previous SOTA with only 38% of the latency. With SAM-distillation, the extrapolation enables HRSAMs to outperform the teacher model at lower latency. Further finetuning achieves performance significantly exceeding the previous SOTA.

### Deep Learning-Based Automatic Delineation of Liver Domes in kV Triggered   Images for Online Breath-hold Reproducibility Verification of Liver   Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
**Authors**: Sugandima Weragoda, Ping Xia, Kevin Stephans, Neil Woody, Michael Martens, Robert Brown, Bingqi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-11-22T19:30:40Z

**Summary**: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) can be a precise, minimally invasive treatment method for liver cancer and liver metastases. However, the effectiveness of SBRT relies on the accurate delivery of the dose to the tumor while sparing healthy tissue. Challenges persist in ensuring breath-hold reproducibility, with current methods often requiring manual verification of liver dome positions from kV-triggered images. To address this, we propose a proof-of-principle study of a deep learning-based pipeline to automatically delineate the liver dome from kV-planar images. From 24 patients who received SBRT for liver cancer or metastasis inside liver, 711 KV-triggered images acquired for online breath-hold verification were included in the current study. We developed a pipeline comprising a trained U-Net for automatic liver dome region segmentation from the triggered images followed by extraction of the liver dome via thresholding, edge detection, and morphological operations. The performance and generalizability of the pipeline was evaluated using 2-fold cross validation. The training of the U-Net model for liver region segmentation took under 30 minutes and the automatic delineation of a liver dome for any triggered image took less than one second. The RMSE and rate of detection for Fold1 with 366 images was (6.4 +/- 1.6) mm and 91.7%, respectively. For Fold2 with 345 images, the RMSE and rate of detection was (7.7 +/- 2.3) mm and 76.3% respectively.

### AttriBoT: A Bag of Tricks for Efficiently Approximating Leave-One-Out   Context Attribution
**Authors**: Fengyuan Liu, Nikhil Kandpal, Colin Raffel

**Updated**: 2024-11-22T18:06:14Z

**Summary**: The influence of contextual input on the behavior of large language models (LLMs) has prompted the development of context attribution methods that aim to quantify each context span's effect on an LLM's generations. The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods.

### DyCoke: Dynamic Compression of Tokens for Fast Video Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Keda Tao, Can Qin, Haoxuan You, Yang Sui, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-22T15:55:19Z

**Summary**: Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.

### ProactivePIM: Accelerating Weight-Sharing Embedding Layer with PIM for   Scalable Recommendation System
**Authors**: Youngsuk Kim, Junghwan Lim, Hyuk-Jae Lee, Chae Eun Rhee

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T05:55:43Z

**Summary**: The model size growth of personalized recommendation systems poses new challenges for inference. Weight-sharing algorithms have been proposed for size reduction, but they increase memory access. Recent advancements in processing-in-memory (PIM) enhanced the model throughput by exploiting memory parallelism, but such algorithms introduce massive CPU-PIM communication into prior PIM systems. We propose ProactivePIM, a PIM system for weight-sharing recommendation system acceleration. ProactivePIM integrates a cache within the PIM with a prefetching scheme to leverage a unique locality of the algorithm and eliminate communication overhead through a subtable mapping strategy. ProactivePIM achieves a 4.8x speedup compared to prior works.

### Static Reuse Profile Estimation for Array Applications
**Authors**: Abdur Razzak, Atanu Barai, Nandakishore Santhi, Abdel-Hameed A. Badawy

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T05:26:57Z

**Summary**: Reuse distance analysis is a widely recognized method for application characterization that illustrates cache locality. Although there are various techniques to calculate the reuse profile from dynamic memory traces, it is both time and space-consuming due to the requirement to collect dynamic memory traces at runtime. In contrast, static analysis reuse profile estimation is a promisingly faster approach since it is calculated at compile time without running the program or collecting memory traces. This work presents a static analysis technique to estimate the reuse profile of loop-based programs. For an input program, we generate a basic block-level control flow graph and the execution count by analyzing the LLVM IR of the program. We present the memory accesses of the application kernel in a compact bracketed format and use a recursive algorithm to predict the reuse distance histogram. We deploy a separate predictor that unrolls the loop(s) for smaller bounds and generates a temporary reuse distance profile for those small cases. Using these smaller profiles, the reuse profile is extrapolated for the actual loop bound(s). We use this reuse profile to predict the cache hit rate. Results show that our model can predict cache hit rates with an average accuracy of 95% relative to the dynamic reuse profile methods.

### Retrieval-Enhanced Visual Prompt Learning for Few-shot Classification
**Authors**: Jintao Rong, Hao Chen, Linlin Ou, Tianxiao Chen, Xinyi Yu, Yifan Liu

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T04:12:53Z

**Summary**: The Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model has been widely used in various downstream vision tasks. The few-shot learning paradigm has been widely adopted to augment its capacity for these tasks. However, current paradigms may struggle with fine-grained classification, such as satellite image recognition, due to widening domain gaps. To address this limitation, we propose retrieval-enhanced visual prompt learning (RePrompt), which introduces retrieval mechanisms to cache and reuse the knowledge of downstream tasks. RePrompt constructs a retrieval database from either training examples or external data if available, and uses a retrieval mechanism to enhance multiple stages of a simple prompt learning baseline, thus narrowing the domain gap. During inference, our enhanced model can reference similar samples brought by retrieval to make more accurate predictions. A detailed analysis reveals that retrieval helps to improve the distribution of late features, thus, improving generalization for downstream tasks. Reprompt attains state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of vision datasets, including 11 image datasets, 3 video datasets, 1 multi-view dataset, and 4 domain generalization benchmarks.

### InstCache: A Predictive Cache for LLM Serving
**Authors**: Longwei Zou, Tingfeng Liu, Kai Chen, Jiangang Kong, Yangdong Deng

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T03:52:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models are revolutionizing every aspect of human life. However, the unprecedented power comes at the cost of significant computing intensity, suggesting long latency and large energy footprint. Key-Value Cache and Semantic Cache have been proposed as a solution to the above problem, but both suffer from limited scalability due to significant memory cost for each token or instruction embeddings. Motivated by the observations that most instructions are short, repetitive and predictable by LLMs, we propose to predict user-instructions by an instruction-aligned LLM and store them in a predictive cache, so-called InstCache. We introduce an instruction pre-population algorithm based on the negative log likelihood of instructions, determining the cache size with regard to the hit rate. The proposed InstCache is efficiently implemented as a hash table with minimal lookup latency for deployment. Experimental results show that InstCache can achieve up to 51.34% hit rate on LMSys dataset, which corresponds to a 2x speedup, at a memory cost of only 4.5GB.

### WaveRoRA: Wavelet Rotary Route Attention for Multivariate Time Series   Forecasting
**Authors**: Aobo Liang, Yan Sun, Nadra Guizani

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T03:34:44Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Transformer-based models (Transformers) have achieved significant success in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, previous works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the frequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework to model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet domain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the analysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally, the Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic complexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing long-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism: Rotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary position embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence tokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate information from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix, offering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA to capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that WaveRoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining lower computational costs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Leopold2333/WaveRoRA.

### Adaptable Embeddings Network (AEN)
**Authors**: Stan Loosmore, Alexander Titus

**Updated**: 2024-11-21T02:15:52Z

**Summary**: Modern day Language Models see extensive use in text classification, yet this comes at significant computational cost. Compute-effective classification models are needed for low-resource environments, most notably on edge devices. We introduce Adaptable Embeddings Networks (AEN), a novel dual-encoder architecture using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). This architecture allows for runtime adaptation of classification criteria without retraining and is non-autoregressive. Through thorough synthetic data experimentation, we demonstrate our model outputs comparable and in certain cases superior results to that of autoregressive models an order of magnitude larger than AEN's size. The architecture's ability to preprocess and cache condition embeddings makes it ideal for edge computing applications and real-time monitoring systems.

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T19:51:25Z

**Summary**: We propose Hymba, a family of small language models featuring a hybrid-head parallel architecture that integrates transformer attention mechanisms with state space models (SSMs) for enhanced efficiency. Attention heads provide high-resolution recall, while SSM heads enable efficient context summarization. Additionally, we introduce learnable meta tokens that are prepended to prompts, storing critical information and alleviating the "forced-to-attend" burden associated with attention mechanisms. This model is further optimized by incorporating cross-layer key-value (KV) sharing and partial sliding window attention, resulting in a compact cache size. During development, we conducted a controlled study comparing various architectures under identical settings and observed significant advantages of our proposed architecture. Notably, Hymba achieves state-of-the-art results for small LMs: Our Hymba-1.5B-Base model surpasses all sub-2B public models in performance and even outperforms Llama-3.2-3B with 1.32% higher average accuracy, an 11.67x cache size reduction, and 3.49x throughput.

### MAS-Attention: Memory-Aware Stream Processing for Attention Acceleration   on Resource-Constrained Edge Devices
**Authors**: Mohammadali Shakerdargah, Shan Lu, Chao Gao, Di Niu

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T19:44:26Z

**Summary**: The advent of foundation models have revolutionized various fields, enabling unprecedented task accuracy and flexibility in computational linguistics, computer vision and other domains. Attention mechanism has become an essential component of foundation models, due to their superb capability of capturing correlations in a sequence. However, attention results in quadratic complexity in memory and compute as the context length grows. Although many fusion-based exact attention acceleration algorithms have been developed for datacenter-grade GPUs and accelerators leveraging multi-core parallelism and data locality, yet it remains a significant challenge to accelerate attention on resource-constrained edge neural accelerators with limited compute units and stringent on-chip caches. In this paper, we propose a scheme for exact attention inference acceleration on memory-constrained edge accelerators, by parallelizing the utilization of heterogeneous compute units, i.e., vector processing units and matrix processing units. Our method involves scheduling workloads onto these different compute units in a multi-tiered tiling scheme to process tiled vector workloads and matrix workloads in attention as two streams, respecting the workload dependencies. We search for tiling factors to maximize the parallelization of both compute units while considering I/O overhead, and propose a proactive cache overwrite strategy to avoid undesirable cache spills in reality. Extensive results based on open-sourced simulation frameworks show up to 2.75x speedup and 54% reduction in energy consumption as compared to the state-of-the-art attention fusion method (FLAT) in the edge computing scenario. Further experiments on a real-world edge neural processing unit demonstrate speedup of up to 1.76x for attention as compared to FLAT, without affecting model output accuracy.

### A Distributed-memory Tridiagonal Solver Based on a Specialised Data   Structure Optimised for CPU and GPU Architectures
**Authors**: Semih Akkurt, Sébastien Lemaire, Paul Bartholomew, Sylvain Laizet

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T18:31:39Z

**Summary**: Various numerical methods used for solving partial differential equations (PDE) result in tridiagonal systems. Solving tridiagonal systems on distributed-memory environments is not straightforward, and often requires significant amount of communication. In this article, we present a novel distributed-memory tridiagonal solver algorithm, DistD2-TDS, based on a specialised data structure. DistD2-TDS algorithm takes advantage of the diagonal dominance in tridiagonal systems to reduce the communications in distributed-memory environments. The underlying data structure plays a crucial role for the performance of the algorithm. First, the data structure improves data localities and makes it possible to minimise data movements via cache blocking and kernel fusion strategies. Second, data continuity enables a contiguous data access pattern and results in efficient utilisation of the available memory bandwidth. Finally, the data layout supports vectorisation on CPUs and thread level parallelisation on GPUs for improved performance. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm, we implemented and benchmarked the algorithm on CPUs and GPUs. We investigated the single rank performance and compared against existing algorithms. Furthermore, we analysed the strong scaling of the implementation up to 384 NVIDIA H100 GPUs and up to 8192 AMD EPYC 7742 CPUs. Finally, we demonstrated a practical use case of the algorithm by using compact finite difference schemes to solve a 3D non-linear PDE. The results demonstrate that DistD2 algorithm can sustain around 66% of the theoretical peak bandwidth at scale on CPU and GPU based supercomputers.

**Authors**: Marco Barbisan, Marco Boldrin, Luca Cinnirella, Bruno Laterza, Alberto Maistrello, Lionello Marrelli, Federico Molon, Simone Peruzzo, Cesare Taliercio, Marco Valisa, Enrico Zampiva

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T14:52:36Z

**Summary**: Diagnostic Neutral Beam Injectors (DNBI), through the combined use of Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CHERS) and Motional Stark effect diagnostics (MSE), are a well-known tool to access important information about magnetically confined plasmas, such as radial profiles of ion temperature, ion flow, impurity content and intensity and direction of the magnetic field. For this purpose, a DNBI was installed and operated in the RFX-mod experiment, which was designed to confine plasma mainly through the Reversed Field Pinch configuration. The DNBI, designed and built by the Budker Institute of Plasma Physics, was based on a source of positive hydrogen ions, accelerated to 50 keV and for an equivalent neutral beam current of about 5 A at the source. The beam could be modulated and the maximum overall duration was 50 ms. With the upgrade of RFX-mod to the present RFX-mod2 machine, the DNBI is being renovated to solve several plant faults and improve the overall reliability of the system. The 50 kV power supply is being improved, as well as the power supplies in the high voltage deck and its insulation transformer. The control system, originally based on CAMAC technology, was redesigned to be fully replaced. This contribution reviews the technical criticalities emerged in the DNBI check-up and the new solutions adopted to make the DNBI operative and more reliable.

**Authors**: Luohe Shi, Hongyi Zhang, Yao Yao, Zuchao Li, Hai Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-11-20T02:04:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by ChatGPT's release in late 2022, have revolutionized various industries with their advanced language comprehension. However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture's struggle with handling long texts. KV Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our review thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering insights into future advancements in this dynamic field.

### An Eulerian approach to regularized JKO scheme with low-rank tensor   decompositions for Bayesian inversion
**Authors**: Vitalii Aksenov, Martin Eigel

**Updated**: 2024-11-19T11:40:56Z

**Summary**: The possibility of using the Eulerian discretization for the problem of modelling high-dimensional distributions and sampling, is studied. The problem is posed as a minimization problem over the space of probability measures with respect to the Wasserstein distance and solved with entropy-regularized JKO scheme. Each proximal step can be formulated as a fixed-point equation and solved with accelerated methods, such as Anderson's. The usage of low-rank Tensor Train format allows to overcome the \emph{curse of dimensionality}, i.e. the exponential growth of degrees of freedom with dimension, inherent to Eulerian approaches. The resulting method requires only pointwise computations of the unnormalized posterior and is, in particular, gradient-free. Fixed Eulerian grid allows to employ a caching strategy, significally reducing the expensive evaluations of the posterior. When the Eulerian model of the target distribution is fitted, the passage back to the Lagrangian perspective can also be made, allowing to approximately sample from it. We test our method both for synthetic target distributions and particular Bayesian inverse problems and report comparable or better performance than the baseline Metropolis-Hastings MCMC with same amount of resources. Finally, the fitted model can be modified to facilitate the solution of certain associated problems, which we demonstrate by fitting an importance distribution for a particular quantity of interest.

### Adaptive Cache Management for Complex Storage Systems Using   CNN-LSTM-Based Spatiotemporal Prediction
**Authors**: Xiaoye Wang, Xuan Li, Linji Wang, Tingyi Ruan, Pochun Li

**Updated**: 2024-11-19T01:55:26Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes an intelligent cache management strategy based on CNN-LSTM to improve the performance and cache hit rate of storage systems. Through comparative experiments with traditional algorithms (such as LRU and LFU) and other deep learning models (such as RNN, GRU-RNN and LSTM), the results show that the CNN-LSTM model has significant advantages in cache demand prediction. The MSE and MAE values of this model are significantly reduced, proving its effectiveness under complex data access patterns. This study not only verifies the potential of deep learning technology in storage system optimization, but also provides direction and reference for further optimizing and improving cache management strategies. This intelligent cache management strategy performs well in complex storage environments. By combining the spatial feature extraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks and the time series modeling capabilities of long short-term memory networks, the CNN-LSTM model can more accurately predict cache needs, thereby Dynamically optimize cache allocation to improve system response speed and resource utilization. This research provides theoretical support and practical reference for cache optimization under large-scale data access modes, and is of great significance to improving the performance of future storage systems.

### Bi-Mamba: Towards Accurate 1-Bit State Space Models
**Authors**: Shengkun Tang, Liqun Ma, Haonan Li, Mingjie Sun, Zhiqiang Shen

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T18:59:15Z

**Summary**: The typical selective state-space model (SSM) of Mamba addresses several limitations of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with sequence length and significant inference-time memory requirements due to the key-value cache. However, the growing size of Mamba models continues to pose training and deployment challenges and raises environmental concerns due to considerable energy consumption. In this work, we introduce Bi-Mamba, a scalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed for more efficient large language models with multiple sizes across 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B. Bi-Mamba models are trained from scratch on data volume as regular LLM pertaining using an autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experimental results on language modeling demonstrate that Bi-Mamba achieves performance comparable to its full-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) and much better accuracy than post-training-binarization (PTB) Mamba baselines, while significantly reducing memory footprint and energy consumption compared to the original Mamba model. Our study pioneers a new linear computational complexity LLM framework under low-bit representation and facilitates the future design of specialized hardware tailored for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based LLMs.

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T17:08:35Z

**Summary**: In recent years, with the significant evolution of multi-modal large models, many recommender researchers realized the potential of multi-modal information for user interest modeling. In industry, a wide-used modeling architecture is a cascading paradigm: (1) first pre-training a multi-modal model to provide omnipotent representations for downstream services; (2) The downstream recommendation model takes the multi-modal representation as additional input to fit real user-item behaviours. Although such paradigm achieves remarkable improvements, however, there still exist two problems that limit model performance: (1) Representation Unmatching: The pre-trained multi-modal model is always supervised by the classic NLP/CV tasks, while the recommendation models are supervised by real user-item interaction. As a result, the two fundamentally different tasks' goals were relatively separate, and there was a lack of consistent objective on their representations; (2) Representation Unlearning: The generated multi-modal representations are always stored in cache store and serve as extra fixed input of recommendation model, thus could not be updated by recommendation model gradient, further unfriendly for downstream training. Inspired by the two difficulties challenges in downstream tasks usage, we introduce a quantitative multi-modal framework to customize the specialized and trainable multi-modal information for different downstream models.

### Accelerating spherical K-means clustering for large-scale sparse   document data
**Authors**: Kazuo Aoyama, Kazumi Saito

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T05:50:58Z

**Summary**: This paper presents an accelerated spherical K-means clustering algorithm for large-scale and high-dimensional sparse document data sets. We design an algorithm working in an architecture-friendly manner (AFM), which is a procedure of suppressing performance-degradation factors such as the numbers of instructions, branch mispredictions, and cache misses in CPUs of a modern computer system. For the AFM operation, we leverage unique universal characteristics (UCs) of a data-object and a cluster's mean set, which are skewed distributions on data relationships such as Zipf's law and a feature-value concentration phenomenon. The UCs indicate that the most part of the number of multiplications for similarity calculations is executed regarding terms with high document frequencies (df) and the most part of a similarity between an object- and a mean-feature vector is obtained by the multiplications regarding a few high mean-feature values. Our proposed algorithm applies an inverted-index data structure to a mean set, extracts the specific region with high-df terms and high mean-feature values in the mean-inverted index by newly introduced two structural parameters, and exploits the index divided into three parts for efficient pruning. The algorithm determines the two structural parameters by minimizing the approximate number of multiplications related to that of instructions, reduces the branch mispredictions by sharing the index structure including the two parameters with all the objects, and suppressing the cache misses by keeping in the caches the frequently used data in the foregoing specific region, resulting in working in the AFM. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm efficiently achieves superior speed performance in large-scale documents compared with algorithms using the state-of-the-art techniques.

### Unveiling Redundancy in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs): A Systematic   Study
**Authors**: Xibo Sun, Jiarui Fang, Aoyu Li, Jinzhe Pan

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T02:49:23Z

**Summary**: The increased model capacity of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) and the demand for generating higher resolutions of images and videos have led to a significant rise in inference latency, impacting real-time performance adversely. While prior research has highlighted the presence of high similarity in activation values between adjacent diffusion steps (referred to as redundancy) and proposed various caching mechanisms to mitigate computational overhead, the exploration of redundancy in existing literature remains limited, with findings often not generalizable across different DiT models. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive investigation into redundancy across a broad spectrum of mainstream DiT models. Our experimental analysis reveals substantial variations in the distribution of redundancy across diffusion steps among different DiT models. Interestingly, within a single model, the redundancy distribution remains stable regardless of variations in input prompts, step counts, or scheduling strategies. Given the lack of a consistent pattern across diverse models, caching strategies designed for a specific group of models may not easily transfer to others. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a tool for analyzing the redundancy of individual models, enabling subsequent research to develop tailored caching strategies for specific model architectures. The project is publicly available at https://github.com/xdit-project/DiTCacheAnalysis.

### LSMGraph: A High-Performance Dynamic Graph Storage System with   Multi-Level CSR
**Authors**: Song Yu, Shufeng Gong, Qian Tao, Sijie Shen, Yanfeng Zhang, Wenyuan Yu, Pengxi Liu, Zhixin Zhang, Hongfu Li, Xiaojian Luo, Ge Yu, Jingren Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-11-18T02:10:28Z

**Summary**: The growing volume of graph data may exhaust the main memory. It is crucial to design a disk-based graph storage system to ingest updates and analyze graphs efficiently. However, existing dynamic graph storage systems suffer from read or write amplification and face the challenge of optimizing both read and write performance simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose LSMGraph, a novel dynamic graph storage system that combines the write-friendly LSM-tree and the read-friendly CSR. It leverages the multi-level structure of LSM-trees to optimize write performance while utilizing the compact CSR structures embedded in the LSM-trees to boost read performance. LSMGraph uses a new memory structure, MemGraph, to efficiently cache graph updates and uses a multi-level index to speed up reads within the multi-level structure. Furthermore, LSMGraph incorporates a vertex-grained version control mechanism to mitigate the impact of LSM-tree compaction on read performance and ensure the correctness of concurrent read and write operations. Our evaluation shows that LSMGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (graph) storage systems on both graph update and graph analytical workloads.

**Authors**: Edward Bortnikov, Michael Azran, Asa Bornstein, Shmuel Dashevsky, Dennis Huang, Omer Kepten, Michael Pan, Gali Sheffi, Moshe Twitto, Tamar Weiss Orzech, Idit Keidar, Guy Gueta, Roey Maor, Niv Dayan

**Updated**: 2024-11-17T14:47:15Z

**Summary**: We present~\emph{KV-Tandem}, a modular architecture for building LSM-based storage engines on top of simple, non-ordered persistent key-value stores (KVSs). KV-Tandem enables advanced functionalities such as range queries and snapshot reads, while maintaining the native KVS performance for random reads and writes. Its modular design offers better performance trade-offs compared to previous KV-separation solutions, which struggle to decompose the monolithic LSM structure. Central to KV-Tandem is~\emph{LSM bypass} -- a novel algorithm that offers a fast path to basic operations while ensuring the correctness of advanced APIs.   We implement KV-Tandem in \emph{XDP-Rocks}, a RocksDB-compatible storage engine that leverages the XDP KVS and incorporates practical design optimizations for real-world deployment. Through extensive microbenchmark and system-level comparisons, we demonstrate that XDP-Rocks achieves 3x to 4x performance improvements over RocksDB across various workloads. XDP-Rocks is already deployed in production, delivering significant operator cost savings consistent with these performance gains.

 ### Retrieving Semantics from the Deep: an RAG Solution for Gesture   Synthesis
**Authors**: M. Hamza Mughal, Rishabh Dabral, Merel C. J. Scholman, Vera Demberg, Christian Theobalt

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:59:46Z

**Summary**: Non-verbal communication often comprises of semantically rich gestures that help convey the meaning of an utterance. Producing such semantic co-speech gestures has been a major challenge for the existing neural systems that can generate rhythmic beat gestures, but struggle to produce semantically meaningful gestures. Therefore, we present RAG-Gesture, a diffusion-based gesture generation approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce natural-looking and semantically rich gestures. Our neuro-explicit gesture generation approach is designed to produce semantic gestures grounded in interpretable linguistic knowledge. We achieve this by using explicit domain knowledge to retrieve exemplar motions from a database of co-speech gestures. Once retrieved, we then inject these semantic exemplar gestures into our diffusion-based gesture generation pipeline using DDIM inversion and retrieval guidance at the inference time without any need of training. Further, we propose a control paradigm for guidance, that allows the users to modulate the amount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence. Our comparative evaluations demonstrate the validity of our approach against recent gesture generation approaches. The reader is urged to explore the results on our project page.

### CARP: Visuomotor Policy Learning via Coarse-to-Fine Autoregressive   Prediction
**Authors**: Zhefei Gong, Pengxiang Ding, Shangke Lyu, Siteng Huang, Mingyang Sun, Wei Zhao, Zhaoxin Fan, Donglin Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:59:18Z

**Summary**: In robotic visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based models have achieved significant success in improving the accuracy of action trajectory generation compared to traditional autoregressive models. However, they suffer from inefficiency due to multiple denoising steps and limited flexibility from complex constraints. In this paper, we introduce Coarse-to-Fine AutoRegressive Policy (CARP), a novel paradigm for visuomotor policy learning that redefines the autoregressive action generation process as a coarse-to-fine, next-scale approach. CARP decouples action generation into two stages: first, an action autoencoder learns multi-scale representations of the entire action sequence; then, a GPT-style transformer refines the sequence prediction through a coarse-to-fine autoregressive process. This straightforward and intuitive approach produces highly accurate and smooth actions, matching or even surpassing the performance of diffusion-based policies while maintaining efficiency on par with autoregressive policies. We conduct extensive evaluations across diverse settings, including single-task and multi-task scenarios on state-based and image-based simulation benchmarks, as well as real-world tasks. CARP achieves competitive success rates, with up to a 10% improvement, and delivers 10x faster inference compared to state-of-the-art policies, establishing a high-performance, efficient, and flexible paradigm for action generation in robotic tasks.

### Diverse Score Distillation
**Authors**: Yanbo Xu, Jayanth Srinivasa, Gaowen Liu, Shubham Tulsiani

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:59:02Z

**Summary**: Score distillation of 2D diffusion models has proven to be a powerful mechanism to guide 3D optimization, for example enabling text-based 3D generation or single-view reconstruction. A common limitation of existing score distillation formulations, however, is that the outputs of the (mode-seeking) optimization are limited in diversity despite the underlying diffusion model being capable of generating diverse samples. In this work, inspired by the sampling process in denoising diffusion, we propose a score formulation that guides the optimization to follow generation paths defined by random initial seeds, thus ensuring diversity. We then present an approximation to adopt this formulation for scenarios where the optimization may not precisely follow the generation paths (e.g. a 3D representation whose renderings evolve in a co-dependent manner). We showcase the applications of our `Diverse Score Distillation' (DSD) formulation across tasks such as 2D optimization, text-based 3D inference, and single-view reconstruction. We also empirically validate DSD against prior score distillation formulations and show that it significantly improves sample diversity while preserving fidelity.

### Driv3R: Learning Dense 4D Reconstruction for Autonomous Driving
**Authors**: Xin Fei, Wenzhao Zheng, Yueqi Duan, Wei Zhan, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Kurt Keutzer, Jiwen Lu

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:58:03Z

**Summary**: Realtime 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes remains a crucial challenge for autonomous driving perception. Most existing methods rely on depth estimation through self-supervision or multi-modality sensor fusion. In this paper, we propose Driv3R, a DUSt3R-based framework that directly regresses per-frame point maps from multi-view image sequences. To achieve streaming dense reconstruction, we maintain a memory pool to reason both spatial relationships across sensors and dynamic temporal contexts to enhance multi-view 3D consistency and temporal integration. Furthermore, we employ a 4D flow predictor to identify moving objects within the scene to direct our network focus more on reconstructing these dynamic regions. Finally, we align all per-frame pointmaps consistently to the world coordinate system in an optimization-free manner. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale nuScenes dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Driv3R outperforms previous frameworks in 4D dynamic scene reconstruction, achieving 15x faster inference speed compared to methods requiring global alignment.

### Training Large Language Models to Reason in a Continuous Latent Space
**Authors**: Shibo Hao, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, DiJia Su, Xian Li, Zhiting Hu, Jason Weston, Yuandong Tian

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:55:56Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are restricted to reason in the "language space", where they typically express the reasoning process with a chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve a complex reasoning problem. However, we argue that language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most word tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for reasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge challenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an unrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new paradigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed "continuous thought"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the LLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space. Experiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several reasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent advanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple alternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a single deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical reasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with fewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promise of latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.

### New Ionization Models and the Shocking Nitrogen Excess at z > 5
**Authors**: Sophia R. Flury, Karla Z. Arellano-Córdova, Edward C. Moran, Alaina Einsig

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:52:54Z

**Summary**: The new era of galaxy evolution studies hearkened in by JWST has led to the discovery of z > 5 galaxies exhibiting excess nitrogen with log(N/O)~1 dex or more than expected from log(N/O) vs 12+log(O/H) trends in the local Universe. A variety of novel enrichment pathways have been presented to explain the apparent nitrogen excess, invoking a wide range of processes from very massive stars to stripped binaries to fine-tuned star-formation histories. However, understanding the excitation mechanism responsible for the observed nebular emission is necessary to accurately infer chemical abundances. As of yet, the ionization sources of these galaxies have not been thoroughly explored, with radiative shocks left out of the picture. We present a suite of homogeneous excitation models for star-forming galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and radiative shocks, with which we explore possible explanations for the apparent nitrogen excess. We propose new BPT-style diagnostics to classify galaxies at z > 5, finding that, when combined with O iii] 1660,66 and He ii 1640, N iii] 1747-54 / C iii] 1907,09 best selects shock-dominated galaxies while N iv] 1483,86 / C iii] 1907,09 best distinguishes between active black holes and star forming galaxies. From our diagnostics, we find that slow/intermediate radiative shocks (v = 75-150 km/s) are most consistent with observed UV emission line flux ratios in nitrogen-bright galaxies. Accounting for the effects of shocks can bring nitrogen estimates into better agreement with abundance patterns observed in the local Universe and may be attributable to Wolf Rayet populations actively enriching these galaxies with nitrogen and possibly driving winds responsible for these shocks.

### Hallmarks of Deception in Asset-Exchange Models
**Authors**: Kristian Blom, Dmitrii E. Makarov, Aljaž Godec

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:51:12Z

**Summary**: We investigate the transient and steady-state dynamics of the Bennati-Dregulescu-Yakovenko money game in the presence of probabilistic cheaters, who can misrepresent their financial status by claiming to have no money. We derive the steady-state wealth distribution per player analytically and show how the presence of hidden cheaters can be inferred from the relative variance of wealth per player. In scenarios with a finite number of cheaters amidst an infinite pool of honest players, we identify a critical probability of cheating at which the total wealth owned by the cheaters experiences a second-order discontinuity. Below this point, the probability to lose money is larger than the probability to gain; conversely, above this point, the direction is reversed. Additionally, we establish a threshold probability at which cheaters collectively possess more than half of the total wealth in the game. Lastly, we provide bounds on the rate at which both cheaters and honest players can gain or lose wealth, contributing to a deeper understanding of deception in asset exchange models.

### Why Do Developers Engage with ChatGPT in Issue-Tracker? Investigating   Usage and Reliance on ChatGPT-Generated Code
**Authors**: Joy Krishan Das, Saikat Mondal, Chanchal K. Roy

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:47:31Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown the potential to assist developers with coding and debugging tasks. However, their role in collaborative issue resolution is underexplored. In this study, we analyzed 1,152 Developer-ChatGPT conversations across 1,012 issues in GitHub to examine the diverse usage of ChatGPT and reliance on its generated code. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we manually analyzed 289 conversations to understand ChatGPT's usage in the GitHub Issues. Our analysis revealed that ChatGPT is primarily utilized for ideation, whereas its usage for validation (e.g., code documentation accuracy) is minimal. Second, we applied BERTopic modeling to identify key areas of engagement on the entire dataset. We found that backend issues (e.g., API management) dominate conversations, while testing is surprisingly less covered. Third, we utilized the CPD clone detection tool to check if the code generated by ChatGPT was used to address issues. Our findings revealed that ChatGPT-generated code was used as-is to resolve only 5.83\% of the issues. Fourth, we estimated sentiment using a RoBERTa-based sentiment analysis model to determine developers' satisfaction with different usages and engagement areas. We found positive sentiment (i.e., high satisfaction) about using ChatGPT for refactoring and addressing data analytics (e.g., categorizing table data) issues. On the contrary, we observed negative sentiment when using ChatGPT to debug issues and address automation tasks (e.g., GUI interactions). Our findings show the unmet needs and growing dissatisfaction among developers. Researchers and ChatGPT developers should focus on developing task-specific solutions that help resolve diverse issues, improving user satisfaction and problem-solving efficiency in software development.

### InstantRestore: Single-Step Personalized Face Restoration with   Shared-Image Attention
**Authors**: Howard Zhang, Yuval Alaluf, Sizhuo Ma, Achuta Kadambi, Jian Wang, Kfir Aberman

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:43:46Z

**Summary**: Face image restoration aims to enhance degraded facial images while addressing challenges such as diverse degradation types, real-time processing demands, and, most crucially, the preservation of identity-specific features. Existing methods often struggle with slow processing times and suboptimal restoration, especially under severe degradation, failing to accurately reconstruct finer-level identity details. To address these issues, we introduce InstantRestore, a novel framework that leverages a single-step image diffusion model and an attention-sharing mechanism for fast and personalized face restoration. Additionally, InstantRestore incorporates a novel landmark attention loss, aligning key facial landmarks to refine the attention maps, enhancing identity preservation. At inference time, given a degraded input and a small (~4) set of reference images, InstantRestore performs a single forward pass through the network to achieve near real-time performance. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full diffusion processes or per-identity model tuning, InstantRestore offers a scalable solution suitable for large-scale applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstantRestore outperforms existing methods in quality and speed, making it an appealing choice for identity-preserving face restoration.

### ZS4C: Zero-Shot Synthesis of Compilable Code for Incomplete Code   Snippets using LLMs
**Authors**: Azmain Kabir, Shaowei Wang, Yuan Tian, Tse-Hsun Chen, Muhammad Asaduzzaman, Wenbin Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:41:35Z

**Summary**: Technical Q&A sites are valuable for software developers seeking knowledge, but the code snippets they provide are often uncompilable and incomplete due to unresolved types and missing libraries. This poses a challenge for users who wish to reuse or analyze these snippets. Existing methods either do not focus on creating compilable code or have low success rates. To address this, we propose ZS4C, a lightweight approach for zero-shot synthesis of compilable code from incomplete snippets using Large Language Models (LLMs). ZS4C operates in two stages: first, it uses an LLM, like GPT-3.5, to identify missing import statements in a snippet; second, it collaborates with a validator (e.g., compiler) to fix compilation errors caused by incorrect imports and syntax issues. We evaluated ZS4C on the StatType-SO benchmark and a new dataset, Python-SO, which includes 539 Python snippets from Stack Overflow across the 20 most popular Python libraries. ZS4C significantly outperforms existing methods, improving the compilation rate from 63% to 95.1% compared to the state-of-the-art SnR, marking a 50.1% improvement. On average, ZS4C can infer more accurate import statements (with an F1 score of 0.98) than SnR, with an improvement of 8.5% in the F1.

### Refusal Tokens: A Simple Way to Calibrate Refusals in Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Neel Jain, Aditya Shrivastava, Chenyang Zhu, Daben Liu, Alfy Samuel, Ashwinee Panda, Anoop Kumar, Micah Goldblum, Tom Goldstein

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:40:44Z

**Summary**: A key component of building safe and reliable language models is enabling the models to appropriately refuse to follow certain instructions or answer certain questions. We may want models to output refusal messages for various categories of user queries, for example, ill-posed questions, instructions for committing illegal acts, or queries which require information past the model's knowledge horizon. Engineering models that refuse to answer such questions is complicated by the fact that an individual may want their model to exhibit varying levels of sensitivity for refusing queries of various categories, and different users may want different refusal rates. The current default approach involves training multiple models with varying proportions of refusal messages from each category to achieve the desired refusal rates, which is computationally expensive and may require training a new model to accommodate each user's desired preference over refusal rates. To address these challenges, we propose refusal tokens, one such token for each refusal category or a single refusal token, which are prepended to the model's responses during training. We then show how to increase or decrease the probability of generating the refusal token for each category during inference to steer the model's refusal behavior. Refusal tokens enable controlling a single model's refusal rates without the need of any further fine-tuning, but only by selectively intervening during generation.

### ONEBench to Test Them All: Sample-Level Benchmarking Over Open-Ended   Capabilities
**Authors**: Adhiraj Ghosh, Sebastian Dziadzio, Ameya Prabhu, Vishaal Udandarao, Samuel Albanie, Matthias Bethge

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:37:14Z

**Summary**: Traditional fixed test sets fall short in evaluating open-ended capabilities of foundation models. To address this, we propose ONEBench(OpeN-Ended Benchmarking), a new testing paradigm that consolidates individual evaluation datasets into a unified, ever-expanding sample pool. ONEBench allows users to generate custom, open-ended evaluation benchmarks from this pool, corresponding to specific capabilities of interest. By aggregating samples across test sets, ONEBench enables the assessment of diverse capabilities beyond those covered by the original test sets, while mitigating overfitting and dataset bias. Most importantly, it frames model evaluation as a collective process of selecting and aggregating sample-level tests.   The shift from task-specific benchmarks to ONEBench introduces two challenges: (1)heterogeneity and (2)incompleteness. Heterogeneity refers to the aggregation over diverse metrics, while incompleteness describes comparing models evaluated on different data subsets. To address these challenges, we explore algorithms to aggregate sparse measurements into reliable model scores. Our aggregation algorithm ensures identifiability(asymptotically recovering ground-truth scores) and rapid convergence, enabling accurate model ranking with less data. On homogenous datasets, we show our aggregation algorithm provides rankings that highly correlate with those produced by average scores. We also demonstrate robustness to ~95% of measurements missing, reducing evaluation cost by up to 20x with little-to-no change in model rankings. We introduce ONEBench-LLM for language models and ONEBench-LMM for vision-language models, unifying evaluations across these domains. Overall, we present a technique for open-ended evaluation, which can aggregate over incomplete, heterogeneous sample-level measurements to continually grow a benchmark alongside the rapidly developing foundation models.

**Summary**: We present a comprehensive report on compressing the Llama 3.1 8B and Mistral NeMo 12B models to 4B and 8B parameters, respectively, using pruning and distillation. We explore two distinct pruning strategies: (1) depth pruning and (2) joint hidden/attention/MLP (width) pruning, and evaluate the results on common benchmarks from the LM Evaluation Harness. The models are then aligned with NeMo Aligner and tested in instruct-tuned versions. This approach produces a compelling 4B model from Llama 3.1 8B and a state-of-the-art Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B (MN-Minitron-8B for brevity) model from Mistral NeMo 12B. We found that with no access to the original data, it is beneficial to slightly fine-tune teacher models on the distillation dataset. We open-source our base model weights on Hugging Face with a permissive license.

### JAPAGEN: Efficient Few/Zero-shot Learning via Japanese Training Dataset   Generation with LLM
**Authors**: Takuro Fujii, Satoru Katsumata

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:27:32Z

**Summary**: Recently some studies have highlighted the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as effective generators of supervised training data, offering advantages such as enhanced inference efficiency and reduced costs associated with data collection. However, these studies have predominantly focused on English language tasks. In this paper, we address the fundamental research question: Can LLMs serve as proficient training data generators for other language tasks? Specifically, we leverage LLMs to synthesize supervised training data under few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios across six diverse Japanese downstream tasks. Subsequently, we utilize this synthesized data to train compact models (e.g., BERT). This novel methodology is termed JAPAGEN. Our experimental findings underscore that JAPAGEN achieves robust performance in classification tasks that necessitate formal text inputs, demonstrating competitive results compared to conventional LLM prompting strategies.

### OW-VISCapTor: Abstractors for Open-World Video Instance Segmentation and   Captioning
**Authors**: Anwesa Choudhuri, Girish Chowdhary, Alexander G. Schwing

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:19:05Z

**Summary**: We propose the new task 'open-world video instance segmentation and captioning'. It requires to detect, segment, track and describe with rich captions never before seen objects. This challenging task can be addressed by developing "abstractors" which connect a vision model and a language foundation model. Concretely, we connect a multi-scale visual feature extractor and a large language model (LLM) by developing an object abstractor and an object-to-text abstractor. The object abstractor, consisting of a prompt encoder and transformer blocks, introduces spatially-diverse open-world object queries to discover never before seen objects in videos. An inter-query contrastive loss further encourages the diversity of object queries. The object-to-text abstractor is augmented with masked cross-attention and acts as a bridge between the object queries and a frozen LLM to generate rich and descriptive object-centric captions for each detected object. Our generalized approach surpasses the baseline that jointly addresses the tasks of open-world video instance segmentation and dense video object captioning by 13% on never before seen objects, and by 10% on object-centric captions.

### AutoDCWorkflow: LLM-based Data Cleaning Workflow Auto-Generation and   Benchmark
**Authors**: Lan Li, Liri Fang, Vetle I. Torvik

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:13:27Z

**Summary**: We investigate the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for automatically generating data-cleaning workflows. To evaluate LLMs' ability to complete data-cleaning tasks, we implemented a pipeline for LLM-based Auto Data Cleaning Workflow (AutoDCWorkflow), prompting LLMs on data cleaning operations to repair three types of data quality issues: duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent data formats. Given a dirty table and a purpose (expressed as a query), this pipeline generates a minimal, clean table sufficient to address the purpose and the data cleaning workflow used to produce the table. The planning process involves three main LLM-driven components: (1) Select Target Columns: Identifies a set of target columns related to the purpose. (2) Inspect Column Quality: Assesses the data quality for each target column and generates a Data Quality Report as operation objectives. (3) Generate Operation & Arguments: Predicts the next operation and arguments based on the data quality report results. Additionally, we propose a data cleaning benchmark to evaluate the capability of LLM agents to automatically generate workflows that address data cleaning purposes of varying difficulty levels. The benchmark comprises the annotated datasets as a collection of purpose, raw table, clean table, data cleaning workflow, and answer set. In our experiments, we evaluated three LLMs that auto-generate purpose-driven data cleaning workflows. The results indicate that LLMs perform well in planning and generating data-cleaning workflows without the need for fine-tuning.

### Piecewise-linear modeling of multivariate geometric extremes
**Authors**: Ryan Campbell, Jennifer Wadsworth

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:09:25Z

**Summary**: A recent development in extreme value modeling uses the geometry of the dataset to perform inference on the multivariate tail. A key quantity in this inference is the gauge function, whose values define this geometry. Methodology proposed to date for capturing the gauge function either lacks flexibility due to parametric specifications, or relies on complex neural network specifications in dimensions greater than three. We propose a semiparametric gauge function that is piecewise-linear, making it simple to interpret and provides a good approximation for the true underlying gauge function. This linearity also makes optimization tasks computationally inexpensive. The piecewise-linear gauge function can be used to define both a radial and an angular model, allowing for the joint fitting of extremal pseudo-polar coordinates, a key aspect of this geometric framework. We further expand the toolkit for geometric extremal modeling through the estimation of high radial quantiles at given angular values via kernel density estimation. We apply the new methodology to air pollution data, which exhibits a complex extremal dependence structure.

**Authors**: Bar Genossar, Thinh On, Md. Mouinul Islam, Ben Eliav, Senjuti Basu Roy, Avigdor Gal

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T17:59:59Z

**Summary**: We investigate the problem of selecting features for datasets that can be naturally partitioned into subgroups (e.g., according to socio-demographic groups and age), each with its own dominant set of features. Within this subgroup-oriented framework, we address the challenge of systematic missing data, a scenario in which some feature values are missing for all tuples of a subgroup, due to flawed data integration, regulatory constraints, or privacy concerns. Feature selection is governed by finding mutual Information, a popular quantification of correlation, between features and a target variable. Our goal is to identify top-K feature subsets of some fixed size with the highest joint mutual information with a target variable. In the presence of systematic missing data, the closed form of mutual information could not simply be applied. We argue that in such a setting, leveraging relationships between available feature mutual information within a subgroup or across subgroups can assist inferring missing mutual information values. We propose a generalizable model based on heterogeneous graph neural network to identify interdependencies between feature-subgroup-target variable connections by modeling it as a multiplex graph, and employing information propagation between its nodes. We address two distinct scalability challenges related to training and propose principled solutions to tackle them. Through an extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solutions both qualitatively and running time wise.

### When Composite Likelihood Meets Stochastic Approximation
**Authors**: Giuseppe Alfonzetti, Ruggero Bellio, Yunxiao Chen, Irini Moustaki

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T17:47:02Z

**Summary**: A composite likelihood is an inference function derived by multiplying a set of likelihood components. This approach provides a flexible framework for drawing inference when the likelihood function of a statistical model is computationally intractable. While composite likelihood has computational advantages, it can still be demanding when dealing with numerous likelihood components and a large sample size. This paper tackles this challenge by employing an approximation of the conventional composite likelihood estimator, which is derived from an optimization procedure relying on stochastic gradients. This novel estimator is shown to be asymptotically normally distributed around the true parameter. In particular, based on the relative divergent rate of the sample size and the number of iterations of the optimization, the variance of the limiting distribution is shown to compound for two sources of uncertainty: the sampling variability of the data and the optimization noise, with the latter depending on the sampling distribution used to construct the stochastic gradients. The advantages of the proposed framework are illustrated through simulation studies on two working examples: an Ising model for binary data and a gamma frailty model for count data. Finally, a real-data application is presented, showing its effectiveness in a large-scale mental health survey.

### Geometric distances between closed universes
**Authors**: Arthur G. Suvorov

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T17:42:44Z

**Summary**: The large-scale structure of the universe is well-approximated by the Friedmann equations, parameterised by several energy densities which can be observationally inferred. A natural question to ask is: how different would the universe be if these densities took on other values? While there are many ways this can be approached depending on interpretation and mathematical rigour, we attempt an answer by building a "history space" of different cosmologies. A metric is introduced after overcoming technical hurdles related to Lorentzian signature and infinite volume, at least for topologically-closed cases. Geodesics connecting two points on the superspace are computed to express how distant -- in a purely geometric sense -- two universes are. Age can be treated as a free parameter in such an approach, leading to a more general mathematical construct relative to geometrodynamical configuration-space. Connections to bubble inflation and phase transitions are explored.

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T17:31:54Z

**Summary**: As the capabilities of code large language models (LLMs) continue to expand, their applications across diverse code intelligence domains are rapidly increasing. However, most existing datasets only evaluate limited application domains. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive code evaluation dataset FullStack Bench focusing on full-stack programming, which encompasses a wide range of application domains (e.g., basic programming, data analysis, software engineering, mathematics, and machine learning). Besides, to assess multilingual programming capabilities, in FullStack Bench, we design real-world instructions and corresponding unit test cases from 16 widely-used programming languages to reflect real-world usage scenarios rather than simple translations. Moreover, we also release an effective code sandbox execution tool (i.e., SandboxFusion) supporting various programming languages and packages to evaluate the performance of our FullStack Bench efficiently. Comprehensive experimental results on our FullStack Bench demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our FullStack Bench and SandboxFusion.

### Exploring Critical Testing Scenarios for Decision-Making Policies: An   LLM Approach
**Authors**: Weichao Xu, Huaxin Pei, Jingxuan Yang, Yuchen Shi, Yi Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T17:27:04Z

**Summary**: Recent years have witnessed surprising achievements of decision-making policies across various fields, such as autonomous driving and robotics. Testing for decision-making policies is crucial with the existence of critical scenarios that may threaten their reliability. Numerous research efforts have been dedicated to testing these policies. However, there are still significant challenges, such as low testing efficiency and diversity due to the complexity of the policies and environments under test. Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs), in this paper, we propose an LLM-driven online testing framework for efficiently testing decision-making policies. The main idea is to employ an LLM-based test scenario generator to intelligently generate challenging test cases through contemplation and reasoning. Specifically, we first design a "generate-test-feedback" pipeline and apply templated prompt engineering to fully leverage the knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Then, we introduce a multi-scale scenario generation strategy to address the inherent challenges LLMs face in making fine adjustments, further enhancing testing efficiency. Finally, we evaluate the LLM-driven approach on five widely used benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in uncovering both critical and diverse scenarios.

### Toward LLM-Agent-Based Modeling of Transportation Systems: A Conceptual   Framework
**Authors**: Tianming Liu, Jirong Yang, Yafeng Yin

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T17:24:41Z

**Summary**: In transportation system demand modeling and simulation, agent-based models and microsimulations are current state-of-the-art approaches. However, existing agent-based models still have some limitations on behavioral realism and resource demand that limit their applicability. In this study, leveraging the emerging technology of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents, we propose a general LLM-agent-based modeling framework for transportation systems. We argue that LLM agents not only possess the essential capabilities to function as agents but also offer promising solutions to overcome some limitations of existing agent-based models. Our conceptual framework design closely replicates the decision-making and interaction processes and traits of human travelers within transportation networks, and we demonstrate that the proposed systems can meet critical behavioral criteria for decision-making and learning behaviors using related studies and a demonstrative example of LLM agents' learning and adjustment in the bottleneck setting. Although further refinement of the LLM-agent-based modeling framework is necessary, we believe that this approach has the potential to improve transportation system modeling and simulation.

### ILLUME: Illuminating Your LLMs to See, Draw, and Self-Enhance
**Authors**: Chunwei Wang, Guansong Lu, Junwei Yang, Runhui Huang, Jianhua Han, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Hang Xu

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T17:11:50Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce ILLUME, a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) that seamlessly integrates multimodal understanding and generation capabilities within a single large language model through a unified next-token prediction formulation. To address the large dataset size typically required for image-text alignment, we propose to enhance data efficiency through the design of a vision tokenizer that incorporates semantic information and a progressive multi-stage training procedure. This approach reduces the dataset size to just 15M for pretraining -- over four times fewer than what is typically needed -- while achieving competitive or even superior performance with existing unified MLLMs, such as Janus. Additionally, to promote synergistic enhancement between understanding and generation capabilities, which is under-explored in previous works, we introduce a novel self-enhancing multimodal alignment scheme. This scheme supervises the MLLM to self-assess the consistency between text descriptions and self-generated images, facilitating the model to interpret images more accurately and avoid unrealistic and incorrect predictions caused by misalignment in image generation. Based on extensive experiments, our proposed ILLUME stands out and competes with state-of-the-art unified MLLMs and specialized models across various benchmarks for multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

### Efficiency Meets Fidelity: A Novel Quantization Framework for Stable   Diffusion
**Authors**: Shuaiting Li, Juncan Deng, Zeyu Wang, Hong Gu, Kedong Xu, Haibin Shen, Kejie Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T17:00:20Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image generation of Stable Diffusion models has achieved notable success due to its remarkable generation ability. However, the repetitive denoising process is computationally intensive during inference, which renders Diffusion models less suitable for real-world applications that require low latency and scalability. Recent studies have employed post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) methods to compress Diffusion models. Nevertheless, prior research has often neglected to examine the consistency between results generated by quantized models and those from floating-point models. This consistency is crucial in fields such as content creation, design, and edge deployment, as it can significantly enhance both efficiency and system stability for practitioners. To ensure that quantized models generate high-quality and consistent images, we propose an efficient quantization framework for Stable Diffusion models. Our approach features a Serial-to-Parallel calibration pipeline that addresses the consistency of both the calibration and inference processes, as well as ensuring training stability. Based on this pipeline, we further introduce a mix-precision quantization strategy, multi-timestep activation quantization, and time information precalculation techniques to ensure high-fidelity generation in comparison to floating-point models. Through extensive experiments with Stable Diffusion v1-4, v2-1, and XL 1.0, we have demonstrated that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art techniques when tested on prompts from the COCO validation dataset and the Stable-Diffusion-Prompts dataset. Under W4A8 quantization settings, our approach enhances both distribution similarity and visual similarity by 45%-60%.

### GEAR: A Simple GENERATE, EMBED, AVERAGE AND RANK Approach for   Unsupervised Reverse Dictionary
**Authors**: Fatemah Almeman, Luis Espinosa-Anke

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:54:54Z

**Summary**: Reverse Dictionary (RD) is the task of obtaining the most relevant word or set of words given a textual description or dictionary definition. Effective RD methods have applications in accessibility, translation or writing support systems. Moreover, in NLP research we find RD to be used to benchmark text encoders at various granularities, as it often requires word, definition and sentence embeddings. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to RD that leverages LLMs in combination with embedding models. Despite its simplicity, this approach outperforms supervised baselines in well studied RD datasets, while also showing less over-fitting. We also conduct a number of experiments on different dictionaries and analyze how different styles, registers and target audiences impact the quality of RD systems. We conclude that, on average, untuned embeddings alone fare way below an LLM-only baseline (although they are competitive in highly technical dictionaries), but are crucial for boosting performance in combined methods.

### How transformers learn structured data: insights from hierarchical   filtering
**Authors**: Jerome Garnier-Brun, Marc Mézard, Emanuele Moscato, Luca Saglietti

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:53:42Z

**Summary**: Understanding the learning process and the embedded computation in transformers is becoming a central goal for the development of interpretable AI. In the present study, we introduce a hierarchical filtering procedure for generative models of sequences on trees, allowing us to hand-tune the range of positional correlations in the data. Leveraging this controlled setting, we provide evidence that vanilla encoder-only transformers can approximate the exact inference algorithm when trained on root classification and masked language modeling tasks, and study how this computation is discovered and implemented. We find that correlations at larger distances, corresponding to increasing layers of the hierarchy, are sequentially included by the network during training. Moreover, by comparing attention maps from models trained with varying degrees of filtering and by probing the different encoder levels, we find clear evidence of a reconstruction of correlations on successive length scales corresponding to the various levels of the hierarchy, which we relate to a plausible implementation of the exact inference algorithm within the same architecture.

### Chatbots im Schulunterricht: Wir testen das Fobizz-Tool zur   automatischen Bewertung von Hausaufgaben
**Authors**: Rainer Mühlhoff, Marte Henningsen

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:50:02Z

**Summary**: This study examines the AI-powered grading tool "AI Grading Assistant" by the German company Fobizz, designed to support teachers in evaluating and providing feedback on student assignments. Against the societal backdrop of an overburdened education system and rising expectations for artificial intelligence as a solution to these challenges, the investigation evaluates the tool's functional suitability through two test series. The results reveal significant shortcomings: The tool's numerical grades and qualitative feedback are often random and do not improve even when its suggestions are incorporated. The highest ratings are achievable only with texts generated by ChatGPT. False claims and nonsensical submissions frequently go undetected, while the implementation of some grading criteria is unreliable and opaque. Since these deficiencies stem from the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), fundamental improvements to this or similar tools are not immediately foreseeable. The study critiques the broader trend of adopting AI as a quick fix for systemic problems in education, concluding that Fobizz's marketing of the tool as an objective and time-saving solution is misleading and irresponsible. Finally, the study calls for systematic evaluation and subject-specific pedagogical scrutiny of the use of AI tools in educational contexts.

### Can tweets predict article retractions? A comparison between human and   LLM labelling
**Authors**: Er-Te Zheng, Hui-Zhen Fu, Mike Thelwall, Zhichao Fang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:42:25Z

**Summary**: Quickly detecting problematic research articles is crucial to safeguarding the integrity of scientific research. This study explores whether Twitter mentions of retracted articles can signal potential problems with the articles prior to their retraction, potentially serving as an early warning system for scholars. To investigate this, we analysed a dataset of 4,354 Twitter mentions associated with 504 retracted articles. The effectiveness of Twitter mentions in predicting article retractions was evaluated by both manual and Large Language Model (LLM) labelling. Manual labelling results indicated that 25.7% of tweets signalled problems before retraction. Using the manual labelling results as the baseline, we found that LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and Claude-3.5-Haiku) outperformed lexicon-based sentiment analysis tools (e.g., TextBlob) in detecting potential problems, suggesting that automatic detection of problematic articles from social media using LLMs is technically feasible. Nevertheless, since only a small proportion of retracted articles (11.1%) were criticised on Twitter prior to retraction, such automatic systems would detect only a minority of problematic articles. Overall, this study offers insights into how social media data, coupled with emerging generative AI techniques, can support research integrity.

### "Bursts, Beats, and Beyond": Uncovering the landscape from accretion to   ignition of 4U 1728--34 using \textit{AstroSat}
**Authors**: Anirudh Salgundi, Suman Bala, Gayathri Raman, Utkarsh Pathak, Varun Bhalerao

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:37:43Z

**Summary**: A comprehensive study on persistent and thermonuclear burst emission of 4U 1728--34, commonly known as `Slow Burster' is performed using seven archival observations of \textit{AstroSat} spanning from 2016--2019. The burst-free persistent spectra can be well fitted with a blackbody \texttt{bbody} and a powerlaw \texttt{powerlaw} components, with a powerlaw photon index ($\Gamma$) was found to be $\sim$2 indicating the source was in ``high/soft" bananna state or intermediate state. The time averaged power density spectrum reveals the presence of twin kilohertz Quasi Periodic Oscillations (kHz QPOs) with centroid frequencies $619\pm10$~Hz and $965\pm6$~Hz with a maximum fractional root mean squared amplitude of $6.24\pm1.31$~\% at $\sim$16~keV. From the upper kHz QPO, we infer the magnetospheric disk radius to be $\sim$17~km, corresponding to a magnetic field strength of 0.35--1.27$~\times~10^7$~G. The burst spectral evolution indicates Photospheric Radius Expansion (PRE) in five bursts, yielding a touchdown radius of 3.1--5.47~km. These bursts reached near-Eddington luminosities, through which the distance of the source was calculated to be 5.18--5.21~kpc. Two of the bursts show coherent oscillations at 362.81--363.93~Hz. The presence of twin kHz QPOs and coherent Burst Oscillations allows us to provide two different estimates for the spin frequency of the Neutron Star in the system, for the first time using \textit{AstroSat}.

### How Transformers Solve Propositional Logic Problems: A Mechanistic   Analysis
**Authors**: Guan Zhe Hong, Nishanth Dikkala, Enming Luo, Cyrus Rashtchian, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:36:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown amazing performance on tasks that require planning and reasoning. Motivated by this, we investigate the internal mechanisms that underpin a network's ability to perform complex logical reasoning. We first construct a synthetic propositional logic problem that serves as a concrete test-bed for network training and evaluation. Crucially, this problem demands nontrivial planning to solve. We perform our study on two fronts. First, we pursue an understanding of precisely how a three-layer transformer, trained from scratch and attains perfect test accuracy, solves this problem. We are able to identify certain "planning" and "reasoning" mechanisms in the network that necessitate cooperation between the attention blocks to implement the desired logic. Second, we study how pretrained LLMs, namely Mistral-7B and Gemma-2-9B, solve this problem. We characterize their reasoning circuits through causal intervention experiments, providing necessity and sufficiency evidence for the circuits. We find evidence suggesting that the two models' latent reasoning strategies are surprisingly similar, and human-like. Overall, our work systemically uncovers novel aspects of small and large transformers, and continues the study of how they plan and reason.

### RARE: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Enhancement for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Hieu Tran, Zonghai Yao, Junda Wang, Yifan Zhang, Zhichao Yang, Hong Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:26:09Z

**Summary**: This work introduces RARE (Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Enhancement), a versatile extension to the mutual reasoning framework (rStar), aimed at enhancing reasoning accuracy and factual integrity across large language models (LLMs) for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks such as commonsense and medical reasoning. RARE incorporates two innovative actions within the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework: A6, which generates search queries based on the initial problem statement, performs information retrieval using those queries, and augments reasoning with the retrieved data to formulate the final answer; and A7, which leverages information retrieval specifically for generated sub-questions and re-answers these sub-questions with the relevant contextual information. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Scorer is proposed to replace the original discriminator, prioritizing reasoning paths that meet high standards of factuality. Experimental results with LLaMA 3.1 show that RARE enables open-source LLMs to achieve competitive performance with top open-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o. This research establishes RARE as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains where logical coherence and factual integrity are critical.

### M$^{2}$UGen: Multi-modal Music Understanding and Generation with the   Power of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shansong Liu, Atin Sakkeer Hussain, Qilong Wu, Chenshuo Sun, Ying Shan

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:15:07Z

**Summary**: The current landscape of research leveraging large language models (LLMs) is experiencing a surge. Many works harness the powerful reasoning capabilities of these models to comprehend various modalities, such as text, speech, images, videos, etc. They also utilize LLMs to understand human intention and generate desired outputs like images, videos, and music. However, research that combines both understanding and generation using LLMs is still limited and in its nascent stage. To address this gap, we introduce a Multi-modal Music Understanding and Generation (M$^{2}$UGen) framework that integrates LLM's abilities to comprehend and generate music for different modalities. The M$^{2}$UGen framework is purpose-built to unlock creative potential from diverse sources of inspiration, encompassing music, image, and video through the use of pretrained MERT, ViT, and ViViT models, respectively. To enable music generation, we explore the use of AudioLDM 2 and MusicGen. Bridging multi-modal understanding and music generation is accomplished through the integration of the LLaMA 2 model. Furthermore, we make use of the MU-LLaMA model to generate extensive datasets that support text/image/video-to-music generation, facilitating the training of our M$^{2}$UGen framework. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our proposed framework. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves or surpasses the performance of the current state-of-the-art models.

### Copyright-Protected Language Generation via Adaptive Model Fusion
**Authors**: Javier Abad, Konstantin Donhauser, Francesco Pinto, Fanny Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:13:17Z

**Summary**: The risk of language models reproducing copyrighted material from their training data has led to the development of various protective measures. Among these, inference-time strategies that impose constraints via post-processing have shown promise in addressing the complexities of copyright regulation. However, they often incur prohibitive computational costs or suffer from performance trade-offs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Copyright-Protecting Model Fusion (CP-Fuse), a novel approach that combines models trained on disjoint sets of copyrighted material during inference. In particular, CP-Fuse adaptively aggregates the model outputs to minimize the reproduction of copyrighted content, adhering to a crucial balancing property that prevents the regurgitation of memorized data. Through extensive experiments, we show that CP-Fuse significantly reduces the reproduction of protected material without compromising the quality of text and code generation. Moreover, its post-hoc nature allows seamless integration with other protective measures, further enhancing copyright safeguards. Lastly, we show that CP-Fuse is robust against common techniques for extracting training data.

### AI TrackMate: Finally, Someone Who Will Give Your Music More Than Just   "Sounds Great!"
**Authors**: Yi-Lin Jiang, Chia-Ho Hsiung, Yen-Tung Yeh, Lu-Rong Chen, Bo-Yu Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:09:44Z

**Summary**: The rise of "bedroom producers" has democratized music creation, while challenging producers to objectively evaluate their work. To address this, we present AI TrackMate, an LLM-based music chatbot designed to provide constructive feedback on music productions. By combining LLMs' inherent musical knowledge with direct audio track analysis, AI TrackMate offers production-specific insights, distinguishing it from text-only approaches. Our framework integrates a Music Analysis Module, an LLM-Readable Music Report, and Music Production-Oriented Feedback Instruction, creating a plug-and-play, training-free system compatible with various LLMs and adaptable to future advancements. We demonstrate AI TrackMate's capabilities through an interactive web interface and present findings from a pilot study with a music producer. By bridging AI capabilities with the needs of independent producers, AI TrackMate offers on-demand analytical feedback, potentially supporting the creative process and skill development in music production. This system addresses the growing demand for objective self-assessment tools in the evolving landscape of independent music production.

### Macroscopic Quantum States and Universal Correlations in a   Disorder-Order Interface Propagating over a 1D Ground State
**Authors**: Vanja Marić, Florent Ferro, Maurizio Fagotti

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:01:04Z

**Summary**: We consider translationally invariant quantum spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains with local interactions and a discrete symmetry that is spontaneously broken at zero temperature. We envision experimenters switching off the couplings between two parts of the system and preparing them in independent equilibrium states. One side of the chain settles into a symmetry-breaking ground state. When the couplings are switched back on, time evolution ensues. We argue that in integrable systems the front separating the ordered region recedes at the maximal velocity of quasiparticle excitations over the ground state. We infer that, generically, the order parameters should vary on a subdiffusive scale of order $t^{1/3}$, where $t$ is time, and their fluctuations should exhibit the same scaling. Thus, the interfacial region exhibits full range correlations, indicating that it cannot be decomposed into nearly uncorrelated subsystems. Using the transverse-field Ising chain as a case study, we demonstrate that all order parameters follow the same universal scaling functions. Through an analysis of the skew information, we uncover that the breakdown of cluster decomposition has a quantum contribution: each subsystem within the interfacial region, with extent comparable to the region, exists in a macroscopic quantum state.

### APOLLO: SGD-like Memory, AdamW-level Performance
**Authors**: Hanqing Zhu, Zhenyu Zhang, Wenyan Cong, Xi Liu, Sem Park, Vikas Chandra, Bo Long, David Z. Pan, Zhangyang Wang, Jinwon Lee

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:01:00Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are notoriously memory-intensive during training, particularly with the popular AdamW optimizer. This memory burden necessitates using more or higher-end GPUs or reducing batch sizes, limiting training scalability and throughput. To address this, various memory-efficient optimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, they face critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii) significant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) still substantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance.   In this work, we identify that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can be effectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on this insight, we propose Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLM Optimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using an auxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. This structured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further memory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Even its rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performance compared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs.   Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par with or better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearly eliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significant system-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GB setup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes. (2) Improved Model Scalability: Pre-training LLaMA-13B with naive DDP on A100-80GB GPUs without system-level optimizations. (3) Low-End GPU Friendly Pre-training: Pre-training LLaMA-7B on a single GPU using less than 12 GB of memory with weight quantization.

### Vulnerability of Text-Matching in ML/AI Conference Reviewer Assignments   to Collusions
**Authors**: Jhih-Yi, Hsieh, Aditi Raghunathan, Nihar B. Shah

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T15:55:20Z

**Summary**: In the peer review process of top-tier machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) conferences, reviewers are assigned to papers through automated methods. These assignment algorithms consider two main factors: (1) reviewers' expressed interests indicated by their bids for papers, and (2) reviewers' domain expertise inferred from the similarity between the text of their previously published papers and the submitted manuscripts. A significant challenge these conferences face is the existence of collusion rings, where groups of researchers manipulate the assignment process to review each other's papers, providing positive evaluations regardless of their actual quality. Most efforts to combat collusion rings have focused on preventing bid manipulation, under the assumption that the text similarity component is secure. In this paper, we demonstrate that even in the absence of bidding, colluding reviewers and authors can exploit the machine learning based text-matching component of reviewer assignment used at top ML/AI venues to get assigned their target paper. We also highlight specific vulnerabilities within this system and offer suggestions to enhance its robustness.

**Authors**: Justin D. Weisz, Shraddha Kumar, Michael Muller, Karen-Ellen Browne, Arielle Goldberg, Ellice Heintze, Shagun Bajpai

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T15:53:00Z

**Summary**: AI assistants are being created to help software engineers conduct a variety of coding-related tasks, such as writing, documenting, and testing code. We describe the use of the watsonx Code Assistant (WCA), an LLM-powered coding assistant deployed internally within IBM. Through surveys of two user cohorts (N=669) and unmoderated usability testing (N=15), we examined developers' experiences with WCA and its impact on their productivity. We learned about their motivations for using (or not using) WCA, we examined their expectations of its speed and quality, and we identified new considerations regarding ownership of and responsibility for generated code. Our case study characterizes the impact of an LLM-powered assistant on developers' perceptions of productivity and it shows that although such tools do often provide net productivity increases, these benefits may not always be experienced by all users.

### Anchoring Bias in Large Language Models: An Experimental Study
**Authors**: Jiaxu Lou

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T15:45:03Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Gemini have significantly advanced artificial intelligence by enabling machines to generate and comprehend human-like text. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs are not immune to limitations, including various biases. While much research has explored demographic biases, the cognitive biases in LLMs have not been equally scrutinized. This study delves into anchoring bias, a cognitive bias where initial information disproportionately influences judgment. Utilizing an experimental dataset, we examine how anchoring bias manifests in LLMs and verify the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of LLM responses to biased hints. At the same time, our experiments show that, to mitigate anchoring bias, one needs to collect hints from comprehensive angles to prevent the LLMs from being anchored to individual pieces of information, while simple algorithms such as Chain-of-Thought, Thoughts of Principles, Ignoring Anchor Hints, and Reflection are not sufficient.

### CIC: A Framework for Culturally-Aware Image Captioning
**Authors**: Youngsik Yun, Jihie Kim

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T15:39:30Z

**Summary**: Image Captioning generates descriptive sentences from images using Vision-Language Pre-trained models (VLPs) such as BLIP, which has improved greatly. However, current methods lack the generation of detailed descriptive captions for the cultural elements depicted in the images, such as the traditional clothing worn by people from Asian cultural groups. In this paper, we propose a new framework, Culturally-aware Image Captioning (CIC), that generates captions and describes cultural elements extracted from cultural visual elements in images representing cultures. Inspired by methods combining visual modality and Large Language Models (LLMs) through appropriate prompts, our framework (1) generates questions based on cultural categories from images, (2) extracts cultural visual elements from Visual Question Answering (VQA) using generated questions, and (3) generates culturally-aware captions using LLMs with the prompts. Our human evaluation conducted on 45 participants from 4 different cultural groups with a high understanding of the corresponding culture shows that our proposed framework generates more culturally descriptive captions when compared to the image captioning baseline based on VLPs.

### Data Quality Enhancement on the Basis of Diversity with Large Language   Models for Text Classification: Uncovered, Difficult, and Noisy
**Authors**: Min Zeng, Caiquan Liu, Shiqi Zhang, Li Xie, Chen Sang, Xiaoxin Chen, Xiaoxin Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T15:28:39Z

**Summary**: In recent years, the use of large language models (LLMs) for text classification has attracted widespread attention. Despite this, the classification accuracy of LLMs has not yet universally surpassed that of smaller models. LLMs can enhance their performance in text classification through fine-tuning. However, existing data quality research based on LLMs is challenging to apply directly to solve text classification problems. To further improve the performance of LLMs in classification tasks, this paper proposes a data quality enhancement (DQE) method for text classification based on LLMs. This method starts by using a greedy algorithm to select data, dividing the dataset into sampled and unsampled subsets, and then performing fine-tuning of the LLMs using the sampled data. Subsequently, this model is used to predict the outcomes for the unsampled data, categorizing incorrectly predicted data into uncovered, difficult, and noisy data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the performance of LLMs in text classification tasks and significantly improves training efficiency, saving nearly half of the training time. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance in several open-source classification tasks.

### DEX: Data Channel Extension for Efficient CNN Inference on Tiny AI   Accelerators
**Authors**: Taesik Gong, Fahim Kawsar, Chulhong Min

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T15:18:04Z

**Summary**: Tiny machine learning (TinyML) aims to run ML models on small devices and is increasingly favored for its enhanced privacy, reduced latency, and low cost. Recently, the advent of tiny AI accelerators has revolutionized the TinyML field by significantly enhancing hardware processing power. These accelerators, equipped with multiple parallel processors and dedicated per-processor memory instances, offer substantial performance improvements over traditional microcontroller units (MCUs). However, their limited data memory often necessitates downsampling input images, resulting in accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we propose Data channel EXtension (DEX), a novel approach for efficient CNN execution on tiny AI accelerators. DEX incorporates additional spatial information from original images into input images through patch-wise even sampling and channel-wise stacking, effectively extending data across input channels. By leveraging underutilized processors and data memory for channel extension, DEX facilitates parallel execution without increasing inference latency. Our evaluation with four models and four datasets on tiny AI accelerators demonstrates that this simple idea improves accuracy on average by 3.5%p while keeping the inference latency the same on the AI accelerator. The source code is available at https://github.com/Nokia-Bell-Labs/data-channel-extension.

### Applications and Implications of Large Language Models in Qualitative   Analysis: A New Frontier for Empirical Software Engineering
**Authors**: Matheus de Morais Leça, Lucas Valença, Reydne Santos, Ronnie de Souza Santos

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T15:17:36Z

**Summary**: The use of large language models (LLMs) for qualitative analysis is gaining attention in various fields, including software engineering, where qualitative methods are essential for understanding human and social factors. This study aimed to investigate how LLMs are currently used in qualitative analysis and their potential applications in software engineering research, focusing on the benefits, limitations, and practices associated with their use. A systematic mapping study was conducted, analyzing 21 relevant studies to explore reported uses of LLMs for qualitative analysis. The findings indicate that LLMs are primarily used for tasks such as coding, thematic analysis, and data categorization, offering benefits like increased efficiency and support for new researchers. However, limitations such as output variability, challenges in capturing nuanced perspectives, and ethical concerns related to privacy and transparency were also identified. The study emphasizes the need for structured strategies and guidelines to optimize LLM use in qualitative research within software engineering, enhancing their effectiveness while addressing ethical considerations. While LLMs show promise in supporting qualitative analysis, human expertise remains crucial for interpreting data, and ongoing exploration of best practices will be vital for their successful integration into empirical software engineering research.

### Prediction of Occluded Pedestrians in Road Scenes using Human-like   Reasoning: Insights from the OccluRoads Dataset
**Authors**: Melo Castillo Angie Nataly, Martin Serrano Sergio, Salinas Carlota, Sotelo Miguel Angel

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:59:27Z

**Summary**: Pedestrian detection is a critical task in autonomous driving, aimed at enhancing safety and reducing risks on the road. Over recent years, significant advancements have been made in improving detection performance. However, these achievements still fall short of human perception, particularly in cases involving occluded pedestrians, especially entirely invisible ones. In this work, we present the Occlusion-Rich Road Scenes with Pedestrians (OccluRoads) dataset, which features a diverse collection of road scenes with partially and fully occluded pedestrians in both real and virtual environments. All scenes are meticulously labeled and enriched with contextual information that encapsulates human perception in such scenarios. Using this dataset, we developed a pipeline to predict the presence of occluded pedestrians, leveraging Knowledge Graph (KG), Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE), and a Bayesian inference process. Our approach achieves a F1 score of 0.91, representing an improvement of up to 42% compared to traditional machine learning models.

### Challenges and Opportunities for Visual Analytics in Jurisprudence
**Authors**: Daniel Fürst, Mennatallah El-Assady, Daniel A. Keim, Maximilian T. Fischer

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:54:44Z

**Summary**: Exploring, analyzing, and interpreting law can be tedious and challenging, even for legal scholars, since legal texts contain domain-specific language, require knowledge of tacit legal concepts, and are sometimes intentionally ambiguous. In related, text-based domains, Visual Analytics (VA) and large language models (LLMs) have become essential for working with documents as they support data navigation, knowledge representation, and analytical reasoning. However, legal scholars must simultaneously manage hierarchical information sources, leverage implicit domain knowledge, and document complex reasoning processes, which are neither adequately accessible through existing VA designs nor sufficiently supported by current LLMs. To address the needs of legal scholars, we identify previously unexamined challenges and opportunities when applying VA to jurisprudence. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine experts from the legal domain and found that they lacked the ability to articulate their tacit domain knowledge as explicit, machine-interpretable knowledge. Hence, we propose leveraging interactive visualization for this articulation, teaching the machine relevant semantic relationships between legal documents. These relationships inform the predictions of VA and LLMs, facilitating the navigation between the hierarchies of legal document collections. The enhanced navigation can uncover additional relevant legal documents, reinforcing the legal reasoning process by generating legal insights that reflect internalized, tacit domain knowledge. In summary, we provide a human-is-the-loop VA workflow for jurisprudence that recognizes tacit domain knowledge as essential for deriving legal insights. More broadly, we compare this workflow with related text-based research practices, revealing research gaps and guiding visualization researchers in knowledge-assisted VA for law and beyond.

### Sloth: scaling laws for LLM skills to predict multi-benchmark   performance across families
**Authors**: Felipe Maia Polo, Seamus Somerstep, Leshem Choshen, Yuekai Sun, Mikhail Yurochkin

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:51:26Z

**Summary**: Scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) predict model performance based on parameters like size and training data. However, differences in training configurations and data processing across model families lead to significant variations in benchmark performance, making it difficult for a single scaling law to generalize across all LLMs. On the other hand, training family-specific scaling laws requires training models of varying sizes for every family. In this work, we propose Skills Scaling Laws (SSLaws, pronounced as Sloth), a novel scaling law that leverages publicly available benchmark data and assumes LLM performance is driven by low-dimensional latent skills, such as reasoning and instruction following. These latent skills are influenced by computational resources like model size and training tokens but with varying efficiencies across model families. Sloth exploits correlations across benchmarks to provide more accurate and interpretable predictions while alleviating the need to train multiple LLMs per family. We present both theoretical results on parameter identification and empirical evaluations on 12 prominent benchmarks, from Open LLM Leaderboard v1/v2, demonstrating that Sloth predicts LLM performance efficiently and offers insights into scaling behaviors for downstream tasks such as coding and emotional intelligence applications.

### Efficient Task Grouping Through Samplewise Optimisation Landscape   Analysis
**Authors**: Anshul Thakur, Yichen Huang, Soheila Molaei, Yujiang Wang, David A. Clifton

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:46:09Z

**Summary**: Shared training approaches, such as multi-task learning (MTL) and gradient-based meta-learning, are widely used in various machine learning applications, but they often suffer from negative transfer, leading to performance degradation in specific tasks. While several optimisation techniques have been developed to mitigate this issue for pre-selected task cohorts, identifying optimal task combinations for joint learning - known as task grouping - remains underexplored and computationally challenging due to the exponential growth in task combinations and the need for extensive training and evaluation cycles. This paper introduces an efficient task grouping framework designed to reduce these overwhelming computational demands of the existing methods. The proposed framework infers pairwise task similarities through a sample-wise optimisation landscape analysis, eliminating the need for the shared model training required to infer task similarities in existing methods. With task similarities acquired, a graph-based clustering algorithm is employed to pinpoint near-optimal task groups, providing an approximate yet efficient and effective solution to the originally NP-hard problem. Empirical assessments conducted on 8 different datasets highlight the effectiveness of the proposed framework, revealing a five-fold speed enhancement compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework consistently demonstrates comparable performance, confirming its remarkable efficiency and effectiveness in task grouping.

### StableMoFusion: Towards Robust and Efficient Diffusion-based Motion   Generation Framework
**Authors**: Yiheng Huang, Hui Yang, Chuanchen Luo, Yuxi Wang, Shibiao Xu, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Man Zhang, Junran Peng

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:43:56Z

**Summary**: Thanks to the powerful generative capacity of diffusion models, recent years have witnessed rapid progress in human motion generation. Existing diffusion-based methods employ disparate network architectures and training strategies. The effect of the design of each component is still unclear. In addition, the iterative denoising process consumes considerable computational overhead, which is prohibitive for real-time scenarios such as virtual characters and humanoid robots. For this reason, we first conduct a comprehensive investigation into network architectures, training strategies, and inference processs. Based on the profound analysis, we tailor each component for efficient high-quality human motion generation. Despite the promising performance, the tailored model still suffers from foot skating which is an ubiquitous issue in diffusion-based solutions. To eliminate footskate, we identify foot-ground contact and correct foot motions along the denoising process. By organically combining these well-designed components together, we present StableMoFusion, a robust and efficient framework for human motion generation. Extensive experimental results show that our StableMoFusion performs favorably against current state-of-the-art methods. Project page: https://h-y1heng.github.io/StableMoFusion-page/

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:41:04Z

**Summary**: Recent years have seen an explosive increase in research on large language models (LLMs), and accompanying public engagement on the topic. While starting as a niche area within natural language processing, LLMs have shown remarkable potential across a broad range of applications and domains, including games. This paper surveys the current state of the art across the various applications of LLMs in and for games, and identifies the different roles LLMs can take within a game. Importantly, we discuss underexplored areas and promising directions for future uses of LLMs in games and we reconcile the potential and limitations of LLMs within the games domain. As the first comprehensive survey and roadmap at the intersection of LLMs and games, we are hopeful that this paper will serve as the basis for groundbreaking research and innovation in this exciting new field.

### Words2Contact: Identifying Support Contacts from Verbal Instructions   Using Foundation Models
**Authors**: Dionis Totsila, Quentin Rouxel, Jean-Baptiste Mouret, Serena Ivaldi

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:40:51Z

**Summary**: This paper presents Words2Contact, a language-guided multi-contact placement pipeline leveraging large language models and vision language models. Our method is a key component for language-assisted teleoperation and human-robot cooperation, where human operators can instruct the robots where to place their support contacts before whole-body reaching or manipulation using natural language. Words2Contact transforms the verbal instructions of a human operator into contact placement predictions; it also deals with iterative corrections, until the human is satisfied with the contact location identified in the robot's field of view. We benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs and VLMs for size and performance in contact prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the iterative correction process, showing that users, even naive, quickly learn how to instruct the system to obtain accurate locations. Finally, we validate Words2Contact in real-world experiments with the Talos humanoid robot, instructed by human operators to place support contacts on different locations and surfaces to avoid falling when reaching for distant objects.

### A Survey on Multilingual Large Language Models: Corpora, Alignment, and   Bias
**Authors**: Yuemei Xu, Ling Hu, Jiayi Zhao, Zihan Qiu, Kexin XU, Yuqi Ye, Hanwen Gu

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:30:11Z

**Summary**: Based on the foundation of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multilingual LLMs (MLLMs) have been developed to address the challenges faced in multilingual natural language processing, hoping to achieve knowledge transfer from high-resource languages to low-resource languages. However, significant limitations and challenges still exist, such as language imbalance, multilingual alignment, and inherent bias. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of MLLMs, delving deeply into discussions surrounding these critical issues. First of all, we start by presenting an overview of MLLMs, covering their evolutions, key techniques, and multilingual capacities. Secondly, we explore the multilingual training corpora of MLLMs and the multilingual datasets oriented for downstream tasks that are crucial to enhance the cross-lingual capability of MLLMs. Thirdly, we survey the state-of-the-art studies of multilingual representations and investigate whether the current MLLMs can learn a universal language representation. Fourthly, we discuss bias on MLLMs, including its categories, evaluation metrics, and debiasing techniques. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and point out promising research directions of MLLMs.

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:28:38Z

**Summary**: We introduce the Bias-free Extragalactic Analysis for Cosmic Origins with NIRCam (BEACON) survey, a JWST Cycle2 program allocated up to 600 pure-parallel hours of observations. BEACON explores high-latitude areas of the sky with JWST/NIRCam over $\sim100$ independent sightlines, totaling $\sim0.3$deg$^2$, reaching a median F444W depth of $\approx28.2$AB mag (5$\sigma$). Based on existing JWST observations in legacy fields, we estimate that BEACON will photometrically identify 25--150 galaxies at $z>10$ and 500--1000 at $z\sim7$--10 uniquely enabled by an efficient multiple filter configuration spanning $0.9$--5.0$\mu$m. The expected sample size of $z>10$ galaxies will allow us to obtain robust number density estimates and to discriminate between different models of early star formation. In this paper, we present an overview of the survey design and initial results using the first 19 fields. We present 129 galaxy candidates at $z>7$ identified in those fields, including 11 galaxies at $z>10$ and several UV-luminous ($M_{\rm UV}<-21$mag) galaxies at $z\sim8$. The number densities of $z<13$ galaxies inferred from the initial fields are overall consistent with those in the literature. Despite reaching a considerably large volume ($\sim10^5$Mpc$^3$), however, we find no galaxy candidates at $z>13$, providing us with a complimentary insight into early galaxy evolution with minimal cosmic variance. We publish imaging and catalog data products for these initial fields. Upon survey completion, all BEACON data will be coherently processed and distributed to the community along with catalogs for redshift and other physical quantities.

### Imitating Language via Scalable Inverse Reinforcement Learning

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:26:42Z

**Summary**: The majority of language model training builds on imitation learning. It covers pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and affects the starting conditions for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The simplicity and scalability of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for next token prediction led to its role as predominant paradigm. However, the broader field of imitation learning can more effectively utilize the sequential structure underlying autoregressive generation. We focus on investigating the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) perspective to imitation, extracting rewards and directly optimizing sequences instead of individual token likelihoods and evaluate its benefits for fine-tuning large language models. We provide a new angle, reformulating inverse soft-Q-learning as a temporal difference regularized extension of MLE. This creates a principled connection between MLE and IRL and allows trading off added complexity with increased performance and diversity of generations in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting. We find clear advantages for IRL-based imitation, in particular for retaining diversity while maximizing task performance, rendering IRL a strong alternative on fixed SFT datasets even without online data generation. Our analysis of IRL-extracted reward functions further indicates benefits for more robust reward functions via tighter integration of supervised and preference-based LLM post-training.

### The Fusion of Large Language Models and Formal Methods for Trustworthy   AI Agents: A Roadmap
**Authors**: Yedi Zhang, Yufan Cai, Xinyue Zuo, Xiaokun Luan, Kailong Wang, Zhe Hou, Yifan Zhang, Zhiyuan Wei, Meng Sun, Jun Sun, Jing Sun, Jin Song Dong

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:14:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative AI paradigm, profoundly influencing daily life through their exceptional language understanding and contextual generation capabilities. Despite their remarkable performance, LLMs face a critical challenge: the propensity to produce unreliable outputs due to the inherent limitations of their learning-based nature. Formal methods (FMs), on the other hand, are a well-established computation paradigm that provides mathematically rigorous techniques for modeling, specifying, and verifying the correctness of systems. FMs have been extensively applied in mission-critical software engineering, embedded systems, and cybersecurity. However, the primary challenge impeding the deployment of FMs in real-world settings lies in their steep learning curves, the absence of user-friendly interfaces, and issues with efficiency and adaptability.   This position paper outlines a roadmap for advancing the next generation of trustworthy AI systems by leveraging the mutual enhancement of LLMs and FMs. First, we illustrate how FMs, including reasoning and certification techniques, can help LLMs generate more reliable and formally certified outputs. Subsequently, we highlight how the advanced learning capabilities and adaptability of LLMs can significantly enhance the usability, efficiency, and scalability of existing FM tools. Finally, we show that unifying these two computation paradigms -- integrating the flexibility and intelligence of LLMs with the rigorous reasoning abilities of FMs -- has transformative potential for the development of trustworthy AI software systems. We acknowledge that this integration has the potential to enhance both the trustworthiness and efficiency of software engineering practices while fostering the development of intelligent FM tools capable of addressing complex yet real-world challenges.

### Prototypical Hash Encoding for On-the-Fly Fine-Grained Category   Discovery
**Authors**: Haiyang Zheng, Nan Pu, Wenjing Li, Nicu Sebe, Zhun Zhong

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T13:47:36Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we study a practical yet challenging task, On-the-fly Category Discovery (OCD), aiming to online discover the newly-coming stream data that belong to both known and unknown classes, by leveraging only known category knowledge contained in labeled data. Previous OCD methods employ the hash-based technique to represent old/new categories by hash codes for instance-wise inference. However, directly mapping features into low-dimensional hash space not only inevitably damages the ability to distinguish classes and but also causes "high sensitivity" issue, especially for fine-grained classes, leading to inferior performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel Prototypical Hash Encoding (PHE) framework consisting of Category-aware Prototype Generation (CPG) and Discriminative Category Encoding (DCE) to mitigate the sensitivity of hash code while preserving rich discriminative information contained in high-dimension feature space, in a two-stage projection fashion. CPG enables the model to fully capture the intra-category diversity by representing each category with multiple prototypes. DCE boosts the discrimination ability of hash code with the guidance of the generated category prototypes and the constraint of minimum separation distance. By jointly optimizing CPG and DCE, we demonstrate that these two components are mutually beneficial towards an effective OCD. Extensive experiments show the significant superiority of our PHE over previous methods, e.g., obtaining an improvement of +5.3% in ALL ACC averaged on all datasets. Moreover, due to the nature of the interpretable prototypes, we visually analyze the underlying mechanism of how PHE helps group certain samples into either known or unknown categories. Code is available at https://github.com/HaiyangZheng/PHE.

**Summary**: This paper presents the TartuNLP team submission to EvaLatin 2024 shared task of the emotion polarity detection for historical Latin texts. Our system relies on two distinct approaches to annotating training data for supervised learning: 1) creating heuristics-based labels by adopting the polarity lexicon provided by the organizers and 2) generating labels with GPT4. We employed parameter efficient fine-tuning using the adapters framework and experimented with both monolingual and cross-lingual knowledge transfer for training language and task adapters. Our submission with the LLM-generated labels achieved the overall first place in the emotion polarity detection task. Our results show that LLM-based annotations show promising results on texts in Latin.

### Fourier-enhanced reduced-order surrogate modeling for uncertainty   quantification in electric machine design
**Authors**: Aylar Partovizadeh, Sebastian Schöps, Dimitrios Loukrezis

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T13:35:28Z

**Summary**: This work proposes a data-driven surrogate modeling framework for cost-effectively inferring the torque of a permanent magnet synchronous machine under geometric design variations. The framework is separated into a reduced-order modeling and an inference part. Given a dataset of torque signals, each corresponding to a different set of design parameters, torque dimension is first reduced by post-processing a discrete Fourier transform and keeping a reduced number of frequency components. This allows to take advantage of torque periodicity and preserve physical information contained in the frequency components. Next, a response surface model is computed by means of machine learning regression, which maps the design parameters to the reduced frequency components. The response surface models of choice are polynomial chaos expansions, feedforward neural networks, and Gaussian processes. Torque inference is performed by evaluating the response surface model for new design parameters and then inverting the dimension reduction. Numerical results show that the resulting surrogate models lead to sufficiently accurate torque predictions for previously unseen design configurations. The framework is found to be significantly advantageous compared to approximating the original (not reduced) torque signal directly, as well as slightly advantageous compared to using principal component analysis for dimension reduction. The combination of discrete Fourier transform-based dimension reduction with Gaussian process-based response surfaces yields the best-in-class surrogate model for this use case. The surrogate models replace the original, high-fidelity model in Monte Carlo-based uncertainty quantification studies, where they provide accurate torque statistics estimates at significantly reduced computational cost.

### SafeWorld: Geo-Diverse Safety Alignment
**Authors**: Da Yin, Haoyi Qiu, Kung-Hsiang Huang, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun Peng

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T13:31:46Z

**Summary**: In the rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring safety is a crucial and widely discussed topic. However, existing works often overlook the geo-diversity of cultural and legal standards across the world. To demonstrate the challenges posed by geo-diverse safety standards, we introduce SafeWorld, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to generate responses that are not only helpful but also culturally sensitive and legally compliant across diverse global contexts. SafeWorld encompasses 2,342 test user queries, each grounded in high-quality, human-verified cultural norms and legal policies from 50 countries and 493 regions/races. On top of it, we propose a multi-dimensional automatic safety evaluation framework that assesses the contextual appropriateness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of responses. Our evaluations reveal that current LLMs struggle to meet these criteria. To enhance LLMs' alignment with geo-diverse safety standards, we synthesize helpful preference pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) alignment training. The preference pair construction aims to encourage LLMs to behave appropriately and provide precise references to relevant cultural norms and policies when necessary. Our trained SafeWorldLM outperforms all competing models, including GPT-4o on all three evaluation dimensions by a large margin. Global human evaluators also note a nearly 20% higher winning rate in helpfulness and harmfulness evaluation. Our code and data can be found here: https://github.com/PlusLabNLP/SafeWorld.

### On the Universal Truthfulness Hyperplane Inside LLMs
**Authors**: Junteng Liu, Shiqi Chen, Yu Cheng, Junxian He

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T13:26:37Z

**Summary**: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities across various fields, hallucination remains a significant challenge. Recent studies have explored hallucinations through the lens of internal representations, proposing mechanisms to decipher LLMs' adherence to facts. However, these approaches often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data, leading to concerns about whether internal representation patterns reflect fundamental factual awareness, or only overfit spurious correlations on the specific datasets. In this work, we investigate whether a universal truthfulness hyperplane that distinguishes the model's factually correct and incorrect outputs exists within the model. To this end, we scale up the number of training datasets and conduct an extensive evaluation -- we train the truthfulness hyperplane on a diverse collection of over 40 datasets and examine its cross-task, cross-domain, and in-domain generalization. Our results indicate that increasing the diversity of the training datasets significantly enhances the performance in all scenarios, while the volume of data samples plays a less critical role. This finding supports the optimistic hypothesis that a universal truthfulness hyperplane may indeed exist within the model, offering promising directions for future research.

### Exploiting the diversity of modeling methods to probe systematic biases   in strong lensing analyses
**Authors**: A. Galan, G. Vernardos, Q. Minor, D. Sluse, L. Van de Vyvere, M. Gomer

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T13:23:18Z

**Summary**: Challenges inherent to high-resolution and high signal-to-noise data as well as model degeneracies can cause systematic biases in analyses of strong lens systems. In the past decade, the number of lens modeling methods has significantly increased, from purely analytical methods, to pixelated and non-parametric ones, or ones based on deep learning. We embraced this diversity by selecting different software packages and use them to blindly model independently simulated Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data. To overcome the difficulties arising from using different codes and conventions, we used the COde-independent Organized LEns STandard (COOLEST) to store, compare, and release all models in a self-consistent and human-readable manner. From an ensemble of six modeling methods, we studied the recovery of the lens potential parameters and properties of the reconstructed source. We find that, overall, both lens and source properties are recovered reasonably well, but systematic biases arise in all methods. Interestingly, we do not observe that a single method is significantly more accurate than others, and the amount of bias largely depends on the specific lens or source property of interest. By combining posterior distributions from individual methods using equal weights, the maximal systematic biases on lens model parameters inferred from individual models are reduced by a factor of 5.4 on average. We investigated a selection of modeling effects that partly explain the observed biases, such as the cuspy nature of the background source and the accuracy of the point spread function. This work introduces, for the first time, a generic framework to compare and ease the combination of models obtained from different codes and methods, which will be key to retain accuracy in future strong lensing analyses.

### From Uncertainty to Trust: Enhancing Reliability in Vision-Language   Models with Uncertainty-Guided Dropout Decoding
**Authors**: Yixiong Fang, Ziran Yang, Zhaorun Chen, Zhuokai Zhao, Jiawei Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T13:21:07Z

**Summary**: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in multimodal tasks but are prone to misinterpreting visual inputs, often resulting in hallucinations and unreliable outputs. To address these challenges, we propose Dropout Decoding, a novel inference-time approach that quantifies the uncertainty of visual tokens and selectively masks uncertain tokens to improve decoding. Our method measures the uncertainty of each visual token by projecting it onto the text space and decomposing it into aleatoric and epistemic components. Specifically, we focus on epistemic uncertainty, which captures perception-related errors more effectively. Inspired by dropout regularization, we introduce uncertainty-guided token dropout, which applies the dropout principle to input visual tokens instead of model parameters, and during inference rather than training. By aggregating predictions from an ensemble of masked decoding contexts, Dropout Decoding robustly mitigates errors arising from visual token misinterpretations. Evaluations on benchmarks including CHAIR, THRONE, and MMBench demonstrate that Dropout Decoding significantly reduces object hallucinations (OH) and enhances both reliability and quality of LVLM outputs across diverse visual contexts.

### Pruning All-Rounder: Rethinking and Improving Inference Efficiency for   Large Vision Language Models
**Authors**: Wei Suo, Ji Ma, Mengyang Sun, Lin Yuanbo Wu, Peng Wang, Yanning Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T13:02:35Z

**Summary**: Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive results, their high computational cost poses a significant barrier to wider application. To enhance inference efficiency, most existing approaches depend on parameter-dependent or token-dependent strategies to reduce computational demands. However, these methods typically require complex training processes and struggle to consistently select the most relevant tokens. In this paper, we systematically analyze the above challenges and provide a series of valuable insights for inference acceleration. Based on these findings, we propose a novel framework, the Pruning All-Rounder (PAR). Different from previous works, PAR develops a meta-router to adaptively organize pruning flows across both tokens and layers. With a self-supervised learning manner, our method achieves a superior balance between performance and efficiency. Notably, PAR is highly flexible, offering multiple pruning versions to address a range of pruning scenarios. The code for this work will be made publicly available.

### Learning Deep Dynamical Systems using Stable Neural ODEs
**Authors**: Andreas Sochopoulos, Michael Gienger, Sethu Vijayakumar

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T12:31:07Z

**Summary**: Learning complex trajectories from demonstrations in robotic tasks has been effectively addressed through the utilization of Dynamical Systems (DS). State-of-the-art DS learning methods ensure stability of the generated trajectories; however, they have three shortcomings: a) the DS is assumed to have a single attractor, which limits the diversity of tasks it can achieve, b) state derivative information is assumed to be available in the learning process and c) the state of the DS is assumed to be measurable at inference time. We propose a class of provably stable latent DS with possibly multiple attractors, that inherit the training methods of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, thus, dropping the dependency on state derivative information. A diffeomorphic mapping for the output and a loss that captures time-invariant trajectory similarity are proposed. We validate the efficacy of our approach through experiments conducted on a public dataset of handwritten shapes and within a simulated object manipulation task.

### Can foundation models actively gather information in interactive   environments to test hypotheses?
**Authors**: Nan Rosemary Ke, Danny P. Sawyer, Hubert Soyer, Martin Engelcke, David P Reichert, Drew A. Hudson, John Reid, Alexander Lerchner, Danilo Jimenez Rezende, Timothy P Lillicrap, Michael Mozer, Jane X Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T12:27:21Z

**Summary**: While problem solving is a standard evaluation task for foundation models, a crucial component of problem solving -- actively and strategically gathering information to test hypotheses -- has not been closely investigated. To assess the information gathering abilities of foundation models in interactive environments, we introduce a framework in which a model must determine the factors influencing a hidden reward function by iteratively reasoning about its previously gathered information and proposing its next exploratory action to maximize information gain at each step. We implement this framework in both a text-based environment, which offers a tightly controlled setting and enables high-throughput parameter sweeps, and in an embodied 3D environment, which requires addressing complexities of multi-modal interaction more relevant to real-world applications. We further investigate whether approaches such as self-correction and increased inference time improve information gathering efficiency. In a relatively simple task that requires identifying a single rewarding feature, we find that LLM's information gathering capability is close to optimal. However, when the model must identify a conjunction of rewarding features, performance is suboptimal. The hit in performance is due partly to the model translating task description to a policy and partly to the model's effectiveness in using its in-context memory. Performance is comparable in both text and 3D embodied environments, although imperfect visual object recognition reduces its accuracy in drawing conclusions from gathered information in the 3D embodied case. For single-feature-based rewards, we find that smaller models curiously perform better; for conjunction-based rewards, incorporating self correction into the model improves performance.

### Simulating Human-like Daily Activities with Desire-driven Autonomy
**Authors**: Yiding Wang, Yuxuan Chen, Fangwei Zhong, Long Ma, Yizhou Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T12:21:20Z

**Summary**: Existing task-oriented AI agents often depend on explicit instructions or external rewards, limiting their ability to be driven by intrinsic motivations like humans. In this paper, we present a desire-driven autonomy framework to guide a Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) agent to simulate human-like daily activities. In contrast to previous agents, our Desire-driven Autonomous Agent (D2A) operates on the principle of intrinsic desire, allowing it to propose and select tasks that fulfill its motivational framework autonomously. Inspired by the Theory of Needs, the motivational framework incorporates an understanding of human-like desires, such as the need for social interaction, personal fulfillment, and self-care. Utilizing a desire-driven task generation mechanism, the agent evaluates its current state and takes a sequence of activities aligned with its intrinsic motivations. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our Desire-driven Autonomous Agent (D2A) generates coherent, contextually relevant daily activities while exhibiting variability and adaptability similar to human behavior. A comparative analysis with other LLM-based frameworks demonstrates that our approach significantly enhances the rationality of the simulated activities.

### Integrating Expert Labels into LLM-based Emission Goal Detection:   Example Selection vs Automatic Prompt Design
**Authors**: Marco Wrzalik, Adrian Ulges, Anne Uersfeld, Florian Faust

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T12:20:33Z

**Summary**: We address the detection of emission reduction goals in corporate reports, an important task for monitoring companies' progress in addressing climate change. Specifically, we focus on the issue of integrating expert feedback in the form of labeled example passages into LLM-based pipelines, and compare the two strategies of (1) a dynamic selection of few-shot examples and (2) the automatic optimization of the prompt by the LLM itself. Our findings on a public dataset of 769 climate-related passages from real-world business reports indicate that automatic prompt optimization is the superior approach, while combining both methods provides only limited benefit. Qualitative results indicate that optimized prompts do indeed capture many intricacies of the targeted emission goal extraction task.

### PROSPECT: A profile likelihood code for frequentist cosmological   parameter inference
**Authors**: Emil Brinch Holm, Andreas Nygaard, Jeppe Dakin, Steen Hannestad, Thomas Tram

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T12:11:12Z

**Summary**: Cosmological parameter inference has been dominated by the Bayesian approach for the past two decades, primarily due to its computational efficiency. However, the Bayesian approach involves integration of the posterior probability and therefore depends on both the choice of model parametrisation and the choice of prior on the model parameter space. In some cases, this can lead to conclusions which are driven by choice of parametrisation and priors rather than by data. The profile likelihood method provides a complementary frequentist tool which can be used to investigate this effect.   In this paper, we present the code PROSPECT for computing profile likelihoods in cosmology. We showcase the code using a phenomenological model for converting dark matter into dark radiation that suffers from large volume effects and prior dependence. PROSPECT is compatible with both cobaya and MontePython, and is publicly available at https://github.com/AarhusCosmology/prospect_public.

### LLM-BIP: Structured Pruning for Large Language Models with Block-Wise   Forward Importance Propagation
**Authors**: Haihang Wu

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T11:57:16Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various language tasks, but their widespread deployment is impeded by their large size and high computational costs. Structural pruning is a prevailing technique used to introduce sparsity into pre-trained models and facilitate direct hardware acceleration during inference by removing redundant connections (structurally-grouped parameters), such as channels and attention heads. Existing structural pruning approaches often employ either global or layer-wise pruning criteria; however, they are hindered by ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate evaluation of connection importance. Global pruning methods typically assess component importance using near-zero and unreliable gradients, while layer-wise pruning approaches encounter significant pruning error accumulation issues. To this end, we propose a more accurate pruning metric based on the block-wise importance score propagation, termed LLM-BIP. Specifically, LLM-BIP precisely evaluates connection importance by gauging its influence on the respective transformer block output, which can be efficiently approximated in a single forward pass through an upper bound derived from the assumption of Lipschitz continuity. We evaluate the proposed method using LLaMA-7B, Vicuna-7B, and LLaMA-13B across common zero-shot tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves an average of 3.26% increase in accuracy for common reasoning tasks compared to previous best baselines. It also reduces perplexity by 14.09 and 68.76 on average for the WikiText2 dataset and PTB dataset, respectively.

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T11:40:06Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have introduced convenient and user-friendly methods for leveraging tools across various domains. In the field of astronomical observation, the construction of new telescopes has significantly increased astronomers' workload. Deploying LLM-powered agents can effectively alleviate this burden and reduce the costs associated with training personnel. Within the Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey (NGSS) project, which encompasses eight telescopes across three observation sites, aiming to find the transients from the galaxies in 50 mpc, we have developed the \textbf{StarWhisper Telescope System} to manage the entire observation process. This system automates tasks such as generating observation lists, conducting observations, analyzing data, and providing feedback to the observer. Observation lists are customized for different sites and strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage of celestial objects. After manual verification, these lists are uploaded to the telescopes via the agents in the system, which initiates observations upon neutral language. The observed images are analyzed in real-time, and the transients are promptly communicated to the observer. The agent modifies them into a real-time follow-up observation proposal and send to the Xinglong observatory group chat, then add them to the next-day observation lists. Additionally, the integration of AI agents within the system provides online accessibility, saving astronomers' time and encouraging greater participation from amateur astronomers in the NGSS project.

### Lying Blindly: Bypassing ChatGPT's Safeguards to Generate Hard-to-Detect   Disinformation Claims
**Authors**: Freddy Heppell, Mehmet E. Bakir, Kalina Bontcheva

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T11:34:28Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models become more proficient, their misuse in coordinated disinformation campaigns is a growing concern. This study explores the capability of ChatGPT with GPT-3.5 to generate short-form disinformation claims about the war in Ukraine, both in general and on a specific event, which is beyond the GPT-3.5 knowledge cutoff. Unlike prior work, we do not provide the model with human-written disinformation narratives by including them in the prompt. Thus the generated short claims are hallucinations based on prior world knowledge and inference from the minimal prompt. With a straightforward prompting technique, we are able to bypass model safeguards and generate numerous short claims. We compare those against human-authored false claims on the war in Ukraine from ClaimReview, specifically with respect to differences in their linguistic properties. We also evaluate whether AI authorship can be differentiated by human readers or state-of-the-art authorship detection tools. Thus, we demonstrate that ChatGPT can produce realistic, target-specific disinformation claims, even on a specific post-cutoff event, and that they cannot be reliably distinguished by humans or existing automated tools.

### GameArena: Evaluating LLM Reasoning through Live Computer Games
**Authors**: Lanxiang Hu, Qiyu Li, Anze Xie, Nan Jiang, Ion Stoica, Haojian Jin, Hao Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T11:22:59Z

**Summary**: Evaluating the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) is challenging. Existing benchmarks often depend on static datasets, which are vulnerable to data contamination and may get saturated over time, or on binary live human feedback that conflates reasoning with other abilities. As the most prominent dynamic benchmark, Chatbot Arena evaluates open-ended questions in real-world settings, but lacks the granularity in assessing specific reasoning capabilities. We introduce GameArena, a dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities through interactive gameplay with humans. GameArena consists of three games designed to test specific reasoning capabilities (e.g., deductive and inductive reasoning), while keeping participants entertained and engaged. We analyze the gaming data retrospectively to uncover the underlying reasoning processes of LLMs and measure their fine-grained reasoning capabilities. We collect over 2000 game sessions and provide detailed assessments of various reasoning capabilities for five state-of-the-art LLMs. Our user study with 100 participants suggests that GameArena improves user engagement compared to Chatbot Arena. For the first time, GameArena enables the collection of step-by-step LLM reasoning data in the wild.

### Questioning the Survey Responses of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ricardo Dominguez-Olmedo, Moritz Hardt, Celestine Mendler-Dünner

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T10:47:06Z

**Summary**: Surveys have recently gained popularity as a tool to study large language models. By comparing survey responses of models to those of human reference populations, researchers aim to infer the demographics, political opinions, or values best represented by current language models. In this work, we critically examine this methodology on the basis of the well-established American Community Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau. Evaluating 43 different language models using de-facto standard prompting methodologies, we establish two dominant patterns. First, models' responses are governed by ordering and labeling biases, for example, towards survey responses labeled with the letter "A". Second, when adjusting for these systematic biases through randomized answer ordering, models across the board trend towards uniformly random survey responses, irrespective of model size or pre-training data. As a result, in contrast to conjectures from prior work, survey-derived alignment measures often permit a simple explanation: models consistently appear to better represent subgroups whose aggregate statistics are closest to uniform for any survey under consideration.

### Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal   Control
**Authors**: Mohammad Mahmoudi Filabadi, Tom Lefebvre, Guillaume Crevecoeur

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T10:46:23Z

**Summary**: In this article, we discuss two algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called deterministic trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms can be derived from an emerging theoretical paradigm that we refer to as probabilistic optimal control. The paradigm reformulates stochastic optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem and can be viewed as a generalisation of the former. The merit of this perspective is that it allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. It is shown that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of the algorithms is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.

### Exploring Memorization and Copyright Violation in Frontier LLMs: A Study   of the New York Times v. OpenAI 2023 Lawsuit
**Authors**: Joshua Freeman, Chloe Rippe, Edoardo Debenedetti, Maksym Andriushchenko

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T10:44:47Z

**Summary**: Copyright infringement in frontier LLMs has received much attention recently due to the New York Times v. OpenAI lawsuit, filed in December 2023. The New York Times claims that GPT-4 has infringed its copyrights by reproducing articles for use in LLM training and by memorizing the inputs, thereby publicly displaying them in LLM outputs. Our work aims to measure the propensity of OpenAI's LLMs to exhibit verbatim memorization in its outputs relative to other LLMs, specifically focusing on news articles. We discover that both GPT and Claude models use refusal training and output filters to prevent verbatim output of the memorized articles. We apply a basic prompt template to bypass the refusal training and show that OpenAI models are currently less prone to memorization elicitation than models from Meta, Mistral, and Anthropic. We find that as models increase in size, especially beyond 100 billion parameters, they demonstrate significantly greater capacity for memorization. Our findings have practical implications for training: more attention must be placed on preventing verbatim memorization in very large models. Our findings also have legal significance: in assessing the relative memorization capacity of OpenAI's LLMs, we probe the strength of The New York Times's copyright infringement claims and OpenAI's legal defenses, while underscoring issues at the intersection of generative AI, law, and policy.

**Summary**: With the increasing application of large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain, evaluating these models' performance using benchmark datasets has become crucial. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of various benchmark datasets employed in medical LLM tasks. These datasets span multiple modalities including text, image, and multimodal benchmarks, focusing on different aspects of medical knowledge such as electronic health records (EHRs), doctor-patient dialogues, medical question-answering, and medical image captioning. The survey categorizes the datasets by modality, discussing their significance, data structure, and impact on the development of LLMs for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, report generation, and predictive decision support. Key benchmarks include MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, BioASQ, PubMedQA, and CheXpert, which have facilitated advancements in tasks like medical report generation, clinical summarization, and synthetic data generation. The paper summarizes the challenges and opportunities in leveraging these benchmarks for advancing multimodal medical intelligence, emphasizing the need for datasets with a greater degree of language diversity, structured omics data, and innovative approaches to synthesis. This work also provides a foundation for future research in the application of LLMs in medicine, contributing to the evolving field of medical artificial intelligence.

### Eliminating Biased Length Reliance of Direct Preference Optimization via   Down-Sampled KL Divergence
**Authors**: Junru Lu, Jiazheng Li, Siyu An, Meng Zhao, Yulan He, Di Yin, Xing Sun

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T09:57:05Z

**Summary**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a prominent algorithm for the direct and robust alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, offering a more straightforward alternative to the complex Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Despite its promising efficacy, DPO faces a notable drawback: "verbosity", a common over-optimization phenomenon also observed in RLHF. While previous studies mainly attributed verbosity to biased labels within the data, we propose that the issue also stems from an inherent algorithmic length reliance in DPO. Specifically, we suggest that the discrepancy between sequence-level Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences between chosen and rejected sequences, used in DPO, results in overestimated or underestimated rewards due to varying token lengths. Empirically, we utilize datasets with different label lengths to demonstrate the presence of biased rewards. We then introduce an effective downsampling approach, named SamPO, to eliminate potential length reliance. Our experimental evaluations, conducted across three LLMs of varying scales and a diverse array of conditional and open-ended benchmarks, highlight the efficacy of SamPO in mitigating verbosity, achieving improvements of 5% to 12% over DPO through debaised rewards.

### Assessing the potential of LLM-assisted annotation for corpus-based   pragmatics and discourse analysis: The case of apology
**Authors**: Danni Yu, Luyang Li, Hang Su, Matteo Fuoli

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T09:56:59Z

**Summary**: Certain forms of linguistic annotation, like part of speech and semantic tagging, can be automated with high accuracy. However, manual annotation is still necessary for complex pragmatic and discursive features that lack a direct mapping to lexical forms. This manual process is time-consuming and error-prone, limiting the scalability of function-to-form approaches in corpus linguistics. To address this, our study explores the possibility of using large language models (LLMs) to automate pragma-discursive corpus annotation. We compare GPT-3.5 (the model behind the free-to-use version of ChatGPT), GPT-4 (the model underpinning the precise mode of Bing chatbot), and a human coder in annotating apology components in English based on the local grammar framework. We find that GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5, with accuracy approaching that of a human coder. These results suggest that LLMs can be successfully deployed to aid pragma-discursive corpus annotation, making the process more efficient, scalable and accessible.

### FIPO: Free-form Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization with Preference   Dataset and Modular Fine-tuning Schema
**Authors**: Junru Lu, Siyu An, Min Zhang, Yulan He, Di Yin, Xing Sun

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T09:53:07Z

**Summary**: When the quality of naive prompts is carefully optimized by human experts, the task performance of large language models (LLMs) can be significantly improved. However, expert-based prompt optimizations are expensive. Herein, some works have proposed Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), to optimize naive prompts according to task outputs of given in-box testing models, with the help of advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in an ad-hoc way. Although effective, existing schemes suffer from poor generalization ability and privacy risk. To this end, we collect the first large-scale Prompt Optimization Preference dataset (POP), fine-tune offline local LLM-based optimizers, then fairly test with various downstream models. Our method allows accurate optimization of the core task instruction part within the naive prompt in a model-agnostic manner, and thus is named Free-from Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO). In specific, FIPO uses a modular APO template that dynamically integrate the naive task instruction, optional instruction responses, and optional ground truth to produce finely optimized prompts. The POP dataset is meticulously constructed using advanced LLMs, undergoing rigorous cross-validation by human experts and analytical models. Leveraging insights from the data with Tulu2 models and diverse fine-tuning strategies, we validate the efficacy of FIPO framework across five public benchmarks and six testing models. Check codes and data here: https://github.com/LuJunru/FIPO_Project.

### Tracking control of latent dynamic systems with application to   spacecraft attitude control
**Authors**: Congxi Zhang, Yongchun Xie

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T09:49:15Z

**Summary**: When intelligent spacecraft or space robots perform tasks in a complex environment, the controllable variables are usually not directly available and have to be inferred from high-dimensional observable variables, such as outputs of neural networks or images. While the dynamics of these observations are highly complex, the mechanisms behind them may be simple, which makes it possible to regard them as latent dynamic systems. For control of latent dynamic systems, methods based on reinforcement learning suffer from sample inefficiency and generalization problems. In this work, we propose an asymptotic tracking controller for latent dynamic systems. The latent variables are related to the high-dimensional observations through an unknown nonlinear function. The dynamics are unknown but assumed to be affine nonlinear. To realize asymptotic tracking, an identifiable latent dynamic model is learned to recover the latents and estimate the dynamics. This training process does not depend on the goals or reference trajectories. Based on the learned model, we use a manually designed feedback linearization controller to ensure the asymptotic tracking property of the closed-loop system. After considering fully controllable systems, the results are extended to the case that uncontrollable environmental latents exist. As an application, simulation experiments on a latent spacecraft attitude dynamic model are conducted to verify the proposed methods, and the observation noise and control deviation are taken into consideration.

### Split and Merge: Aligning Position Biases in LLM-based Evaluators
**Authors**: Zongjie Li, Chaozheng Wang, Pingchuan Ma, Daoyuan Wu, Shuai Wang, Cuiyun Gao, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T09:39:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise as automated evaluators for assessing the quality of answers generated by AI systems. However, these LLM-based evaluators exhibit position bias, or inconsistency, when used to evaluate candidate answers in pairwise comparisons, favoring either the first or second answer regardless of content. To address this limitation, we propose PORTIA, an alignment-based system designed to mimic human comparison strategies to calibrate position bias in a lightweight yet effective manner. Specifically, PORTIA splits the answers into multiple segments, aligns similar content across candidate answers, and then merges them back into a single prompt for evaluation by LLMs. We conducted extensive experiments with six diverse LLMs to evaluate 11,520 answer pairs. Our results show that PORTIA markedly enhances the consistency rates for all the models and comparison forms tested, achieving an average relative improvement of 47.46%. Remarkably, PORTIA enables less advanced GPT models to achieve 88% agreement with the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model at just 10% of the cost. Furthermore, it rectifies around 80% of the position bias instances within the GPT-4 model, elevating its consistency rate up to 98%. Subsequent human evaluations indicate that the PORTIA-enhanced GPT-3.5 model can even surpass the standalone GPT-4 in terms of alignment with human evaluators. These findings highlight PORTIA's ability to correct position bias, improve LLM consistency, and boost performance while keeping cost-efficiency. This represents a valuable step toward a more reliable and scalable use of LLMs for automated evaluations across diverse applications.

### Rethinking Data Selection at Scale: Random Selection is Almost All You   Need
**Authors**: Tingyu Xia, Bowen Yu, Kai Dang, An Yang, Yuan Wu, Yuan Tian, Yi Chang, Junyang Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T09:31:39Z

**Summary**: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human instructions. The primary goal during SFT is to select a small yet representative subset of training data from the larger pool, such that fine-tuning with this subset achieves results comparable to or even exceeding those obtained using the entire dataset. However, most existing data selection techniques are designed for small-scale data pools, which fail to meet the demands of real-world SFT scenarios. In this paper, we replicated several self-scoring methods those that do not rely on external model assistance on two million scale datasets, and found that nearly all methods struggled to significantly outperform random selection when dealing with such large-scale data pools. Moreover, our comparisons suggest that, during SFT, diversity in data selection is more critical than simply focusing on high quality data. We also analyzed the limitations of several current approaches, explaining why they perform poorly on large-scale datasets and why they are unsuitable for such contexts. Finally, we found that filtering data by token length offers a stable and efficient method for improving results. This approach, particularly when training on long text data, proves highly beneficial for relatively weaker base models, such as Llama3.

### Adaptive Rank, Reduced Forgetting: Knowledge Retention in Continual   Learning Vision-Language Models with Dynamic Rank-Selective LoRA
**Authors**: Haodong Lu, Chongyang Zhao, Jason Xue, Lina Yao, Kristen Moore, Dong Gong

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T09:25:36Z

**Summary**: We investigate whether the pre-trained knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, can be retained or even enhanced during continual learning (CL) while absorbing knowledge from a data stream. Existing methods often rely on additional reference data, isolated components for distribution or domain predictions, leading to high training costs, increased inference complexity, and limited improvement potential for pre-trained models. To address these challenges, we first comprehensively analyze the effects of parameter update locations and ranks on downstream adaptation and knowledge retention. Based on these insights, we propose Dynamic Rank-Selective Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a universal and efficient CL approach that adaptively assigns ranks to LoRA modules based on their relevance to the current data. Unlike prior methods, our approach continually enhances the pre-trained VLM by retaining both the pre-trained knowledge and the knowledge acquired during CL. Our approach eliminates the need for explicit domain or distribution prediction and additional reference data, enabling seamless integration of new tasks while preserving pre-trained capabilities. It also maintains the original architecture and deployment pipeline of the pre-trained model without incurring any additional inference overhead. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in continually absorbing knowledge of downstream tasks while retaining pre-trained knowledge.

**Authors**: Saransh Kumar Gupta, Lipika Dey, Partha Pratim Das, Geeta Trilok-Kumar, Ramesh Jain

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T09:21:49Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach to compute food composition data for Indian recipes using a knowledge graph for Indian food (FKG.in) and LLMs. The primary focus is to provide a broad overview of an automated food composition analysis workflow and describe its core functionalities: nutrition data aggregation, food composition analysis, and LLM-augmented information resolution. This workflow aims to complement FKG.in and iteratively supplement food composition data from verified knowledge bases. Additionally, this paper highlights the challenges of representing Indian food and accessing food composition data digitally. It also reviews three key sources of food composition data: the Indian Food Composition Tables, the Indian Nutrient Databank, and the Nutritionix API. Furthermore, it briefly outlines how users can interact with the workflow to obtain diet-based health recommendations and detailed food composition information for numerous recipes. We then explore the complex challenges of analyzing Indian recipe information across dimensions such as structure, multilingualism, and uncertainty as well as present our ongoing work on LLM-based solutions to address these issues. The methods proposed in this workshop paper for AI-driven knowledge curation and information resolution are application-agnostic, generalizable, and replicable for any domain.

### From Novice to Expert: LLM Agent Policy Optimization via Step-wise   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Zhirui Deng, Zhicheng Dou, Yutao Zhu, Ji-Rong Wen, Ruibin Xiong, Mang Wang, Weipeng Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T09:20:11Z

**Summary**: The outstanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) render them a crucial component in various autonomous agent systems. While traditional methods depend on the inherent knowledge of LLMs without fine-tuning, more recent approaches have shifted toward the reinforcement learning strategy to further enhance agents' ability to solve complex interactive tasks with environments and tools. However, previous approaches are constrained by the sparse reward issue, where existing datasets solely provide a final scalar reward for each multi-step reasoning chain, potentially leading to ineffectiveness and inefficiency in policy learning. In this paper, we introduce StepAgent, which utilizes step-wise reward to optimize the agent's reinforcement learning process. Inheriting the spirit of novice-to-expert theory, we first compare the actions of the expert and the agent to automatically generate intermediate rewards for fine-grained optimization. Additionally, we propose implicit-reward and inverse reinforcement learning techniques to facilitate agent reflection and policy adjustment. Further theoretical analysis demonstrates that the action distribution of the agent can converge toward the expert action distribution over multiple training cycles. Experimental results across various datasets indicate that StepAgent outperforms existing baseline methods.

### A Flexible Template for Edge Generative AI with High-Accuracy   Accelerated Softmax & GELU
**Authors**: Andrea Belano, Yvan Tortorella, Angelo Garofalo, Luca Benini, Davide Rossi, Francesco Conti

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T09:15:35Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models achieve remarkable results in a wide range of fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing. However, this comes at the cost of increased complexity and the need of sophisticated non-linearities such as softmax and GELU. Even if Transformers are computationally dominated by matrix multiplications (MatMul), these non-linearities can become a performance bottleneck, especially if dedicated hardware is used to accelerate MatMul operators. In this work, we introduce a GenAI BFloat16 Transformer acceleration template based on a heterogeneous tightly-coupled cluster containing 256KiB of shared SRAM, 8 general-purpose RISC-V cores, a 24x8 systolic array MatMul accelerator, and a novel accelerator for Transformer softmax and GELU non-linearities: SoftEx. SoftEx introduces an approximate exponentiation algorithm balancing efficiency (121x speedup over glibc's implementation) with accuracy (mean relative error of 0.14%). In 12nm technology, SoftEx occupies 0.039 mm$^2$, only 3.22% of the cluster, which achieves an operating frequency of 1.12 GHz. Compared to optimized software running on the RISC-V cores, SoftEx achieves significant improvements, accelerating softmax and GELU computations by up to 10.8x and 5.11x, respectively, while reducing their energy consumption by up to 10.8x and 5.29x. These enhancements translate into a 1.58x increase in throughput (310 GOPS at 0.8V) and a 1.42x improvement in energy efficiency (1.34 TOPS/W at 0.55V) on end-to-end ViT inference workloads.

### PRECISE: Pre-training Sequential Recommenders with Collaborative and   Semantic Information
**Authors**: Chonggang Song, Chunxu Shen, Hao Gu, Yaoming Wu, Lingling Yi, Jie Wen, Chuan Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T08:55:48Z

**Summary**: Real-world recommendation systems commonly offer diverse content scenarios for users to interact with. Considering the enormous number of users in industrial platforms, it is infeasible to utilize a single unified recommendation model to meet the requirements of all scenarios. Usually, separate recommendation pipelines are established for each distinct scenario. This practice leads to challenges in comprehensively grasping users' interests. Recent research endeavors have been made to tackle this problem by pre-training models to encapsulate the overall interests of users. Traditional pre-trained recommendation models mainly capture user interests by leveraging collaborative signals. Nevertheless, a prevalent drawback of these systems is their incapacity to handle long-tail items and cold-start scenarios. With the recent advent of large language models, there has been a significant increase in research efforts focused on exploiting LLMs to extract semantic information for users and items. However, text-based recommendations highly rely on elaborate feature engineering and frequently fail to capture collaborative similarities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pre-training framework for sequential recommendation, termed PRECISE. This framework combines collaborative signals with semantic information. Moreover, PRECISE employs a learning framework that initially models users' comprehensive interests across all recommendation scenarios and subsequently concentrates on the specific interests of target-scene behaviors. We demonstrate that PRECISE precisely captures the entire range of user interests and effectively transfers them to the target interests. Empirical findings reveal that the PRECISE framework attains outstanding performance on both public and industrial datasets.

### DSAI: Unbiased and Interpretable Latent Feature Extraction for   Data-Centric AI
**Authors**: Hyowon Cho, Soonwon Ka, Daechul Park, Jaewook Kang, Minjoon Seo, Bokyung Son

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T08:47:05Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to objectively identify latent characteristics in large datasets due to their reliance on pre-trained knowledge rather than actual data patterns. To address this data grounding issue, we propose Data Scientist AI (DSAI), a framework that enables unbiased and interpretable feature extraction through a multi-stage pipeline with quantifiable prominence metrics for evaluating extracted features. On synthetic datasets with known ground-truth features, DSAI demonstrates high recall in identifying expert-defined features while faithfully reflecting the underlying data. Applications on real-world datasets illustrate the framework's practical utility in uncovering meaningful patterns with minimal expert oversight, supporting use cases such as interpretable classification.   The title of our paper is chosen from multiple candidates based on DSAI-generated criteria.

### Beyond pip install: Evaluating LLM Agents for the Automated Installation   of Python Projects
**Authors**: Louis Milliken, Sungmin Kang, Shin Yoo

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T08:37:06Z

**Summary**: Many works have recently proposed the use of Large Language Model (LLM) based agents for performing `repository level' tasks, loosely defined as a set of tasks whose scopes are greater than a single file. This has led to speculation that the orchestration of these repository-level tasks could lead to software engineering agents capable of performing almost independently of human intervention. However, of the suite of tasks that would need to be performed by this autonomous software engineering agent, we argue that one important task is missing, which is to fulfil project level dependency by installing other repositories. To investigate the feasibility of this repository level installation task, we introduce a benchmark of of repository installation tasks curated from 40 open source Python projects, which includes a ground truth installation process for each target repository. Further, we propose Installamatic, an agent which aims to perform and verify the installation of a given repository by searching for relevant instructions from documentation in the repository. Empirical experiments reveal that that 55% of the studied repositories can be automatically installed by our agent at least one out of ten times. Through further analysis, we identify the common causes for our agent's inability to install a repository, discuss the challenges faced in the design and implementation of such an agent and consider the implications that such an agent could have for developers.

### ARChef: An iOS-Based Augmented Reality Cooking Assistant Powered by   Multimodal Gemini LLM
**Authors**: Rithik Vir, Parsa Madinei

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T08:27:07Z

**Summary**: Cooking meals can be difficult, causing many to resort to cookbooks and online recipes. However, relying on these traditional methods of cooking often results in missing ingredients, nutritional hazards, and unsatisfactory meals. Using Augmented Reality (AR) can address these issues; however, current AR cooking applications have poor user interfaces and limited accessibility. This paper proposes a prototype of an iOS application that integrates AR and Computer Vision (CV) into the cooking process. We leverage Google's Gemini Large Language Model (LLM) to identify ingredients in the camera's field of vision and generate recipe choices with detailed nutritional information. Additionally, this application uses Apple's ARKit to create an AR user interface compatible with iOS devices. Users can personalize their meal suggestions by inputting their dietary preferences and rating each meal. The application's effectiveness is evaluated through three rounds of user experience surveys. This application advances the field of accessible cooking assistance technologies, aiming to reduce food wastage and improve the meal planning experience.

### S$^{2}$FT: Efficient, Scalable and Generalizable LLM Fine-tuning by   Structured Sparsity
**Authors**: Xinyu Yang, Jixuan Leng, Geyang Guo, Jiawei Zhao, Ryumei Nakada, Linjun Zhang, Huaxiu Yao, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T08:24:11Z

**Summary**: Current PEFT methods for LLMs can achieve either high quality, efficient training, or scalable serving, but not all three simultaneously. To address this limitation, we investigate sparse fine-tuning and observe a remarkable improvement in generalization ability. Utilizing this key insight, we propose a family of Structured Sparse Fine-Tuning (S$^{2}$FT) methods for LLMs, which concurrently achieve state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance, training efficiency, and inference scalability. S$^{2}$FT accomplishes this by "selecting sparsely and computing densely". It selects a few heads and channels in the MHA and FFN modules for each Transformer block, respectively. Next, it co-permutes weight matrices on both sides of the coupled structures in LLMs to connect the selected components in each layer into a dense submatrix. Finally, S$^{2}$FT performs in-place gradient updates on all submatrices. Through theoretical analysis and empirical results, our method prevents overfitting and forgetting, delivers SOTA performance on both commonsense and arithmetic reasoning with 4.6% and 1.3% average improvements compared to LoRA, and surpasses full FT by 11.5% when generalizing to various domains after instruction tuning. Using our partial backpropagation algorithm, S$^{2}$FT saves training memory up to 3$\times$ and improves latency by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to full FT, while delivering an average 10% improvement over LoRA on both metrics. We further demonstrate that the weight updates in S$^{2}$FT can be decoupled into adapters, enabling effective fusion, fast switch, and efficient parallelism for serving multiple fine-tuned models.

### PediaBench: A Comprehensive Chinese Pediatric Dataset for Benchmarking   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Qian Zhang, Panfeng Chen, Jiali Li, Linkun Feng, Shuyu Liu, Mei Chen, Hui Li, Yanhao Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T08:19:28Z

**Summary**: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the medical domain has stressed a compelling need for standard datasets to evaluate their question-answering (QA) performance. Although there have been several benchmark datasets for medical QA, they either cover common knowledge across different departments or are specific to another department rather than pediatrics. Moreover, some of them are limited to objective questions and do not measure the generation capacity of LLMs. Therefore, they cannot comprehensively assess the QA ability of LLMs in pediatrics. To fill this gap, we construct PediaBench, the first Chinese pediatric dataset for LLM evaluation. Specifically, it contains 4,565 objective questions and 1,632 subjective questions spanning 12 pediatric disease groups. It adopts an integrated scoring criterion based on different difficulty levels to thoroughly assess the proficiency of an LLM in instruction following, knowledge understanding, clinical case analysis, etc. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of PediaBench with extensive experiments on 20 open-source and commercial LLMs. Through an in-depth analysis of experimental results, we offer insights into the ability of LLMs to answer pediatric questions in the Chinese context, highlighting their limitations for further improvements. Our code and data are published at https://github.com/ACMISLab/PediaBench.

### Monet: Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers
**Authors**: Jungwoo Park, Young Jin Ahn, Kee-Eung Kim, Jaewoo Kang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T07:49:01Z

**Summary**: Understanding the internal computations of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for aligning them with human values and preventing undesirable behaviors like toxic content generation. However, mechanistic interpretability is hindered by polysemanticity -- where individual neurons respond to multiple, unrelated concepts. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have attempted to disentangle these features through sparse dictionary learning, they have compromised LLM performance due to reliance on post-hoc reconstruction loss. To address this issue, we introduce Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers (Monet) architecture, which incorporates sparse dictionary learning directly into end-to-end Mixture-of-Experts pretraining. Our novel expert decomposition method enables scaling the expert count to 262,144 per layer while total parameters scale proportionally to the square root of the number of experts. Our analyses demonstrate mutual exclusivity of knowledge across experts and showcase the parametric knowledge encapsulated within individual experts. Moreover, Monet allows knowledge manipulation over domains, languages, and toxicity mitigation without degrading general performance. Our pursuit of transparent LLMs highlights the potential of scaling expert counts to enhance mechanistic interpretability and directly resect the internal knowledge to fundamentally adjust model behavior. The source code and pretrained checkpoints are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/Monet.

### Methods for Legal Citation Prediction in the Age of LLMs: An Australian   Law Case Study
**Authors**: Ehsan Shareghi, Jiuzhou Han, Paul Burgess

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T07:46:14Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential across a wide range of legal tasks. Despite these advances, mitigating hallucination remains a significant challenge, with state-of-the-art LLMs still frequently generating incorrect legal references. In this paper, we focus on the problem of legal citation prediction within the Australian law context, where correctly identifying and citing relevant legislations or precedents is critical. We compare several approaches: prompting general purpose and law-specialised LLMs, retrieval-only pipelines with both generic and domain-specific embeddings, task-specific instruction-tuning of LLMs, and hybrid strategies that combine LLMs with retrieval augmentation, query expansion, or voting ensembles. Our findings indicate that domain-specific pre-training alone is insufficient for achieving satisfactory citation accuracy even after law-specialised pre-training. In contrast, instruction tuning on our task-specific dataset dramatically boosts performance reaching the best results across all settings. We also highlight that database granularity along with the type of embeddings play a critical role in the performance of retrieval systems. Among retrieval-based approaches, hybrid methods consistently outperform retrieval-only setups, and among these, ensemble voting delivers the best result by combining the predictive quality of instruction-tuned LLMs with the retrieval system.

### iLLaVA: An Image is Worth Fewer Than 1/3 Input Tokens in Large   Multimodal Models
**Authors**: Lianyu Hu, Fanhua Shang, Liang Wan, Wei Feng

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T07:22:19Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce iLLaVA, a simple method that can be seamlessly deployed upon current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to greatly increase the throughput with nearly lossless model performance, without a further requirement to train. iLLaVA achieves this by finding and gradually merging the redundant tokens with an accurate and fast algorithm, which can merge hundreds of tokens within only one step. While some previous methods have explored directly pruning or merging tokens in the inference stage to accelerate models, our method excels in both performance and throughput by two key designs. First, while most previous methods only try to save the computations of Large Language Models (LLMs), our method accelerates the forward pass of both image encoders and LLMs in LVLMs, which both occupy a significant part of time during inference. Second, our method recycles the beneficial information from the pruned tokens into existing tokens, which avoids directly dropping context tokens like previous methods to cause performance loss. iLLaVA can nearly 2$\times$ the throughput, and reduce the memory costs by half with only a 0.2\% - 0.5\% performance drop across models of different scales including 7B, 13B and 34B. On tasks across different domains including single-image, multi-images and videos, iLLaVA demonstrates strong generalizability with consistently promising efficiency. We finally offer abundant visualizations to show the merging processes of iLLaVA in each step, which show insights into the distribution of computing resources in LVLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hulianyuyy/iLLaVA.

### A Lightweight U-like Network Utilizing Neural Memory Ordinary   Differential Equations for Slimming the Decoder
**Authors**: Quansong He, Xiaojun Yao, Jun Wu, Zhang Yi, Tao He

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T07:21:27Z

**Summary**: In recent years, advanced U-like networks have demonstrated remarkable performance in medical image segmentation tasks. However, their drawbacks, including excessive parameters, high computational complexity, and slow inference speed, pose challenges for practical implementation in scenarios with limited computational resources. Existing lightweight U-like networks have alleviated some of these problems, but they often have pre-designed structures and consist of inseparable modules, limiting their application scenarios. In this paper, we propose three plug-and-play decoders by employing different discretization methods of the neural memory Ordinary Differential Equations (nmODEs). These decoders integrate features at various levels of abstraction by processing information from skip connections and performing numerical operations on upward path. Through experiments on the PH2, ISIC2017, and ISIC2018 datasets, we embed these decoders into different U-like networks, demonstrating their effectiveness in significantly reducing the number of parameters and FLOPs while maintaining performance. In summary, the proposed discretized nmODEs decoders are capable of reducing the number of parameters by about 20% ~ 50% and FLOPs by up to 74%, while possessing the potential to adapt to all U-like networks.

### Rethinking Data Synthesis: A Teacher Model Training Recipe with   Interpretation
**Authors**: Yifang Chen, David Zhu, Simon Du, Kevin Jamieson, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T07:17:07Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) training have highlighted the need for diverse, high-quality instruction data. Recently, many works are exploring synthetic data generation using LLMs. However, they primarily focus on prompt engineering with standard supervised instruction-finetuned models, which contains a fundamental limitation: these models are optimized for general question-answering/problem-solving rather than data generation. We propose a paradigm shift named \textbf{NOMAD} by investigating how to specifically train models for data generation, demonstrating that this task differs significantly from training a classical LM. We identify two key factors: no-prompt-masked training and proper training set size selection. Our method, NOMAD, shows substantial improvements over baselines, achieving >4\% gains in TriviaQA and >2\% in GSM8K with limited training data. Finally, we offer new insights by interpreting synthetic data through the lenses of "relevance" and "novelty".

### A Comparative Study of Learning Paradigms in Large Language Models via   Intrinsic Dimension
**Authors**: Saahith Janapati, Yangfeng Ji

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T06:37:35Z

**Summary**: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on natural language tasks can be improved through both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and in-context learning (ICL), which operate via distinct mechanisms. Supervised fine-tuning updates the model's weights by minimizing loss on training data, whereas in-context learning leverages task demonstrations embedded in the prompt, without changing the model's parameters. This study investigates the effects of these learning paradigms on the hidden representations of LLMs using Intrinsic Dimension (ID). We use ID to estimate the number of degrees of freedom between representations extracted from LLMs as they perform specific natural language tasks. We first explore how the ID of LLM representations evolves during SFT and how it varies due to the number of demonstrations in ICL. We then compare the IDs induced by SFT and ICL and find that ICL consistently induces a higher ID compared to SFT, suggesting that representations generated during ICL reside in higher dimensional manifolds in the embedding space.

### Representational Transfer Learning for Matrix Completion
**Authors**: Yong He, Zeyu Li, Dong Liu, Kangxiang Qin, Jiahui Xie

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T06:14:47Z

**Summary**: We propose to transfer representational knowledge from multiple sources to a target noisy matrix completion task by aggregating singular subspaces information. Under our representational similarity framework, we first integrate linear representation information by solving a two-way principal component analysis problem based on a properly debiased matrix-valued dataset. After acquiring better column and row representation estimators from the sources, the original high-dimensional target matrix completion problem is then transformed into a low-dimensional linear regression, of which the statistical efficiency is guaranteed. A variety of extensional arguments, including post-transfer statistical inference and robustness against negative transfer, are also discussed alongside. Finally, extensive simulation results and a number of real data cases are reported to support our claims.

## Keyword: LLM Deployment 
 ### Training Large Language Models to Reason in a Continuous Latent Space
**Authors**: Shibo Hao, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, DiJia Su, Xian Li, Zhiting Hu, Jason Weston, Yuandong Tian

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:55:56Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are restricted to reason in the "language space", where they typically express the reasoning process with a chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve a complex reasoning problem. However, we argue that language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most word tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for reasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge challenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an unrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new paradigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed "continuous thought"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the LLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space. Experiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several reasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent advanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple alternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a single deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical reasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with fewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promise of latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.

### Why Do Developers Engage with ChatGPT in Issue-Tracker? Investigating   Usage and Reliance on ChatGPT-Generated Code
**Authors**: Joy Krishan Das, Saikat Mondal, Chanchal K. Roy

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:47:31Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown the potential to assist developers with coding and debugging tasks. However, their role in collaborative issue resolution is underexplored. In this study, we analyzed 1,152 Developer-ChatGPT conversations across 1,012 issues in GitHub to examine the diverse usage of ChatGPT and reliance on its generated code. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we manually analyzed 289 conversations to understand ChatGPT's usage in the GitHub Issues. Our analysis revealed that ChatGPT is primarily utilized for ideation, whereas its usage for validation (e.g., code documentation accuracy) is minimal. Second, we applied BERTopic modeling to identify key areas of engagement on the entire dataset. We found that backend issues (e.g., API management) dominate conversations, while testing is surprisingly less covered. Third, we utilized the CPD clone detection tool to check if the code generated by ChatGPT was used to address issues. Our findings revealed that ChatGPT-generated code was used as-is to resolve only 5.83\% of the issues. Fourth, we estimated sentiment using a RoBERTa-based sentiment analysis model to determine developers' satisfaction with different usages and engagement areas. We found positive sentiment (i.e., high satisfaction) about using ChatGPT for refactoring and addressing data analytics (e.g., categorizing table data) issues. On the contrary, we observed negative sentiment when using ChatGPT to debug issues and address automation tasks (e.g., GUI interactions). Our findings show the unmet needs and growing dissatisfaction among developers. Researchers and ChatGPT developers should focus on developing task-specific solutions that help resolve diverse issues, improving user satisfaction and problem-solving efficiency in software development.

### ZS4C: Zero-Shot Synthesis of Compilable Code for Incomplete Code   Snippets using LLMs
**Authors**: Azmain Kabir, Shaowei Wang, Yuan Tian, Tse-Hsun Chen, Muhammad Asaduzzaman, Wenbin Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:41:35Z

**Summary**: Technical Q&A sites are valuable for software developers seeking knowledge, but the code snippets they provide are often uncompilable and incomplete due to unresolved types and missing libraries. This poses a challenge for users who wish to reuse or analyze these snippets. Existing methods either do not focus on creating compilable code or have low success rates. To address this, we propose ZS4C, a lightweight approach for zero-shot synthesis of compilable code from incomplete snippets using Large Language Models (LLMs). ZS4C operates in two stages: first, it uses an LLM, like GPT-3.5, to identify missing import statements in a snippet; second, it collaborates with a validator (e.g., compiler) to fix compilation errors caused by incorrect imports and syntax issues. We evaluated ZS4C on the StatType-SO benchmark and a new dataset, Python-SO, which includes 539 Python snippets from Stack Overflow across the 20 most popular Python libraries. ZS4C significantly outperforms existing methods, improving the compilation rate from 63% to 95.1% compared to the state-of-the-art SnR, marking a 50.1% improvement. On average, ZS4C can infer more accurate import statements (with an F1 score of 0.98) than SnR, with an improvement of 8.5% in the F1.

### ONEBench to Test Them All: Sample-Level Benchmarking Over Open-Ended   Capabilities
**Authors**: Adhiraj Ghosh, Sebastian Dziadzio, Ameya Prabhu, Vishaal Udandarao, Samuel Albanie, Matthias Bethge

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:37:14Z

**Summary**: Traditional fixed test sets fall short in evaluating open-ended capabilities of foundation models. To address this, we propose ONEBench(OpeN-Ended Benchmarking), a new testing paradigm that consolidates individual evaluation datasets into a unified, ever-expanding sample pool. ONEBench allows users to generate custom, open-ended evaluation benchmarks from this pool, corresponding to specific capabilities of interest. By aggregating samples across test sets, ONEBench enables the assessment of diverse capabilities beyond those covered by the original test sets, while mitigating overfitting and dataset bias. Most importantly, it frames model evaluation as a collective process of selecting and aggregating sample-level tests.   The shift from task-specific benchmarks to ONEBench introduces two challenges: (1)heterogeneity and (2)incompleteness. Heterogeneity refers to the aggregation over diverse metrics, while incompleteness describes comparing models evaluated on different data subsets. To address these challenges, we explore algorithms to aggregate sparse measurements into reliable model scores. Our aggregation algorithm ensures identifiability(asymptotically recovering ground-truth scores) and rapid convergence, enabling accurate model ranking with less data. On homogenous datasets, we show our aggregation algorithm provides rankings that highly correlate with those produced by average scores. We also demonstrate robustness to ~95% of measurements missing, reducing evaluation cost by up to 20x with little-to-no change in model rankings. We introduce ONEBench-LLM for language models and ONEBench-LMM for vision-language models, unifying evaluations across these domains. Overall, we present a technique for open-ended evaluation, which can aggregate over incomplete, heterogeneous sample-level measurements to continually grow a benchmark alongside the rapidly developing foundation models.

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:31:01Z

**Summary**: We present a comprehensive report on compressing the Llama 3.1 8B and Mistral NeMo 12B models to 4B and 8B parameters, respectively, using pruning and distillation. We explore two distinct pruning strategies: (1) depth pruning and (2) joint hidden/attention/MLP (width) pruning, and evaluate the results on common benchmarks from the LM Evaluation Harness. The models are then aligned with NeMo Aligner and tested in instruct-tuned versions. This approach produces a compelling 4B model from Llama 3.1 8B and a state-of-the-art Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B (MN-Minitron-8B for brevity) model from Mistral NeMo 12B. We found that with no access to the original data, it is beneficial to slightly fine-tune teacher models on the distillation dataset. We open-source our base model weights on Hugging Face with a permissive license.

### JAPAGEN: Efficient Few/Zero-shot Learning via Japanese Training Dataset   Generation with LLM
**Authors**: Takuro Fujii, Satoru Katsumata

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:27:32Z

**Summary**: Recently some studies have highlighted the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as effective generators of supervised training data, offering advantages such as enhanced inference efficiency and reduced costs associated with data collection. However, these studies have predominantly focused on English language tasks. In this paper, we address the fundamental research question: Can LLMs serve as proficient training data generators for other language tasks? Specifically, we leverage LLMs to synthesize supervised training data under few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios across six diverse Japanese downstream tasks. Subsequently, we utilize this synthesized data to train compact models (e.g., BERT). This novel methodology is termed JAPAGEN. Our experimental findings underscore that JAPAGEN achieves robust performance in classification tasks that necessitate formal text inputs, demonstrating competitive results compared to conventional LLM prompting strategies.

### OW-VISCapTor: Abstractors for Open-World Video Instance Segmentation and   Captioning
**Authors**: Anwesa Choudhuri, Girish Chowdhary, Alexander G. Schwing

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:19:05Z

**Summary**: We propose the new task 'open-world video instance segmentation and captioning'. It requires to detect, segment, track and describe with rich captions never before seen objects. This challenging task can be addressed by developing "abstractors" which connect a vision model and a language foundation model. Concretely, we connect a multi-scale visual feature extractor and a large language model (LLM) by developing an object abstractor and an object-to-text abstractor. The object abstractor, consisting of a prompt encoder and transformer blocks, introduces spatially-diverse open-world object queries to discover never before seen objects in videos. An inter-query contrastive loss further encourages the diversity of object queries. The object-to-text abstractor is augmented with masked cross-attention and acts as a bridge between the object queries and a frozen LLM to generate rich and descriptive object-centric captions for each detected object. Our generalized approach surpasses the baseline that jointly addresses the tasks of open-world video instance segmentation and dense video object captioning by 13% on never before seen objects, and by 10% on object-centric captions.

### AutoDCWorkflow: LLM-based Data Cleaning Workflow Auto-Generation and   Benchmark
**Authors**: Lan Li, Liri Fang, Vetle I. Torvik

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:13:27Z

**Summary**: We investigate the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for automatically generating data-cleaning workflows. To evaluate LLMs' ability to complete data-cleaning tasks, we implemented a pipeline for LLM-based Auto Data Cleaning Workflow (AutoDCWorkflow), prompting LLMs on data cleaning operations to repair three types of data quality issues: duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent data formats. Given a dirty table and a purpose (expressed as a query), this pipeline generates a minimal, clean table sufficient to address the purpose and the data cleaning workflow used to produce the table. The planning process involves three main LLM-driven components: (1) Select Target Columns: Identifies a set of target columns related to the purpose. (2) Inspect Column Quality: Assesses the data quality for each target column and generates a Data Quality Report as operation objectives. (3) Generate Operation & Arguments: Predicts the next operation and arguments based on the data quality report results. Additionally, we propose a data cleaning benchmark to evaluate the capability of LLM agents to automatically generate workflows that address data cleaning purposes of varying difficulty levels. The benchmark comprises the annotated datasets as a collection of purpose, raw table, clean table, data cleaning workflow, and answer set. In our experiments, we evaluated three LLMs that auto-generate purpose-driven data cleaning workflows. The results indicate that LLMs perform well in planning and generating data-cleaning workflows without the need for fine-tuning.

### How to Merge Your Multimodal Models Over Time?
**Authors**: Sebastian Dziadzio, Vishaal Udandarao, Karsten Roth, Ameya Prabhu, Zeynep Akata, Samuel Albanie, Matthias Bethge

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T18:01:13Z

**Summary**: Model merging combines multiple expert models - finetuned from a base foundation model on diverse tasks and domains - into a single, more capable model. However, most existing model merging approaches assume that all experts are available simultaneously. In reality, new tasks and domains emerge progressively over time, requiring strategies to integrate the knowledge of expert models as they become available: a process we call temporal model merging. The temporal dimension introduces unique challenges not addressed in prior work, raising new questions such as: when training for a new task, should the expert model start from the merged past experts or from the original base model? Should we merge all models at each time step? Which merging techniques are best suited for temporal merging? Should different strategies be used to initialize the training and deploy the model? To answer these questions, we propose a unified framework called TIME - Temporal Integration of Model Expertise - which defines temporal model merging across three axes: (1) Initialization Phase, (2) Deployment Phase, and (3) Merging Technique. Using TIME, we study temporal model merging across model sizes, compute budgets, and learning horizons on the FoMo-in-Flux benchmark. Our comprehensive suite of experiments across TIME allows us to uncover key insights for temporal model merging, offering a better understanding of current challenges and best practices for effective temporal model merging.

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T17:31:54Z

**Summary**: As the capabilities of code large language models (LLMs) continue to expand, their applications across diverse code intelligence domains are rapidly increasing. However, most existing datasets only evaluate limited application domains. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive code evaluation dataset FullStack Bench focusing on full-stack programming, which encompasses a wide range of application domains (e.g., basic programming, data analysis, software engineering, mathematics, and machine learning). Besides, to assess multilingual programming capabilities, in FullStack Bench, we design real-world instructions and corresponding unit test cases from 16 widely-used programming languages to reflect real-world usage scenarios rather than simple translations. Moreover, we also release an effective code sandbox execution tool (i.e., SandboxFusion) supporting various programming languages and packages to evaluate the performance of our FullStack Bench efficiently. Comprehensive experimental results on our FullStack Bench demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our FullStack Bench and SandboxFusion.

### Exploring Critical Testing Scenarios for Decision-Making Policies: An   LLM Approach
**Authors**: Weichao Xu, Huaxin Pei, Jingxuan Yang, Yuchen Shi, Yi Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T17:27:04Z

**Summary**: Recent years have witnessed surprising achievements of decision-making policies across various fields, such as autonomous driving and robotics. Testing for decision-making policies is crucial with the existence of critical scenarios that may threaten their reliability. Numerous research efforts have been dedicated to testing these policies. However, there are still significant challenges, such as low testing efficiency and diversity due to the complexity of the policies and environments under test. Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs), in this paper, we propose an LLM-driven online testing framework for efficiently testing decision-making policies. The main idea is to employ an LLM-based test scenario generator to intelligently generate challenging test cases through contemplation and reasoning. Specifically, we first design a "generate-test-feedback" pipeline and apply templated prompt engineering to fully leverage the knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Then, we introduce a multi-scale scenario generation strategy to address the inherent challenges LLMs face in making fine adjustments, further enhancing testing efficiency. Finally, we evaluate the LLM-driven approach on five widely used benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in uncovering both critical and diverse scenarios.

### Toward LLM-Agent-Based Modeling of Transportation Systems: A Conceptual   Framework
**Authors**: Tianming Liu, Jirong Yang, Yafeng Yin

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T17:24:41Z

**Summary**: In transportation system demand modeling and simulation, agent-based models and microsimulations are current state-of-the-art approaches. However, existing agent-based models still have some limitations on behavioral realism and resource demand that limit their applicability. In this study, leveraging the emerging technology of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents, we propose a general LLM-agent-based modeling framework for transportation systems. We argue that LLM agents not only possess the essential capabilities to function as agents but also offer promising solutions to overcome some limitations of existing agent-based models. Our conceptual framework design closely replicates the decision-making and interaction processes and traits of human travelers within transportation networks, and we demonstrate that the proposed systems can meet critical behavioral criteria for decision-making and learning behaviors using related studies and a demonstrative example of LLM agents' learning and adjustment in the bottleneck setting. Although further refinement of the LLM-agent-based modeling framework is necessary, we believe that this approach has the potential to improve transportation system modeling and simulation.

### ILLUME: Illuminating Your LLMs to See, Draw, and Self-Enhance
**Authors**: Chunwei Wang, Guansong Lu, Junwei Yang, Runhui Huang, Jianhua Han, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Hang Xu

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T17:11:50Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce ILLUME, a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) that seamlessly integrates multimodal understanding and generation capabilities within a single large language model through a unified next-token prediction formulation. To address the large dataset size typically required for image-text alignment, we propose to enhance data efficiency through the design of a vision tokenizer that incorporates semantic information and a progressive multi-stage training procedure. This approach reduces the dataset size to just 15M for pretraining -- over four times fewer than what is typically needed -- while achieving competitive or even superior performance with existing unified MLLMs, such as Janus. Additionally, to promote synergistic enhancement between understanding and generation capabilities, which is under-explored in previous works, we introduce a novel self-enhancing multimodal alignment scheme. This scheme supervises the MLLM to self-assess the consistency between text descriptions and self-generated images, facilitating the model to interpret images more accurately and avoid unrealistic and incorrect predictions caused by misalignment in image generation. Based on extensive experiments, our proposed ILLUME stands out and competes with state-of-the-art unified MLLMs and specialized models across various benchmarks for multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

### Efficiency Meets Fidelity: A Novel Quantization Framework for Stable   Diffusion
**Authors**: Shuaiting Li, Juncan Deng, Zeyu Wang, Hong Gu, Kedong Xu, Haibin Shen, Kejie Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T17:00:20Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image generation of Stable Diffusion models has achieved notable success due to its remarkable generation ability. However, the repetitive denoising process is computationally intensive during inference, which renders Diffusion models less suitable for real-world applications that require low latency and scalability. Recent studies have employed post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) methods to compress Diffusion models. Nevertheless, prior research has often neglected to examine the consistency between results generated by quantized models and those from floating-point models. This consistency is crucial in fields such as content creation, design, and edge deployment, as it can significantly enhance both efficiency and system stability for practitioners. To ensure that quantized models generate high-quality and consistent images, we propose an efficient quantization framework for Stable Diffusion models. Our approach features a Serial-to-Parallel calibration pipeline that addresses the consistency of both the calibration and inference processes, as well as ensuring training stability. Based on this pipeline, we further introduce a mix-precision quantization strategy, multi-timestep activation quantization, and time information precalculation techniques to ensure high-fidelity generation in comparison to floating-point models. Through extensive experiments with Stable Diffusion v1-4, v2-1, and XL 1.0, we have demonstrated that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art techniques when tested on prompts from the COCO validation dataset and the Stable-Diffusion-Prompts dataset. Under W4A8 quantization settings, our approach enhances both distribution similarity and visual similarity by 45%-60%.

### GEAR: A Simple GENERATE, EMBED, AVERAGE AND RANK Approach for   Unsupervised Reverse Dictionary
**Authors**: Fatemah Almeman, Luis Espinosa-Anke

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:54:54Z

**Summary**: Reverse Dictionary (RD) is the task of obtaining the most relevant word or set of words given a textual description or dictionary definition. Effective RD methods have applications in accessibility, translation or writing support systems. Moreover, in NLP research we find RD to be used to benchmark text encoders at various granularities, as it often requires word, definition and sentence embeddings. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to RD that leverages LLMs in combination with embedding models. Despite its simplicity, this approach outperforms supervised baselines in well studied RD datasets, while also showing less over-fitting. We also conduct a number of experiments on different dictionaries and analyze how different styles, registers and target audiences impact the quality of RD systems. We conclude that, on average, untuned embeddings alone fare way below an LLM-only baseline (although they are competitive in highly technical dictionaries), but are crucial for boosting performance in combined methods.

### Chatbots im Schulunterricht: Wir testen das Fobizz-Tool zur   automatischen Bewertung von Hausaufgaben
**Authors**: Rainer Mühlhoff, Marte Henningsen

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:50:02Z

**Summary**: This study examines the AI-powered grading tool "AI Grading Assistant" by the German company Fobizz, designed to support teachers in evaluating and providing feedback on student assignments. Against the societal backdrop of an overburdened education system and rising expectations for artificial intelligence as a solution to these challenges, the investigation evaluates the tool's functional suitability through two test series. The results reveal significant shortcomings: The tool's numerical grades and qualitative feedback are often random and do not improve even when its suggestions are incorporated. The highest ratings are achievable only with texts generated by ChatGPT. False claims and nonsensical submissions frequently go undetected, while the implementation of some grading criteria is unreliable and opaque. Since these deficiencies stem from the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), fundamental improvements to this or similar tools are not immediately foreseeable. The study critiques the broader trend of adopting AI as a quick fix for systemic problems in education, concluding that Fobizz's marketing of the tool as an objective and time-saving solution is misleading and irresponsible. Finally, the study calls for systematic evaluation and subject-specific pedagogical scrutiny of the use of AI tools in educational contexts.

**Authors**: Er-Te Zheng, Hui-Zhen Fu, Mike Thelwall, Zhichao Fang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:42:25Z

**Summary**: Quickly detecting problematic research articles is crucial to safeguarding the integrity of scientific research. This study explores whether Twitter mentions of retracted articles can signal potential problems with the articles prior to their retraction, potentially serving as an early warning system for scholars. To investigate this, we analysed a dataset of 4,354 Twitter mentions associated with 504 retracted articles. The effectiveness of Twitter mentions in predicting article retractions was evaluated by both manual and Large Language Model (LLM) labelling. Manual labelling results indicated that 25.7% of tweets signalled problems before retraction. Using the manual labelling results as the baseline, we found that LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and Claude-3.5-Haiku) outperformed lexicon-based sentiment analysis tools (e.g., TextBlob) in detecting potential problems, suggesting that automatic detection of problematic articles from social media using LLMs is technically feasible. Nevertheless, since only a small proportion of retracted articles (11.1%) were criticised on Twitter prior to retraction, such automatic systems would detect only a minority of problematic articles. Overall, this study offers insights into how social media data, coupled with emerging generative AI techniques, can support research integrity.

### How Transformers Solve Propositional Logic Problems: A Mechanistic   Analysis
**Authors**: Guan Zhe Hong, Nishanth Dikkala, Enming Luo, Cyrus Rashtchian, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:36:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown amazing performance on tasks that require planning and reasoning. Motivated by this, we investigate the internal mechanisms that underpin a network's ability to perform complex logical reasoning. We first construct a synthetic propositional logic problem that serves as a concrete test-bed for network training and evaluation. Crucially, this problem demands nontrivial planning to solve. We perform our study on two fronts. First, we pursue an understanding of precisely how a three-layer transformer, trained from scratch and attains perfect test accuracy, solves this problem. We are able to identify certain "planning" and "reasoning" mechanisms in the network that necessitate cooperation between the attention blocks to implement the desired logic. Second, we study how pretrained LLMs, namely Mistral-7B and Gemma-2-9B, solve this problem. We characterize their reasoning circuits through causal intervention experiments, providing necessity and sufficiency evidence for the circuits. We find evidence suggesting that the two models' latent reasoning strategies are surprisingly similar, and human-like. Overall, our work systemically uncovers novel aspects of small and large transformers, and continues the study of how they plan and reason.

### The potential impact of large-scale wind clusters on the local weather   patterns
**Authors**: Rui Li, Jincheng Zhang, Xiaowei Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:33:06Z

**Summary**: To decarbonise the electricity sector and achieve renewable energy targets, a rapidly growing number of wind farms have been authorised, constructed, and commissioned in the UK and EU in recent years. For instance, the UK Government aims to expand offshore wind capacity to 60 GW by 2030, while the EU has set a target of 120 GW of offshore renewable energy by the same year. Given these substantial projected capacities, it is crucial to thoroughly investigate the potential impacts of large-scale wind clusters on local weather patterns to prevent unintended consequences prior to deployment. In this paper, we use the WRF model to simulate four scenarios with varying wind energy capacities in the North Sea, assessing the potential effects of these wind clusters on the local weather patterns over mainland UK. Please note that the simulations of Case 3 and Case 4 are still ongoing, while all analyses in the current version of manuscript are all based on Case 1 and Case 2.

### RARE: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Enhancement for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Hieu Tran, Zonghai Yao, Junda Wang, Yifan Zhang, Zhichao Yang, Hong Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:26:09Z

**Summary**: This work introduces RARE (Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Enhancement), a versatile extension to the mutual reasoning framework (rStar), aimed at enhancing reasoning accuracy and factual integrity across large language models (LLMs) for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks such as commonsense and medical reasoning. RARE incorporates two innovative actions within the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework: A6, which generates search queries based on the initial problem statement, performs information retrieval using those queries, and augments reasoning with the retrieved data to formulate the final answer; and A7, which leverages information retrieval specifically for generated sub-questions and re-answers these sub-questions with the relevant contextual information. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Scorer is proposed to replace the original discriminator, prioritizing reasoning paths that meet high standards of factuality. Experimental results with LLaMA 3.1 show that RARE enables open-source LLMs to achieve competitive performance with top open-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o. This research establishes RARE as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains where logical coherence and factual integrity are critical.

### M$^{2}$UGen: Multi-modal Music Understanding and Generation with the   Power of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shansong Liu, Atin Sakkeer Hussain, Qilong Wu, Chenshuo Sun, Ying Shan

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:15:07Z

**Summary**: The current landscape of research leveraging large language models (LLMs) is experiencing a surge. Many works harness the powerful reasoning capabilities of these models to comprehend various modalities, such as text, speech, images, videos, etc. They also utilize LLMs to understand human intention and generate desired outputs like images, videos, and music. However, research that combines both understanding and generation using LLMs is still limited and in its nascent stage. To address this gap, we introduce a Multi-modal Music Understanding and Generation (M$^{2}$UGen) framework that integrates LLM's abilities to comprehend and generate music for different modalities. The M$^{2}$UGen framework is purpose-built to unlock creative potential from diverse sources of inspiration, encompassing music, image, and video through the use of pretrained MERT, ViT, and ViViT models, respectively. To enable music generation, we explore the use of AudioLDM 2 and MusicGen. Bridging multi-modal understanding and music generation is accomplished through the integration of the LLaMA 2 model. Furthermore, we make use of the MU-LLaMA model to generate extensive datasets that support text/image/video-to-music generation, facilitating the training of our M$^{2}$UGen framework. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our proposed framework. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves or surpasses the performance of the current state-of-the-art models.

**Authors**: Yi-Lin Jiang, Chia-Ho Hsiung, Yen-Tung Yeh, Lu-Rong Chen, Bo-Yu Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:09:44Z

**Summary**: The rise of "bedroom producers" has democratized music creation, while challenging producers to objectively evaluate their work. To address this, we present AI TrackMate, an LLM-based music chatbot designed to provide constructive feedback on music productions. By combining LLMs' inherent musical knowledge with direct audio track analysis, AI TrackMate offers production-specific insights, distinguishing it from text-only approaches. Our framework integrates a Music Analysis Module, an LLM-Readable Music Report, and Music Production-Oriented Feedback Instruction, creating a plug-and-play, training-free system compatible with various LLMs and adaptable to future advancements. We demonstrate AI TrackMate's capabilities through an interactive web interface and present findings from a pilot study with a music producer. By bridging AI capabilities with the needs of independent producers, AI TrackMate offers on-demand analytical feedback, potentially supporting the creative process and skill development in music production. This system addresses the growing demand for objective self-assessment tools in the evolving landscape of independent music production.

### APOLLO: SGD-like Memory, AdamW-level Performance
**Authors**: Hanqing Zhu, Zhenyu Zhang, Wenyan Cong, Xi Liu, Sem Park, Vikas Chandra, Bo Long, David Z. Pan, Zhangyang Wang, Jinwon Lee

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T16:01:00Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are notoriously memory-intensive during training, particularly with the popular AdamW optimizer. This memory burden necessitates using more or higher-end GPUs or reducing batch sizes, limiting training scalability and throughput. To address this, various memory-efficient optimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, they face critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii) significant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) still substantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance.   In this work, we identify that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can be effectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on this insight, we propose Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLM Optimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using an auxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. This structured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further memory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Even its rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performance compared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs.   Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par with or better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearly eliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significant system-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GB setup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes. (2) Improved Model Scalability: Pre-training LLaMA-13B with naive DDP on A100-80GB GPUs without system-level optimizations. (3) Low-End GPU Friendly Pre-training: Pre-training LLaMA-7B on a single GPU using less than 12 GB of memory with weight quantization.

### Examining the Use and Impact of an AI Code Assistant on Developer   Productivity and Experience in the Enterprise
**Authors**: Justin D. Weisz, Shraddha Kumar, Michael Muller, Karen-Ellen Browne, Arielle Goldberg, Ellice Heintze, Shagun Bajpai

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T15:53:00Z

**Summary**: AI assistants are being created to help software engineers conduct a variety of coding-related tasks, such as writing, documenting, and testing code. We describe the use of the watsonx Code Assistant (WCA), an LLM-powered coding assistant deployed internally within IBM. Through surveys of two user cohorts (N=669) and unmoderated usability testing (N=15), we examined developers' experiences with WCA and its impact on their productivity. We learned about their motivations for using (or not using) WCA, we examined their expectations of its speed and quality, and we identified new considerations regarding ownership of and responsibility for generated code. Our case study characterizes the impact of an LLM-powered assistant on developers' perceptions of productivity and it shows that although such tools do often provide net productivity increases, these benefits may not always be experienced by all users.

### Anchoring Bias in Large Language Models: An Experimental Study
**Authors**: Jiaxu Lou

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T15:45:03Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Gemini have significantly advanced artificial intelligence by enabling machines to generate and comprehend human-like text. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs are not immune to limitations, including various biases. While much research has explored demographic biases, the cognitive biases in LLMs have not been equally scrutinized. This study delves into anchoring bias, a cognitive bias where initial information disproportionately influences judgment. Utilizing an experimental dataset, we examine how anchoring bias manifests in LLMs and verify the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of LLM responses to biased hints. At the same time, our experiments show that, to mitigate anchoring bias, one needs to collect hints from comprehensive angles to prevent the LLMs from being anchored to individual pieces of information, while simple algorithms such as Chain-of-Thought, Thoughts of Principles, Ignoring Anchor Hints, and Reflection are not sufficient.

### CIC: A Framework for Culturally-Aware Image Captioning
**Authors**: Youngsik Yun, Jihie Kim

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T15:39:30Z

**Summary**: Image Captioning generates descriptive sentences from images using Vision-Language Pre-trained models (VLPs) such as BLIP, which has improved greatly. However, current methods lack the generation of detailed descriptive captions for the cultural elements depicted in the images, such as the traditional clothing worn by people from Asian cultural groups. In this paper, we propose a new framework, Culturally-aware Image Captioning (CIC), that generates captions and describes cultural elements extracted from cultural visual elements in images representing cultures. Inspired by methods combining visual modality and Large Language Models (LLMs) through appropriate prompts, our framework (1) generates questions based on cultural categories from images, (2) extracts cultural visual elements from Visual Question Answering (VQA) using generated questions, and (3) generates culturally-aware captions using LLMs with the prompts. Our human evaluation conducted on 45 participants from 4 different cultural groups with a high understanding of the corresponding culture shows that our proposed framework generates more culturally descriptive captions when compared to the image captioning baseline based on VLPs.

### Data Quality Enhancement on the Basis of Diversity with Large Language   Models for Text Classification: Uncovered, Difficult, and Noisy
**Authors**: Min Zeng, Caiquan Liu, Shiqi Zhang, Li Xie, Chen Sang, Xiaoxin Chen, Xiaoxin Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T15:28:39Z

**Summary**: In recent years, the use of large language models (LLMs) for text classification has attracted widespread attention. Despite this, the classification accuracy of LLMs has not yet universally surpassed that of smaller models. LLMs can enhance their performance in text classification through fine-tuning. However, existing data quality research based on LLMs is challenging to apply directly to solve text classification problems. To further improve the performance of LLMs in classification tasks, this paper proposes a data quality enhancement (DQE) method for text classification based on LLMs. This method starts by using a greedy algorithm to select data, dividing the dataset into sampled and unsampled subsets, and then performing fine-tuning of the LLMs using the sampled data. Subsequently, this model is used to predict the outcomes for the unsampled data, categorizing incorrectly predicted data into uncovered, difficult, and noisy data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the performance of LLMs in text classification tasks and significantly improves training efficiency, saving nearly half of the training time. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance in several open-source classification tasks.

### Applications and Implications of Large Language Models in Qualitative   Analysis: A New Frontier for Empirical Software Engineering
**Authors**: Matheus de Morais Leça, Lucas Valença, Reydne Santos, Ronnie de Souza Santos

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T15:17:36Z

**Summary**: The use of large language models (LLMs) for qualitative analysis is gaining attention in various fields, including software engineering, where qualitative methods are essential for understanding human and social factors. This study aimed to investigate how LLMs are currently used in qualitative analysis and their potential applications in software engineering research, focusing on the benefits, limitations, and practices associated with their use. A systematic mapping study was conducted, analyzing 21 relevant studies to explore reported uses of LLMs for qualitative analysis. The findings indicate that LLMs are primarily used for tasks such as coding, thematic analysis, and data categorization, offering benefits like increased efficiency and support for new researchers. However, limitations such as output variability, challenges in capturing nuanced perspectives, and ethical concerns related to privacy and transparency were also identified. The study emphasizes the need for structured strategies and guidelines to optimize LLM use in qualitative research within software engineering, enhancing their effectiveness while addressing ethical considerations. While LLMs show promise in supporting qualitative analysis, human expertise remains crucial for interpreting data, and ongoing exploration of best practices will be vital for their successful integration into empirical software engineering research.

### Challenges and Opportunities for Visual Analytics in Jurisprudence
**Authors**: Daniel Fürst, Mennatallah El-Assady, Daniel A. Keim, Maximilian T. Fischer

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:54:44Z

**Summary**: Exploring, analyzing, and interpreting law can be tedious and challenging, even for legal scholars, since legal texts contain domain-specific language, require knowledge of tacit legal concepts, and are sometimes intentionally ambiguous. In related, text-based domains, Visual Analytics (VA) and large language models (LLMs) have become essential for working with documents as they support data navigation, knowledge representation, and analytical reasoning. However, legal scholars must simultaneously manage hierarchical information sources, leverage implicit domain knowledge, and document complex reasoning processes, which are neither adequately accessible through existing VA designs nor sufficiently supported by current LLMs. To address the needs of legal scholars, we identify previously unexamined challenges and opportunities when applying VA to jurisprudence. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine experts from the legal domain and found that they lacked the ability to articulate their tacit domain knowledge as explicit, machine-interpretable knowledge. Hence, we propose leveraging interactive visualization for this articulation, teaching the machine relevant semantic relationships between legal documents. These relationships inform the predictions of VA and LLMs, facilitating the navigation between the hierarchies of legal document collections. The enhanced navigation can uncover additional relevant legal documents, reinforcing the legal reasoning process by generating legal insights that reflect internalized, tacit domain knowledge. In summary, we provide a human-is-the-loop VA workflow for jurisprudence that recognizes tacit domain knowledge as essential for deriving legal insights. More broadly, we compare this workflow with related text-based research practices, revealing research gaps and guiding visualization researchers in knowledge-assisted VA for law and beyond.

### Sequential Printed MLP Circuits for Super TinyML Multi-Sensory   Applications
**Authors**: Gurol Saglam, Florentia Afentaki, Georgios Zervakis, Mehdi B. Tahoori

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:54:28Z

**Summary**: Super-TinyML aims to optimize machine learning models for deployment on ultra-low-power application domains such as wearable technologies and implants. Such domains also require conformality, flexibility, and non-toxicity which traditional silicon-based systems cannot fulfill. Printed Electronics (PE) offers not only these characteristics, but also cost-effective and on-demand fabrication. However, Neural Networks (NN) with hundreds of features -- often necessary for target applications -- have not been feasible in PE because of its restrictions such as limited device count due to its large feature sizes. In contrast to the state of the art using fully parallel architectures and limited to smaller classifiers, in this work we implement a super-TinyML architecture for bespoke (application-specific) NNs that surpasses the previous limits of state of the art and enables NNs with large number of parameters. With the introduction of super-TinyML into PE technology, we address the area and power limitations through resource sharing with multi-cycle operation and neuron approximation. This enables, for the first time, the implementation of NNs with up to $35.9\times$ more features and $65.4\times$ more coefficients than the state of the art solutions.

### Sloth: scaling laws for LLM skills to predict multi-benchmark   performance across families
**Authors**: Felipe Maia Polo, Seamus Somerstep, Leshem Choshen, Yuekai Sun, Mikhail Yurochkin

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:51:26Z

**Summary**: Scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) predict model performance based on parameters like size and training data. However, differences in training configurations and data processing across model families lead to significant variations in benchmark performance, making it difficult for a single scaling law to generalize across all LLMs. On the other hand, training family-specific scaling laws requires training models of varying sizes for every family. In this work, we propose Skills Scaling Laws (SSLaws, pronounced as Sloth), a novel scaling law that leverages publicly available benchmark data and assumes LLM performance is driven by low-dimensional latent skills, such as reasoning and instruction following. These latent skills are influenced by computational resources like model size and training tokens but with varying efficiencies across model families. Sloth exploits correlations across benchmarks to provide more accurate and interpretable predictions while alleviating the need to train multiple LLMs per family. We present both theoretical results on parameter identification and empirical evaluations on 12 prominent benchmarks, from Open LLM Leaderboard v1/v2, demonstrating that Sloth predicts LLM performance efficiently and offers insights into scaling behaviors for downstream tasks such as coding and emotional intelligence applications.

**Authors**: Roberto Gallotta, Graham Todd, Marvin Zammit, Sam Earle, Antonios Liapis, Julian Togelius, Georgios N. Yannakakis

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:41:04Z

**Summary**: Recent years have seen an explosive increase in research on large language models (LLMs), and accompanying public engagement on the topic. While starting as a niche area within natural language processing, LLMs have shown remarkable potential across a broad range of applications and domains, including games. This paper surveys the current state of the art across the various applications of LLMs in and for games, and identifies the different roles LLMs can take within a game. Importantly, we discuss underexplored areas and promising directions for future uses of LLMs in games and we reconcile the potential and limitations of LLMs within the games domain. As the first comprehensive survey and roadmap at the intersection of LLMs and games, we are hopeful that this paper will serve as the basis for groundbreaking research and innovation in this exciting new field.

### Words2Contact: Identifying Support Contacts from Verbal Instructions   Using Foundation Models
**Authors**: Dionis Totsila, Quentin Rouxel, Jean-Baptiste Mouret, Serena Ivaldi

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:40:51Z

**Summary**: This paper presents Words2Contact, a language-guided multi-contact placement pipeline leveraging large language models and vision language models. Our method is a key component for language-assisted teleoperation and human-robot cooperation, where human operators can instruct the robots where to place their support contacts before whole-body reaching or manipulation using natural language. Words2Contact transforms the verbal instructions of a human operator into contact placement predictions; it also deals with iterative corrections, until the human is satisfied with the contact location identified in the robot's field of view. We benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs and VLMs for size and performance in contact prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the iterative correction process, showing that users, even naive, quickly learn how to instruct the system to obtain accurate locations. Finally, we validate Words2Contact in real-world experiments with the Talos humanoid robot, instructed by human operators to place support contacts on different locations and surfaces to avoid falling when reaching for distant objects.

**Authors**: Yuemei Xu, Ling Hu, Jiayi Zhao, Zihan Qiu, Kexin XU, Yuqi Ye, Hanwen Gu

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:30:11Z

**Summary**: Based on the foundation of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multilingual LLMs (MLLMs) have been developed to address the challenges faced in multilingual natural language processing, hoping to achieve knowledge transfer from high-resource languages to low-resource languages. However, significant limitations and challenges still exist, such as language imbalance, multilingual alignment, and inherent bias. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of MLLMs, delving deeply into discussions surrounding these critical issues. First of all, we start by presenting an overview of MLLMs, covering their evolutions, key techniques, and multilingual capacities. Secondly, we explore the multilingual training corpora of MLLMs and the multilingual datasets oriented for downstream tasks that are crucial to enhance the cross-lingual capability of MLLMs. Thirdly, we survey the state-of-the-art studies of multilingual representations and investigate whether the current MLLMs can learn a universal language representation. Fourthly, we discuss bias on MLLMs, including its categories, evaluation metrics, and debiasing techniques. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and point out promising research directions of MLLMs.

### Imitating Language via Scalable Inverse Reinforcement Learning

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:26:42Z

**Summary**: The majority of language model training builds on imitation learning. It covers pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and affects the starting conditions for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The simplicity and scalability of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for next token prediction led to its role as predominant paradigm. However, the broader field of imitation learning can more effectively utilize the sequential structure underlying autoregressive generation. We focus on investigating the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) perspective to imitation, extracting rewards and directly optimizing sequences instead of individual token likelihoods and evaluate its benefits for fine-tuning large language models. We provide a new angle, reformulating inverse soft-Q-learning as a temporal difference regularized extension of MLE. This creates a principled connection between MLE and IRL and allows trading off added complexity with increased performance and diversity of generations in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting. We find clear advantages for IRL-based imitation, in particular for retaining diversity while maximizing task performance, rendering IRL a strong alternative on fixed SFT datasets even without online data generation. Our analysis of IRL-extracted reward functions further indicates benefits for more robust reward functions via tighter integration of supervised and preference-based LLM post-training.

### Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses against Multimodal Generative Models: A   Survey
**Authors**: Xuannan Liu, Xing Cui, Peipei Li, Zekun Li, Huaibo Huang, Shuhan Xia, Miaoxuan Zhang, Yueying Zou, Ran He

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:22:14Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of multimodal foundation models has led to significant advancements in cross-modal understanding and generation across diverse modalities, including text, images, audio, and video. However, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which can bypass built-in safety mechanisms and induce the production of potentially harmful content. Consequently, understanding the methods of jailbreak attacks and existing defense mechanisms is essential to ensure the safe deployment of multimodal generative models in real-world scenarios, particularly in security-sensitive applications. To provide comprehensive insight into this topic, this survey reviews jailbreak and defense in multimodal generative models. First, given the generalized lifecycle of multimodal jailbreak, we systematically explore attacks and corresponding defense strategies across four levels: input, encoder, generator, and output. Based on this analysis, we present a detailed taxonomy of attack methods, defense mechanisms, and evaluation frameworks specific to multimodal generative models. Additionally, we cover a wide range of input-output configurations, including modalities such as Any-to-Text, Any-to-Vision, and Any-to-Any within generative systems. Finally, we highlight current research challenges and propose potential directions for future research.

### The Fusion of Large Language Models and Formal Methods for Trustworthy   AI Agents: A Roadmap
**Authors**: Yedi Zhang, Yufan Cai, Xinyue Zuo, Xiaokun Luan, Kailong Wang, Zhe Hou, Yifan Zhang, Zhiyuan Wei, Meng Sun, Jun Sun, Jing Sun, Jin Song Dong

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T14:14:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative AI paradigm, profoundly influencing daily life through their exceptional language understanding and contextual generation capabilities. Despite their remarkable performance, LLMs face a critical challenge: the propensity to produce unreliable outputs due to the inherent limitations of their learning-based nature. Formal methods (FMs), on the other hand, are a well-established computation paradigm that provides mathematically rigorous techniques for modeling, specifying, and verifying the correctness of systems. FMs have been extensively applied in mission-critical software engineering, embedded systems, and cybersecurity. However, the primary challenge impeding the deployment of FMs in real-world settings lies in their steep learning curves, the absence of user-friendly interfaces, and issues with efficiency and adaptability.   This position paper outlines a roadmap for advancing the next generation of trustworthy AI systems by leveraging the mutual enhancement of LLMs and FMs. First, we illustrate how FMs, including reasoning and certification techniques, can help LLMs generate more reliable and formally certified outputs. Subsequently, we highlight how the advanced learning capabilities and adaptability of LLMs can significantly enhance the usability, efficiency, and scalability of existing FM tools. Finally, we show that unifying these two computation paradigms -- integrating the flexibility and intelligence of LLMs with the rigorous reasoning abilities of FMs -- has transformative potential for the development of trustworthy AI software systems. We acknowledge that this integration has the potential to enhance both the trustworthiness and efficiency of software engineering practices while fostering the development of intelligent FM tools capable of addressing complex yet real-world challenges.

**Authors**: Francesco Cremonesi, Lucia Innocenti, Sebastien Ourselin, Vicky Goh, Michela Antonelli, Marco Lorenzi

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T13:50:52Z

**Summary**: Background. Federated learning (FL) has gained wide popularity as a collaborative learning paradigm enabling collaborative AI in sensitive healthcare applications. Nevertheless, the practical implementation of FL presents technical and organizational challenges, as it generally requires complex communication infrastructures. In this context, consensus-based learning (CBL) may represent a promising collaborative learning alternative, thanks to the ability of combining local knowledge into a federated decision system, while potentially reducing deployment overhead. Methods. In this work we propose an extensive benchmark of the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of a panel of FL and CBL methods in a wide range of collaborative medical data analysis scenarios. The benchmark includes 7 different medical datasets, encompassing 3 machine learning tasks, 8 different data modalities, and multi-centric settings involving 3 to 23 clients. Findings. Our results reveal that CBL is a cost-effective alternative to FL. When compared across the panel of medical dataset in the considered benchmark, CBL methods provide equivalent accuracy to the one achieved by FL.Nonetheless, CBL significantly reduces training time and communication cost (resp. 15 fold and 60 fold decrease) (p < 0.05). Interpretation. This study opens a novel perspective on the deployment of collaborative AI in real-world applications, whereas the adoption of cost-effective methods is instrumental to achieve sustainability and democratisation of AI by alleviating the need for extensive computational resources.

### TartuNLP at EvaLatin 2024: Emotion Polarity Detection
**Authors**: Aleksei Dorkin, Kairit Sirts

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T13:41:31Z

**Summary**: This paper presents the TartuNLP team submission to EvaLatin 2024 shared task of the emotion polarity detection for historical Latin texts. Our system relies on two distinct approaches to annotating training data for supervised learning: 1) creating heuristics-based labels by adopting the polarity lexicon provided by the organizers and 2) generating labels with GPT4. We employed parameter efficient fine-tuning using the adapters framework and experimented with both monolingual and cross-lingual knowledge transfer for training language and task adapters. Our submission with the LLM-generated labels achieved the overall first place in the emotion polarity detection task. Our results show that LLM-based annotations show promising results on texts in Latin.

### SafeWorld: Geo-Diverse Safety Alignment
**Authors**: Da Yin, Haoyi Qiu, Kung-Hsiang Huang, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun Peng

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T13:31:46Z

**Summary**: In the rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring safety is a crucial and widely discussed topic. However, existing works often overlook the geo-diversity of cultural and legal standards across the world. To demonstrate the challenges posed by geo-diverse safety standards, we introduce SafeWorld, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to generate responses that are not only helpful but also culturally sensitive and legally compliant across diverse global contexts. SafeWorld encompasses 2,342 test user queries, each grounded in high-quality, human-verified cultural norms and legal policies from 50 countries and 493 regions/races. On top of it, we propose a multi-dimensional automatic safety evaluation framework that assesses the contextual appropriateness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of responses. Our evaluations reveal that current LLMs struggle to meet these criteria. To enhance LLMs' alignment with geo-diverse safety standards, we synthesize helpful preference pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) alignment training. The preference pair construction aims to encourage LLMs to behave appropriately and provide precise references to relevant cultural norms and policies when necessary. Our trained SafeWorldLM outperforms all competing models, including GPT-4o on all three evaluation dimensions by a large margin. Global human evaluators also note a nearly 20% higher winning rate in helpfulness and harmfulness evaluation. Our code and data can be found here: https://github.com/PlusLabNLP/SafeWorld.

### On the Universal Truthfulness Hyperplane Inside LLMs
**Authors**: Junteng Liu, Shiqi Chen, Yu Cheng, Junxian He

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T13:26:37Z

**Summary**: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities across various fields, hallucination remains a significant challenge. Recent studies have explored hallucinations through the lens of internal representations, proposing mechanisms to decipher LLMs' adherence to facts. However, these approaches often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data, leading to concerns about whether internal representation patterns reflect fundamental factual awareness, or only overfit spurious correlations on the specific datasets. In this work, we investigate whether a universal truthfulness hyperplane that distinguishes the model's factually correct and incorrect outputs exists within the model. To this end, we scale up the number of training datasets and conduct an extensive evaluation -- we train the truthfulness hyperplane on a diverse collection of over 40 datasets and examine its cross-task, cross-domain, and in-domain generalization. Our results indicate that increasing the diversity of the training datasets significantly enhances the performance in all scenarios, while the volume of data samples plays a less critical role. This finding supports the optimistic hypothesis that a universal truthfulness hyperplane may indeed exist within the model, offering promising directions for future research.

### Transfer or Self-Supervised? Bridging the Performance Gap in Medical   Imaging
**Authors**: Zehui Zhao, Laith Alzubaidi, Jinglan Zhang, Ye Duan, Usman Naseem, Yuantong Gu

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T13:07:01Z

**Summary**: Recently, transfer learning and self-supervised learning have gained significant attention within the medical field due to their ability to mitigate the challenges posed by limited data availability, improve model generalisation, and reduce computational expenses. Transfer learning and self-supervised learning hold immense potential for advancing medical research. However, it is crucial to recognise that transfer learning and self-supervised learning architectures exhibit distinct advantages and limitations, manifesting variations in accuracy, training speed, and robustness. This paper compares the performance and robustness of transfer learning and self-supervised learning in the medical field. Specifically, we pre-trained two models using the same source domain datasets with different pre-training methods and evaluated them on small-sized medical datasets to identify the factors influencing their final performance. We tested data with several common issues in medical domains, such as data imbalance, data scarcity, and domain mismatch, through comparison experiments to understand their impact on specific pre-trained models. Finally, we provide recommendations to help users apply transfer learning and self-supervised learning methods in medical areas, and build more convenient and efficient deployment strategies.

### UAV Virtual Antenna Array Deployment for Uplink Interference Mitigation   in Data Collection Networks
**Authors**: Hongjuan Li, Hui Kang, Geng Sun, Jiahui Li, Jiacheng Wang, Xue Wang, Dusit Niyato, Victor C. M. Leung

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T12:56:50Z

**Summary**: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained considerable attention as a platform for establishing aerial wireless networks and communications. However, the line-of-sight dominance in air-to-ground communications often leads to significant interference with terrestrial networks, reducing communication efficiency among terrestrial terminals. This paper explores a novel uplink interference mitigation approach based on the collaborative beamforming (CB) method in multi-UAV network systems. Specifically, the UAV swarm forms a UAV-enabled virtual antenna array (VAA) to achieve the transmissions of gathered data to multiple base stations (BSs) for data backup and distributed processing. However, there is a trade-off between the effectiveness of CB-based interference mitigation and the energy conservation of UAVs. Thus, by jointly optimizing the excitation current weights and hover position of UAVs as well as the sequence of data transmission to various BSs, we formulate an uplink interference mitigation multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) to decrease interference affection, enhance transmission efficiency, and improve energy efficiency, simultaneously. In response to the computational demands of the formulated problem, we introduce an evolutionary computation method, namely chaotic non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (CNSGA-II) with multiple improved operators. The proposed CNSGA-II efficiently addresses the formulated MOOP, outperforming several other comparative algorithms, as evidenced by the outcomes of the simulations. Moreover, the proposed CB-based uplink interference mitigation approach can significantly reduce the interference caused by UAVs to non-receiving BSs.

### Can foundation models actively gather information in interactive   environments to test hypotheses?
**Authors**: Nan Rosemary Ke, Danny P. Sawyer, Hubert Soyer, Martin Engelcke, David P Reichert, Drew A. Hudson, John Reid, Alexander Lerchner, Danilo Jimenez Rezende, Timothy P Lillicrap, Michael Mozer, Jane X Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T12:27:21Z

**Summary**: While problem solving is a standard evaluation task for foundation models, a crucial component of problem solving -- actively and strategically gathering information to test hypotheses -- has not been closely investigated. To assess the information gathering abilities of foundation models in interactive environments, we introduce a framework in which a model must determine the factors influencing a hidden reward function by iteratively reasoning about its previously gathered information and proposing its next exploratory action to maximize information gain at each step. We implement this framework in both a text-based environment, which offers a tightly controlled setting and enables high-throughput parameter sweeps, and in an embodied 3D environment, which requires addressing complexities of multi-modal interaction more relevant to real-world applications. We further investigate whether approaches such as self-correction and increased inference time improve information gathering efficiency. In a relatively simple task that requires identifying a single rewarding feature, we find that LLM's information gathering capability is close to optimal. However, when the model must identify a conjunction of rewarding features, performance is suboptimal. The hit in performance is due partly to the model translating task description to a policy and partly to the model's effectiveness in using its in-context memory. Performance is comparable in both text and 3D embodied environments, although imperfect visual object recognition reduces its accuracy in drawing conclusions from gathered information in the 3D embodied case. For single-feature-based rewards, we find that smaller models curiously perform better; for conjunction-based rewards, incorporating self correction into the model improves performance.

### Simulating Human-like Daily Activities with Desire-driven Autonomy
**Authors**: Yiding Wang, Yuxuan Chen, Fangwei Zhong, Long Ma, Yizhou Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T12:21:20Z

**Summary**: Existing task-oriented AI agents often depend on explicit instructions or external rewards, limiting their ability to be driven by intrinsic motivations like humans. In this paper, we present a desire-driven autonomy framework to guide a Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) agent to simulate human-like daily activities. In contrast to previous agents, our Desire-driven Autonomous Agent (D2A) operates on the principle of intrinsic desire, allowing it to propose and select tasks that fulfill its motivational framework autonomously. Inspired by the Theory of Needs, the motivational framework incorporates an understanding of human-like desires, such as the need for social interaction, personal fulfillment, and self-care. Utilizing a desire-driven task generation mechanism, the agent evaluates its current state and takes a sequence of activities aligned with its intrinsic motivations. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our Desire-driven Autonomous Agent (D2A) generates coherent, contextually relevant daily activities while exhibiting variability and adaptability similar to human behavior. A comparative analysis with other LLM-based frameworks demonstrates that our approach significantly enhances the rationality of the simulated activities.

### Integrating Expert Labels into LLM-based Emission Goal Detection:   Example Selection vs Automatic Prompt Design
**Authors**: Marco Wrzalik, Adrian Ulges, Anne Uersfeld, Florian Faust

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T12:20:33Z

**Summary**: We address the detection of emission reduction goals in corporate reports, an important task for monitoring companies' progress in addressing climate change. Specifically, we focus on the issue of integrating expert feedback in the form of labeled example passages into LLM-based pipelines, and compare the two strategies of (1) a dynamic selection of few-shot examples and (2) the automatic optimization of the prompt by the LLM itself. Our findings on a public dataset of 769 climate-related passages from real-world business reports indicate that automatic prompt optimization is the superior approach, while combining both methods provides only limited benefit. Qualitative results indicate that optimized prompts do indeed capture many intricacies of the targeted emission goal extraction task.

### DNN Task Assignment in UAV Networks: A Generative AI Enhanced   Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach
**Authors**: Xin Tang, Qian Chen, Wenjie Weng, Binhan Liao, Jiacheng Wang, Xianbin Cao, Xiaohuan Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T12:12:14Z

**Summary**: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) possess high mobility and flexible deployment capabilities, prompting the development of UAVs for various application scenarios within the Internet of Things (IoT). The unique capabilities of UAVs give rise to increasingly critical and complex tasks in uncertain and potentially harsh environments. The substantial amount of data generated from these applications necessitates processing and analysis through deep neural networks (DNNs). However, UAVs encounter challenges due to their limited computing resources when managing DNN models. This paper presents a joint approach that combines multiple-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and generative diffusion models (GDM) for assigning DNN tasks to a UAV swarm, aimed at reducing latency from task capture to result output. To address these challenges, we first consider the task size of the target area to be inspected and the shortest flying path as optimization constraints, employing a greedy algorithm to resolve the subproblem with a focus on minimizing the UAV's flying path and the overall system cost. In the second stage, we introduce a novel DNN task assignment algorithm, termed GDM-MADDPG, which utilizes the reverse denoising process of GDM to replace the actor network in multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG). This approach generates specific DNN task assignment actions based on agents' observations in a dynamic environment. Simulation results indicate that our algorithm performs favorably compared to benchmarks in terms of path planning, Age of Information (AoI), energy consumption, and task load balancing.

### LLM-BIP: Structured Pruning for Large Language Models with Block-Wise   Forward Importance Propagation
**Authors**: Haihang Wu

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T11:57:16Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various language tasks, but their widespread deployment is impeded by their large size and high computational costs. Structural pruning is a prevailing technique used to introduce sparsity into pre-trained models and facilitate direct hardware acceleration during inference by removing redundant connections (structurally-grouped parameters), such as channels and attention heads. Existing structural pruning approaches often employ either global or layer-wise pruning criteria; however, they are hindered by ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate evaluation of connection importance. Global pruning methods typically assess component importance using near-zero and unreliable gradients, while layer-wise pruning approaches encounter significant pruning error accumulation issues. To this end, we propose a more accurate pruning metric based on the block-wise importance score propagation, termed LLM-BIP. Specifically, LLM-BIP precisely evaluates connection importance by gauging its influence on the respective transformer block output, which can be efficiently approximated in a single forward pass through an upper bound derived from the assumption of Lipschitz continuity. We evaluate the proposed method using LLaMA-7B, Vicuna-7B, and LLaMA-13B across common zero-shot tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves an average of 3.26% increase in accuracy for common reasoning tasks compared to previous best baselines. It also reduces perplexity by 14.09 and 68.76 on average for the WikiText2 dataset and PTB dataset, respectively.

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T11:40:06Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have introduced convenient and user-friendly methods for leveraging tools across various domains. In the field of astronomical observation, the construction of new telescopes has significantly increased astronomers' workload. Deploying LLM-powered agents can effectively alleviate this burden and reduce the costs associated with training personnel. Within the Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey (NGSS) project, which encompasses eight telescopes across three observation sites, aiming to find the transients from the galaxies in 50 mpc, we have developed the \textbf{StarWhisper Telescope System} to manage the entire observation process. This system automates tasks such as generating observation lists, conducting observations, analyzing data, and providing feedback to the observer. Observation lists are customized for different sites and strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage of celestial objects. After manual verification, these lists are uploaded to the telescopes via the agents in the system, which initiates observations upon neutral language. The observed images are analyzed in real-time, and the transients are promptly communicated to the observer. The agent modifies them into a real-time follow-up observation proposal and send to the Xinglong observatory group chat, then add them to the next-day observation lists. Additionally, the integration of AI agents within the system provides online accessibility, saving astronomers' time and encouraging greater participation from amateur astronomers in the NGSS project.

### GameArena: Evaluating LLM Reasoning through Live Computer Games
**Authors**: Lanxiang Hu, Qiyu Li, Anze Xie, Nan Jiang, Ion Stoica, Haojian Jin, Hao Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T11:22:59Z

**Summary**: Evaluating the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) is challenging. Existing benchmarks often depend on static datasets, which are vulnerable to data contamination and may get saturated over time, or on binary live human feedback that conflates reasoning with other abilities. As the most prominent dynamic benchmark, Chatbot Arena evaluates open-ended questions in real-world settings, but lacks the granularity in assessing specific reasoning capabilities. We introduce GameArena, a dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities through interactive gameplay with humans. GameArena consists of three games designed to test specific reasoning capabilities (e.g., deductive and inductive reasoning), while keeping participants entertained and engaged. We analyze the gaming data retrospectively to uncover the underlying reasoning processes of LLMs and measure their fine-grained reasoning capabilities. We collect over 2000 game sessions and provide detailed assessments of various reasoning capabilities for five state-of-the-art LLMs. Our user study with 100 participants suggests that GameArena improves user engagement compared to Chatbot Arena. For the first time, GameArena enables the collection of step-by-step LLM reasoning data in the wild.

### Exploring Memorization and Copyright Violation in Frontier LLMs: A Study   of the New York Times v. OpenAI 2023 Lawsuit
**Authors**: Joshua Freeman, Chloe Rippe, Edoardo Debenedetti, Maksym Andriushchenko

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T10:44:47Z

**Summary**: Copyright infringement in frontier LLMs has received much attention recently due to the New York Times v. OpenAI lawsuit, filed in December 2023. The New York Times claims that GPT-4 has infringed its copyrights by reproducing articles for use in LLM training and by memorizing the inputs, thereby publicly displaying them in LLM outputs. Our work aims to measure the propensity of OpenAI's LLMs to exhibit verbatim memorization in its outputs relative to other LLMs, specifically focusing on news articles. We discover that both GPT and Claude models use refusal training and output filters to prevent verbatim output of the memorized articles. We apply a basic prompt template to bypass the refusal training and show that OpenAI models are currently less prone to memorization elicitation than models from Meta, Mistral, and Anthropic. We find that as models increase in size, especially beyond 100 billion parameters, they demonstrate significantly greater capacity for memorization. Our findings have practical implications for training: more attention must be placed on preventing verbatim memorization in very large models. Our findings also have legal significance: in assessing the relative memorization capacity of OpenAI's LLMs, we probe the strength of The New York Times's copyright infringement claims and OpenAI's legal defenses, while underscoring issues at the intersection of generative AI, law, and policy.

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T10:11:22Z

**Summary**: With the increasing application of large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain, evaluating these models' performance using benchmark datasets has become crucial. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of various benchmark datasets employed in medical LLM tasks. These datasets span multiple modalities including text, image, and multimodal benchmarks, focusing on different aspects of medical knowledge such as electronic health records (EHRs), doctor-patient dialogues, medical question-answering, and medical image captioning. The survey categorizes the datasets by modality, discussing their significance, data structure, and impact on the development of LLMs for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, report generation, and predictive decision support. Key benchmarks include MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, BioASQ, PubMedQA, and CheXpert, which have facilitated advancements in tasks like medical report generation, clinical summarization, and synthetic data generation. The paper summarizes the challenges and opportunities in leveraging these benchmarks for advancing multimodal medical intelligence, emphasizing the need for datasets with a greater degree of language diversity, structured omics data, and innovative approaches to synthesis. This work also provides a foundation for future research in the application of LLMs in medicine, contributing to the evolving field of medical artificial intelligence.

### Eliminating Biased Length Reliance of Direct Preference Optimization via   Down-Sampled KL Divergence
**Authors**: Junru Lu, Jiazheng Li, Siyu An, Meng Zhao, Yulan He, Di Yin, Xing Sun

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T09:57:05Z

**Summary**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a prominent algorithm for the direct and robust alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, offering a more straightforward alternative to the complex Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Despite its promising efficacy, DPO faces a notable drawback: "verbosity", a common over-optimization phenomenon also observed in RLHF. While previous studies mainly attributed verbosity to biased labels within the data, we propose that the issue also stems from an inherent algorithmic length reliance in DPO. Specifically, we suggest that the discrepancy between sequence-level Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences between chosen and rejected sequences, used in DPO, results in overestimated or underestimated rewards due to varying token lengths. Empirically, we utilize datasets with different label lengths to demonstrate the presence of biased rewards. We then introduce an effective downsampling approach, named SamPO, to eliminate potential length reliance. Our experimental evaluations, conducted across three LLMs of varying scales and a diverse array of conditional and open-ended benchmarks, highlight the efficacy of SamPO in mitigating verbosity, achieving improvements of 5% to 12% over DPO through debaised rewards. Our codes can be accessed at: https://github.com/LuJunru/SamPO/.

### Assessing the potential of LLM-assisted annotation for corpus-based   pragmatics and discourse analysis: The case of apology
**Authors**: Danni Yu, Luyang Li, Hang Su, Matteo Fuoli

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T09:56:59Z

**Summary**: Certain forms of linguistic annotation, like part of speech and semantic tagging, can be automated with high accuracy. However, manual annotation is still necessary for complex pragmatic and discursive features that lack a direct mapping to lexical forms. This manual process is time-consuming and error-prone, limiting the scalability of function-to-form approaches in corpus linguistics. To address this, our study explores the possibility of using large language models (LLMs) to automate pragma-discursive corpus annotation. We compare GPT-3.5 (the model behind the free-to-use version of ChatGPT), GPT-4 (the model underpinning the precise mode of Bing chatbot), and a human coder in annotating apology components in English based on the local grammar framework. We find that GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5, with accuracy approaching that of a human coder. These results suggest that LLMs can be successfully deployed to aid pragma-discursive corpus annotation, making the process more efficient, scalable and accessible.

### FIPO: Free-form Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization with Preference   Dataset and Modular Fine-tuning Schema
**Authors**: Junru Lu, Siyu An, Min Zhang, Yulan He, Di Yin, Xing Sun

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T09:53:07Z

**Summary**: When the quality of naive prompts is carefully optimized by human experts, the task performance of large language models (LLMs) can be significantly improved. However, expert-based prompt optimizations are expensive. Herein, some works have proposed Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), to optimize naive prompts according to task outputs of given in-box testing models, with the help of advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in an ad-hoc way. Although effective, existing schemes suffer from poor generalization ability and privacy risk. To this end, we collect the first large-scale Prompt Optimization Preference dataset (POP), fine-tune offline local LLM-based optimizers, then fairly test with various downstream models. Our method allows accurate optimization of the core task instruction part within the naive prompt in a model-agnostic manner, and thus is named Free-from Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO). In specific, FIPO uses a modular APO template that dynamically integrate the naive task instruction, optional instruction responses, and optional ground truth to produce finely optimized prompts. The POP dataset is meticulously constructed using advanced LLMs, undergoing rigorous cross-validation by human experts and analytical models. Leveraging insights from the data with Tulu2 models and diverse fine-tuning strategies, we validate the efficacy of FIPO framework across five public benchmarks and six testing models.

### Split and Merge: Aligning Position Biases in LLM-based Evaluators
**Authors**: Zongjie Li, Chaozheng Wang, Pingchuan Ma, Daoyuan Wu, Shuai Wang, Cuiyun Gao, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T09:39:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise as automated evaluators for assessing the quality of answers generated by AI systems. However, these LLM-based evaluators exhibit position bias, or inconsistency, when used to evaluate candidate answers in pairwise comparisons, favoring either the first or second answer regardless of content. To address this limitation, we propose PORTIA, an alignment-based system designed to mimic human comparison strategies to calibrate position bias in a lightweight yet effective manner. Specifically, PORTIA splits the answers into multiple segments, aligns similar content across candidate answers, and then merges them back into a single prompt for evaluation by LLMs. We conducted extensive experiments with six diverse LLMs to evaluate 11,520 answer pairs. Our results show that PORTIA markedly enhances the consistency rates for all the models and comparison forms tested, achieving an average relative improvement of 47.46%. Remarkably, PORTIA enables less advanced GPT models to achieve 88% agreement with the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model at just 10% of the cost. Furthermore, it rectifies around 80% of the position bias instances within the GPT-4 model, elevating its consistency rate up to 98%. Subsequent human evaluations indicate that the PORTIA-enhanced GPT-3.5 model can even surpass the standalone GPT-4 in terms of alignment with human evaluators. These findings highlight PORTIA's ability to correct position bias, improve LLM consistency, and boost performance while keeping cost-efficiency. This represents a valuable step toward a more reliable and scalable use of LLMs for automated evaluations across diverse applications.

### Rethinking Data Selection at Scale: Random Selection is Almost All You   Need
**Authors**: Tingyu Xia, Bowen Yu, Kai Dang, An Yang, Yuan Wu, Yuan Tian, Yi Chang, Junyang Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T09:31:39Z

**Summary**: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human instructions. The primary goal during SFT is to select a small yet representative subset of training data from the larger pool, such that fine-tuning with this subset achieves results comparable to or even exceeding those obtained using the entire dataset. However, most existing data selection techniques are designed for small-scale data pools, which fail to meet the demands of real-world SFT scenarios. In this paper, we replicated several self-scoring methods those that do not rely on external model assistance on two million scale datasets, and found that nearly all methods struggled to significantly outperform random selection when dealing with such large-scale data pools. Moreover, our comparisons suggest that, during SFT, diversity in data selection is more critical than simply focusing on high quality data. We also analyzed the limitations of several current approaches, explaining why they perform poorly on large-scale datasets and why they are unsuitable for such contexts. Finally, we found that filtering data by token length offers a stable and efficient method for improving results. This approach, particularly when training on long text data, proves highly beneficial for relatively weaker base models, such as Llama3.

### Adaptive Rank, Reduced Forgetting: Knowledge Retention in Continual   Learning Vision-Language Models with Dynamic Rank-Selective LoRA
**Authors**: Haodong Lu, Chongyang Zhao, Jason Xue, Lina Yao, Kristen Moore, Dong Gong

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T09:25:36Z

**Summary**: We investigate whether the pre-trained knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, can be retained or even enhanced during continual learning (CL) while absorbing knowledge from a data stream. Existing methods often rely on additional reference data, isolated components for distribution or domain predictions, leading to high training costs, increased inference complexity, and limited improvement potential for pre-trained models. To address these challenges, we first comprehensively analyze the effects of parameter update locations and ranks on downstream adaptation and knowledge retention. Based on these insights, we propose Dynamic Rank-Selective Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a universal and efficient CL approach that adaptively assigns ranks to LoRA modules based on their relevance to the current data. Unlike prior methods, our approach continually enhances the pre-trained VLM by retaining both the pre-trained knowledge and the knowledge acquired during CL. Our approach eliminates the need for explicit domain or distribution prediction and additional reference data, enabling seamless integration of new tasks while preserving pre-trained capabilities. It also maintains the original architecture and deployment pipeline of the pre-trained model without incurring any additional inference overhead. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in continually absorbing knowledge of downstream tasks while retaining pre-trained knowledge.

**Authors**: Saransh Kumar Gupta, Lipika Dey, Partha Pratim Das, Geeta Trilok-Kumar, Ramesh Jain

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T09:21:49Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach to compute food composition data for Indian recipes using a knowledge graph for Indian food (FKG.in) and LLMs. The primary focus is to provide a broad overview of an automated food composition analysis workflow and describe its core functionalities: nutrition data aggregation, food composition analysis, and LLM-augmented information resolution. This workflow aims to complement FKG.in and iteratively supplement food composition data from verified knowledge bases. Additionally, this paper highlights the challenges of representing Indian food and accessing food composition data digitally. It also reviews three key sources of food composition data: the Indian Food Composition Tables, the Indian Nutrient Databank, and the Nutritionix API. Furthermore, it briefly outlines how users can interact with the workflow to obtain diet-based health recommendations and detailed food composition information for numerous recipes. We then explore the complex challenges of analyzing Indian recipe information across dimensions such as structure, multilingualism, and uncertainty as well as present our ongoing work on LLM-based solutions to address these issues. The methods proposed in this workshop paper for AI-driven knowledge curation and information resolution are application-agnostic, generalizable, and replicable for any domain.

### From Novice to Expert: LLM Agent Policy Optimization via Step-wise   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Zhirui Deng, Zhicheng Dou, Yutao Zhu, Ji-Rong Wen, Ruibin Xiong, Mang Wang, Weipeng Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T09:20:11Z

**Summary**: The outstanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) render them a crucial component in various autonomous agent systems. While traditional methods depend on the inherent knowledge of LLMs without fine-tuning, more recent approaches have shifted toward the reinforcement learning strategy to further enhance agents' ability to solve complex interactive tasks with environments and tools. However, previous approaches are constrained by the sparse reward issue, where existing datasets solely provide a final scalar reward for each multi-step reasoning chain, potentially leading to ineffectiveness and inefficiency in policy learning. In this paper, we introduce StepAgent, which utilizes step-wise reward to optimize the agent's reinforcement learning process. Inheriting the spirit of novice-to-expert theory, we first compare the actions of the expert and the agent to automatically generate intermediate rewards for fine-grained optimization. Additionally, we propose implicit-reward and inverse reinforcement learning techniques to facilitate agent reflection and policy adjustment. Further theoretical analysis demonstrates that the action distribution of the agent can converge toward the expert action distribution over multiple training cycles. Experimental results across various datasets indicate that StepAgent outperforms existing baseline methods.

### PRECISE: Pre-training Sequential Recommenders with Collaborative and   Semantic Information
**Authors**: Chonggang Song, Chunxu Shen, Hao Gu, Yaoming Wu, Lingling Yi, Jie Wen, Chuan Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T08:55:48Z

**Summary**: Real-world recommendation systems commonly offer diverse content scenarios for users to interact with. Considering the enormous number of users in industrial platforms, it is infeasible to utilize a single unified recommendation model to meet the requirements of all scenarios. Usually, separate recommendation pipelines are established for each distinct scenario. This practice leads to challenges in comprehensively grasping users' interests. Recent research endeavors have been made to tackle this problem by pre-training models to encapsulate the overall interests of users. Traditional pre-trained recommendation models mainly capture user interests by leveraging collaborative signals. Nevertheless, a prevalent drawback of these systems is their incapacity to handle long-tail items and cold-start scenarios. With the recent advent of large language models, there has been a significant increase in research efforts focused on exploiting LLMs to extract semantic information for users and items. However, text-based recommendations highly rely on elaborate feature engineering and frequently fail to capture collaborative similarities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pre-training framework for sequential recommendation, termed PRECISE. This framework combines collaborative signals with semantic information. Moreover, PRECISE employs a learning framework that initially models users' comprehensive interests across all recommendation scenarios and subsequently concentrates on the specific interests of target-scene behaviors. We demonstrate that PRECISE precisely captures the entire range of user interests and effectively transfers them to the target interests. Empirical findings reveal that the PRECISE framework attains outstanding performance on both public and industrial datasets.

### DSAI: Unbiased and Interpretable Latent Feature Extraction for   Data-Centric AI
**Authors**: Hyowon Cho, Soonwon Ka, Daechul Park, Jaewook Kang, Minjoon Seo, Bokyung Son

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T08:47:05Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to objectively identify latent characteristics in large datasets due to their reliance on pre-trained knowledge rather than actual data patterns. To address this data grounding issue, we propose Data Scientist AI (DSAI), a framework that enables unbiased and interpretable feature extraction through a multi-stage pipeline with quantifiable prominence metrics for evaluating extracted features. On synthetic datasets with known ground-truth features, DSAI demonstrates high recall in identifying expert-defined features while faithfully reflecting the underlying data. Applications on real-world datasets illustrate the framework's practical utility in uncovering meaningful patterns with minimal expert oversight, supporting use cases such as interpretable classification.   The title of our paper is chosen from multiple candidates based on DSAI-generated criteria.

### Beyond pip install: Evaluating LLM Agents for the Automated Installation   of Python Projects
**Authors**: Louis Milliken, Sungmin Kang, Shin Yoo

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T08:37:06Z

**Summary**: Many works have recently proposed the use of Large Language Model (LLM) based agents for performing `repository level' tasks, loosely defined as a set of tasks whose scopes are greater than a single file. This has led to speculation that the orchestration of these repository-level tasks could lead to software engineering agents capable of performing almost independently of human intervention. However, of the suite of tasks that would need to be performed by this autonomous software engineering agent, we argue that one important task is missing, which is to fulfil project level dependency by installing other repositories. To investigate the feasibility of this repository level installation task, we introduce a benchmark of of repository installation tasks curated from 40 open source Python projects, which includes a ground truth installation process for each target repository. Further, we propose Installamatic, an agent which aims to perform and verify the installation of a given repository by searching for relevant instructions from documentation in the repository. Empirical experiments reveal that that 55% of the studied repositories can be automatically installed by our agent at least one out of ten times. Through further analysis, we identify the common causes for our agent's inability to install a repository, discuss the challenges faced in the design and implementation of such an agent and consider the implications that such an agent could have for developers.

### ARChef: An iOS-Based Augmented Reality Cooking Assistant Powered by   Multimodal Gemini LLM
**Authors**: Rithik Vir, Parsa Madinei

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T08:27:07Z

**Summary**: Cooking meals can be difficult, causing many to resort to cookbooks and online recipes. However, relying on these traditional methods of cooking often results in missing ingredients, nutritional hazards, and unsatisfactory meals. Using Augmented Reality (AR) can address these issues; however, current AR cooking applications have poor user interfaces and limited accessibility. This paper proposes a prototype of an iOS application that integrates AR and Computer Vision (CV) into the cooking process. We leverage Google's Gemini Large Language Model (LLM) to identify ingredients in the camera's field of vision and generate recipe choices with detailed nutritional information. Additionally, this application uses Apple's ARKit to create an AR user interface compatible with iOS devices. Users can personalize their meal suggestions by inputting their dietary preferences and rating each meal. The application's effectiveness is evaluated through three rounds of user experience surveys. This application advances the field of accessible cooking assistance technologies, aiming to reduce food wastage and improve the meal planning experience.

### S$^{2}$FT: Efficient, Scalable and Generalizable LLM Fine-tuning by   Structured Sparsity
**Authors**: Xinyu Yang, Jixuan Leng, Geyang Guo, Jiawei Zhao, Ryumei Nakada, Linjun Zhang, Huaxiu Yao, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T08:24:11Z

**Summary**: Current PEFT methods for LLMs can achieve either high quality, efficient training, or scalable serving, but not all three simultaneously. To address this limitation, we investigate sparse fine-tuning and observe a remarkable improvement in generalization ability. Utilizing this key insight, we propose a family of Structured Sparse Fine-Tuning (S$^{2}$FT) methods for LLMs, which concurrently achieve state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance, training efficiency, and inference scalability. S$^{2}$FT accomplishes this by "selecting sparsely and computing densely". It selects a few heads and channels in the MHA and FFN modules for each Transformer block, respectively. Next, it co-permutes weight matrices on both sides of the coupled structures in LLMs to connect the selected components in each layer into a dense submatrix. Finally, S$^{2}$FT performs in-place gradient updates on all submatrices. Through theoretical analysis and empirical results, our method prevents overfitting and forgetting, delivers SOTA performance on both commonsense and arithmetic reasoning with 4.6% and 1.3% average improvements compared to LoRA, and surpasses full FT by 11.5% when generalizing to various domains after instruction tuning. Using our partial backpropagation algorithm, S$^{2}$FT saves training memory up to 3$\times$ and improves latency by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to full FT, while delivering an average 10% improvement over LoRA on both metrics. We further demonstrate that the weight updates in S$^{2}$FT can be decoupled into adapters, enabling effective fusion, fast switch, and efficient parallelism for serving multiple fine-tuned models.

### PediaBench: A Comprehensive Chinese Pediatric Dataset for Benchmarking   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Qian Zhang, Panfeng Chen, Jiali Li, Linkun Feng, Shuyu Liu, Mei Chen, Hui Li, Yanhao Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T08:19:28Z

**Summary**: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the medical domain has stressed a compelling need for standard datasets to evaluate their question-answering (QA) performance. Although there have been several benchmark datasets for medical QA, they either cover common knowledge across different departments or are specific to another department rather than pediatrics. Moreover, some of them are limited to objective questions and do not measure the generation capacity of LLMs. Therefore, they cannot comprehensively assess the QA ability of LLMs in pediatrics. To fill this gap, we construct PediaBench, the first Chinese pediatric dataset for LLM evaluation. Specifically, it contains 4,565 objective questions and 1,632 subjective questions spanning 12 pediatric disease groups. It adopts an integrated scoring criterion based on different difficulty levels to thoroughly assess the proficiency of an LLM in instruction following, knowledge understanding, clinical case analysis, etc. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of PediaBench with extensive experiments on 20 open-source and commercial LLMs. Through an in-depth analysis of experimental results, we offer insights into the ability of LLMs to answer pediatric questions in the Chinese context, highlighting their limitations for further improvements. Our code and data are published at https://github.com/ACMISLab/PediaBench.

**Authors**: Chalisa Veesommai Sillberg, Jose Siqueira De Cerqueira, Pekka Sillberg, Kai-Kristian Kemell, Pekka Abrahamsson

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T08:01:13Z

**Summary**: The EU AI Act was created to ensure ethical and safe Artificial Intelligence (AI) development and deployment across the EU. This study aims to identify key challenges and strategies for helping enterprises focus on resources effectively. To achieve this aim, we conducted a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) to explore the sentiments of both the industry and the academia. From 130 articles, 56 met the criteria. Our key findings are three-fold. First, liability. Second, discrimination. Third, tool adequacy. Additionally, some negative sentiments were expressed by industry and academia regarding regulatory interpretations, specific requirements, and transparency issues. Next, our findings are three essential themes for enterprises. First, risk-based regulatory compliance. Second, ethical frameworks and principles in technology development. Third, policies and systems for regulatory risk management. These results identify the key challenges and strategies and provide less commonly discussed themes, enabling enterprises to align with the requirements and minimize their distance from the EU market.

### Monet: Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers
**Authors**: Jungwoo Park, Young Jin Ahn, Kee-Eung Kim, Jaewoo Kang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T07:49:01Z

**Summary**: Understanding the internal computations of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for aligning them with human values and preventing undesirable behaviors like toxic content generation. However, mechanistic interpretability is hindered by polysemanticity -- where individual neurons respond to multiple, unrelated concepts. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have attempted to disentangle these features through sparse dictionary learning, they have compromised LLM performance due to reliance on post-hoc reconstruction loss. To address this issue, we introduce Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers (Monet) architecture, which incorporates sparse dictionary learning directly into end-to-end Mixture-of-Experts pretraining. Our novel expert decomposition method enables scaling the expert count to 262,144 per layer while total parameters scale proportionally to the square root of the number of experts. Our analyses demonstrate mutual exclusivity of knowledge across experts and showcase the parametric knowledge encapsulated within individual experts. Moreover, Monet allows knowledge manipulation over domains, languages, and toxicity mitigation without degrading general performance. Our pursuit of transparent LLMs highlights the potential of scaling expert counts to enhance mechanistic interpretability and directly resect the internal knowledge to fundamentally adjust model behavior. The source code and pretrained checkpoints are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/Monet.

### Methods for Legal Citation Prediction in the Age of LLMs: An Australian   Law Case Study
**Authors**: Ehsan Shareghi, Jiuzhou Han, Paul Burgess

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T07:46:14Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential across a wide range of legal tasks. Despite these advances, mitigating hallucination remains a significant challenge, with state-of-the-art LLMs still frequently generating incorrect legal references. In this paper, we focus on the problem of legal citation prediction within the Australian law context, where correctly identifying and citing relevant legislations or precedents is critical. We compare several approaches: prompting general purpose and law-specialised LLMs, retrieval-only pipelines with both generic and domain-specific embeddings, task-specific instruction-tuning of LLMs, and hybrid strategies that combine LLMs with retrieval augmentation, query expansion, or voting ensembles. Our findings indicate that domain-specific pre-training alone is insufficient for achieving satisfactory citation accuracy even after law-specialised pre-training. In contrast, instruction tuning on our task-specific dataset dramatically boosts performance reaching the best results across all settings. We also highlight that database granularity along with the type of embeddings play a critical role in the performance of retrieval systems. Among retrieval-based approaches, hybrid methods consistently outperform retrieval-only setups, and among these, ensemble voting delivers the best result by combining the predictive quality of instruction-tuned LLMs with the retrieval system.

### iLLaVA: An Image is Worth Fewer Than 1/3 Input Tokens in Large   Multimodal Models
**Authors**: Lianyu Hu, Fanhua Shang, Liang Wan, Wei Feng

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T07:22:19Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce iLLaVA, a simple method that can be seamlessly deployed upon current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to greatly increase the throughput with nearly lossless model performance, without a further requirement to train. iLLaVA achieves this by finding and gradually merging the redundant tokens with an accurate and fast algorithm, which can merge hundreds of tokens within only one step. While some previous methods have explored directly pruning or merging tokens in the inference stage to accelerate models, our method excels in both performance and throughput by two key designs. First, while most previous methods only try to save the computations of Large Language Models (LLMs), our method accelerates the forward pass of both image encoders and LLMs in LVLMs, which both occupy a significant part of time during inference. Second, our method recycles the beneficial information from the pruned tokens into existing tokens, which avoids directly dropping context tokens like previous methods to cause performance loss. iLLaVA can nearly 2$\times$ the throughput, and reduce the memory costs by half with only a 0.2\% - 0.5\% performance drop across models of different scales including 7B, 13B and 34B. On tasks across different domains including single-image, multi-images and videos, iLLaVA demonstrates strong generalizability with consistently promising efficiency. We finally offer abundant visualizations to show the merging processes of iLLaVA in each step, which show insights into the distribution of computing resources in LVLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hulianyuyy/iLLaVA.

### Rethinking Data Synthesis: A Teacher Model Training Recipe with   Interpretation
**Authors**: Yifang Chen, David Zhu, Simon Du, Kevin Jamieson, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T07:17:07Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) training have highlighted the need for diverse, high-quality instruction data. Recently, many works are exploring synthetic data generation using LLMs. However, they primarily focus on prompt engineering with standard supervised instruction-finetuned models, which contains a fundamental limitation: these models are optimized for general question-answering/problem-solving rather than data generation. We propose a paradigm shift named \textbf{NOMAD} by investigating how to specifically train models for data generation, demonstrating that this task differs significantly from training a classical LM. We identify two key factors: no-prompt-masked training and proper training set size selection. Our method, NOMAD, shows substantial improvements over baselines, achieving >4\% gains in TriviaQA and >2\% in GSM8K with limited training data. Finally, we offer new insights by interpreting synthetic data through the lenses of "relevance" and "novelty".

### A Comparative Study of Learning Paradigms in Large Language Models via   Intrinsic Dimension
**Authors**: Saahith Janapati, Yangfeng Ji

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T06:37:35Z

**Summary**: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on natural language tasks can be improved through both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and in-context learning (ICL), which operate via distinct mechanisms. Supervised fine-tuning updates the model's weights by minimizing loss on training data, whereas in-context learning leverages task demonstrations embedded in the prompt, without changing the model's parameters. This study investigates the effects of these learning paradigms on the hidden representations of LLMs using Intrinsic Dimension (ID). We use ID to estimate the number of degrees of freedom between representations extracted from LLMs as they perform specific natural language tasks. We first explore how the ID of LLM representations evolves during SFT and how it varies due to the number of demonstrations in ICL. We then compare the IDs induced by SFT and ICL and find that ICL consistently induces a higher ID compared to SFT, suggesting that representations generated during ICL reside in higher dimensional manifolds in the embedding space.

**Authors**: Prakash Aryan

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T06:03:48Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces DebateBrawl, an innovative AI-powered debate platform that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Adversarial Search (AS) to create an adaptive and engaging debating experience. DebateBrawl addresses the limitations of traditional LLMs in strategic planning by incorporating evolutionary optimization and game-theoretic techniques. The system demonstrates remarkable performance in generating coherent, contextually relevant arguments while adapting its strategy in real-time. Experimental results involving 23 debates show balanced outcomes between AI and human participants, with the AI system achieving an average score of 2.72 compared to the human average of 2.67 out of 10. User feedback indicates significant improvements in debating skills and a highly satisfactory learning experience, with 85% of users reporting improved debating abilities and 78% finding the AI opponent appropriately challenging. The system's ability to maintain high factual accuracy (92% compared to 78% in human-only debates) while generating diverse arguments addresses critical concerns in AI-assisted discourse. DebateBrawl not only serves as an effective educational tool but also contributes to the broader goal of improving public discourse through AI-assisted argumentation. The paper discusses the ethical implications of AI in persuasive contexts and outlines the measures implemented to ensure responsible development and deployment of the system, including robust fact-checking mechanisms and transparency in decision-making processes.

### Pangea: A Fully Open Multilingual Multimodal LLM for 39 Languages
**Authors**: Xiang Yue, Yueqi Song, Akari Asai, Seungone Kim, Jean de Dieu Nyandwi, Simran Khanuja, Anjali Kantharuban, Lintang Sutawika, Sathyanarayanan Ramamoorthy, Graham Neubig

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T04:47:26Z

**Summary**: Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their development has predominantly focused on English- and western-centric datasets and tasks, leaving most of the world's languages and diverse cultural contexts underrepresented. This paper introduces Pangea, a multilingual multimodal LLM trained on PangeaIns, a diverse 6M instruction dataset spanning 39 languages. PangeaIns features: 1) high-quality English instructions, 2) carefully machine-translated instructions, and 3) culturally relevant multimodal tasks to ensure cross-cultural coverage. To rigorously assess models' capabilities, we introduce PangeaBench, a holistic evaluation suite encompassing 14 datasets covering 47 languages. Results show that Pangea significantly outperforms existing open-source models in multilingual settings and diverse cultural contexts. Ablation studies further reveal the importance of English data proportions, language popularity, and the number of multimodal training samples on overall performance. We fully open-source our data, code, and trained checkpoints, to facilitate the development of inclusive and robust multilingual MLLMs, promoting equity and accessibility across a broader linguistic and cultural spectrum.

### SparseAccelerate: Efficient Long-Context Inference for Mid-Range GPUs
**Authors**: James Vo

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T04:27:03Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to longer context windows, the computational cost of attention mechanisms, which traditionally grows quadratically with input length, presents a critical challenge for real-time and memory-constrained deployments. Existing sparse attention techniques have sought to reduce this complexity, but they often incur significant overhead or compromise accuracy, making them less practical for large contexts on mid-range hardware. In this paper, we introduce SparseAccelerate, a dynamic sparse attention method that adapts its sparsity patterns based on input characteristics, effectively flattening the attention complexity curve. Our approach is effective for input lengths starting at 16K tokens and scales efficiently up to 128K tokens on dual NVIDIA A5000 GPUs (24GB each). Experimental results show that SparseAccelerate achieves up to a 1.04x reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) latency at 32K tokens, while also providing substantial memory savings. These improvements yield practical gains for memory-intensive applications and long-context tasks that were previously infeasible with standard attention. Beyond latency reductions, SparseAccelerate fundamentally shifts the scaling trend, demonstrating the smallest TTFT growth gradient relative to context length among competing methods. Ongoing evaluations on diverse benchmarks confirm its scalability, positioning SparseAccelerate as a critical advancement toward efficient, real-time, and large-context LLM inference on accessible hardware.

### Personalized Language Modeling from Personalized Human Feedback
**Authors**: Xinyu Li, Ruiyang Zhou, Zachary C. Lipton, Liu Leqi

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T04:21:08Z

**Summary**: Personalized large language models (LLMs) are designed to tailor responses to individual user preferences. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a commonly used framework for aligning LLMs with human preferences, vanilla RLHF assumes that all human preferences share the same distribution, preventing fine-tuned LLMs from generating personalized content when user preferences are diverse. In this work, we propose Personalized-RLHF (P-RLHF), an efficient framework that utilizes a lightweight user model to capture individual user preferences and jointly learns the user model and the personalized LLM from human feedback. P-RLHF exhibits the following three characteristics: (1) It enables an LLM to generate personalized content and scale efficiently with growing number of users. (2) It handles both explicit user preferences described as textual input and implicit user preferences encoded in the feedback data. (3) It eliminates the need for users to fully articulate their preferences, which are normally needed for prompting LLMs to generate personalized content yet are often impractical to obtain in real-world scenarios. Our experimental results show that personalized LLMs trained using P-RLHF generate responses that are more closely aligned with individual user preferences, outperforming vanilla, non-personalized RLHF and prompting-based personalization approaches across different tasks. We opensource our code at https://github.com/HumainLab/Personalized_RLHF.

### Category-Adaptive Cross-Modal Semantic Refinement and Transfer for   Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition
**Authors**: Haijing Liu, Tao Pu, Hefeng Wu, Keze Wang, Liang Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T04:00:18Z

**Summary**: Benefiting from the generalization capability of CLIP, recent vision language pre-training (VLP) models have demonstrated an impressive ability to capture virtually any visual concept in daily images. However, due to the presence of unseen categories in open-vocabulary settings, existing algorithms struggle to effectively capture strong semantic correlations between categories, resulting in sub-optimal performance on the open-vocabulary multi-label recognition (OV-MLR). Furthermore, the substantial variation in the number of discriminative areas across diverse object categories is misaligned with the fixed-number patch matching used in current methods, introducing noisy visual cues that hinder the accurate capture of target semantics. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel category-adaptive cross-modal semantic refinement and transfer (C$^2$SRT) framework to explore the semantic correlation both within each category and across different categories, in a category-adaptive manner. The proposed framework consists of two complementary modules, i.e., intra-category semantic refinement (ISR) module and inter-category semantic transfer (IST) module. Specifically, the ISR module leverages the cross-modal knowledge of the VLP model to adaptively find a set of local discriminative regions that best represent the semantics of the target category. The IST module adaptively discovers a set of most correlated categories for a target category by utilizing the commonsense capabilities of LLMs to construct a category-adaptive correlation graph and transfers semantic knowledge from the correlated seen categories to unseen ones. Extensive experiments on OV-MLR benchmarks clearly demonstrate that the proposed C$^2$SRT framework outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms.

### Householder Pseudo-Rotation: A Novel Approach to Activation Editing in   LLMs with Direction-Magnitude Perspective
**Authors**: Van-Cuong Pham, Thien Huu Nguyen

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T03:53:19Z

**Summary**: Activation Editing, which involves directly editting the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) to alter their behaviors and achieve desired properties, has emerged as a promising area of research. Existing works primarily treat LLMs' activations as points in space and modify them by adding steering vectors. However, this approach is limited in its ability to achieve greater performance improvement while maintaining the necessary consistency of activation magnitudes. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel editing method that views activations in terms of their directions and magnitudes. Our method, named Householder Pseudo-Rotation (HPR), mimics the rotation transformation, thus preserving activation norms and resulting in an improved performance on various safety benchmarks.

### Think-on-Graph 2.0: Deep and Faithful Large Language Model Reasoning   with Knowledge-guided Retrieval Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Shengjie Ma, Chengjin Xu, Xuhui Jiang, Muzhi Li, Huaren Qu, Cehao Yang, Jiaxin Mao, Jian Guo

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T03:39:00Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has improved large language models (LLMs) by using knowledge retrieval to overcome knowledge deficiencies. However, current RAG methods often fall short of ensuring the depth and completeness of retrieved information, which is necessary for complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we introduce Think-on-Graph 2.0 (ToG-2), a hybrid RAG framework that iteratively retrieves information from both unstructured and structured knowledge sources in a tight-coupling manner. Specifically, ToG-2 leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to link documents via entities, facilitating deep and knowledge-guided context retrieval. Simultaneously, it utilizes documents as entity contexts to achieve precise and efficient graph retrieval. ToG-2 alternates between graph retrieval and context retrieval to search for in-depth clues relevant to the question, enabling LLMs to generate answers. We conduct a series of well-designed experiments to highlight the following advantages of ToG-2: 1) ToG-2 tightly couples the processes of context retrieval and graph retrieval, deepening context retrieval via the KG while enabling reliable graph retrieval based on contexts; 2) it achieves deep and faithful reasoning in LLMs through an iterative knowledge retrieval process of collaboration between contexts and the KG; and 3) ToG-2 is training-free and plug-and-play compatible with various LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToG-2 achieves overall state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on 6 out of 7 knowledge-intensive datasets with GPT-3.5, and can elevate the performance of smaller models (e.g., LLAMA-2-13B) to the level of GPT-3.5's direct reasoning. The source code is available on https://github.com/IDEA-FinAI/ToG-2.

**Authors**: Bryan Li, Sounak Bagchi, Zizhan Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T03:34:49Z

**Summary**: The increasing integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into society necessitates robust defenses against vulnerabilities from jailbreaking and adversarial prompts. This project proposes a recursive framework for enhancing the resistance of LLMs to manipulation through the use of prompt simplification techniques. By increasing the transparency of complex and confusing adversarial prompts, the proposed method enables more reliable detection and prevention of malicious inputs. Our findings attempt to address a critical problem in AI safety and security, providing a foundation for the development of systems able to distinguish harmless inputs from prompts containing malicious intent. As LLMs continue to be used in diverse applications, the importance of such safeguards will only grow.

### Trustful LLMs: Customizing and Grounding Text Generation with Knowledge   Bases and Dual Decoders
**Authors**: Xiaofeng Zhu, Jaya Krishna Mandivarapu

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T03:25:55Z

**Summary**: Although people are impressed by the content generation skills of large language models, the use of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is limited by the domain grounding of the content. The correctness and groundedness of the generated content need to be based on a verified context, such as results from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). One important issue when adapting LLMs to a customized domain is that the generated responses are often incomplete, or the additions are not verified and may even be hallucinated. Prior studies on hallucination detection have focused on evaluation metrics, which are not easily adaptable to dynamic domains and can be vulnerable to attacks like jail-breaking. In this work, we propose 1) a post-processing algorithm that leverages knowledge triplets in RAG context to correct hallucinations and 2) a dual-decoder model that fuses RAG context to guide the generation process.

### AlphaVerus: Bootstrapping Formally Verified Code Generation through   Self-Improving Translation and Treefinement
**Authors**: Pranjal Aggarwal, Bryan Parno, Sean Welleck

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T03:22:35Z

**Summary**: Automated code generation with large language models has gained significant traction, but there remains no guarantee on the correctness of generated code. We aim to use formal verification to provide mathematical guarantees that the generated code is correct. However, generating formally verified code with LLMs is hindered by the scarcity of training data and the complexity of formal proofs. To tackle this challenge, we introduce AlphaVerus, a self-improving framework that bootstraps formally verified code generation by iteratively translating programs from a higher-resource language and leveraging feedback from a verifier. AlphaVerus operates in three phases: exploration of candidate translations, Treefinement -- a novel tree search algorithm for program refinement using verifier feedback, and filtering misaligned specifications and programs to prevent reward hacking. Through this iterative process, AlphaVerus enables a LLaMA-3.1-70B model to generate verified code without human intervention or model finetuning. AlphaVerus shows an ability to generate formally verified solutions for HumanEval and MBPP, laying the groundwork for truly trustworthy code-generation agents.

### Holmes-VAU: Towards Long-term Video Anomaly Understanding at Any   Granularity
**Authors**: Huaxin Zhang, Xiaohao Xu, Xiang Wang, Jialong Zuo, Xiaonan Huang, Changxin Gao, Shanjun Zhang, Li Yu, Nong Sang

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T03:05:34Z

**Summary**: How can we enable models to comprehend video anomalies occurring over varying temporal scales and contexts? Traditional Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) methods focus on frame-level anomaly prediction, often missing the interpretability of complex and diverse real-world anomalies. Recent multimodal approaches leverage visual and textual data but lack hierarchical annotations that capture both short-term and long-term anomalies. To address this challenge, we introduce HIVAU-70k, a large-scale benchmark for hierarchical video anomaly understanding across any granularity. We develop a semi-automated annotation engine that efficiently scales high-quality annotations by combining manual video segmentation with recursive free-text annotation using large language models (LLMs). This results in over 70,000 multi-granular annotations organized at clip-level, event-level, and video-level segments. For efficient anomaly detection in long videos, we propose the Anomaly-focused Temporal Sampler (ATS). ATS integrates an anomaly scorer with a density-aware sampler to adaptively select frames based on anomaly scores, ensuring that the multimodal LLM concentrates on anomaly-rich regions, which significantly enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our hierarchical instruction data markedly improves anomaly comprehension. The integrated ATS and visual-language model outperform traditional methods in processing long videos. Our benchmark and model are publicly available at https://github.com/pipixin321/HolmesVAU.

### Out-of-Distribution Detection with Overlap Index
**Authors**: Hao Fu, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Siddharth Garg, Farshad Khorrami

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T03:01:47Z

**Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the deployment of machine learning models in the open world. While existing OOD detectors are effective in identifying OOD samples that deviate significantly from in-distribution (ID) data, they often come with trade-offs. For instance, deep OOD detectors usually suffer from high computational costs, require tuning hyperparameters, and have limited interpretability, whereas traditional OOD detectors may have a low accuracy on large high-dimensional datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel effective OOD detection approach that employs an overlap index (OI)-based confidence score function to evaluate the likelihood of a given input belonging to the same distribution as the available ID samples. The proposed OI-based confidence score function is non-parametric, lightweight, and easy to interpret, hence providing strong flexibility and generality. Extensive empirical evaluations indicate that our OI-based OOD detector is competitive with state-of-the-art OOD detectors in terms of detection accuracy on a wide range of datasets while requiring less computation and memory costs. Lastly, we show that the proposed OI-based confidence score function inherits nice properties from OI (e.g., insensitivity to small distributional variations and robustness against Huber $\epsilon$-contamination) and is a versatile tool for estimating OI and model accuracy in specific contexts.

**Authors**: Henry W. Sprueill, Carl Edwards, Khushbu Agarwal, Mariefel V. Olarte, Udishnu Sanyal, Conrad Johnston, Hongbin Liu, Heng Ji, Sutanay Choudhury

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T03:01:35Z

**Summary**: The discovery of new catalysts is essential for the design of new and more efficient chemical processes in order to transition to a sustainable future. We introduce an AI-guided computational screening framework unifying linguistic reasoning with quantum-chemistry based feedback from 3D atomistic representations. Our approach formulates catalyst discovery as an uncertain environment where an agent actively searches for highly effective catalysts via the iterative combination of large language model (LLM)-derived hypotheses and atomistic graph neural network (GNN)-derived feedback. Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and reaction energy barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts. We introduce planning methods that automatically guide the exploration without human input, providing competitive performance against expert-enumerated chemical descriptor-based implementations. By integrating language-guided reasoning with computational chemistry feedback, our work pioneers AI-accelerated, trustworthy catalyst discovery.

### Query-Efficient Planning with Language Models
**Authors**: Gonzalo Gonzalez-Pumariega, Wayne Chen, Kushal Kedia, Sanjiban Choudhury

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T02:51:21Z

**Summary**: Planning in complex environments requires an agent to efficiently query a world model to find a feasible sequence of actions from start to goal. Recent work has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their rich prior knowledge and reasoning capabilities, can potentially help with planning by searching over promising states and adapting to feedback from the world. In this paper, we propose and study two fundamentally competing frameworks that leverage LLMs for query-efficient planning. The first uses LLMs as a heuristic within a search-based planner to select promising nodes to expand and propose promising actions. The second uses LLMs as a generative planner to propose an entire sequence of actions from start to goal, query a world model, and adapt based on feedback. We show that while both approaches improve upon comparable baselines, using an LLM as a generative planner results in significantly fewer interactions. Our key finding is that the LLM as a planner can more rapidly adapt its planning strategies based on immediate feedback than LLM as a heuristic. We present evaluations and ablations on Robotouille and PDDL planning benchmarks and discuss connections to existing theory on query-efficient planning algorithms.

### Hybrid RAG-empowered Multi-modal LLM for Secure Data Management in   Internet of Medical Things: A Diffusion-based Contract Approach
**Authors**: Cheng Su, Jinbo Wen, Jiawen Kang, Yonghua Wang, Yuanjia Su, Hudan Pan, Zishao Zhong, M. Shamim Hossain

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T02:28:01Z

**Summary**: Secure data management and effective data sharing have become paramount in the rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, especially with the growing integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The rise of generative artificial intelligence has further elevated Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as essential tools for managing and optimizing healthcare data in IoMT. MLLMs can support multi-modal inputs and generate diverse types of content by leveraging large-scale training on vast amounts of multi-modal data. However, critical challenges persist in developing medical MLLMs, including security and freshness issues of healthcare data, affecting the output quality of MLLMs. To this end, in this paper, we propose a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-empowered medical MLLM framework for healthcare data management. This framework leverages a hierarchical cross-chain architecture to facilitate secure data training. Moreover, it enhances the output quality of MLLMs through hybrid RAG, which employs multi-modal metrics to filter various unimodal RAG results and incorporates these retrieval results as additional inputs to MLLMs. Additionally, we employ age of information to indirectly evaluate the data freshness impact of MLLMs and utilize contract theory to incentivize healthcare data holders to share their fresh data, mitigating information asymmetry during data sharing. Finally, we utilize a generative diffusion model-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the optimal contract for efficient data sharing. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes, which achieve secure and efficient healthcare data management.

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T02:14:08Z

**Summary**: With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), medical artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced substantial technological progress and paradigm shifts, highlighting the potential of LLMs to streamline healthcare delivery and improve patient outcomes. Considering this rapid technical progress, in this survey, we trace the recent advances of Medical Large Language Models (Med-LLMs), including the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques, especially for the evolution from general-purpose models to medical-specialized applications. Firstly, we delve into the foundational technology of Med-LLMs, indicating how general models can be progressively adapted and refined for the complicated medical tasks.

Recognizing the importance of responsible innovation, we discuss the challenges associated with ensuring fairness, accountability, privacy, and robustness. Ethical considerations, rigorous evaluation methodologies, and the establishment of regulatory frameworks are crucial for building trustworthiness in the real-world system. We emphasize the need for ongoing scrutiny and development to maintain high standards of safety and reliability. Finally, we anticipate possible future trajectories for Med-LLMs, identifying key avenues for prudent expansion. By consolidating these insights, our review aims to provide professionals and researchers with a thorough understanding of the strengths and limitations of Med-LLMs, fostering a balanced and ethical approach to their integration into the healthcare ecosystem.

### AgentAlign: Misalignment-Adapted Multi-Agent Perception for Resilient   Inter-Agent Sensor Correlations
**Authors**: Zonglin Meng, Yun Zhang, Zhaoliang Zheng, Zhihao Zhao, Jiaqi Ma

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T01:51:18Z

**Summary**: Cooperative perception has attracted wide attention given its capability to leverage shared information across connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and smart infrastructures to address sensing occlusion and range limitation issues. However, existing research overlooks the fragile multi-sensor correlations in multi-agent settings, as the heterogeneous agent sensor measurements are highly susceptible to environmental factors, leading to weakened inter-agent sensor interactions. The varying operational conditions and other real-world factors inevitably introduce multifactorial noise and consequentially lead to multi-sensor misalignment, making the deployment of multi-agent multi-modality perception particularly challenging in the real world. In this paper, we propose AgentAlign, a real-world heterogeneous agent cross-modality feature alignment framework, to effectively address these multi-modality misalignment issues. Our method introduces a cross-modality feature alignment space (CFAS) and heterogeneous agent feature alignment (HAFA) mechanism to harmonize multi-modality features across various agents dynamically. Additionally, we present a novel V2XSet-noise dataset that simulates realistic sensor imperfections under diverse environmental conditions, facilitating a systematic evaluation of our approach's robustness. Extensive experiments on the V2X-Real and V2XSet-Noise benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its potential for real-world applications in cooperative autonomous driving. The controllable V2XSet-Noise dataset and generation pipeline will be released in the future.

### MMedPO: Aligning Medical Vision-Language Models with Clinical-Aware   Multimodal Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Kangyu Zhu, Peng Xia, Yun Li, Hongtu Zhu, Sheng Wang, Huaxiu Yao

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T01:50:39Z

**Summary**: The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has propelled their application in the medical field. However, Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) encounter factuality challenges due to modality misalignment, where the models prioritize textual knowledge over visual input, leading to hallucinations that contradict information in medical images. Previous attempts to enhance modality alignment in Med-LVLMs through preference optimization have inadequately mitigated clinical relevance in preference data, making these samples easily distinguishable and reducing alignment effectiveness. To address this challenge, we propose MMedPO, a novel multimodal medical preference optimization approach that considers the clinical relevance of preference samples to enhance Med-LVLM alignment. MMedPO curates multimodal preference data by introducing two types of dispreference: (1) plausible hallucinations injected through target Med-LVLMs or GPT-4o to produce medically inaccurate responses, and (2) lesion region neglect achieved through local lesion-noising, disrupting visual understanding of critical areas. We then calculate clinical relevance for each sample based on scores from multiple Med-LLMs and visual tools, and integrate these scores into the preference optimization process as weights, enabling effective alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that MMedPO significantly enhances factual accuracy in Med-LVLMs, achieving substantial improvements over existing preference optimization methods by averaging 14.2% and 51.7% across the Med-VQA and report generation tasks. Our code are available in https://github.com/aiming-lab/MMedPO.

### GPT Semantic Cache: Reducing LLM Costs and Latency via Semantic   Embedding Caching
**Authors**: Sajal Regmi, Chetan Phakami Pun

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T01:44:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling nuanced understanding and generation of human-like text across a wide range of applications. However, the high computational and financial costs associated with frequent API calls to these models present a substantial bottleneck, especially for applications like customer service chatbots that handle repetitive queries. In this paper, we introduce GPT Semantic Cache, a method that leverages semantic caching of query embeddings in in-memory storage (Redis). By storing embeddings of user queries, our approach efficiently identifies semantically similar questions, allowing for the retrieval of pre-generated responses without redundant API calls to the LLM. This technique achieves a notable reduction in operational costs while significantly enhancing response times, making it a robust solution for optimizing LLM-powered applications. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT Semantic Cache reduces API calls by up to 68.8% across various query categories, with cache hit rates ranging from 61.6% to 68.8%. Additionally, the system achieves high accuracy, with positive hit rates exceeding 97%, confirming the reliability of cached responses. This technique not only reduces operational costs, but also improves response times, enhancing the efficiency of LLM-powered applications.

### AIDE: Task-Specific Fine Tuning with Attribute Guided Multi-Hop Data   Expansion
**Authors**: Jiayu Li, Xuan Zhu, Fang Liu, Yanjun Qi

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T01:39:16Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks requires high-quality, diverse training data relevant to the task. Recent research has leveraged LLMs to synthesize training data, but existing approaches either depend on large seed datasets or struggle to ensure both task relevance and data diversity in the generated outputs. To address these challenges, we propose AIDE, a novel data synthesis framework that uses a multi-hop process to expand 10 seed data points while ensuring diversity and task relevance. AIDE extracts the main topic and key knowledge attributes from the seed data to guide the synthesis process. In each subsequent hop, it extracts the topic and attributes from the newly generated data and continues guided synthesis. This process repeats for a total of K hops. To prevent irrelevant data generation as the hop depth increases, AIDE incorporates a residual connection mechanism and uses self-reflection to improve data quality. Our empirical results demonstrate that fine-tuning Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B and Llama-3.2-3B with AIDE achieves more than 10% accuracy improvements over the base models across 13 tasks from 5 different benchmarks, while outperforming the models fine-tuned with state-of-the-art data synthesis methods like Evol-Instruct, DataTune and Prompt2Model.

### Evaluating and Mitigating Social Bias for Large Language Models in   Open-ended Settings
**Authors**: Zhao Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T01:29:47Z

**Summary**: Current social bias benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily rely on pre-defined question formats like multiple-choice, limiting their ability to reflect the complexity and open-ended nature of real-world interactions. To address this gap, we extend an existing BBQ dataset introduced by incorporating fill-in-the-blank and short-answer question types, designed to evaluate biases in an open-ended setting. Our finding reveals that LLMs tend to produce responses that are more biased against certain protected attributes, like age and socio-economic status. On the other hand, these biased outputs produced by LLMs can serve as valuable contexts and chains of thought for debiasing. Our debiasing approach combined zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought could significantly reduce the level of bias to almost 0. We open-source our evaluation and debiasing code hoping to encourage further measurements and mitigation of bias and stereotype in LLMs.

### Privacy-Preserving Large Language Models: Mechanisms, Applications, and   Future Directions
**Authors**: Guoshenghui Zhao, Eric Song

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T00:24:09Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, enabling applications in diverse domains such as healthcare, finance and education. However, the growing reliance on extensive data for training and inference has raised significant privacy concerns, ranging from data leakage to adversarial attacks. This survey comprehensively explores the landscape of privacy-preserving mechanisms tailored for LLMs, including differential privacy, federated learning, cryptographic protocols, and trusted execution environments. We examine their efficacy in addressing key privacy challenges, such as membership inference and model inversion attacks, while balancing trade-offs between privacy and model utility. Furthermore, we analyze privacy-preserving applications of LLMs in privacy-sensitive domains, highlighting successful implementations and inherent limitations. Finally, this survey identifies emerging research directions, emphasizing the need for novel frameworks that integrate privacy by design into the lifecycle of LLMs. By synthesizing state-of-the-art approaches and future trends, this paper provides a foundation for developing robust, privacy-preserving large language models that safeguard sensitive information without compromising performance.

### Enhanced Computationally Efficient Long LoRA Inspired Perceiver   Architectures for Auto-Regressive Language Modeling
**Authors**: Kaleel Mahmood, Shaoyi Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-08T23:41:38Z

**Summary**: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized the Natural Language Processing field and is the backbone of Large Language Models (LLMs). The Transformer uses the attention mechanism that computes the pair-wise similarity between its input tokens to produce latent vectors that are able to understand the semantic meaning of the input text. One of the challenges in the Transformer architecture is the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism that prohibits the efficient processing of long sequence lengths. While many recent research works have attempted to provide a reduction from $O(n^2)$ time complexity of attention to semi-linear complexity, it remains an unsolved problem in the sense of maintaining a high performance when such complexity is reduced. One of the important works in this respect is the Perceiver class of architectures that have demonstrated excellent performance while reducing the computation complexity. In this paper, we use the PerceiverAR that was proposed for Auto-Regressive modeling as a baseline, and provide three different architectural enhancements to it with varying computation overhead tradeoffs. Inspired by the recently proposed efficient attention computation approach of Long-LoRA, we then present an equally efficient Perceiver-based architecture (termed as Long LoRA Pereceiver - LLP) that can be used as the base architecture in LLMs instead of just a fine-tuning add-on. Our results on different benchmarks indicate impressive improvements compared to recent Transformer based models.

### Trust No AI: Prompt Injection Along The CIA Security Triad
**Authors**: Johann Rehberger

**Updated**: 2024-12-08T22:46:30Z

**Summary**: The CIA security triad - Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability - is a cornerstone of data and cybersecurity. With the emergence of large language model (LLM) applications, a new class of threat, known as prompt injection, was first identified in 2022. Since then, numerous real-world vulnerabilities and exploits have been documented in production LLM systems, including those from leading vendors like OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic and Google. This paper compiles real-world exploits and proof-of concept examples, based on the research conducted and publicly documented by the author, demonstrating how prompt injection undermines the CIA triad and poses ongoing risks to cybersecurity and AI systems at large.

**Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen significant progress with diffusion models, enabling generation of photo-realistic images from text prompts. Despite this progress, existing methods still face challenges in following complex text prompts, especially those requiring compositional and multi-step reasoning. Given such complex instructions, SOTA models often make mistakes in faithfully modeling object attributes, and relationships among them. In this work, we present an alternate paradigm for T2I synthesis, decomposing the task of complex multi-step generation into three steps, (a) Generate: we first generate an image using existing diffusion models (b) Plan: we make use of Multi-Modal LLMs (MLLMs) to identify the mistakes in the generated image expressed in terms of individual objects and their properties, and produce a sequence of corrective steps required in the form of an edit-plan. (c) Edit: we make use of an existing text-guided image editing models to sequentially execute our edit-plan over the generated image to get the desired image which is faithful to the original instruction. Our approach derives its strength from the fact that it is modular in nature, is training free, and can be applied over any combination of image generation and editing models. As an added contribution, we also develop a model capable of compositional editing, which further helps improve the overall accuracy of our proposed approach. Our method flexibly trades inference time compute with performance on compositional text prompts. We perform extensive experimental evaluation across 3 benchmarks and 10 T2I models including DALLE-3 and the latest -- SD-3.5-Large. Our approach not only improves the performance of the SOTA models, by upto 3 points, it also reduces the performance gap between weaker and stronger models. $\href{https://dair-iitd.github.io/GraPE/}{https://dair-iitd.github.io/GraPE/}$

**Summary**: Recent advances in self-supervision and constrastive learning have brought the performance of foundation models to unprecedented levels in a variety of tasks. Fueled by this progress, these models are becoming the prevailing approach for a wide array of real-world vision problems, including risk-sensitive and high-stakes applications. However, ensuring safe deployment in these scenarios requires a more comprehensive understanding of their uncertainty modeling capabilities, which has been barely explored. In this work, we delve into the behavior of vision and vision-language foundation models under Conformal Prediction (CP), a statistical framework that provides theoretical guarantees of marginal coverage of the true class. Across extensive experiments including popular vision classification benchmarks, well-known foundation vision models, and three CP methods, our findings reveal that foundation models are well-suited for conformalization procedures, particularly those integrating Vision Transformers. Furthermore, we show that calibrating the confidence predictions of these models leads to efficiency degradation of the conformal set on adaptive CP methods. In contrast, few-shot adaptation to downstream tasks generally enhances conformal scores, where we identify Adapters as a better conformable alternative compared to Prompt Learning strategies. Our empirical study identifies APS as particularly promising in the context of vision foundation models, as it does not violate the marginal coverage property across multiple challenging, yet realistic scenarios.
