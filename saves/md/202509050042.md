 ### CloudFormer: An Attention-based Performance Prediction for Public Clouds   with Unknown Workload
**Authors**: Amirhossein Shahbazinia, Darong Huang, Luis Costero, David Atienza

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:15:44Z

**Summary**: Cloud platforms are increasingly relied upon to host diverse, resource-intensive workloads due to their scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. In multi-tenant cloud environments, virtual machines are consolidated on shared physical servers to improve resource utilization. While virtualization guarantees resource partitioning for CPU, memory, and storage, it cannot ensure performance isolation. Competition for shared resources such as last-level cache, memory bandwidth, and network interfaces often leads to severe performance degradation. Existing management techniques, including VM scheduling and resource provisioning, require accurate performance prediction to mitigate interference. However, this remains challenging in public clouds due to the black-box nature of VMs and the highly dynamic nature of workloads. To address these limitations, we propose CloudFormer, a dual-branch Transformer-based model designed to predict VM performance degradation in black-box environments. CloudFormer jointly models temporal dynamics and system-level interactions, leveraging 206 system metrics at one-second resolution across both static and dynamic scenarios. This design enables the model to capture transient interference effects and adapt to varying workload conditions without scenario-specific tuning. Complementing the methodology, we provide a fine-grained dataset that significantly expands the temporal resolution and metric diversity compared to existing benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that CloudFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving robust generalization across diverse and previously unseen workloads. Notably, CloudFormer attains a mean absolute error (MAE) of just 7.8%, representing a substantial improvement in predictive accuracy and outperforming existing methods at least by 28%.

**Authors**: Ruoyu Qin, Zheming Li, Weiran He, Mingxing Zhang, Yongwei Wu, Weimin Zheng, Xinran Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:56:29Z

**Summary**: Mooncake is the serving platform for Kimi, a leading LLM service provided by Moonshot AI. It features a KVCache-centric disaggregated architecture that separates the prefill and decoding clusters. It also leverages the underutilized CPU, DRAM, and SSD resources of the GPU cluster to implement a disaggregated cache of KVCache. The core of Mooncake is its KVCache-centric scheduler, which balances maximizing overall effective throughput while meeting latency-related Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Unlike traditional studies that assume all requests will be processed, Mooncake faces challenges due to highly overloaded scenarios. To mitigate these, we developed a prediction-based early rejection policy. Experiments show that Mooncake excels in long-context scenarios. Compared to the baseline method, Mooncake can achieve up to a 525% increase in throughput in certain simulated scenarios while adhering to SLOs. Under real workloads, Mooncake's innovative architecture enables Kimi to handle 75% more requests.

**Authors**: Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Linsen Ma, Yunhua Fang, Zirak Burzin Engineer, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:53:45Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) inference is bottlenecked by the limited bandwidth of CXL-based memory used for capacity expansion. We introduce CXL-NDP, a transparent near-data processing architecture that amplifies effective CXL bandwidth without requiring changes to the CXL.mem interface or AI models. CXL-NDP integrates a precision-scalable bit-plane layout for dynamic quantization with transparent lossless compression of weights and KV caches directly within the CXL device. In end-to-end serving, CXL-NDP improves throughput by 43%, extends the maximum context length by 87%, and reduces the KV cache footprint by 46.9% without accuracy loss. Hardware synthesis confirms its practicality with a modest silicon footprint, lowering the barrier for adopting efficient, scalable CXL-based memory in generative AI infrastructure.

### RAT: Bridging RNN Efficiency and Attention Accuracy via Chunk-based   Sequence Modeling
**Authors**: Xiuying Wei, Anunay Yadav, Razvan Pascanu, Caglar Gulcehre

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:28:23Z

**Summary**: Transformers have become the cornerstone of modern large-scale language models, but their reliance on softmax attention poses a computational bottleneck at both training and inference. Recurrent models offer high efficiency, but compressing the full sequence into a fixed-size and holistic representation suffers from memory degradation in long contexts and limits fine-grained retrieval. To address this, we propose RAT, an intermediate design that bridges the efficiency of RNNs and capacity of attention. RAT partitions the input into chunks, applies recurrence within each chunk for local dependencies, and softmax-based attention across chunks for long-range interactions. This design mitigates memory degradation and enables direct access to distant tokens, while retaining computational efficiency. Empirically, with a chunk size of 16, the RAT block achieves a 7x improvement in training speed with 100K token sequences and 9x in generation at the 4K position, while maintaining similar performance compared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter models from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short- and long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We further propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves RAT with local attention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local interactions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces cache memory usage, but also consistently enhances performance and shows the overall best results. Code is available at https://github.com/CLAIRE-Labo/RAT.

### Adaptive KV-Cache Compression without Manually Setting Budget
**Authors**: Chenxia Tang, Jianchun Liu, Hongli Xu, Liusheng Huang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:38:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) inference relies heavily on KV-caches to accelerate autoregressive decoding, but the resulting memory footprint grows rapidly with sequence length, posing significant efficiency challenges. Current KV-cache compression methods suffer from a Procrustes' bed problem: they force diverse workloads into fixed compression ratios, leading to suboptimal resource allocation and inference performance. To this end, we present GVote, an adaptive KV-cache compression scheme that eliminates manual budget specification while achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. GVote operates on the principle that the important keys are the aggregation of keys required by future queries. The method predicts future query attention demands by Monte-Carlo style sampling potential queries and aggregating selected keys to determine the optimal cache budget without manual specification. Experimental evaluation demonstrates GVote's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks, including GSM8K, RULER and Longbench. Compared to baselines, GVote exhibits 2$\times$ memory reduction while the accuracy maintains higher or comparable.

### FastCache: Fast Caching for Diffusion Transformer Through Learnable   Linear Approximation
**Authors**: Dong Liu, Yanxuan Yu, Jiayi Zhang, Yifan Li, Ben Lengerich, Ying Nian Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T06:56:21Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) are powerful generative models but remain computationally intensive due to their iterative structure and deep transformer stacks. To alleviate this inefficiency, we propose FastCache, a hidden-state-level caching and compression framework that accelerates DiT inference by exploiting redundancy within the model's internal representations. FastCache introduces a dual strategy: (1) a spatial-aware token selection mechanism that adaptively filters redundant tokens based on hidden state saliency, and (2) a transformer-level cache that reuses latent activations across timesteps when changes are statistically insignificant. These modules work jointly to reduce unnecessary computation while preserving generation fidelity through learnable linear approximation. Theoretical analysis shows that FastCache maintains bounded approximation error under a hypothesis-testing-based decision rule. Empirical evaluations across multiple DiT variants demonstrate substantial reductions in latency and memory usage, with best generation output quality compared to other cache methods, as measured by FID and t-FID. Code implementation of FastCache is available on GitHub at https://github.com/NoakLiu/FastCache-xDiT.

**Authors**: Zifan Zhang, Zhiyuan Peng, Hanzhi Yu, Mingzhe Chen, Yuchen Liu

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T18:10:00Z

**Summary**: Digital network twins (DNTs), by representing a physical network using a virtual model, offer significant benefits such as streamlined network development, enhanced productivity, and cost reduction for next-generation (nextG) communication infrastructure. Existing works mainly describe the deployment of DNT technologies in various service sections.The full life cycle of DNTs for telecommunication has not yet been comprehensively studied, particularly in the aspects of fine-grained creation, real-time adaptation, resource-efficient deployment, and security protection. This article presents an in-depth overview of DNTs, exploring their concrete integration into networks and communication, covering the fundamental designs, the emergent applications, and critical challenges in multiple dimensions. We also include two detailed case studies to illustrate how DNTs can be applied in real-world scenarios such as wireless traffic forecasting and edge caching. Additionally, a forward-looking vision of the research opportunities in tackling the challenges of DNTs is provided, aiming to fully maximize the benefits of DNTs in nextG networks.

### A Novel Coded Caching Scheme for Partially Cooperative Device-to-Device   Networks
**Authors**: Rashid Ummer N. T., K. K. Krishnan Namboodiri, B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T17:35:42Z

**Summary**: Device-to-device (D2D) communication is one of the most promising techniques for future wireless cellular communication systems. This paper considers coded caching in a partially cooperative wireless D2D network, where only a subset of users transmit during delivery, while all users request files. The non-transmitting users are referred to as selfish users. All existing schemes that do not require knowledge of the identity of selfish users before content placement are limited to the high-memory regime, particularly when the number of selfish users is large. We propose a novel coded caching scheme for a partially cooperative D2D network that operates in all feasible memory regimes, regardless of the number of selfish users. We also derive a lower bound on the transmission load of a partially cooperative D2D coded caching scheme. Using this bound, the proposed scheme is shown to be optimal in the high-memory regime.

### REPS: Recycled Entropy Packet Spraying for Adaptive Load Balancing and   Failure Mitigation
**Authors**: Tommaso Bonato, Abdul Kabbani, Ahmad Ghalayini, Michael Papamichael, Mohammad Dohadwala, Lukas Gianinazzi, Mikhail Khalilov, Elias Achermann, Daniele De Sensi, Torsten Hoefler

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T16:39:56Z

**Summary**: Next-generation datacenters require highly efficient network load balancing to manage the growing scale of artificial intelligence (AI) training and general datacenter traffic. However, existing Ethernet-based solutions, such as Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) and oblivious packet spraying (OPS), struggle to maintain high network utilization due to both increasing traffic demands and the expanding scale of datacenter topologies, which also exacerbate network failures. To address these limitations, we propose REPS, a lightweight decentralized per-packet adaptive load balancing algorithm designed to optimize network utilization while ensuring rapid recovery from link failures. REPS adapts to network conditions by caching good-performing paths. In case of a network failure, REPS re-routes traffic away from it in less than 100 microseconds. REPS is designed to be deployed with next-generation out-of-order transports, such as Ultra Ethernet, and uses less than 25 bytes of per-connection state regardless of the topology size. We extensively evaluate REPS in large-scale simulations and FPGA-based NICs.

### MLP-Offload: Multi-Level, Multi-Path Offloading for LLM Pre-training to   Break the GPU Memory Wall
**Authors**: Avinash Maurya, M. Mustafa Rafique, Franck Cappello, Bogdan Nicolae

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T16:30:49Z

**Summary**: Training LLMs larger than the aggregated memory of multiple GPUs is increasingly necessary due to the faster growth of LLM sizes compared to GPU memory. To this end, multi-tier host memory or disk offloading techniques are proposed by state of art. Despite advanced asynchronous multi-tier read/write strategies, such offloading strategies result in significant I/O overheads in the critical path of training, resulting in slower iterations. To this end, we propose MLP-Offload, a novel multi-level, multi-path offloading engine specifically designed for optimizing LLM training on resource-constrained setups by mitigating I/O bottlenecks. We make several key observations that drive the design of MLP-Offload, such as I/O overheads during the update dominate the iteration time; I/O bandwidth of the third-level remote storage tier remains unutilized; and, contention due to concurrent offloading amplifies I/O bottlenecks. Driven by these insights, we design and implement MLP-Offload to offload the optimizer states across multiple tiers in a cache-efficient and concurrency-controlled fashion to mitigate I/O bottlenecks during the backward and update phases. Evaluations on models up to 280B parameters shows that MLP-Offload achieves 2.5$\times$ faster iterations compared to the state-of-the-art LLM training runtimes.

### Cache Management for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs -- extended version
**Authors**: Spyros Angelopoulos, Loris Marchal, Adrien Obrecht, Bertrand Simon

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T15:19:06Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a variety of tasks. One of the main challenges towards the successful deployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions of parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been proposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated when producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently managing the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts should be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.   In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert management optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture of LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first present lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and randomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like policies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a layer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.   Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE usage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging problem, such as the standard LRU.

### Leveraging Approximate Caching for Faster Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Shai Bergman, Zhang Ji, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Diana Petrescu, Rafael Pires, Mathis Randl, Martijn de Vos

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T13:09:37Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves the reliability of large language model (LLM) answers by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG increases the end-to-end inference time since looking for relevant documents from large vector databases is computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce Proximity, an approximate key-value cache that optimizes the RAG workflow by leveraging similarities in user queries. Instead of treating each query independently, Proximity reuses previously retrieved documents when similar queries appear, substantially reducing reliance on expensive vector database lookups. To scale efficiently, Proximity employs a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme that enables fast cache lookups while preserving retrieval accuracy. We evaluate Proximity using the MMLU and MedRAG question answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Proximity with our LSH scheme and a realistically skewed MedRAG workload reduces database calls by 78.9% while maintaining database recall and test accuracy. We experiment with different similarity tolerances and cache capacities, and show that the time spent within the Proximity cache remains low and constant (4.8 microseconds) even as the cache grows substantially in size. Our work highlights that approximate caching is a viable and effective strategy for optimizing RAG-based systems.

### Efficient Geometry Compression and Communication for 3D Gaussian   Splatting Point Clouds
**Authors**: Liang Xie, Yanting Li, Luyang Tang, Wei Gao

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T11:58:06Z

**Summary**: Storage and transmission challenges in dynamic 3D scene representation based on the i3DV platform, With increasing scene complexity, the explosive growth of 3D Gaussian data volume causes excessive storage space occupancy. To address this issue, we propose adopting the AVS PCRM reference software for efficient compression of Gaussian point cloud geometry data. The strategy deeply integrates the advanced encoding capabilities of AVS PCRM into the i3DV platform, forming technical complementarity with the original rate-distortion optimization mechanism based on binary hash tables. On one hand, the hash table efficiently caches inter-frame Gaussian point transformation relationships, which allows for high-fidelity transmission within a 40 Mbps bandwidth constraint. On the other hand, AVS PCRM performs precise compression on geometry data. Experimental results demonstrate that the joint framework maintains the advantages of fast rendering and high-quality synthesis in 3D Gaussian technology while achieving significant 10\%-25\% bitrate savings on universal test sets. It provides a superior rate-distortion tradeoff solution for the storage, transmission, and interaction of 3D volumetric video.

### SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache   Channel Pruning
**Authors**: Huanxuan Liao, Yixing Xu, Shizhu He, Guanchen Li, Xuanwu Yin, Dong Li, Emad Barsoum, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T11:29:34Z

**Summary**: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

### Batch Query Processing and Optimization for Agentic Workflows
**Authors**: Junyi Shen, Noppanat Wadlom, Yao Lu

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T09:17:40Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic workflows combine multi-step reasoning, tool use, and collaboration across multiple specialized agents. Existing LLM serving engines optimize individual calls in isolation, while multi-agent frameworks focus on orchestration without system-level performance planning. As a result, repeated prompts, overlapping contexts, and concurrent executions create substantial redundancy and poor GPU utilization, especially in batch analytics scenarios. We introduce Halo, a system that brings batch query processing and optimization into agentic LLM workflows. Halo represents each workflow as a structured query plan DAG and constructs a consolidated graph for batched queries that exposes shared computation. Guided by a cost model that jointly considers prefill and decode costs, cache reuse, and GPU placement, Halo performs plan-level optimization to minimize redundant execution. Its runtime integrates adaptive batching, KV-cache sharing and migration, along with compute-communication overlap to maximize hardware efficiency. Evaluation across six benchmarks shows that Halo achieves up to 18.6x speedup for batch inference and 4.7x throughput improvement under online serving, scaling to workloads of tens of thousands of queries and complex graphs. These gains are achieved without compromising output quality. By unifying query optimization with LLM serving, Halo enables efficient agentic workflows in data analytics and decision-making applications.

### Augmented Shuffle Differential Privacy Protocols for Large-Domain   Categorical and Key-Value Data
**Authors**: Takao Murakami, Yuichi Sei, Reo Eriguchi

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T06:40:45Z

**Summary**: Shuffle DP (Differential Privacy) protocols provide high accuracy and privacy by introducing a shuffler who randomly shuffles data in a distributed system. However, most shuffle DP protocols are vulnerable to two attacks: collusion attacks by the data collector and users and data poisoning attacks. A recent study addresses this issue by introducing an augmented shuffle DP protocol, where users do not add noise and the shuffler performs random sampling and dummy data addition. However, it focuses on frequency estimation over categorical data with a small domain and cannot be applied to a large domain due to prohibitively high communication and computational costs.   In this paper, we fill this gap by introducing a novel augmented shuffle DP protocol called the FME (Filtering-with-Multiple-Encryption) protocol. Our FME protocol uses a hash function to filter out unpopular items and then accurately calculates frequencies for popular items. To perform this within one round of interaction between users and the shuffler, our protocol carefully communicates within a system using multiple encryption. We also apply our FME protocol to more advanced KV (Key-Value) statistics estimation with an additional technique to reduce bias. For both categorical and KV data, we prove that our protocol provides computational DP, high robustness to the above two attacks, accuracy, and efficiency. We show the effectiveness of our proposals through comparisons with twelve existing protocols.

### BOLT: Bandwidth-Optimized Lightning-Fast Oblivious Map powered by Secure   HBM Accelerators
**Authors**: Yitong Guo, Hongbo Chen, Haobin Hiroki Chen, Yukui Luo, XiaoFeng Wang, Chenghong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-01T19:49:21Z

**Summary**: While Trusted Execution Environments provide a strong foundation for secure cloud computing, they remain vulnerable to access pattern leakages. Oblivious Maps (OMAPs) mitigate this by fully hiding access patterns but suffer from high overhead due to randomized remapping and worst-case padding. We argue these costs are not fundamental. Modern accelerators featuring High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) offer a new opportunity: Vaswani et al. [OSDI'18] point out that eavesdropping on HBM is difficult -- even for physical attackers -- as its memory channels are sealed together with processor cores inside the same physical package. Later, Hunt et al. [NSDI'20] show that, with proper isolation, HBM can be turned into an unobservable region where both data and memory traces are hidden. This motivates a rethink of OMAP design with HBM-backed solutions to finally overcome their traditional performance limits. Building on these insights, we present BOLT, a Bandwidth Optimized, Lightning-fast OMAP accelerator that, for the first time, achieves O(1) + O((log log N)^2) bandwidth overhead. BOLT introduces three key innovations: (i) a new OMAP algorithm that leverages isolated HBM as an unobservable cache to accelerate oblivious access to large host memory; (ii) a self-hosted architecture that offloads execution and memory control from the host to mitigate CPU-side leakage; and (iii) tailored algorithm-architecture co-designs that maximize resource efficiency. We implement a prototype BOLT on a Xilinx U55C FPGA. Evaluations show that BOLT achieves up to 279x and 480x speedups in initialization and query time, respectively, over state-of-the-art OMAPs, including an industry implementation from Facebook.

### LLMs cannot spot math errors, even when allowed to peek into the   solution
**Authors**: KV Aditya Srivatsa, Kaushal Kumar Maurya, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2025-09-01T11:41:10Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on math word problems, yet they have been shown to struggle with meta-reasoning tasks such as identifying errors in student solutions. In this work, we investigate the challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution, aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve performance.

### Rotate, Clip, and Partition: Towards W2A4KV4 Quantization by Integrating   Rotation and Learnable Non-uniform Quantizer
**Authors**: Euntae Choi, Sumin Song, Woosang Lim, Sungjoo Yoo

**Updated**: 2025-09-01T07:26:57Z

**Summary**: We propose Rotate, Clip, and Partition (RCP), a quantization-aware training (QAT) approach that first realizes extreme compression of LLMs with W2A4KV4(2-bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) configuration. RCP integrates recent rotation techniques with a novel non-uniform weight quantizer design, by quantitatively analyzing the impact of random rotation on 2-bit weight quantization. Our weight quantizer features Learnable Direct Partitioning (LDP), which introduces learnable parameters to directly learn non-uniform intervals jointly with LLM weights. We also present a specialized GPU kernel that supports GEMV on non-uniform W2A4. Experiments show that RCP can compress LLaMA-2-7B to W2A4KV4 with a loss of only 2.84 WikiText2 ppl and 5.29 times reduced memory footprint. Furthermore, RCP can quantize challenging mobile-targeted LLaMA-3.2 models and domain-specific WizardCoder-7B and MetaMath-7B with no critical problems such as convergence failure and repetition. Code is available at https://github.com/ songsm921/RCP.

### ProMoE: Fast MoE-based LLM Serving using Proactive Caching
**Authors**: Xiaoniu Song, Zihang Zhong, Rong Chen, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-01T03:51:09Z

**Summary**: The promising applications of large language models are often limited by the constrained GPU memory capacity available on edge devices. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models help address this issue by activating only a subset of the model's parameters during computation. This approach allows the unused parameters to be offloaded to host memory, thereby reducing the overall GPU memory demand. However, existing cache-based offloading solutions handle cache misses reactively, which significantly impacts system performance. In this paper, we introduce ProMoE, a novel proactive caching system that utilizes intermediate results to predict subsequent expert usage. By proactively fetching experts in advance, ProMoE eliminates passive cache misses, removes loading time from the critical path, and reduces the performance overhead associated with offloading. Our evaluations demonstrate that ProMoE achieves an average speedup of 2.20x (up to 3.21x) and 2.07x (up to 5.02x) in the prefill and decode stages, respectively, compared to existing offloading solutions.

### REFRAG: Rethinking RAG based Decoding
**Authors**: Xiaoqiang Lin, Aritra Ghosh, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low, Anshumali Shrivastava, Vijai Mohan

**Updated**: 2025-09-01T03:31:44Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

### Bidirectional Sparse Attention for Faster Video Diffusion Training
**Authors**: Chenlu Zhan, Wen Li, Chuyu Shen, Jun Zhang, Suhui Wu, Hao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-01T03:16:52Z

**Summary**: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training, the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full attention.

### LLM Serving Optimization with Variable Prefill and Decode Lengths
**Authors**: Meixuan Wang, Yinyu Ye, Zijie Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-31T15:09:36Z

**Summary**: We study the problem of serving LLM (Large Language Model) requests where each request has heterogeneous prefill and decode lengths. In LLM serving, the prefill length corresponds to the input prompt length, which determines the initial memory usage in the KV cache. The decode length refers to the number of output tokens generated sequentially, with each additional token increasing the KV cache memory usage by one unit. Given a set of n requests, our goal is to schedule and process them to minimize the total completion time. We show that this problem is NP-hard due to the interplay of batching, placement constraints, precedence relationships, and linearly increasing memory usage. We then analyze commonly used scheduling strategies in practice, such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-First (SF), and prove that their competitive ratios scale up sublinearly with the memory limit-a significant drawback in real-world settings where memory demand is large. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on a new selection metric that efficiently forms batches over time. We prove that this algorithm achieves a constant competitive ratio. Finally, we develop and evaluate a few algorithm variants inspired by this approach, including dynamic programming variants, local search methods, and an LP-based scheduler, demonstrating through comprehensive simulations that they outperform standard baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.

### Accelerating Latency-Critical Applications with AI-Powered   Semi-Automatic Fine-Grained Parallelization on SMT Processors
**Authors**: Denis Los, Igor Petushkov

**Updated**: 2025-08-31T14:51:19Z

**Summary**: Latency-critical applications tend to show low utilization of functional units due to frequent cache misses and mispredictions during speculative execution in high-performance superscalar processors. However, due to significant impact on single-thread performance, Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) technology is rarely used with heavy threads of latency-critical applications. In this paper, we explore utilization of SMT technology to support fine-grained parallelization of latency-critical applications. Following the advancements in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce Aira, an AI-powered Parallelization Adviser. To implement Aira, we extend AI Coding Agent in Cursor IDE with additional tools connected through Model Context Protocol, enabling end-to-end AI Agent for parallelization. Additional connected tools enable LLM-guided hotspot detection, collection of dynamic dependencies with Dynamic Binary Instrumentation, SMT-aware performance simulation to estimate performance gains. We apply Aira with Relic parallel framework for fine-grained task parallelism on SMT cores to parallelize latency-critical benchmarks representing real-world applications used in industry. We show 17% geomean performance gain from parallelization of latency-critical benchmarks using Aira with Relic framework.

### Yet Another Mirage of Breaking MIRAGE: Debunking Occupancy-based   Side-Channel Attacks on Fully Associative Randomized Caches
**Authors**: Chris Cao, Gururaj Saileshwar

**Updated**: 2025-08-31T05:43:55Z

**Summary**: Recent work presented at USENIX Security 2025 (SEC'25) claims that occupancy-based attacks can recover AES keys from the MIRAGE randomized cache. In this paper, we examine these claims and find that they arise from a modeling flaw in the SEC'25 paper. Most critically, the SEC'25 paper's simulation of MIRAGE uses a constant seed to initialize the random number generator used for global evictions in MIRAGE, causing every AES encryption they trace to evict the same deterministic sequence of cache lines. This artificially creates a highly repeatable timing pattern that is not representative of a realistic implementation of MIRAGE, where eviction sequences vary randomly between encryptions. When we instead randomize the eviction seed for each run, reflecting realistic operation, the correlation between AES T-table accesses and attacker runtimes disappears, and the attack fails. These findings show that the reported leakage is an artifact of incorrect modeling, and not an actual vulnerability in MIRAGE.

### NetGent: Agent-Based Automation of Network Application Workflows
**Authors**: Jaber Daneshamooz, Eugene Vuong, Laasya Koduru, Sanjay Chandrasekaran, Arpit Gupta

**Updated**: 2025-08-30T22:47:15Z

**Summary**: We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly. NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments, NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming, live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping, producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

### KVComp: A High-Performance, LLM-Aware, Lossy Compression Framework for   KV Cache
**Authors**: Bo Jiang, Taolue Yang, Youyuan Liu, Chengming Zhang, Xubin He, Sian Jin

**Updated**: 2025-08-30T18:25:19Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive potential in various practical applications. However, long context inference poses a significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to multiple gigabytes as sequence length and batch size increase. In this paper, we present KVComp, a generic and efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-text generation that synergistically works with both latency-critical and throughput-critical inference systems. KVComp employs novel lossy compression techniques specifically designed for KV cache data characteristics, featuring careful co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach maintains compatibility with the growing nature of KV cache while preserving high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that KVComp achieves on average 47\% and up to 83\% higher memory reduction rate compared to existing methods with little/no model accuracy degradation. Furthermore, KVComp achieves extremely high execution throughput, effectively reducing decompression overhead and, in some cases, even accelerating the matrix-vector multiplication operation and outperform cuBLAS-based attention kernels with less data movement.

### Discrete and Continuous Caching Games
**Authors**: Áron Jánosik, Csenge Miklós, Dániel G. Simon, Kristóf Zólomy

**Updated**: 2025-08-30T14:49:34Z

**Summary**: We investigate a discrete search game called the Multiple Caching Game where the searcher's aim is to find all of a set of $d$ treasures hidden in $n$ locations. Allowed queries are sets of locations of size $k$, and the searcher wins if in all $d$ queries, at least one treasure is hidden in one of the $k$ picked locations. P\'alv\"olgyi showed that the value of the game is at most $\frac{k^d}{\binom{n+d-1}{d}}$, with equality for large enough $n$. We conjecture the exact cases of equality. We also investigate variants of the game and show an example where their values are different, answering a question of P\'alv\"olgyi.   This game is closely related to a continuous variant, Alpern's Caching Game, based on which we define other continous variants of the multiple caching game and examine their values.

### DiffKV: Differentiated Memory Management for Large Language Models with   Parallel KV Compaction
**Authors**: Yanqi Zhang, Yuwei Hu, Runyuan Zhao, John C. S. Lui, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-30T09:35:22Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities but face substantial serving costs due to their high memory demands, with the key-value (KV) cache being a primary bottleneck. State-of-the-art KV cache compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, apply uniform treatment to both keys and values, and discard unimportant tokens entirely, overlooking the fine-grained distinctions in the significance of individual KV cache components. To address such limitations, we introduce \textit{DiffKV}, a novel framework for efficient KV cache compression that exploits three levels of differentiation in the KV cache: (1) the differing impact of keys and values on attention computation, (2) the varying importance of tokens, and (3) the diverse dynamic sparsity patterns across attention heads. These levels of differentiation introduce irregular memory usage patterns across different requests and attention heads, posing significant scalability challenges for memory management. To address these challenges, DiffKV proposes an on-GPU memory manager that compacts fragmented free memory list into contiguous regions in parallel, effectively translating sparsity in the KV cache into performance gains. We evaluate DiffKV on several mainstream LLMs, including the emerging thinking models that generate extended chains of thought. DiffKV is able to compress the KV cache by $2.7\times$ to $5.7\times$ with near-lossless accuracy on complex workloads requiring sophisticated reasoning and long-generation capabilities, and enhances throughput by $1.9\times$ to $5.4\times$. Source codes of DiffKV are available at https://github.com/zyqCSL/DiffKV.

### LightVLM: Acceleraing Large Multimodal Models with Pyramid Token Merging   and KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Lianyu Hu, Fanhua Shang, Wei Feng, Liang Wan

**Updated**: 2025-08-30T08:57:53Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput. Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B), hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by 3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

### GraphKV: Breaking the Static Selection Paradigm with Graph-Based KV   Cache Eviction
**Authors**: Xuelin Li, Xiangqi Jin, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-30T06:56:28Z

**Summary**: Efficient Key-Value (KV) cache management is essential for processing long text sequences in large language models (LLMs), where memory constraints often limit performance. Conventional KV eviction strategies, such as top-k selection based on attention scores, depend on static heuristics that fail to capture the evolving implicit dependencies among tokens during inference. To overcome this, we propose GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for KV cache compression. In GraphKV, tokens are modeled as nodes with importance scores, and edges represent their similarity relationships. Through a decay-signal-propagation mechanism, token importance is dynamically updated by propagating information across the graph, enabling adaptive retention of the most contextually significant tokens. GraphKV can be seamlessly utilized in existing KV cache eviction methods such as SnapKV and PyramidKV in a plug-and-play manner. Codes will be released on Github.

### Robust Containment Queries over Collections of Trimmed NURBS Surfaces   via Generalized Winding Numbers
**Authors**: Jacob Spainhour, Kenneth Weiss

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T20:39:21Z

**Summary**: We propose a containment query that is robust to the watertightness of regions bound by trimmed NURBS surfaces, as this property is difficult to guarantee for in-the-wild CAD models. Containment is determined through the generalized winding number (GWN), a mathematical construction that is indifferent to the arrangement of surfaces in the shape. Applying contemporary techniques for the 3D GWN to trimmed NURBS surfaces requires some form of geometric discretization, introducing computational inefficiency to the algorithm and even risking containment misclassifications near the surface. In contrast, our proposed method uses a novel reformulation of the relevant surface integral based on Stokes' theorem, which operates on the boundary and trimming curves as provided through rapidly converging adaptive quadrature. Batches of queries are further accelerated by memoizing (i.e.\ caching and reusing) quadrature node positions and tangents as they are evaluated. We demonstrate that our GWN method is robust to complex trimming geometry in a CAD model, and is accurate up to arbitrary precision at arbitrary distances from the surface. The derived containment query is therefore robust to model non-watertightness while respecting all curved features of the input shape.

### From TLinFormer to TConstFormer: The Leap to Constant-Time Transformer   Attention: Achieving O(1) Computation and O(1) KV Cache during Autoregressive   Inference
**Authors**: Zhongpan Tang

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T19:23:35Z

**Summary**: Although the Transformer has become the cornerstone of modern AI, its autoregressive inference suffers from a linearly growing KV Cache and a computational complexity of O(N^2 d), severely hindering its ability to process ultra-long sequences. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the TConstFormer architecture, building upon our previous work, TLinFormer. TConstFormer employs an innovative periodic state update mechanism to achieve a truly constant-size O(1) KV Cache. The computational complexity of this mechanism is also O(1) in an amortized sense: it performs purely constant-time computations for $k-1$ consecutive steps (e.g., $k=256$) and executes a single linear-time global information synchronization only on the $k$-th step. Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that TConstFormer exhibits an overwhelming advantage over baseline models in terms of speed, memory efficiency, and overall performance on long-text inference tasks. This breakthrough paves the way for efficient and robust streaming language model applications.

### Democratizing Agentic AI with Fast Test-Time Scaling on the Edge
**Authors**: Hao Mark Chen, Zhiwen Mo, Guanxi Lu, Shuang Liang, Lingxiao Ma, Wayne Luk, Hongxiang Fan

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T19:12:04Z

**Summary**: Deploying agentic AI on edge devices is crucial for privacy and responsiveness, but memory constraints typically relegate these systems to smaller Large Language Models (LLMs) with inferior reasoning capabilities. Test-Time Scaling (TTS) can bridge this reasoning gap by dedicating more compute during inference, but existing methods incur prohibitive overhead on edge hardware. To overcome this, we introduce FlashTTS, a serving system that makes TTS practical for memory-constrained LLM reasoning. FlashTTS introduces three synergistic optimizations: (i) Speculative Beam Extension to mitigate system stragglers from irregular reasoning paths; (ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model Memory Allocation to dynamically balance memory between generation and verification; and (iii) Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling to maximize KV-cache reuse. Built as a plug-and-play library for vLLM, FlashTTS enables edge LLMs on a single consumer GPU (24 GB) to match the accuracy and latency of large cloud models. Our evaluation demonstrates that FlashTTS achieves an average 2.2x higher goodput and reduces latency by 38%-68% compared to a vLLM baseline, paving the way for democratized, high-performance agentic AI on edge devices.

### Towards Compute-Optimal Many-Shot In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Shahriar Golchin, Yanfei Chen, Rujun Han, Manan Gandhi, Tianli Yu, Swaroop Mishra, Mihai Surdeanu, Rishabh Agarwal, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T18:45:22Z

**Summary**: Long-context large language models (LLMs) are able to process inputs containing up to several million tokens. In the scope of in-context learning (ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1) high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and (3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.

### Neural Visibility Cache for Real-Time Light Sampling
**Authors**: Jakub Bokšanský, Daniel Meister

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T09:58:17Z

**Summary**: Direct illumination with many lights is an inherent component of physically-based rendering, remaining challenging, especially in real-time scenarios. We propose an online-trained neural cache that stores visibility between lights and 3D positions. We feed light visibility to weighted reservoir sampling (WRS) to sample a light source. The cache is implemented as a fully-fused multilayer perceptron (MLP) with multi-resolution hash-grid encoding, enabling online training and efficient inference on modern GPUs in real-time frame rates. The cache can be seamlessly integrated into existing rendering frameworks and can be used in combination with other real-time techniques such as spatiotemporal reservoir sampling (ReSTIR).

### FedSEA-LLaMA: A Secure, Efficient and Adaptive Federated Splitting   Framework for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zishuai Zhang, Hainan zhang, Weihua Li, Qinnan zhang, jin Dong, Yongxin Tong, Zhiming Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T07:40:34Z

**Summary**: Private data holds promise for improving LLMs due to its high quality, but its scattered distribution across data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their deployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based federated split models are proposed, which offload most model parameters to the server (or distributed clients) while retaining only a small portion on the client to ensure data privacy. Despite this design, they still face three challenges: 1) Peer-to-peer key encryption struggles to secure transmitted vectors effectively; 2) The auto-regressive nature of LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially, causing high communication overhead; 3) Fixed partition points lack adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FedSEA-LLaMA, a Secure, Efficient, and Adaptive Federated splitting framework based on LLaMA2. First, we inject Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states to enable secure end-to-end vector transmission. Second, we employ attention-mask compression and KV cache collaboration to reduce communication costs, accelerating training and inference. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points for input/output blocks based on specific task requirements. Experiments on natural language understanding, summarization, and conversational QA tasks show that FedSEA-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2 and achieves up to 8x speedups in training and inference. Further analysis of privacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the effectiveness of FedSEA-LLaMA in security and adaptability.

### Deep Multiple Quantization Network on Long Behavior Sequence for   Click-Through Rate Prediction
**Authors**: Zhuoxing Wei, Qi Liu, Qingchen Xie

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T14:58:47Z

**Summary**: In Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, the long behavior sequence, comprising the user's long period of historical interactions with items has a vital influence on assessing the user's interest in the candidate item. Existing approaches strike efficiency and effectiveness through a two-stage paradigm: first retrieving hundreds of candidate-related items and then extracting interest intensity vector through target attention. However, we argue that the discrepancy in target attention's relevance distribution between the retrieved items and the full long behavior sequence inevitably leads to a performance decline. To alleviate the discrepancy, we propose the Deep Multiple Quantization Network (DMQN) to process long behavior sequence end-to-end through compressing the long behavior sequence. Firstly, the entire spectrum of long behavior sequence will be quantized into multiple codeword sequences based on multiple independent codebooks. Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Unit is incorporated to facilitate the interaction of reduced codeword sequences. Then, attention between the candidate and multiple codeword sequences will output the interest vector. To enable online serving, intermediate representations of the codeword sequences are cached, significantly reducing latency. Our extensive experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of DMQN. The A/B test in our advertising system shows that DMQN improves CTR by 3.5% and RPM by 2.0%.

### SOT-MRAM Bitcell Scaling with BEOL Read Selectors: A DTCO Study
**Authors**: Yang Xiang, Fernando García-Redondo, Arvind Sharma, Van Dai Nguyen, Andrea Fantini, Philippe Matagne, Siddharth Rao, Subhali Subhechha, Lynn Verschueren, Mohammed Aftab Baig, Marie Garcia Bardon, Geert Hellings

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T08:49:24Z

**Summary**: This work explores the cross-node scaling potential of SOT-MRAM for last-level caches (LLCs) under heterogeneous system scaling paradigm. We perform extensive Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) exercises to evaluate the bitcell footprint for different cell configurations at a representative 7 nm technology and to assess their implications on read and write power-performance. We crucially identify the MTJ routing struggle in conventional two-transistor one-resistor (2T1R) SOT-MRAMs as the primary bitcell area scaling challenge and propose to use BEOL read selectors (BEOL RSs) that enable (10 -- 40) % bitcell area reduction and eventually match sub-N3 SRAM. On writability, we affirm that BEOL RS-based bitcells could meet the required SOT switching current, provided the magnetic free layer properties be engineered in line with LLC-specific, (0.1 -- 100) s retention targets. This is particularly to attribute to their (i) more available Si fins for write transistor and (ii) lower bitline resistance at reduced cell width. We nevertheless underscore the read tradeoff associated with BEOL RSs, with the low-drive IGZO-FET selector sacrificing the latency up to (3 -- 5) ns and the imperfectly rectifying diode selectors suffering (2.5 -- 5)$\times$ energy cost relative to 2T1R. This article thus highlights the realistic prospects and hurdles of BEOL RSs towards holistic power-performance-area scaling of SOT-MRAM.

### Matrixed-Spectrum Decomposition Accelerated Linear Boltzmann Transport   Equation Solver for Fast Scatter Correction in Multi-Spectral CT
**Authors**: Guoxi Zhu, Li Zhang, Zhiqiang Chen, Hewei Gao

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T08:05:42Z

**Summary**: X-ray scatter has been a serious concern in computed tomography (CT), leading to image artifacts and distortion of CT values. The linear Boltzmann transport equation (LBTE) is recognized as a fast and accurate approach for scatter estimation. However, for multi-spectral CT, it is cumbersome to compute multiple scattering components for different spectra separately when applying LBTE-based scatter correction. In this work, we propose a Matrixed-Spectrum Decomposition accelerated LBTE solver (MSD-LBTE) that can be used to compute X-ray scatter distributions from CT acquisitions at two or more different spectra simultaneously, in a unified framework with no sacrifice in accuracy and nearly no increase in computation in theory. First, a matrixed-spectrum solver of LBTE is obtained by introducing an additional label dimension to expand the phase space. Then, we propose a ``spectrum basis'' for LBTE and a principle of selection of basis using the QR decomposition, along with the above solver to construct the MSD-LBTE. Based on MSD-LBTE, a unified scatter correction method can be established for multi-spectral CT. We validate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method by comparing it with the Monte Carlo method, including the computational time. We also evaluate the scatter correction performance using two different phantoms for fast-kV switching based dual-energy CT, and using an elliptical phantom in a numerical simulation for kV-modulation enabled CT scans, validating that our proposed method can significantly reduce the computational cost at multiple spectra and effectively reduce scatter artifact in reconstructed CT images.

### MegaCacheX: Towards Cost-Effective Hierarchical Collaborative Content   Caching in Emerging Mega-Constellations
**Authors**: Haoyang Shi, Xing Zhang, Sitong Li, Minghang Li, Xinming Lu, Shaoxiang Xu, Guoquan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T05:22:25Z

**Summary**: Significant latency in global content delivery primarily arises from insufficient terrestrial infrastructure. Deploying space-based content delivery networks within emerging mega-constellations provides an effective means to bridge the digital divide. However, space-based caching faces constraints from physical-layer dynamics, including dynamic topologies, time-varying inter-satellite link conditions, and limited onboard energy. In addition, existing mechanisms often lack fine-grained content categorization and global optimization. This paper proposes MegaCacheX, a cost-effective hierarchical framework for collaborative content distribution that achieves "Earth-independence" by providing cloud services directly from space. Specifically, data centers in Sun-synchronous orbit act as primary content sources, while caching nodes in mega-constellations and ground stations collaboratively form a distributed edge layer. MegaCacheX optimizes caching strategies by integrating content popularity, regional user distribution, and satellite trajectory predictions. Multi-tier caching nodes serve as service anchors, enabling seamless content delivery with low latency. A prototype implemented on a microservices-based, containerized testbed demonstrates that MegaCacheX reduces global content access latency by about 36% compared to baseline approaches, while maintaining cost efficiency.

### Breaking Diffusion with Cache: Exploiting Approximate Caches in   Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Desen Sun, Shuncheng Jie, Sihang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T04:46:44Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models that produce content, such as images, from user prompts, but they are computationally intensive. To mitigate this cost, recent academic and industry work has adopted approximate caching, which reuses intermediate states from similar prompts in a cache. While efficient, this optimization introduces new security risks by breaking isolation among users. This work aims to comprehensively assess new security vulnerabilities arising from approximate caching. First, we demonstrate a remote covert channel established with the cache, where a sender injects prompts with special keywords into the cache and a receiver can recover that even after days, to exchange information. Second, we introduce a prompt stealing attack using the cache, where an attacker can recover existing cached prompts based on cache hit prompts. Finally, we introduce a poisoning attack that embeds the attacker's logos into the previously stolen prompt, to render them in future user prompts that hit the cache. These attacks are all performed remotely through the serving system, which indicates severe security vulnerabilities in approximate caching.

### Rethinking Transformer Connectivity: TLinFormer, A Path to Exact, Full   Context-Aware Linear Attention
**Authors**: Zhongpan Tang

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T04:10:19Z

**Summary**: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency}, \textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

### ASVD: Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition for Compressing   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhihang Yuan, Yuzhang Shang, Yue Song, Dawei Yang, Qiang Wu, Yan Yan, Guangyu Sun

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T03:57:52Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a new post-training compression paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate their wider adoption. We delve into LLM weight low-rank decomposition, and find that the challenges of this task stem from (1) the distribution variance in the LLM activations and (2) the sensitivity difference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by transforming the weight matrix based on the activation distribution. This transformation allows the outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into the transformed weight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers. In this way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the success of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced. ASVD can further achieve 50% KV cache reductions without performance drop in a training-free manner.

### Climber: Toward Efficient Scaling Laws for Large Recommendation Models
**Authors**: Songpei Xu, Shijia Wang, Da Guo, Xianwen Guo, Qiang Xiao, Bin Huang, Guanlin Wu, Chuanjiang Luo

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T01:40:30Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based generative models have achieved remarkable success across domains with various scaling law manifestations. However, our extensive experiments reveal persistent challenges when applying Transformer to recommendation systems: (1) Transformer scaling is not ideal with increased computational resources, due to structural incompatibilities with recommendation-specific features such as multi-source data heterogeneity; (2) critical online inference latency constraints (tens of milliseconds) that intensify with longer user behavior sequences and growing computational demands. We propose Climber, an efficient recommendation framework comprising two synergistic components: the model architecture for efficient scaling and the co-designed acceleration techniques. Our proposed model adopts two core innovations: (1) multi-scale sequence extraction that achieves a time complexity reduction by a constant factor, enabling more efficient scaling with sequence length; (2) dynamic temperature modulation adapting attention distributions to the multi-scenario and multi-behavior patterns. Complemented by acceleration techniques, Climber achieves a 5.15$\times$ throughput gain without performance degradation by adopting a "single user, multiple item" batched processing and memory-efficient Key-Value caching. Comprehensive offline experiments on multiple datasets validate that Climber exhibits a more ideal scaling curve. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly documented framework where controlled model scaling drives continuous online metric growth (12.19\% overall lift) without prohibitive resource costs. Climber has been successfully deployed on Netease Cloud Music, one of China's largest music streaming platforms, serving tens of millions of users daily.

### AdaptCache: KV Cache Native Storage Hierarchy for Low-Delay and   High-Quality Language Model Serving
**Authors**: Shaoting Feng, Hanchen Li, Kuntai Du, Zhuohan Gu, Yuhan Liu, Jiayi Yao, Siddhant Ray, Samuel Shen, Yihua Cheng, Ganesh Ananthanarayanan, Junchen Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T00:46:51Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) applications often reuse previously processed context, such as chat history and documents, which introduces significant redundant computation. Existing LLM serving systems address such redundant computation by storing the KV caches of processed context and loading the corresponding KV cache when a new request reuses the context. Further, as these LLM applications scale, the total size of KV caches becomes excessively large and requires both DRAM and SSD for full storage.   However, prior work that stores KV caches in DRAM and SSD suffers from high loading delays, as most KV cache hits come from SSD, which is slow to load. To increase the KV cache hit rate on DRAM, we identify lossy KV cache compression as a promising approach. We design a lossy compression system that decides the compression algorithm, compression rate and device placement for each KV cache entry to maximise DRAM hits and minimise loading delay without significantly degrading generation quality. Compared to various static compression baselines across three tasks, our system AdaptCache achieves 1.43--2.4 x delay savings at the same quality and 6--55% quality improvements at the same delay.

### DRR-MDPF: A Queue Management Strategy Based on Dynamic Resource   Allocation and Markov Decision Process in Named Data Networking (NDN)
**Authors**: Fatemeh Roshanzadeh, Hamid Barati, Ali Barati

**Updated**: 2025-08-27T21:05:05Z

**Summary**: Named Data Networking (NDN) represents a transformative shift in network architecture, prioritizing content names over host addresses to enhance data dissemination. Efficient queue and resource management are critical to NDN performance, especially under dynamic and high-traffic conditions. This paper introduces DRR-MDPF, a novel hybrid strategy that integrates the Markov Decision Process Forwarding (MDPF) model with the Deficit Round Robin (DRR) algorithm. MDPF enables routers to intelligently predict optimal forwarding decisions based on key metrics such as bandwidth, delay, and the number of unsatisfied Interests, while DRR ensures fair and adaptive bandwidth allocation among competing data flows. The proposed method models each router as a learning agent capable of adjusting its strategies through continuous feedback and probabilistic updates. Simulation results using ndnSIM demonstrate that DRR-MDPF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art strategies including SAF, RFA, SMDPF, and LA-MDPF across various metrics such as throughput, Interest Satisfaction Rate (ISR), packet drop rate, content retrieval time, and load balancing. Notably, DRR-MDPF maintains robustness under limited cache sizes and heavy traffic, offering enhanced adaptability and lower computational complexity due to its single-path routing design. Furthermore, its multi-metric decision-making capability enables more accurate interface selection, leading to optimized network performance. Overall, DRR-MDPF serves as an intelligent, adaptive, and scalable queue management solution for NDN, effectively addressing core challenges such as resource allocation, congestion control, and route optimization in dynamic networking environments.

### SpeedMalloc: Improving Multi-threaded Applications via a Lightweight   Core for Memory Allocation
**Authors**: Ruihao Li, Qinzhe Wu, Krishna Kavi, Gayatri Mehta, Jonathan C. Beard, Neeraja J. Yadwadkar, Lizy K. John

**Updated**: 2025-08-27T20:18:37Z

**Summary**: Memory allocation, though constituting only a small portion of the executed code, can have a "butterfly effect" on overall program performance, leading to significant and far-reaching impacts. Despite accounting for just approximately 5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x performance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from the complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core systems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading to cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead. Offloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a potential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache pollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for multi-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators remains a significant challenge.   We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory allocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a lightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data synchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches. This design minimizes cache conflicts with user data and eliminates the need for cross-core metadata synchronization. In addition, using a general-purpose core instead of domain-specific accelerators makes SpeedMalloc capable of adopting new allocator designs. We compare SpeedMalloc with state-of-the-art software and hardware allocators, including Jemalloc, TCMalloc, Mimalloc, Mallacc, and Memento. SpeedMalloc achieves 1.75x, 1.18x, 1.15x, 1.23x, and 1.18x speedups on multithreaded workloads over these five allocators, respectively.

### MODE: Mixture of Document Experts for RAG
**Authors**: Rahul Anand

**Updated**: 2025-08-27T17:45:16Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks, MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.

**Updated**: 2025-08-27T16:34:47Z

**Summary**: We introduce two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models that power Apple Intelligence features across Apple devices and services: i a 3B-parameter on-device model optimized for Apple silicon through architectural innovations such as KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training; and ii a scalable server model built on a novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts PT-MoE transformer that combines track parallelism, mixture-of-experts sparse computation, and interleaved global-local attention to deliver high quality with competitive cost on Apple's Private Cloud Compute platform. Both models are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data, then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model match or surpass comparably sized open baselines.   A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation, constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements in Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with safeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as our commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private Cloud Compute.

### Re-thinking Memory-Bound Limitations in CGRAs
**Authors**: Xiangfeng Liu, Zhe Jiang, Anzhen Zhu, Xiaomeng Han, Mingsong Lyu, Qingxu Deng, Nan Guan

**Updated**: 2025-08-27T12:13:45Z

**Summary**: Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) are specialized accelerators commonly employed to boost performance in workloads with iterative structures. Existing research typically focuses on compiler or architecture optimizations aimed at improving CGRA performance, energy efficiency, flexibility, and area utilization, under the idealistic assumption that kernels can access all data from Scratchpad Memory (SPM). However, certain complex workloads-particularly in fields like graph analytics, irregular database operations, and specialized forms of high-performance computing (e.g., unstructured mesh simulations)-exhibit irregular memory access patterns that hinder CGRA utilization, sometimes dropping below 1.5%, making the CGRA memory-bound. To address this challenge, we conduct a thorough analysis of the underlying causes of performance degradation, then propose a redesigned memory subsystem and refine the memory model. With both microarchitectural and theoretical optimization, our solution can effectively manage irregular memory accesses through CGRA-specific runahead execution mechanism and cache reconfiguration techniques. Our results demonstrate that we can achieve performance comparable to the original SPM-only system while requiring only 1.27% of the storage size. The runahead execution mechanism achieves an average 3.04x speedup (up to 6.91x), with cache reconfiguration technique providing an additional 6.02% improvement, significantly enhancing CGRA performance for irregular memory access patterns.

### ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient   Diffusion
**Authors**: Xurui Peng, Hong Liu, Chenqian Yan, Rui Ma, Fangmin Chen, Xing Wang, Zhihua Wu, Songwei Liu, Mingbao Lin

**Updated**: 2025-08-27T10:37:24Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model. Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/ERTACache.

### Spotlight Attention: Towards Efficient LLM Generation via Non-linear   Hashing-based KV Cache Retrieval
**Authors**: Wenhao Li, Yuxin Zhang, Gen Luo, Haiyuan Wan, Ziyang Gong, Fei Chao, Rongrong Ji

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T09:08:29Z

**Summary**: Reducing the key-value (KV) cache burden in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerates inference. Dynamically selecting critical KV caches during decoding helps maintain performance. Existing methods use random linear hashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to the orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in LLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear hashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys, enhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight, stable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling optimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8 hours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves retrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least 5$\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the computational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA kernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\mu$s on a single A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\times$ higher than vanilla decoding.

### Beyond the Bermuda Triangle of Contention: IOMMU Interference in Mixed   Criticality Systems
**Authors**: Diogo Costa, Jose Martins, Sandro Pinto

**Updated**: 2025-08-27T08:30:33Z

**Summary**: As Mixed Criticality Systems (MCSs) evolve, they increasingly integrate heterogeneous computing platforms, combining general-purpose processors with specialized accelerators such as AI engines, GPUs, and high-speed networking interfaces. This heterogeneity introduces challenges, as these accelerators and DMA-capable devices act as independent bus masters, directly accessing memory. Consequently, ensuring both security and timing predictability in such environments becomes critical. To address these concerns, the Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) plays a key role in mediating and regulating memory access, preventing unauthorized transactions while enforcing isolation and access control policies. While prior work has explored IOMMU-related side-channel vulnerabilities from a security standpoint, its role in performance interference remains largely unexplored. Moreover, many of the same architectural properties that enable side-channel leakage, such as shared TLBs, caching effects, and translation overheads, can also introduce timing unpredictability. In this work, we analyze the contention effects within IOMMU structures using the Xilinx UltraScale+ ZCU104 platform, demonstrating how their shared nature introduce unpredictable delays. Our findings reveal that IOMMU-induced interference primarily affects small memory transactions, where translation overheads significantly impact execution time. Additionally, we hypothesize that contention effects arising from IOTLBs exhibit similar behavior across architectures due to shared caching principles, such as prefetching and hierarchical TLB structures. Notably, our experiments show that IOMMU interference can delay DMA transactions by up to 1.79x for lower-size transfers on the Arm SMMUv2 implementation.

### FiRST: Finetuning Router-Selective Transformers for Input-Adaptive   Latency Reduction
**Authors**: Akriti Jain, Saransh Sharma, Koyel Mukherjee, Soumyabrata Pal

**Updated**: 2025-08-27T04:58:58Z

**Summary**: Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across different domains such as vision and language processing. However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit, and 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on tasks. Extensive experiments show that FiRST significantly reduces latency while outperforming other layer selection strategies in quality metics. It retains competitive performance to base model (without layer skipping) and in some cases, even improves upon it. FiRST is thus a promising and efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.

### VoxHammer: Training-Free Precise and Coherent 3D Editing in Native 3D   Space
**Authors**: Lin Li, Zehuan Huang, Haoran Feng, Gengxiong Zhuang, Rui Chen, Chunchao Guo, Lu Sheng

**Updated**: 2025-08-26T17:59:47Z

**Summary**: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data foundation for in-context 3D generation.

### Enabling MoE on the Edge via Importance-Driven Expert Scheduling
**Authors**: Guoying Zhu, Meng Li, Haipeng Dai, Xuechen Liu, Weijun Wang, Keran Li, Jun xiao, Ligeng Chen, Wei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-26T12:32:09Z

**Summary**: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query. Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer, while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly lossless accuracy.

### Rethinking Caching for LLM Serving Systems: Beyond Traditional   Heuristics
**Authors**: Jungwoo Kim, Minsang Kim, Jaeheon Lee, Chanwoo Moon, Heejin Kim, Taeho Hwang, Woosuk Chung, Yeseong Kim, Sungjin Lee

**Updated**: 2025-08-26T07:09:09Z

**Summary**: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale requires meeting strict Service Level Objectives (SLOs) under severe computational and memory constraints. Nevertheless, traditional caching strategies fall short: exact-matching and prefix caches neglect query semantics, while state-of-the-art semantic caches remain confined to traditional intuitions, offering little conceptual departure. Building on this, we present SISO, a semantic caching system that redefines efficiency for LLM serving. SISO introduces centroid-based caching to maximize coverage with minimal memory, locality-aware replacement to preserve high-value entries, and dynamic thresholding to balance accuracy and latency under varying workloads. Across diverse datasets, SISO delivers up to 1.71$\times$ higher hit ratios and consistently stronger SLO attainment compared to state-of-the-art systems.

### Physical Autoregressive Model for Robotic Manipulation without Action   Pretraining
**Authors**: Zijian Song, Sihan Qin, Tianshui Chen, Liang Lin, Guangrun Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-26T03:23:53Z

**Summary**: The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

### Krul: Efficient State Restoration for Multi-turn Conversations with   Dynamic Cross-layer KV Sharing
**Authors**: Junyi Wen, Junyuan Liang, Zicong Hong, Wuhui Chen, Ting Cai, Zibin Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-08-26T01:55:27Z

**Summary**: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable accuracy degradation.   We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without compromising generation quality.

### AGILE: Lightweight and Efficient Asynchronous GPU-SSD Integration
**Authors**: Zhuoping Yang, Jinming Zhuang, Xingzhen Chen, Alex K. Jones, Peipei Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-26T01:45:34Z

**Summary**: GPUs are critical for compute-intensive applications, yet emerging workloads such as recommender systems, graph analytics, and data analytics often exceed GPU memory capacity. Existing solutions allow GPUs to use CPU DRAM or SSDs as external memory, and the GPU-centric approach enables GPU threads to directly issue NVMe requests, further avoiding CPU intervention. However, current GPU-centric approaches adopt synchronous I/O, forcing threads to stall during long communication delays.   We propose AGILE, a lightweight asynchronous GPU-centric I/O library that eliminates deadlock risks and integrates a flexible HBM-based software cache. AGILE overlaps computation and I/O, improving performance by up to 1.88$\times$ across workloads with diverse computation-to-communication ratios. Compared to BaM on DLRM, AGILE achieves up to 1.75$\times$ speedup through efficient design and overlapping; on graph applications, AGILE reduces software cache overhead by up to 3.12$\times$ and NVMe I/O overhead by up to 2.85$\times$; AGILE also lowers per-thread register usage by up to 1.32$\times$.

### Strata: Hierarchical Context Caching for Long Context Language Model   Serving
**Authors**: Zhiqiang Xie, Ziyi Xu, Mark Zhao, Yuwei An, Vikram Sharma Mailthody, Scott Mahlke, Michael Garland, Christos Kozyrakis

**Updated**: 2025-08-26T00:09:03Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) with expanding context windows face significant performance hurdles. While caching key-value (KV) states is critical for avoiding redundant computation, the storage footprint of long-context caches quickly exceeds GPU memory capacity, forcing production systems to adopt hierarchical caching across memory hierarchies. However, transferring large cached contexts back to the GPU introduces severe performance bottlenecks: fragmented I/O from paged layouts prevents full bandwidth utilization, and existing schedulers fail to account for cache-loading delays, leaving systems loading-bound rather than compute-bound. We present Strata, a hierarchical context caching framework designed for efficient long context LLM serving. Strata introduces GPU-assisted I/O to combat KV cache fragmentation, decoupling GPU and CPU memory layouts and employs cache-aware request scheduling to balance compute with I/O latency and overlapping unavoidable stalls with complementary tasks. Built on SGLang and deployed in production, Strata achieves up to 5x lower Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) compared to vLLM + LMCache and 3.75x speedup over NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM on long-context benchmarks, without degrading short-context performance.

### Real-time 3D Visualization of Radiance Fields on Light Field Displays
**Authors**: Jonghyun Kim, Cheng Sun, Michael Stengel, Matthew Chan, Andrew Russell, Jaehyun Jung, Wil Braithwaite, Shalini De Mello, David Luebke

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T22:21:04Z

**Summary**: Radiance fields have revolutionized photo-realistic 3D scene visualization by enabling high-fidelity reconstruction of complex environments, making them an ideal match for light field displays. However, integrating these technologies presents significant computational challenges, as light field displays require multiple high-resolution renderings from slightly shifted viewpoints, while radiance fields rely on computationally intensive volume rendering. In this paper, we propose a unified and efficient framework for real-time radiance field rendering on light field displays. Our method supports a wide range of radiance field representations, including NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting, and Sparse Voxels, within a shared architecture based on a single-pass plane sweeping strategy and caching of shared, non-directional components. The framework generalizes across different scene formats without retraining, and avoids redundant computation across views. We further demonstrate a real-time interactive application on a Looking Glass display, achieving 200+ FPS at 512p across 45 views, enabling seamless, immersive 3D interaction. On standard benchmarks, our method achieves up to 22x speedup compared to independently rendering each view, while preserving image quality.

### DiskJoin: Large-scale Vector Similarity Join with SSD
**Authors**: Yanqi Chen, Xiao Yan, Alexandra Meliou, Eric Lo

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T21:07:52Z

**Summary**: Similarity join--a widely used operation in data science--finds all pairs of items that have distance smaller than a threshold. Prior work has explored distributed computation methods to scale similarity join to large data volumes but these methods require a cluster deployment, and efficiency suffers from expensive inter-machine communication. On the other hand, disk-based solutions are more cost-effective by using a single machine and storing the large dataset on high-performance external storage, such as NVMe SSDs, but in these methods the disk I/O time is a serious bottleneck. In this paper, we propose DiskJoin, the first disk-based similarity join algorithm that can process billion-scale vector datasets efficiently on a single machine. DiskJoin improves disk I/O by tailoring the data access patterns to avoid repetitive accesses and read amplification. It also uses main memory as a dynamic cache and carefully manages cache eviction to improve cache hit rate and reduce disk retrieval time. For further acceleration, we adopt a probabilistic pruning technique that can effectively prune a large number of vector pairs from computation. Our evaluation on real-world, large-scale datasets shows that DiskJoin significantly outperforms alternatives, achieving speedups from 50x to 1000x.

### MARM: Unlocking the Future of Recommendation Systems through Memory   Augmentation and Scalable Complexity
**Authors**: Xiao Lv, Jiangxia Cao, Shijie Guan, Xiaoyou Zhou, Zhiguang Qi, Yaqiang Zang, Ming Li, Ben Wang, Kun Gai, Guorui Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T15:48:28Z

**Summary**: Scaling-law has guided the language model designing for past years, however, it is worth noting that the scaling laws of NLP cannot be directly applied to RecSys due to the following reasons: (1) The amount of training samples and model parameters is typically not the bottleneck for the model. Our recommendation system can generate over 50 billion user samples daily, and such a massive amount of training data can easily allow our model parameters to exceed 200 billion, surpassing many LLMs (about 100B). (2) To ensure the stability and robustness of the recommendation system, it is essential to control computational complexity FLOPs carefully. Considering the above differences with LLM, we can draw a conclusion that: for a RecSys model, compared to model parameters, the computational complexity FLOPs is a more expensive factor that requires careful control. In this paper, we propose our milestone work, MARM (Memory Augmented Recommendation Model), which explores a new cache scaling-laws successfully.

### ILRe: Intermediate Layer Retrieval for Context Compression in Causal   Language Models
**Authors**: Manlai Liang, Mandi Liu, Jiangzhou Ji, Huaijun Li, Haobo Yang, Yaohan He, Jinlong Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T10:59:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios, primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline, called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance comparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios. Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx 180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T07:49:17Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative tasks (e.g., image and video generation), and the demand for high-quality content (e.g., 2K/4K videos) is rapidly increasing across various domains. However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and memory costs. To this end, we introduce SuperGen, an efficient tile-based framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SuperGen features a novel training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SuperGen incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps and spatial regions. SuperGen also integrates cache-guided, communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized latency. Evaluations demonstrate that SuperGen harvests the maximum performance gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.

### OmniCache: A Trajectory-Oriented Global Perspective on Training-Free   Cache Reuse for Diffusion Transformer Models
**Authors**: Huanpeng Chu, Wei Wu, Guanyu Fen, Yutao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T03:07:02Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure. In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.

### ExpertWeave: Efficiently Serving Expert-Specialized Fine-Tuned Adapters   at Scale
**Authors**: Ge Shi, Hanieh Sadri, Qian Wang, Yu Zhang, Ying Xiong, Yong Zhang, Zhenan Fan

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T03:05:16Z

**Summary**: Expert-Specialized Fine-Tuning (ESFT) adapts Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language models to enhance their task-specific performance by selectively tuning the top-activated experts for the task. Serving these fine-tuned models at scale is challenging: deploying merged models in isolation is prohibitively resource-hungry, while existing multi-adapter serving systems with LoRA-style additive updates are incompatible with ESFT's expert-oriented paradigm. We present ExpertWeave, a system that serves multiple ESFT adapters concurrently over a single shared MoE base model, drastically reducing the memory footprint and improving resource utilization. To seamlessly integrate into existing inference pipelines for MoE models with non-intrusive modifications and minimal latency overhead, ExpertWeave introduces a virtual-memory-assisted expert weight manager that co-locates base-model and adapter experts without incurring memory overhead from fragmentation, and a fused kernel for batched rerouting to enable lightweight redirection of tokens to the appropriate experts at runtime. Our evaluations show that ExpertWeave can simultaneously serve multiple adapters of a 16B MoE model on a single accelerator where the baseline runs out of memory, or provides up to 94x more KV cache capacity and achieves up to 18% higher throughput while using comparable resources, all without compromising model accuracy. ExpertWeave maintains low overhead even when scaling to 20 adapters, with a 4-11% latency increase compared with serving the base model alone. Source code will be released soon.

### Lightning Fast Caching-based Parallel Denoising Prediction for   Accelerating Talking Head Generation
**Authors**: Jianzhi Long, Wenhao Sun, Rongcheng Tu, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T02:58:39Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications. Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions. Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves inference speed while preserving video quality.

### TPLA: Tensor Parallel Latent Attention for Efficient Disaggregated   Prefill and Decode Inference
**Authors**: Xiaojuan Tang, Fanxu Meng, Pingzhi Tang, Yuxuan Wang, Di Yin, Xing Sun, Muhan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T02:24:20Z

**Summary**: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache, eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.

### Zen-Attention: A Compiler Framework for Dynamic Attention Folding on AMD   NPUs
**Authors**: Aadesh Deshmukh, Venkata Yaswanth Raparti, Samuel Hsu

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T01:33:18Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based deep learning models are increasingly deployed on energy, and DRAM bandwidth constrained devices such as laptops and gaming consoles, which presents significant challenges in meeting the latency requirements of the models. The industry is turning to neural processing units (NPUs) for superior performance-per-watt (perf/watt); however, efficiently mapping dynamic attention layers to the NPUs remains a challenging task. For optimizing perf/watt, AMD XDNA NPUs employ software managed caches and share system memory with host. This requires substantial engineering effort to unlock efficient tiling, buffer allocation, and data movement to extract the maximum efficiency from the device. This paper introduces Zen-Attention, a framework that optimizes DRAM bandwidth utilization in the attention layer of models by systematically exploring the complex design space of layer folding, tiling, and data-movement on the interconnect, and the tensor layouts to come up with an optimal solution. Our evaluation includes comparative analysis of end-to-end model latency and specific attention latency in each model. We demonstrate how the framework enhances mapping capabilities by varying input dimensions, which require padding and masking in the attention block. For representative transformer models, the Zen-Attention Framework achieves up to 4x improvement in the latency of the attention block and up to 32% improvement in end-to-end network latency compared to the baseline Unfolded- approaches.

### RT-Cache: Training-Free Retrieval for Real-Time Manipulation
**Authors**: Owen Kwon, Abraham George, Alison Bartsch, Amir Barati Farimani

**Updated**: 2025-08-25T00:15:27Z

**Summary**: Real robots are expected to repeat the same behavior in new environments with very little new data, yet modern controllers either incur heavy per-step inference or require deployment-time fine-tuning. We propose RT-Cache, a training-free retrieval-as-control pipeline that caches diverse image action trajectories in a unified vector memory and, at test time, embeds the current frame to retrieve and replay multi-step snippets, replacing per-step model calls. A hierarchical search keeps lookups sub-second at million scale, shifting cost from compute to storage and enabling real-time control on modest GPUs. Across real-robot tasks and large open logs, RT-Cache achieves higher success and lower completion time than strong retrieval baselines (approximately x2 higher success and ~30% faster in our settings), and a single-episode anchoring study shows immediate adaptation to a more complex, contact-rich task without fine-tuning. RT-Cache turns experience into an append-only memory, offering a simple, scalable path to few-shot deployment today and a foundation for multimodal keys and optional integration with high-level policies.

### PRISM: Efficient Long-Range Reasoning With Short-Context LLMs
**Authors**: Dulhan Jayalath, James Bradley Wendt, Nicholas Monath, Sandeep Tata, Beliz Gunel

**Updated**: 2025-08-24T22:09:57Z

**Summary**: Long-range tasks demand reasoning over long inputs. However, existing solutions are limited, e.g., long-context models require large compute budgets, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) needs training data, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) entails complex task-specific designs. Though in-context approaches overcome many of these issues, methods with short-context LLMs are inefficient, trading context for processing more tokens. We introduce PRISM, a highly token-efficient in-context method based on structured schemas that outperforms baselines on diverse tasks with 4x shorter contexts. This approach produces concise outputs and efficiently leverages key-value (KV) caches to reduce costs by up to 54%. PRISM scales down to tiny contexts without increasing costs or sacrificing quality, and generalizes to new tasks with minimal effort by generating schemas from task descriptions.

### Evaluating Compiler Optimization Impacts on zkVM Performance
**Authors**: Thomas Gassmann, Stefanos Chaliasos, Thodoris Sotiropoulos, Zhendong Su

**Updated**: 2025-08-24T20:51:06Z

**Summary**: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are the cornerstone of programmable cryptography. They enable (1) privacy-preserving and verifiable computation across blockchains, and (2) an expanding range of off-chain applications such as credential schemes. Zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs) lower the barrier by turning ZKPs into a drop-in backend for standard compilation pipelines. This lets developers write proof-generating programs in conventional languages (e.g., Rust or C++) instead of hand-crafting arithmetic circuits. However, these VMs inherit compiler infrastructures tuned for traditional architectures rather than for proof systems. In particular, standard compiler optimizations assume features that are absent in zkVMs, including cache locality, branch prediction, or instruction-level parallelism. Therefore, their impact on proof generation is questionable.   We present the first systematic study of the impact of compiler optimizations on zkVMs. We evaluate 64 LLVM passes, six standard optimization levels, and an unoptimized baseline across 58 benchmarks on two RISC-V-based zkVMs (RISC Zero and SP1). While standard LLVM optimization levels do improve zkVM performance (over 40\%), their impact is far smaller than on traditional CPUs, since their decisions rely on hardware features rather than proof constraints. Guided by a fine-grained pass-level analysis, we~\emph{slightly} refine a small set of LLVM passes to be zkVM-aware, improving zkVM execution time by up to 45\% (average +4.6\% on RISC Zero, +1\% on SP1) and achieving consistent proving-time gains. Our work highlights the potential of compiler-level optimizations for zkVM performance and opens new direction for zkVM-specific passes, backends, and superoptimizers.

### Practical Insertion-Only Convex Hull
**Authors**: Ivor van der Hoog, Henrik Reinstädtler, Eva Rotenberg

**Updated**: 2025-08-24T19:28:22Z

**Summary**: Convex hull data structures are fundamental in computational geometry. We study insertion-only data structures, supporting various containment and intersection queries. When $P$ is sorted by $x$- or $y$-coordinate, convex hulls can be constructed in linear time using classical algorithms such as Graham scan. We investigate a variety of methods tailored to the insertion-only setting. We explore a broad selection of trade-offs involving robustness, memory access patterns, and space usage, providing an extensive evaluation of both existing and novel techniques. Logarithmic-time methods rely on pointer-based tree structures, which suffer in practice due to poor memory locality. Motivated by this, we develop a vector-based solution inspired by Overmars' logarithmic method. Our structure has worse asymptotic bounds, supporting queries in $O(\log^2 n)$ time, but stores data in $O(\log n)$ contiguous vectors, greatly improving cache performance.   Through empirical evaluation on real-world and synthetic data sets, we uncover surprising trends. Let $h$ denote the size of the convex hull. We show that a na\"ive $O(h)$ insertion-only algorithm based on Graham scan consistently outperforms both theoretical and practical state-of-the-art methods under realistic workloads, even on data sets with rather large convex hulls. While tree-based methods with $O(\log h)$ update times offer solid theoretical guarantees, they are never optimal in practice. In contrast, our vector-based logarithmic method, despite its theoretically inferior bounds, is highly competitive across all tested scenarios. It is optimal whenever the convex hull becomes large.

**Summary**: Recent advancements in aligning large language models via reinforcement learning have achieved remarkable gains in solving complex reasoning problems, but at the cost of expensive on-policy rollouts and limited exploration of diverse reasoning paths. In this work, we introduce TreePO, involving a self-guided rollout algorithm that views sequence generation as a tree-structured searching process. Composed of dynamic tree sampling policy and fixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant additional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update compute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key contributions include: (1) a segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates the KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along with an early-stop mechanism; (2) a tree-based segment-level advantage estimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization. and (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic divergence and fallback strategy. We empirically validate the performance gain of TreePO on a set reasoning benchmarks and the efficiency saving of GPU hours from 22\% up to 43\% of the sampling design for the trained models, meanwhile showing up to 40\% reduction at trajectory-level and 35\% at token-level sampling compute for the existing models. While offering a free lunch of inference efficiency, TreePO reveals a practical path toward scaling RL-based post-training with fewer samples and less compute.

**Authors**: Linwei Dong, Qingnan Fan, Yuhang Yu, Qi Zhang, Jinwei Chen, Yawei Luo, Changqing Zou

**Updated**: 2025-08-24T16:17:33Z

**Summary**: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) focuses on recovering high-quality images from low-resolution inputs that suffer from complex degradations like noise, blur, and compression. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have shown great potential in this area by leveraging strong generative priors to restore fine details. However, their iterative denoising process incurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time applications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and TSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their large, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR, a compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that achieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We introduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy to facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE compression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv. We eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching techniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces computational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83% parameter reduction compared to its teacher TSD-SR, while still providing high quality results.

### DiCache: Let Diffusion Model Determine Its Own Cache
**Authors**: Jiazi Bu, Pengyang Ling, Yujie Zhou, Yibin Wang, Yuhang Zang, Tong Wu, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-24T13:30:00Z

**Summary**: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2) Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image generation.

### TokenLake: A Unified Segment-level Prefix Cache Pool for Fine-grained   Elastic Long-Context LLM Serving
**Authors**: Bingyang Wu, Zili Zhang, Yinmin Zhong, Guanzhe Huang, Yibo Zhu, Xuanzhe Liu, Xin Jin

**Updated**: 2025-08-24T05:45:16Z

**Summary**: Prefix caching is crucial to accelerate multi-turn interactions and requests with shared prefixes. At the cluster level, existing prefix caching systems are tightly coupled with request scheduling to optimize cache efficiency and computation performance together, leading to load imbalance, data redundancy, and memory fragmentation of caching systems across instances. To address these issues, memory pooling is promising to shield the scheduler from the underlying cache management so that it can focus on the computation optimization. However, because existing prefix caching systems only transfer increasingly longer prefix caches between instances, they cannot achieve low-latency memory pooling.   To address these problems, we propose a unified segment-level prefix cache pool, TokenLake. It uses a declarative cache interface to expose requests' query tensors, prefix caches, and cache-aware operations to TokenLake for efficient pooling. Powered by this abstraction, TokenLake can manage prefix cache at the segment level with a heavy-hitter-aware load balancing algorithm to achieve better cache load balance, deduplication, and defragmentation. TokenLake also transparently minimizes the communication volume of query tensors and new caches. Based on TokenLake, the scheduler can schedule requests elastically by using existing techniques without considering prefix cache management. Evaluations on real-world workloads show that TokenLake can improve throughput by up to 2.6$\times$ and 2.0$\times$ and boost hit rate by 2.0$\times$ and 2.1$\times$, compared to state-of-the-art cache-aware routing and cache-centric PD-disaggregation solutions, respectively.

### DPad: Efficient Diffusion Language Models with Suffix Dropout
**Authors**: Xinhua Chen, Sitao Huang, Cong Guo, Chiyue Wei, Yintao He, Jianyi Zhang, Hai "Helen" Li, Yiran Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-23T20:28:45Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) parallelize text generation by framing decoding as a denoising process, but suffer from high computational overhead since they predict all future suffix tokens at each step while retaining only a small fraction. We propose Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad), a training-free method that restricts attention to a small set of nearby suffix tokens, preserving fidelity while eliminating redundancy. DPad integrates two strategies: (i) a sliding window, which maintains a fixed-length suffix window, and (ii) distance-decay dropout, which deterministically removes distant suffix tokens before attention computation. This simple design is compatible with existing optimizations such as prefix caching and can be implemented with only a few lines of code. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks on LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models demonstrate that DPad delivers up to $\mathbf{61.4\times}$ speedup over vanilla dLLMs while maintaining comparable accuracy, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable long-sequence inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/Crys-Chen/DPad.

### MoE-Beyond: Learning-Based Expert Activation Prediction on Edge Devices
**Authors**: Nishant Gavhane, Arush Mehrotra, Rohit Chawla, Peter Proenca

**Updated**: 2025-08-23T20:28:32Z

**Summary**: The deployment of large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on edge devices presents significant challenges due to memory constraints. While MoE architectures enable efficient utilization of computational resources by activating only a subset of experts per inference, they require careful memory management to operate efficiently in resource-constrained environments. Traditional heuristic-based expert caching strategies such as MoE-Infinity struggle to maintain high cache hit rates as models parameters scale. In this work, we introduce MoE-Beyond, a learning-based expert activation predictor trained to predict expert activations during autoregressive decoding. By framing the task as a multi-label sequence prediction problem, we train a lightweight transformer model on 66 million expert activation traces extracted from LDJnr-Puffin dataset [5] using DeepSeek-V2-Chat-Lite MoE. Our predictor generalizes effectively across unseen prompts from WebGLM-QA dataset [6], achieving 97.5% accuracy and an 86.6% F1-score. Simulation results show that MoE-Beyond improves GPU cache hit rate from 17% to 72% when only 10% of experts fit in GPU cache, outperforming heuristic baselines.

### VQL: An End-to-End Context-Aware Vector Quantization Attention for   Ultra-Long User Behavior Modeling
**Authors**: Kaiyuan Li, Yongxiang Tang, Yanhua Cheng, Yong Bai, Yanxiang Zeng, Chao Wang, Xialong Liu, Peng Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-08-23T19:58:18Z

**Summary**: In large-scale recommender systems, ultra-long user behavior sequences encode rich signals of evolving interests. Extending sequence length generally improves accuracy, but directly modeling such sequences in production is infeasible due to latency and memory constraints. Existing solutions fall into two categories: (1) top-k retrieval, which truncates the sequence and may discard most attention mass when L >> k; and (2) encoder-based compression, which preserves coverage but often over-compresses and fails to incorporate key context such as temporal gaps or target-aware signals. Neither class achieves a good balance of low-loss compression, context awareness, and efficiency.   We propose VQL, a context-aware Vector Quantization Attention framework for ultra-long behavior modeling, with three innovations. (1) Key-only quantization: only attention keys are quantized, while values remain intact; we prove that softmax normalization yields an error bound independent of sequence length, and a codebook loss directly supervises quantization quality. This also enables L-free inference via offline caches. (2) Multi-scale quantization: attention heads are partitioned into groups, each with its own small codebook, which reduces quantization error while keeping cache size fixed. (3) Efficient context injection: static features (e.g., item category, modality) are directly integrated, and relative position is modeled via a separable temporal kernel. All context is injected without enlarging the codebook, so cached representations remain query-independent.   Experiments on three large-scale datasets (KuaiRand-1K, KuaiRec, TMALL) show that VQL consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy while reducing inference latency, establishing a new state of the art in balancing accuracy and efficiency for ultra-long sequence recommendation.

### Learned Structure in CARTRIDGES: Keys as Shareable Routers in   Self-Studied Representations
**Authors**: Maurizio Diaz

**Updated**: 2025-08-23T14:20:06Z

**Summary**: A bottleneck for long-context LLM inference is the linearly growing KV cache. Recent work has proposed CARTRIDGES, an approach which leverages offline compute to train a much smaller KV cache than is typically required for a full document (up to 40x less memory usage at inference time). In this paper, we present the first mechanistic exploration of the learned CARTRIDGE key-value cache structure. In particular, we propose that (1) CARTRIDGE keys act as stable, shareable retrieval routers for the compressed corpora and (2) most of the learned compression occurs within the CARTRIDGE value vectors. We present empirical evidence of our routing theory across tasks, model families, and model sizes; for example, we can ablate the learned CARTRIDGE key vectors between tasks with little performance loss. Finally, we propose a slight improvement in initialization called Sampled Chunk Initialization (SCI). We suggest that SCI can lead to faster CARTRIDGE convergence than previously demonstrated in the literature. Our findings lay the groundwork for broader empirical study of CARTRIDGE training optimization which may be crucial for further scaling.

**Authors**: Liang Feng, Shikang Zheng, Jiacheng Liu, Yuqi Lin, Qinming Zhou, Peiliang Cai, Xinyu Wang, Junjie Chen, Chang Zou, Yue Ma, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-23T10:35:16Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.

### Enhancing Memory Efficiency in Large Language Model Training Through   Chronos-aware Pipeline Parallelism
**Authors**: Xinyuan Lin, Chenlu Li, Zongle Huang, Chunyu Wang, Bo Xiao, Huazhong Yang, Shishi Duan, Yongpan Liu

**Updated**: 2025-08-23T08:40:52Z

**Summary**: Larger model sizes and longer sequence lengths have empowered the Large Language Model (LLM) to achieve outstanding performance across various domains. However, this progress brings significant storage capacity challenges for LLM pretraining. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is expensive and requires more advanced packaging technologies for capacity expansion, creating an urgent need for memory-efficient scheduling strategies. Yet, prior pipeline parallelism schedules have primarily focused on reducing bubble overhead, often neglecting memory efficiency and lacking compatibility with other memory-efficient strategies. Consequently, these methods struggle to meet the storage demands of storage capacity for next-generation LLM. This work presents ChronosPipe, a Chronos-aware pipeline parallelism for memory-efficient LLM pretraining. The core insight of ChronosPipe is to treat HBM as a fast but small 'cache,' optimizing and exploiting temporal locality within LLM pretraining to enhance HBM utilization. ChronosPipe introduces a pipeline scheduling strategy, Chronos-Pipe, to reduce the extrinsic overhead that disrupts the temporal locality of activations. Additionally, it leverages Chronos-Recomp and Chronos-Offload to efficiently harness the intrinsic temporal locality of activations and weights in Deep Neural Networks. Experiment results show that ChronosPipe can expand the trainable model size by 2.4x while maintaining comparable throughput, achieving 1.5x better than the 1F1B strategy combined with recomputation.

### SpecExtend: A Drop-in Enhancement for Speculative Decoding of Long   Sequences
**Authors**: Jungyoub Cha, Hyunjong Kim, Sungzoon Cho

**Updated**: 2025-08-22T08:45:04Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), but its performance degrades on long inputs due to increased attention cost and reduced draft accuracy. We introduce SpecExtend, a drop-in enhancement that improves the performance of speculative decoding on long sequences without any additional training. First, SpecExtend integrates efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention and Hybrid Tree Attention into both the draft and target models. To improve draft accuracy and speed on long inputs without retraining, we propose Cross-model Retrieval, a novel KV cache eviction strategy that uses the target model's attention scores to dynamically select relevant context for the draft model. Extensive evaluations on three long-context understanding datasets show that SpecExtend accelerates standard tree-based speculative decoding by up to 2.22x for inputs up to 16K tokens, providing an effective solution for speculative decoding of long sequences. Our code is available at https://github.com/jycha98/SpecExtend .

### Forecast then Calibrate: Feature Caching as ODE for Efficient Diffusion   Transformers
**Authors**: Shikang Zheng, Liang Feng, Xinyu Wang, Qinming Zhou, Peiliang Cai, Chang Zou, Jiacheng Liu, Yuqi Lin, Junjie Chen, Yue Ma, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-22T08:34:03Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps. However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE. We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

### Joint Cache Placement and Routing in Satellite-Terrestrial Edge   Computing Network: A GNN-Enabled DRL Approach
**Authors**: Yuhao Zheng, Ting You, Kejia Peng, Chang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-08-22T07:57:28Z

**Summary**: In this letter, we investigate the problem of joint content caching and routing in satellite-terrestrial edge computing networks (STECNs) to improve caching service for geographically distributed users. To handle the challenges arising from dynamic low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite topologies and heterogeneous content demands, we propose a learning-based framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The satellite network is represented as a dynamic graph, where GNNs are embedded within the DRL agent to capture spatial and topological dependencies and support routing-aware decision-making. The caching strategy is optimized by formulating the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and applying soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the delivery success rate and reduces communication traffic cost.

### CommonKV: Compressing KV Cache with Cross-layer Parameter Sharing
**Authors**: Yixuan Wang, Haoyu Qiao, Lujun Li, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che

**Updated**: 2025-08-22T06:55:45Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters, resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without significant performance loss.

### Lightweight and Fast Real-time Image Enhancement via Decomposition of   the Spatial-aware Lookup Tables
**Authors**: Wontae Kim, Keuntek Lee, Nam Ik Cho

**Updated**: 2025-08-22T06:28:24Z

**Summary**: The image enhancement methods based on 3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) efficiently reduce both model size and runtime by interpolating pre-calculated values at the vertices. However, the 3D LUT methods have a limitation due to their lack of spatial information, as they convert color values on a point-by-point basis. Although spatial-aware 3D LUT methods address this limitation, they introduce additional modules that require a substantial number of parameters, leading to increased runtime as image resolution increases. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating image-adaptive LUTs by focusing on the redundant parts of the tables. Our efficient framework decomposes a 3D LUT into a linear sum of low-dimensional LUTs and employs singular value decomposition (SVD). Furthermore, we enhance the modules for spatial feature fusion to be more cache-efficient. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model effectively decreases both the number of parameters and runtime while maintaining spatial awareness and performance.

### Dynamic Optimization of Storage Systems Using Reinforcement Learning   Techniques
**Authors**: Chiyu Cheng, Chang Zhou, Yang Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-08-22T03:36:44Z

**Summary**: The exponential growth of data-intensive applications has placed unprecedented demands on modern storage systems, necessitating dynamic and efficient optimization strategies. Traditional heuristics employed for storage performance optimization often fail to adapt to the variability and complexity of contemporary workloads, leading to significant performance bottlenecks and resource inefficiencies. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RL-Storage, a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework designed to dynamically optimize storage system configurations. RL-Storage leverages deep Q-learning algorithms to continuously learn from real-time I/O patterns and predict optimal storage parameters, such as cache size, queue depths, and readahead settings[1].This work underscores the transformative potential of reinforcement learning techniques in addressing the dynamic nature of modern storage systems. By autonomously adapting to workload variations in real time, RL-Storage provides a robust and scalable solution for optimizing storage performance, paving the way for next-generation intelligent storage infrastructures.

### Multi-Cache Enhanced Prototype Learning for Test-Time Generalization of   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Xinyu Chen, Haotian Zhai, Can Zhang, Xiupeng Shi, Ruirui Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-21T20:13:40Z

**Summary**: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance.

**Summary**: Modern large language model (LLM) serving systems face challenges from highly variable requests with diverse lengths, priorities, and stage-specific service-level objectives (SLOs). Meeting these requires real-time scheduling, rapid and cost-effective scaling, and support for both collocated and disaggregated Prefill/Decode (P/D) architectures.   We present \textbf{HyperFlexis}, a unified LLM serving system that integrates algorithmic and system-level innovations to jointly optimize scheduling and scaling under multiple SLOs. It features a multi-SLO-aware scheduler that leverages budget estimation and request prioritization to ensure proactive SLO compliance for both new and ongoing requests. The system supports prefill- and decode-stage multi-SLO scheduling for P/D-disaggregated architectures and KV cache transfers. It also enables cost-effective scaling decisions, prefill-decode instance linking during scaling, and rapid P/D role transitions. To accelerate scaling and reduce cold-start latency, a device-to-device (D2D) weight transfer mechanism is proposed that lowers weight loading overhead by up to \textbf{19.39$\times$}. These optimizations allow the system to achieve up to \textbf{4.44$\times$} higher SLO attainment, \textbf{65.82\%} lower request latency, and cost parity with state-of-the-art baselines. The code will be released soon.

### StreamMem: Query-Agnostic KV Cache Memory for Streaming Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Yanlai Yang, Zhuokai Zhao, Satya Narayan Shukla, Aashu Singh, Shlok Kumar Mishra, Lizhu Zhang, Mengye Ren

**Updated**: 2025-08-21T16:56:29Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios. Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware compression approaches.

**Summary**: Graph-based high-dimensional vector indices have become a mainstream solution for large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS). However, their substantial memory footprint often requires storage on secondary devices, where frequent on-demand loading of graph and vector data leads to I/O becoming the dominant bottleneck, accounting for over 90\% of query latency. Existing static caching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase by preloading entry points and multi-hop neighbors, but they fail in the second phase where query-dependent nodes must be dynamically accessed to achieve high recall. We propose GoVector, an I/O-efficient caching strategy tailored for disk-based graph indices. GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores entry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that adaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search phase. To further align storage layout with similarity-driven search patterns, GoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the same or adjacent pages, thereby improving locality and reducing I/O overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that GoVector achieves substantial performance improvements. At 90% recall, it reduces I/O operations by 46% on average, increases query throughput by 1.73x, and lowers query latency by 42% compared to state-of-the-art disk-based graph indexing systems.

### CausalMesh: A Formally Verified Causal Cache for Stateful Serverless   Computing
**Authors**: Haoran Zhang, Zihao Zhang, Shuai Mu, Sebastian Angel, Vincent Liu

**Updated**: 2025-08-21T15:25:30Z

**Summary**: Stateful serverless workflows consist of multiple serverless functions that access state on a remote database. Developers sometimes add a cache layer between the serverless runtime and the database to improve I/O latency. However, in a serverless environment, functions in the same workflow may be scheduled to different nodes with different caches, which can cause non-intuitive anomalies. This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to causally consistent caching in environments where a computation may migrate from one machine to another, such as in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers. CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the presence of client roaming, but at the cost of abort-freedom.   We have formally verified CausalMesh's protocol in Dafny, and our experimental evaluation shows that CausalMesh has lower latency and higher throughput than existing proposals

### GATEBLEED: Exploiting On-Core Accelerator Power Gating for High   Performance & Stealthy Attacks on AI
**Authors**: Joshua Kalyanapu, Farshad Dizani, Darsh Asher, Azam Ghanbari, Rosario Cammarota, Aydin Aysu, Samira Mirbagher Ajorpaz

**Updated**: 2025-08-21T14:58:12Z

**Summary**: As power consumption from AI training and inference continues to increase, AI accelerators are being integrated directly into the CPU. Intel's Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) is one such example, debuting on the 4th generation Intel Xeon Scalable CPU. We discover a timing side and covert channel, GATEBLEED, caused by the aggressive power gating utilized to keep the CPU within operating limits. We show that the GATEBLEED side channel is a threat to AI privacy as many ML models such as transformers and CNNs make critical computationally-heavy decisions based on private values like confidence thresholds and routing logits. Timing delays from selective powering down of AMX components mean that each matrix multiplication is a potential leakage point when executed on the AMX accelerator. Our research identifies over a dozen potential gadgets across popular ML libraries (HuggingFace, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.), revealing that they can leak sensitive and private information. GATEBLEED poses a risk for local and remote timing inference, even under previous protective measures. GATEBLEED can be used as a high performance, stealthy remote covert channel and a generic magnifier for timing transmission channels, capable of bypassing traditional cache defenses to leak arbitrary memory addresses and evading state of the art microarchitectural attack detectors under realistic network conditions and system configurations in which previous attacks fail. We implement an end-to-end microarchitectural inference attack on a transformer model optimized with Intel AMX, achieving a membership inference accuracy of 81% and a precision of 0.89. In a CNN-based or transformer-based mixture-of-experts model optimized with Intel AMX, we leak expert choice with 100% accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first side-channel attack on AI privacy that exploits hardware optimizations.

**Authors**: Li Zhang, Youhe Jiang, Guoliang He, Xin Chen, Han Lv, Qian Yao, Fangcheng Fu, Kai Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-21T14:24:52Z

**Summary**: Mixed-precision inference techniques reduce the memory and computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying hybrid precision formats to model weights, activations, and KV caches. This work introduces mixed-precision LLM inference techniques that encompass (i) systematic memory and compute optimization across hierarchical storage and tensor core architectures, and (ii) comprehensive end-to-end mixed-precision optimization across diverse precision formats and hardware configurations. Our approach features two novel mixed-precision pipelines designed for optimal hardware utilization: a General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) pipeline that optimizes matrix operations through offline weight packing and online acceleration, and an attention pipeline that enables efficient attention computation with arbitrary Query, Key, and Value precision combinations. The key implementation of the pipelines includes (i) hardware-aware weight packing for automatic format optimization, (ii) adaptive head alignment for efficient attention computation, (iii) instruction-level parallelism for memory hierarchy exploitation, and (iv) KV memory loading pipeline for enhanced inference efficiency. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across 16 popular LLMs and 4 representative GPU architectures. Results demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 61% lower serving latency (30% on average) and up to 156% higher throughput (58% on average) in mixed-precision workloads compared to existing mixed-precision frameworks, establishing consistent performance improvements across all tested configurations and hardware types. This work is integrated into TurboMind, a high-performance inference engine of the LMDeploy project, which is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy.

### Time-Optimal Directed q-Analysis
**Authors**: Felix Windisch, Florian Unger

**Updated**: 2025-08-21T13:57:09Z

**Summary**: Directed q-analysis is a recent extension of q-analysis, an established method for extracting structure from networks, to directed graphs. Until recently, a lack of efficient algorithms heavily restricted the application of this technique: Previous approaches scale with the square of the input size, which is also the maximal size of the output, rendering such approaches worst-case optimal. In practice, output sizes of relevant networks are usually far from the worst case, a fact that could be exploited by an (efficient) output-sensitive algorithm. We develop such an algorithm and formally describe it in detail. The key insight, obtained by carefully studying various approaches to directed q-analysis and how they relate to each other, is that inverting the order of computation leads to significant complexity gains. Targeted precomputation and caching tactics further reduce the introduced overhead, enough to achieve (under mild assumptions) a time complexity that is linear in output size. The resulting algorithm for performing directed q-analysis is shown to be time-optimal.

## Keyword: LLM Inference 
 ### Can LLMs Lie? Investigation beyond Hallucination
**Authors**: Haoran Huan, Mihir Prabhudesai, Mengning Wu, Shantanu Jaiswal, Deepak Pathak

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:59:45Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics, shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in high-stakes environments.

### Easier Painting Than Thinking: Can Text-to-Image Models Set the Stage,   but Not Direct the Play?
**Authors**: Ouxiang Li, Yuan Wang, Xinting Hu, Huijuan Huang, Rui Chen, Jiarong Ou, Xin Tao, Pengfei Wan, Fuli Feng

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:58:12Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile, these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive, inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements from prompts.

### Bayesian Multivariate Sparse Functional PCA
**Authors**: Joseph Sartini, Scott Zeger, Ciprian Crainiceanu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:52:16Z

**Summary**: Functional Principal Components Analysis (FPCA) provides a parsimonious, semi-parametric model for multivariate, sparsely-observed functional data. Frequentist FPCA approaches estimate principal components (PCs) from the data, then condition on these estimates in subsequent analyses. As an alternative, we propose a fully Bayesian inferential framework for multivariate, sparse functional data (MSFAST) which explicitly models the PCs and incorporates their uncertainty. MSFAST builds upon the FAST approach to FPCA for univariate, densely-observed functional data. Like FAST, MSFAST represents PCs using orthonormal splines, samples the orthonormal spline coefficients using parameter expansion, and enforces eigenvalue ordering during model fit. MSFAST extends FAST to multivariate, sparsely-observed data by (1) standardizing each functional covariate to mitigate poor posterior conditioning due to disparate scales; (2) using a better-suited orthogonal spline basis; (3) parallelizing likelihood calculations over covariates; (4) updating parameterizations and priors for computational stability; (5) using a Procrustes-based posterior alignment procedure; and (6) providing efficient prediction routines. We evaluated MSFAST alongside existing implementations using simulations. MSFAST produces uniquely valid inferences and accurate estimates, particularly for smaller signals. MSFAST is motivated by and applied to a study of child growth, with an accompanying vignette illustrating the implementation step-by-step.

### Emulating compact binary population synthesis simulations with   uncertainty quantification and model comparison using Bayesian normalizing   flows
**Authors**: Anarya Ray

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:47:46Z

**Summary**: Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences~(CBCs) play a crucial role in extracting astrophysical insights from an ensemble of gravitational wave~(GW) observations. However, realistic simulations can be costly to implement for a dense grid of initial conditions. Normalizing flows can emulate population synthesis runs to enable simulation-based inference from observed catalogs and data augmentation for feature prediction in rarely synthesizable sub-populations. However, flow predictions can be wrought with uncertainties, especially for sparse training sets. In this work, we develop a method for quantifying and marginalizing uncertainties in the emulators by implementing the Bayesian Normalizing flow, a conditional density estimator constructed from Bayesian neural networks. Using the exact likelihood function naturally associated with density estimators, we sample the posterior distribution of flow parameters with suitably chosen priors to quantify and marginalize over flow uncertainties. We demonstrate the accuracy, calibration, inference, and data-augmentation impacts of the estimated uncertainties for simulations of binary black hole populations formed through common envelope evolution. We outline the applications of the proposed methodology in the context of simulation-based inference from growing GW catalogs and feature prediction, with state-of-the-art binary evolution simulators, now marginalized over model and data uncertainties.

### Sharp Bounds on the Variance of General Regression Adjustment in   Randomized Experiments
**Authors**: Jonas M. Mikhaeil, Donald P. Green

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:45:56Z

**Summary**: A growing statistical literature focuses on causal inference in the context of experiments where the target of inference is the average treatment effect in a finite population and random assignment determines which subjects are allocated to one of the experimental conditions. In this framework, variances of average treatment effect estimators remain unidentified because they depend on the covariance between treated and untreated potential outcomes, which are never jointly observed. Conventional variance estimators are upwardly biased. Aronow, Green and Lee [Ann. Statist. 42(3): 850-871 (June 2014)] provide an estimator for the variance of the difference-in-means estimator that is asymptotically sharp. In practice, researchers often use some form of covariate adjustment, such as linear regression, when estimating the average treatment effect. Adapting propositions from empirical process theory, we extend the result in (Aronow et al., 2014), providing asymptotically sharp variance bounds for general regression adjustment. We apply these results to linear regression adjustment and show benefits both in a simulation and in three empirical applications drawn from different disciplines.

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:39:08Z

**Summary**: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid, training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio, missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification, regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

### Strefer: Empowering Video LLMs with Space-Time Referring and Reasoning   via Synthetic Instruction Data
**Authors**: Honglu Zhou, Xiangyu Peng, Shrikant Kendre, Michael S. Ryoo, Silvio Savarese, Caiming Xiong, Juan Carlos Niebles

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:33:20Z

**Summary**: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments. Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally, these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

### OneCAT: Decoder-Only Auto-Regressive Model for Unified Understanding and   Generation
**Authors**: Han Li, Xinyu Peng, Yaoming Wang, Zelin Peng, Xin Chen, Rongxiang Weng, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai, Wenrui Dai, Hongkai Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:29:50Z

**Summary**: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR) objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding.

### Parameter-Efficient Adaptation of mPLUG-Owl2 via Pixel-Level Visual   Prompts for NR-IQA
**Authors**: Yahya Benmahane, Mohammed El Hassouni

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:23:24Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our approach trains only 600K parameters at most (< 0.01% of the base model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference, these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image." Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space visual prompts for NR-IQA, enabling efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level vision tasks. The source code is publicly available at https: // github. com/ yahya-ben/ mplug2-vp-for-nriqa .

### On Entropy Control in LLM-RL Algorithms
**Authors**: Han Shen

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:23:19Z

**Summary**: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits. AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently across multiple benchmarks.

### LLM Embedding-based Attribution (LEA): Quantifying Source Contributions   to Generative Model's Response for Vulnerability Analysis
**Authors**: Reza Fayyazi, Michael Zuzak, Shanchieh Jay Yang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:18:40Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for cybersecurity threat analysis, but their deployment in security-sensitive environments raises trust and safety concerns. With over 21,000 vulnerabilities disclosed in 2025, manual analysis is infeasible, making scalable and verifiable AI support critical. When querying LLMs, dealing with emerging vulnerabilities is challenging as they have a training cut-off date. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can inject up-to-date context to alleviate the cut-off date limitation, it remains unclear how much LLMs rely on retrieved evidence versus the model's internal knowledge, and whether the retrieved information is meaningful or even correct. This uncertainty could mislead security analysts, mis-prioritize patches, and increase security risks. Therefore, this work proposes LLM Embedding-based Attribution (LEA) to analyze the generated responses for vulnerability exploitation analysis. More specifically, LEA quantifies the relative contribution of internal knowledge vs. retrieved content in the generated responses. We evaluate LEA on 500 critical vulnerabilities disclosed between 2016 and 2025, across three RAG settings -- valid, generic, and incorrect -- using three state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate LEA's ability to detect clear distinctions between non-retrieval, generic-retrieval, and valid-retrieval scenarios with over 95% accuracy on larger models. Finally, we demonstrate the limitations posed by incorrect retrieval of vulnerability information and raise a cautionary note to the cybersecurity community regarding the blind reliance on LLMs and RAG for vulnerability analysis. LEA offers security analysts with a metric to audit RAG-enhanced workflows, improving the transparent and trustworthy deployment of AI in cybersecurity threat analysis.

### SimpleTIR: End-to-End Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn   Tool-Integrated Reasoning
**Authors**: Zhenghai Xue, Longtao Zheng, Qian Liu, Yingru Li, Xiaosen Zheng, Zejun Ma, Bo An

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:06:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly improve their reasoning capabilities by interacting with external tools, a paradigm known as Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and performance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by a distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing catastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter out trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code block nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the policy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude gradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show that SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math reasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model. Furthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR encourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns, such as self-correction and cross-validation.

### Efficiently Editing Mixture-of-Experts Models with Compressed Experts
**Authors**: Yifei He, Yang Liu, Chen Liang, Hany Hassan Awadalla

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:06:38Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become a key approach for scaling large language models efficiently by activating only a subset of experts during training and inference. Typically, the number of activated experts presents a trade-off: fewer experts reduce computational costs, while more experts improve performance. Recent studies reveal that not all activated experts contribute equally to model performance, with some providing minimal utility, particularly when finetuning pretrained MoE models for specialized downstream tasks. The co-existence of significant and redundant parameters in experts provides us an opportunity to reduce the number of activated experts while maintaining model performance. In this work, we propose the concept of compressed experts, lightweight modules that serve as compact representations of full experts. Our approach preserves the most important experts while replacing other auxiliary activated experts with compressed experts. The reduction of active parameters significantly lowers inference costs while achieving comparable performance. Extensive experiments on models including Phi-MoE and OLMoE demonstrate that compressed experts recover over 90% of full expert performance across various tasks while reducing more than 30% active parameters and saving 20% in inference costs. This approach enables efficient deployment of MoE models in resource-constrained settings and facilitates scaling to larger models with manageable overhead. Our code is available at https://github.com/yifei-he/Compressed-Experts.

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:03:15Z

**Summary**: Automated agents, powered by Large language models (LLMs), are emerging as the go-to tool for querying information. However, evaluation benchmarks for LLM agents rarely feature natural questions that are both information-seeking and genuinely time-consuming for humans. To address this gap we introduce MoNaCo, a benchmark of 1,315 natural and time-consuming questions that require dozens, and at times hundreds, of intermediate steps to solve -- far more than any existing QA benchmark. To build MoNaCo, we developed a decomposed annotation pipeline to elicit and manually answer real-world time-consuming questions at scale. Frontier LLMs evaluated on MoNaCo achieve at most 61.2% F1, hampered by low recall and hallucinations. Our results underscore the limitations of LLM-powered agents in handling the complexity and sheer breadth of real-world information-seeking tasks -- with MoNaCo providing an effective resource for tracking such progress. The MoNaCo benchmark, codebase, prompts and models predictions are all publicly available at: https://tomerwolgithub.github.io/monaco

**Summary**: Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled (PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2) a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

### The Impact of Critique on LLM-Based Model Generation from Natural   Language: The Case of Activity Diagrams
**Authors**: Parham Khamsepour, Mark Cole, Ish Ashraf, Sandeep Puri, Mehrdad Sabetzadeh, Shiva Nejati

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T16:39:25Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong potential for automating the generation of models from natural-language descriptions. A common approach is an iterative generate-critique-refine loop, where candidate models are produced, evaluated, and updated based on detected issues. This process needs to address: (1) structural correctness - compliance with well-formedness rules - and (2) semantic alignment - accurate reflection of the intended meaning in the source text. We present LADEX (LLM-based Activity Diagram Extractor), a pipeline for deriving activity diagrams from natural-language process descriptions using an LLM-driven critique-refine process. Structural checks in LADEX can be performed either algorithmically or by an LLM, while alignment checks are always performed by an LLM. We design five ablated variants of LADEX to study: (i) the impact of the critique-refine loop itself, (ii) the role of LLM-based semantic checks, and (iii) the comparative effectiveness of algorithmic versus LLM-based structural checks.   To evaluate LADEX, we compare the generated activity diagrams with expert-created ground truths using trace-based operational semantics. This enables automated measurement of correctness and completeness. Experiments on two datasets indicate that: (1) the critique-refine loop improves structural validity, correctness, and completeness compared to single-pass generation; (2) algorithmic structural checks eliminate inconsistencies that LLM-based checks fail to detect, improving correctness by an average of 17.81% and completeness by 13.24% over LLM-only checks; and (3) combining algorithmic structural checks with LLM-based semantic checks, implemented using the reasoning-focused O4 Mini, achieves the best overall performance - yielding average correctness of up to 86.37% and average completeness of up to 88.56% - while requiring fewer than five LLM calls on average.

### sam-llm: interpretable lane change trajectoryprediction via parametric   finetuning
**Authors**: Zhuo Cao, Yunxiao Shi, Min Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T16:37:49Z

**Summary**: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete, continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.

### Rapid Word Learning Through Meta In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Wentao Wang, Guangyuan Jiang, Tal Linzen, Brenden M. Lake

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T16:36:17Z

**Summary**: Humans can quickly learn a new word from a few illustrative examples, and then systematically and flexibly use it in novel contexts. Yet the abilities of current language models for few-shot word learning, and methods for improving these abilities, are underexplored. In this study, we introduce a novel method, Meta-training for IN-context learNing Of Words (Minnow). This method trains language models to generate new examples of a word's usage given a few in-context examples, using a special placeholder token to represent the new word. This training is repeated on many new words to develop a general word-learning ability. We find that training models from scratch with Minnow on human-scale child-directed language enables strong few-shot word learning, comparable to a large language model (LLM) pre-trained on orders of magnitude more data. Furthermore, through discriminative and generative evaluations, we demonstrate that finetuning pre-trained LLMs with Minnow improves their ability to discriminate between new words, identify syntactic categories of new words, and generate reasonable new usages and definitions for new words, based on one or a few in-context examples. These findings highlight the data efficiency of Minnow and its potential to improve language model performance in word learning tasks.

### Comparison of Halo Model and Simulation Predictions for Projected-Field   Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Cross-Correlations
**Authors**: Michael Jacob Rodriguez, Aleksandra Kusiak, Shivam Pandey, J. Colin Hill

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T16:33:04Z

**Summary**: The kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a powerful probe of gas physics and large-scale structure (LSS) in our universe. We consider the "projected-field" kSZ estimator, which involves cross-correlating a foreground-cleaned, filtered, squared CMB temperature map with an LSS tracer, and requires no individual tracer redshifts. We compare $\verb|class_sz|$ halo model calculations of projected-field kSZ cross-correlations with measurements of these signals from the Websky numerical simulations. We cross-correlate halo density maps from Websky with various CMB secondary signals. We first validate our halo model by comparing its predictions for thermal SZ (tSZ) and patchy screening ($\tau$) cross-correlations to measurements of these signals from Websky. We consider three different halo redshift ranges in our comparisons. We also construct our own kSZ, tSZ, and $\tau$ maps to validate the form of the relevant profiles. Following the tSZ and $\tau$ validation, we compare projected-field kSZ calculations between the halo model and the simulations. We use filters constructed for $\textit{Planck}$ and the Simons Observatory (SO) to assess the accuracy of the halo-model kSZ predictions for experiments of differing sensitivity. Overall, we find good agreement, particularly at $\textit{Planck}$ sensitivity. However, we find an $\approx$ 20$\%$ difference between our halo model and the simulations for SO, which significantly exceeds the predicted error bars. We note that our halo model includes only the dominant expected term in the projected-field kSZ signal; the magnitude of the difference between our model and the simulations is consistent with previous predictions for terms arising from other contractions in the theory calculation. These terms will need to be included to obtain unbiased inference from upcoming projected-field kSZ measurements.

### Bayesian Quantum Amplitude Estimation
**Authors**: Alexandra Ramôa, Luis Paulo Santos

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T12:13:47Z

**Summary**: We present BAE, a problem-tailored and noise-aware Bayesian algorithm for quantum amplitude estimation. In a fault tolerant scenario, BAE is capable of saturating the Heisenberg limit; if device noise is present, BAE can dynamically characterize it and self-adapt. We further propose aBAE, an annealed variant of BAE drawing on methods from statistical inference, to enhance robustness. Our proposals are parallelizable in both quantum and classical components, offer tools for fast noise model assessment, and can leverage preexisting information. Additionally, they accommodate experimental limitations and preferred cost trade-offs. We propose a robust benchmark for amplitude estimation algorithms and use it to test BAE against other approaches, demonstrating its competitive performance in both noisy and noiseless scenarios. In both cases, it achieves lower error than any other algorithm as a function of the cost. In the presence of decoherence, it is capable of learning when other algorithms fail.

### RouteNet-Gauss: Hardware-Enhanced Network Modeling with Machine Learning
**Authors**: Carlos Güemes-Palau, Miquel Ferriol-Galmés, Jordi Paillisse-Vilanova, Albert López-Brescó, Pere Barlet-Ros, Albert Cabellos-Aparicio

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T16:19:20Z

**Summary**: Network simulation is pivotal in network modeling, assisting with tasks ranging from capacity planning to performance estimation. Traditional approaches such as Discrete Event Simulation (DES) face limitations in terms of computational cost and accuracy. This paper introduces RouteNet-Gauss, a novel integration of a testbed network with a Machine Learning (ML) model to address these challenges. By using the testbed as a hardware accelerator, RouteNet-Gauss generates training datasets rapidly and simulates network scenarios with high fidelity to real-world conditions. Experimental results show that RouteNet-Gauss significantly reduces prediction errors by up to 95% and achieves a 488x speedup in inference time compared to state-of-the-art DES-based methods. RouteNet-Gauss's modular architecture is dynamically constructed based on the specific characteristics of the network scenario, such as topology and routing. This enables it to understand and generalize to different network configurations beyond those seen during training, including networks up to 10x larger. Additionally, it supports Temporal Aggregated Performance Estimation (TAPE), providing configurable temporal granularity and maintaining high accuracy in flow performance metrics. This approach shows promise in improving both simulation efficiency and accuracy, offering a valuable tool for network operators.

### A DbC Inspired Neurosymbolic Layer for Trustworthy Agent Design
**Authors**: Claudiu Leoveanu-Condrei

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T16:15:16Z

**Summary**: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs, coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance. The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with respect to those contracts.

### The Ramon Llull's Thinking Machine for Automated Ideation
**Authors**: Xinran Zhao, Boyuan Zheng, Chenglei Si, Haofei Yu, Ken Liu, Runlong Zhou, Ruochen Li, Tong Chen, Xiang Li, Yiming Zhang, Tongshuang Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T16:14:12Z

**Summary**: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g., efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work - motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

### Group-in-Group Policy Optimization for LLM Agent Training
**Authors**: Lang Feng, Zhenghai Xue, Tingcong Liu, Bo An

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T16:13:41Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in group-based reinforcement learning (RL) have driven frontier large language models (LLMs) in single-turn tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, their scalability to long-horizon LLM agent training remains limited. Unlike static tasks, agent-environment interactions unfold over many steps and often yield sparse or delayed rewards, making credit assignment across individual steps significantly more challenging. In this work, we propose Group-in-Group Policy Optimization (GiGPO), a novel RL algorithm that achieves fine-grained credit assignment for LLM agents while preserving the appealing properties of group-based RL: critic-free, low memory, and stable convergence. GiGPO introduces a two-level structure for estimating relative advantage: (i) At the episode-level, GiGPO computes macro relative advantages based on groups of complete trajectories; (ii) At the step-level, GiGPO introduces an anchor state grouping mechanism that retroactively constructs step-level groups by identifying repeated environment states across trajectories. Actions stemming from the same state are grouped together, enabling micro relative advantage estimation. This hierarchical structure effectively captures both global trajectory quality and local step effectiveness without relying on auxiliary models or additional rollouts. We evaluate GiGPO on two challenging agent benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, using Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Crucially, GiGPO delivers fine-grained per-step credit signals and achieves performance gains of > 12\% on ALFWorld and > 9\% on WebShop over the GRPO baseline: all while maintaining the same GPU memory overhead, identical LLM rollout, and incurring little to no additional time cost.

### Federated Learning: An approach with Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption
**Authors**: Pedro Correia, Ivan Silva, Ivone Amorim, Eva Maia, Isabel Praça

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:58:22Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach that promises privacy by keeping the data on the device. However, gradient reconstruction and membership-inference attacks show that model updates still leak information. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) can address those privacy concerns but it suffers from ciphertext expansion and requires prohibitive overhead on resource-constrained devices. We propose the first Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE) framework for FL that pairs the PASTA symmetric cipher with the BFV FHE scheme. Clients encrypt local model updates with PASTA and send both the lightweight ciphertexts and the PASTA key (itself BFV-encrypted) to the server, which performs a homomorphic evaluation of the decryption circuit of PASTA and aggregates the resulting BFV ciphertexts. A prototype implementation, developed on top of the Flower FL framework, shows that on independently and identically distributed MNIST dataset with 12 clients and 10 training rounds, the proposed HHE system achieves 97.6% accuracy, just 1.3% below plaintext, while reducing client upload bandwidth by over 2,000x and cutting client runtime by 30% compared to a system based solely on the BFV FHE scheme. However, server computational cost increases by roughly 15621x for each client participating in the training phase, a challenge to be addressed in future work.

### 10,000 Resolved Triples from Gaia: Empirical Constraints on Triple Star   Populations
**Authors**: Cheyanne Shariat, Kareem El-Badry, Smadar Naoz

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:54:53Z

**Summary**: We present a catalog of $\sim 10,000$ resolved triple star systems within 500 pc of the Sun, constructed using Gaia data. The triples include main-sequence, red giant, and white dwarf components spanning separations of 10 to 50,000 au. A well-characterized selection function allows us to constrain intrinsic demographics of the triple star population. We find that (a) all systems are compatible with being hierarchical and dynamically stable; (b) mutual orbital inclinations are isotropic for wide triples but show modest alignment as the systems become more compact; (c) primary masses follow a Kroupa initial mass function weighted by the triple fraction; (d) inner binary orbital periods, eccentricities, and mass ratios mirror those of isolated binaries, including a pronounced twin excess (mass ratios greater than 0.95) out to separations of 1000+ au, suggesting a common formation pathway; (e) tertiary mass ratios follow a power-law distribution with slope $-1.4$; (f) tertiary orbits are consistent with a log-normal period distribution and thermal eccentricities, subject to dynamical stability. Informed by these observations, we develop a publicly available prescription for generating mock triple star populations. Finally, we estimate the catalog's completeness and infer the intrinsic triple fraction, which rises steadily with primary mass: from $5\%$ at $\lesssim 0.5\,{\rm M_\odot}$ to $35\%$ at $2\,{\rm M_\odot}$. The public catalog provides a robust testbed for models of triple star formation and evolution.

### Learning Reaction-Diffusion Kinetics from Mechanical Information
**Authors**: Royal C. Ihuaenyi, Hongbo Zhao, Ruqing Fang, Ruobing Bai, Martin Z. Bazant, Juner Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:54:09Z

**Summary**: A central challenge in materials science is characterizing chemical processes that are elusive to direct measurement, particularly in functional materials operating under realistic conditions. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical strain fields contain sufficient information to reconstruct hidden chemical kinetics in coupled chemomechanical systems. Our partial differential equation-constrained learning framework decodes concentration-dependent diffusion kinetics, thermodynamic driving forces, and spatially heterogeneous reaction rates solely from mechanical observations. Using battery electrode materials as a model system, we demonstrate that the framework can accurately identify complex constitutive laws governing three distinct scenarios: classical Fickian diffusion, spinodal decomposition with pattern formation, and heterogeneous electrochemical reactions with spatial rate variations. The approach demonstrates robustness while maintaining accuracy with limited spatial data and reasonable experimental noise levels. Most significantly, the framework simultaneously infers multiple fundamental processes and properties, including diffusivity, reaction kinetics, chemical potential, and spatial heterogeneity maps, all from mechanical information alone. This method establishes a paradigm for materials characterization, enabling accurate learning of chemical processes in energy storage systems, catalysts, and phase-change materials where conventional diagnostics prove difficult. By revealing that mechanical deformation patterns serve as information-rich fingerprints of the underlying chemical processes, this work follows the pathway of inversely learning constitutive laws, with broad implications in materials science and engineering.

### LINKER: Learning Interactions Between Functional Groups and Residues   With Chemical Knowledge-Enhanced Reasoning and Explainability
**Authors**: Phuc Pham, Viet Thanh Duy Nguyen, Truong-Son Hy

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:53:56Z

**Summary**: Accurate identification of interactions between protein residues and ligand functional groups is essential to understand molecular recognition and guide rational drug design. Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth biochemical annotations.

### Problem Solved? Information Extraction Design Space for Layout-Rich   Documents using LLMs
**Authors**: Gaye Colakoglu, Gürkan Solmaz, Jonathan Fürst

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:53:18Z

**Summary**: This paper defines and explores the design space for information extraction (IE) from layout-rich documents using large language models (LLMs). The three core challenges of layout-aware IE with LLMs are 1) data structuring, 2) model engagement, and 3) output refinement. Our study investigates the sub-problems and methods within these core challenges, such as input representation, chunking, prompting, selection of LLMs, and multimodal models. It examines the effect of different design choices through LayIE-LLM, a new, open-source, layout-aware IE test suite, benchmarking against traditional, fine-tuned IE models. The results on two IE datasets show that LLMs require adjustment of the IE pipeline to achieve competitive performance: the optimized configuration found with LayIE-LLM achieves 13.3--37.5 F1 points more than a general-practice baseline configuration using the same LLM. To find a well-working configuration, we develop a one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method that achieves near-optimal results. Our method is only 0.8--1.8 points lower than the best full factorial exploration with a fraction (2.8%) of the required computation. Overall, we demonstrate that, if well-configured, general-purpose LLMs match the performance of specialized models, providing a cost-effective, finetuning-free alternative. Our test-suite is available at https://github.com/gayecolakoglu/LayIE-LLM.

### Curse of Knowledge: When Complex Evaluation Context Benefits yet Biases   LLM Judges
**Authors**: Weiyuan Li, Xintao Wang, Siyu Yuan, Rui Xu, Jiangjie Chen, Qingqing Dong, Yanghua Xiao, Deqing Yang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:48:33Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face increasingly diverse and complex tasks, making reliable evaluation challenging. The paradigm of LLMs as judges has emerged as a scalable solution, yet prior work primarily focuses on simple settings. Their reliability in complex tasks--where multi-faceted rubrics, unstructured reference answers, and nuanced criteria are critical--remains understudied. In this paper, we constructed ComplexEval, a challenge benchmark designed to systematically expose and quantify Auxiliary Information Induced Biases. We systematically investigated and validated 6 previously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios. Key findings reveal: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant susceptibility to these biases, with bias magnitude scaling with task complexity; (2) notably, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) show paradoxical vulnerability. Our in-depth analysis offers crucial insights for improving the accuracy and verifiability of evaluation signals, paving the way for more general and robust evaluation models.

### Pulsations change the structures of massive stars before they explode:   interpreting the nearby supernova SN 2023ixf
**Authors**: Eva Laplace, Vincent A. Bronner, Fabian R. N. Schneider, Philipp Podsiadlowski

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:43:21Z

**Summary**: Massive red supergiants (RSGs) are known to become hydrodynamically unstable before they explode. Still, the vast majority of supernova (SN) models assume RSG progenitors in hydrostatic equilibrium. Here, we self-consistently follow the hydrodynamic evolution of RSGs with different masses and the development of radial envelope pulsations. Pulsations significantly alter the observable pre- and post-SN properties, and their importance increases substantially as a function of initial mass. We demonstrate that inferring core masses, let alone initial masses, from a single pre-SN luminosity and effective temperature of high-mass RSGs is inadvisable, as these can vary by an order of magnitude during the pulsation. We find that pulsations can naturally lead to ``early-excess" emission in SN light curves and to variations in early photospheric velocities, which can help break degeneracies in type-II SNe. We compare to SN~2023ixf, for which a pulsating RSG progenitor was discovered. We demonstrate that its pre- and post-SN characteristics agree very well with our exploding pulsating RSG model, whereas hydrostatic stellar models are not well-suited. The data coverage at early times is insufficient to break all degeneracies, but we find constraints on the explosion phase. We find no evidence for the claimed pulsation period of the SN~2024ggi progenitor, as it matches Spitzer's orbital period. This study underscores the importance of hydrodynamical pre-SN stellar models. It implies an important shift in our understanding of the last stages of massive star evolution, the interpretation of pre-SN properties, the connection between SNe and their progenitors, and the missing RSG problem.

### A Privacy-Preserving Recommender for Filling Web Forms Using a Local   Large Language Model
**Authors**: Amirreza Nayyeri, Abbas Rasoolzadegan

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:43:01Z

**Summary**: Web applications are increasingly used in critical domains such as education, finance, and e-commerce. This highlights the need to ensure their failure-free performance. One effective method for evaluating failure-free performance is web form testing, where defining effective test scenarios is key to a complete and accurate evaluation. A core aspect of this process involves filling form fields with suitable values to create effective test cases. However, manually generating these values is time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this, various tools have been developed to assist testers. With the appearance of large language models (LLMs), a new generation of tools seeks to handle this task more intelligently. Although many LLM-based tools have been introduced, as these models typically rely on cloud infrastructure, their use in testing confidential web forms raises concerns about unintended data leakage and breaches of confidentiality. This paper introduces a privacy-preserving recommender that operates locally using a large language model. The tool assists testers in web form testing by suggesting effective field values. This tool analyzes the HTML structure of forms, detects input types, and extracts constraints based on each field's type and contextual content, guiding proper field filling.

### Learning Mechanism Underlying NLP Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Yarden Tzach, Ronit D. Gross, Ella Koresh, Shalom Rosner, Or Shpringer, Tal Halevi, Ido Kanter

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:32:50Z

**Summary**: Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of meaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture on a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to implement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the mechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay between the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks. The following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT) increased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over all tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which increased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among tokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as inferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened along the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance considerably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently, higher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though the learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token. These pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy along the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction confidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input meaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match tokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image classification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in fine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and fine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.

**Authors**: Yuxuan Huang, Yihang Chen, Haozheng Zhang, Kang Li, Huichi Zhou, Meng Fang, Linyi Yang, Xiaoguang Li, Lifeng Shang, Songcen Xu, Jianye Hao, Kun Shao, Jun Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:32:23Z

**Summary**: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a new category of autonomous AI systems, referred to as Deep Research (DR) agents. These agents are designed to tackle complex, multi-turn informational research tasks by leveraging a combination of dynamic reasoning, adaptive long-horizon planning, multi-hop information retrieval, iterative tool use, and the generation of structured analytical reports. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of the foundational technologies and architectural components that constitute Deep Research agents. We begin by reviewing information acquisition strategies, contrasting API-based retrieval methods with browser-based exploration. We then examine modular tool-use frameworks, including code execution, multimodal input processing, and the integration of Model Context Protocols (MCPs) to support extensibility and ecosystem development. To systematize existing approaches, we propose a taxonomy that differentiates between static and dynamic workflows, and we classify agent architectures based on planning strategies and agent composition, including single-agent and multi-agent configurations. We also provide a critical evaluation of current benchmarks, highlighting key limitations such as restricted access to external knowledge, sequential execution inefficiencies, and misalignment between evaluation metrics and the practical objectives of DR agents. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising directions for future research.

**Authors**: Trent D. Buskirk, Florian Keusch, Leah von der Heyde, Adam Eck

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:15:31Z

**Summary**: Survey research has a long-standing history of being a human-powered field, but one that embraces various technologies for the collection, processing, and analysis of various behavioral, political, and social outcomes of interest, among others. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) bring new technological challenges and prerequisites in order to fully harness their potential. In this paper, we report work-in-progress on a systematic literature review based on keyword searches from multiple large-scale databases as well as citation networks that assesses how LLMs are currently being applied within the survey research process. We synthesize and organize our findings according to the survey research process to include examples of LLM usage across three broad phases: pre-data collection, data collection, and post-data collection. We discuss selected examples of potential use cases for LLMs as well as its pitfalls based on examples from existing literature. Considering survey research has rich experience and history regarding data quality, we discuss some opportunities and describe future outlooks for survey research to contribute to the continued development and refinement of LLMs.

### Using Aggregate Relational Data to Infer Social Networks
**Authors**: Xunkang Tian

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:07:21Z

**Summary**: This study introduces a novel approach for inferring social network structures using Aggregate Relational Data (ARD), addressing the challenge of limited detailed network data availability. By integrating ARD with variational approximation methods, we provide a computationally efficient and cost-effective solution for network analysis. Our methodology demonstrates the potential of ARD to offer insightful approximations of network dynamics, as evidenced by Monte Carlo Simulations. This paper not only showcases the utility of ARD in social network inference but also opens avenues for future research in enhancing estimation precision and exploring diverse network datasets. Through this work, we contribute to the field of network analysis by offering an alternative strategy for understanding complex social networks with constrained data.

### CompSlider: Compositional Slider for Disentangled Multiple-Attribute   Image Generation
**Authors**: Zixin Zhu, Kevin Duarte, Mamshad Nayeem Rizve, Chengyuan Xu, Ratheesh Kalarot, Junsong Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:01:47Z

**Summary**: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes, preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach, CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

### Breaking the HBM Bit Cost Barrier: Domain-Specific ECC for AI Inference   Infrastructure
**Authors**: Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Yunhua Fang, Linsen Ma, Sanchari Sen, Swagath Venkataramani, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:58:07Z

**Summary**: High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) delivers exceptional bandwidth and energy efficiency for AI workloads, but its high cost per bit, driven in part by stringent on-die reliability requirements, poses a growing barrier to scalable deployment. This work explores a system-level approach to cost reduction by eliminating on-die ECC and shifting all fault management to the memory controller. We introduce a domain-specific ECC framework combining large-codeword Reed--Solomon~(RS) correction with lightweight fine-grained CRC detection, differential parity updates to mitigate write amplification, and tunable protection based on data importance. Our evaluation using LLM inference workloads shows that, even under raw HBM bit error rates up to $10^{-3}$, the system retains over 78\% of throughput and 97\% of model accuracy compared with systems equipped with ideal error-free HBM. By treating reliability as a tunable system parameter rather than a fixed hardware constraint, our design opens a new path toward low-cost, high-performance HBM deployment in AI infrastructure.

### Pruning Weights but Not Truth: Safeguarding Truthfulness While Pruning   LLMs
**Authors**: Yao Fu, Runchao Li, Xianxuan Long, Haotian Yu, Xiaotian Han, Yu Yin, Pan Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:58:03Z

**Summary**: Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance. However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs' internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection. Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at 50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

### Situating AI Agents in their World: Aspective Agentic AI for Dynamic   Partially Observable Information Systems
**Authors**: Peter J. Bentley, Soo Ling Lim, Fuyuki Ishikawa

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:57:04Z

**Summary**: Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment, with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control of information. We provide an illustrative implementation and show that compared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time, aspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this concept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information niches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency.

### The population of NuSTAR Black Hole X-ray Binaries
**Authors**: Paul A. Draghis, Jon M. Miller, Laura Brenneman, Elisa Costantini, Luigi C. Gallo, Mark Reynolds, John A. Tomsick, Abderahmen Zoghbi

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:56:55Z

**Summary**: The spin of a black hole (BH) encodes information about its formation and evolution history. Yet the understanding of the distribution of BH spins in X-ray binaries (XBs), of the models used to measure spin, and of their impact on systematic uncertainties remains incomplete. In this work, we expand on previous analyses of the entire NuSTAR archive of accreting BH XBs. Prior work compiled a sample of 245 spectral fits using the relativistic reflection method for NuSTAR observations of 36 BH systems. Here, we aim to probe two aspects: the connection between BH spin and binary system properties, and the relationships between parameters in the spectral fits. We identify moderate negative correlations between spin uncertainty and both BH mass and system inclination, and a moderate positive correlation with distance. We also point out tentative multidimensional degeneracies between inclination, disk density, Fe abundance, ionization, and the presence or absence of absorption features from ionized outflows linked to disk winds. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive view of the observed distribution of BH spins in XBs, in comparison to spins inferred from gravitational waves. We find that the distribution of BH spins in XBs can be described by a beta distribution with $\alpha=5.66$ and $\beta=1.09$. This data set is highly complex, and the analysis presented here does not fully explore all potential parameter correlations. We make the full data set available in Zenodo to the community to encourage further exploration.

### RepoForge: Training a SOTA Fast-thinking SWE Agent with an End-to-End   Data Curation Pipeline Synergizing SFT and RL at Scale
**Authors**: Zhilong Chen, Chengzong Zhao, Boyuan Chen, Dayi Lin, Yihao Chen, Arthur Leung, Gopi Krishnan Rajbahadur, Gustavo A. Oliva, Haoxiang Zhang, Aaditya Bhatia, Chong Chun Yong, Ahmed E. Hassan

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:56:47Z

**Summary**: Training software engineering (SWE) LLMs is bottlenecked by expensive infrastructure, inefficient evaluation pipelines, scarce training data, and costly quality control. We present RepoForge, an autonomous, end-to-end pipeline that generates, evaluates, and trains SWE agents at scale. Our key contributions include: (1) RepoForge-8B-Agent, achieving 17.4\% on SWE-Bench-Verified~\citep{swebench_verified2024}, establishing new state-of-the-art for $\leq$8B non-thinking LLMs; (2) 7,304 executable environments auto-generated from real GitHub commits with zero manual intervention; (3) 14$\times$ storage reduction (1.4GB $\rightarrow$ 102MB per instance) via intelligent dependency management and image pruning; (4) $>$70\% faster evaluation using a Ray-powered~\citep{ray2018} distributed RepoForge harness; (5) 19,000$\times$ cheaper labeling through our automated SPICE~\citep{spice2024} difficulty assessment technique. By unifying storage-efficient sandboxing, Ray-powered evaluation harness, automated data generation, SPICE-based labeling, and bubble-free RL scaffold, we demonstrate that even $\leq$8B models can reach new state-of-the-art performance on demanding benchmarks like SWE-Bench-Verified. Our approach addresses critical bottlenecks in SWE agent training: high storage costs of container-based evaluation, inefficient sequential reward pipelines, limited availability of high-quality training data, expensive manual labeling, and multi-turn RL pipeline bottlenecks.

### Mooncake: A KVCache-centric Disaggregated Architecture for LLM Serving
**Authors**: Ruoyu Qin, Zheming Li, Weiran He, Mingxing Zhang, Yongwei Wu, Weimin Zheng, Xinran Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:56:29Z

**Summary**: Mooncake is the serving platform for Kimi, a leading LLM service provided by Moonshot AI. It features a KVCache-centric disaggregated architecture that separates the prefill and decoding clusters. It also leverages the underutilized CPU, DRAM, and SSD resources of the GPU cluster to implement a disaggregated cache of KVCache. The core of Mooncake is its KVCache-centric scheduler, which balances maximizing overall effective throughput while meeting latency-related Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Unlike traditional studies that assume all requests will be processed, Mooncake faces challenges due to highly overloaded scenarios. To mitigate these, we developed a prediction-based early rejection policy. Experiments show that Mooncake excels in long-context scenarios. Compared to the baseline method, Mooncake can achieve up to a 525% increase in throughput in certain simulated scenarios while adhering to SLOs. Under real workloads, Mooncake's innovative architecture enables Kimi to handle 75% more requests.

### TinyDrop: Tiny Model Guided Token Dropping for Vision Transformers
**Authors**: Guoxin Wang, Qingyuan Wang, Binhua Huang, Shaowu Chen, Deepu John

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:55:49Z

**Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.

### Amplifying Effective CXL Memory Bandwidth for LLM Inference via   Transparent Near-Data Processing
**Authors**: Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Linsen Ma, Yunhua Fang, Zirak Burzin Engineer, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:53:45Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) inference is bottlenecked by the limited bandwidth of CXL-based memory used for capacity expansion. We introduce CXL-NDP, a transparent near-data processing architecture that amplifies effective CXL bandwidth without requiring changes to the CXL.mem interface or AI models. CXL-NDP integrates a precision-scalable bit-plane layout for dynamic quantization with transparent lossless compression of weights and KV caches directly within the CXL device. In end-to-end serving, CXL-NDP improves throughput by 43%, extends the maximum context length by 87%, and reduces the KV cache footprint by 46.9% without accuracy loss. Hardware synthesis confirms its practicality with a modest silicon footprint, lowering the barrier for adopting efficient, scalable CXL-based memory in generative AI infrastructure.

### Search for Past Stellar Encounters and the Origin of 3I/ATLAS
**Authors**: Yiyang Guo, Luyao Zhang, Fabo Feng, Zhao-Yu Li, Anton Pomazan, Xiaohu Yang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:46:05Z

**Summary**: 3I/ATLAS, the third discovered interstellar object, has a heliocentric speed of 58 km/s and exhibits cometary activity. To constrain the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its past dynamical evolution, we propagate the orbits of 3I/ATLAS and nearby stars to search for stellar encounters. Integrating orbits in the Galactic potential and propagating the astrometric and radial-velocity uncertainties of 30 million Gaia stars, we identify 25 encounters with median encounter distances less than 1 pc. However, because the encounter speeds between 3I/ATLAS and each encounter exceed 20 km/s, none is a plausible host under common ejection mechanisms. We infer stellar masses for most stars and quantify the gravitational perturbations exerted by each individual star or each binary system on 3I/ATLAS. The strongest gravitational scattering perturber is a wide M-dwarf binary. Among all past encounters, the binary's barycenter and 3I/ATLAS reach the small encounter distance of 0.242 pc and the encounter speed of 28.39 km/s,1.64 Myr ago. We further demonstrate that the cumulative influence of the stellar encounters on both the speed and direction of 3I/ATLAS is weak. Based on the present kinematics of 3I/ATLAS to assess its origin, we find that a thin-disk origin is strongly favored, because the thin disk both exhibits a velocity distribution closely matching that of 3I/ATLAS and provides the dominant local number density of stars.

### CoT-Self-Instruct: Building high-quality synthetic prompts for reasoning   and non-reasoning tasks
**Authors**: Ping Yu, Jack Lanchantin, Tianlu Wang, Weizhe Yuan, Olga Golovneva, Ilia Kulikov, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Jason Weston, Jing Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:36:00Z

**Summary**: We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on given seed tasks, and then generate a new synthetic example of similar quality and complexity. This is followed by a filtering step to select high-quality data using automatic metrics, which are then used for LLM training. In verifiable reasoning, our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as s1k and OpenMathReasoning, when evaluated on MATH500, AMC23, AIME24, and GPQA-Diamond. For non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the performance of both human and standard Self-Instruct training data on the AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard benchmarks.

### An integrated method for clustering and association network inference
**Authors**: Jeanne Tous, Julien Chiquet

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:35:19Z

**Summary**: High dimensional Gaussian graphical models provide a rigorous framework to describe a network of statistical dependencies between entities, such as genes in genomic regulation studies or species in ecology. Penalized methods, including the standard Graphical-Lasso, are well-known approaches to infer the parameters of these models. As the number of variables in the model (of entities in the network) grow, the network inference and interpretation become more complex. The Normal-Block model is introduced, a new model that clusters variables and consider a network at the cluster level. Normal-Block both adds structure to the network and reduces its size. The approach builds on Graphical-Lasso to add a penalty on the network's edges and limit the detection of spurious dependencies. A zero-inflated version of the model is also proposed to account for real-world data properties. For the inference procedure, two approaches are introduced, a straightforward method based on state-of-the-art approaches and an original, more rigorous method that simultaneously infers the clustering of variables and the association network between clusters, using a penalized variational Expectation-Maximization approach. An implementation of the model in R, in a package called \textbf{normalblockr}, is available on github\footnote{https://github.com/jeannetous/normalblockr}. The results of the models in terms of clustering and network inference are presented, using both simulated data and various types of real-world data (proteomics and words occurrences on webpages).

### LLM as an Execution Estimator: Recovering Missing Dependency for   Practical Time-travelling Debugging
**Authors**: Yunrui Pei, Hongshu Wang, Wenjie Zhang, Yun Lin, Weiyu Kong, Jin song Dong

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:34:30Z

**Summary**: Determining the dynamic data dependency of a step that reads a variable $v$ is challenging. It typically requires either exhaustive instrumentation, which becomes prohibitively expensive when $v$ is defined within library calls, or repeated executions, which are impractical for non-deterministic programs. In this work, we propose RecovSlicing for computing dynamic data dependency in a single run, with only partial instrumentation. We explore the intuition that LLM can potentially infer program dynamics based on a partially recorded trace and relevant code as its context. Given (1) a partially recorded trace of a program $P$ and (2) the slicing criteria consisting of a query step $s$ and a query variable $v$ read by $s$, RecovSlicing computes the runtime definition of $v$ on the trace by estimating the miss-recorded execution of $P$. In this work, we allow the user to specify implicit query variable. Technically, built upon non-deterministic LLM, we address the challenges of (1) precise recovery of runtime variable value and structure from the recorded execution and (2) aligning the memory address of recovered variables and the recorded variables for definition analysis. We evaluate RecovSlicing on 8300 data dependencies across three slicing benchmarks, comparing it with Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer. RecovSlicing achieves significantly higher accuracy (80.3%, 91.1%, 98.3%) and recall (up to 98.3%) than the best baseline (accuracy: 39.0%, 82.0%, 59.9%; recall: 53.4%, 79.1%, 87.1%). Integrated into a dual-slicing regression bug localizer, it identifies 16% more regressions.

### RAT: Bridging RNN Efficiency and Attention Accuracy via Chunk-based   Sequence Modeling
**Authors**: Xiuying Wei, Anunay Yadav, Razvan Pascanu, Caglar Gulcehre

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:28:23Z

**Summary**: Transformers have become the cornerstone of modern large-scale language models, but their reliance on softmax attention poses a computational bottleneck at both training and inference. Recurrent models offer high efficiency, but compressing the full sequence into a fixed-size and holistic representation suffers from memory degradation in long contexts and limits fine-grained retrieval. To address this, we propose RAT, an intermediate design that bridges the efficiency of RNNs and capacity of attention. RAT partitions the input into chunks, applies recurrence within each chunk for local dependencies, and softmax-based attention across chunks for long-range interactions. This design mitigates memory degradation and enables direct access to distant tokens, while retaining computational efficiency. Empirically, with a chunk size of 16, the RAT block achieves a 7x improvement in training speed with 100K token sequences and 9x in generation at the 4K position, while maintaining similar performance compared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter models from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short- and long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We further propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves RAT with local attention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local interactions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces cache memory usage, but also consistently enhances performance and shows the overall best results. Code is available at https://github.com/CLAIRE-Labo/RAT.

### Frugal inference for control
**Authors**: Itzel Olivos-Castillo, Paul Schrater, Xaq Pitkow

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:28:22Z

**Summary**: A key challenge in advancing artificial intelligence is achieving the right balance between utility maximization and resource use by both external movement and internal computation. While this trade-off has been studied in fully observable settings, our understanding of resource efficiency in partially observable environments remains limited. Motivated by this challenge, we develop a version of the POMDP framework where the information gained through inference is treated as a resource that must be optimized alongside task performance and motion effort. By solving this problem in environments described by linear-Gaussian dynamics, we uncover fundamental principles of resource efficiency. Our study reveals a phase transition in the inference, switching from a Bayes-optimal approach to one that strategically leaves some uncertainty unresolved. This frugal behavior gives rise to a structured family of equally effective strategies, facilitating adaptation to later objectives and constraints overlooked during the original optimization. We illustrate the applicability of our framework and the generality of the principles we derived using two nonlinear tasks. Overall, this work provides a foundation for a new type of rational computation that both brains and machines could use for effective but resource-efficient control under uncertainty.

### Language Models Do Not Follow Occam's Razor: A Benchmark for Inductive   and Abductive Reasoning
**Authors**: Yunxin Sun, Abulhair Saparov

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:22:42Z

**Summary**: Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However, most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs' inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.

### On the MIA Vulnerability Gap Between Private GANs and Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Ilana Sebag, Jean-Yves Franceschi, Alain Rakotomamonjy, Alexandre Allauzen, Jamal Atif

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:18:22Z

**Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models have emerged as leading approaches for high-quality image synthesis. While both can be trained under differential privacy (DP) to protect sensitive data, their sensitivity to membership inference attacks (MIAs), a key threat to data confidentiality, remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first unified theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risks faced by differentially private generative models. We begin by showing, through a stability-based analysis, that GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data perturbations than diffusion models, suggesting a structural advantage in resisting MIAs. We then validate this insight with a comprehensive empirical study using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage across datasets and privacy budgets. Our results consistently reveal a marked privacy robustness gap in favor of GANs, even in strong DP regimes, highlighting that model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage.

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T09:25:05Z

**Summary**: In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator) and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers. This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation engineering.

### VulnRepairEval: An Exploit-Based Evaluation Framework for Assessing   Large Language Model Vulnerability Repair Capabilities
**Authors**: Weizhe Wang, Wei Ma, Qiang Hu, Yao Zhang, Jianfei Sun, Bin Wu, Yang Liu, Guangquan Xu, Lingxiao Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:06:10Z

**Summary**: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated software vulnerability patching has shown promising outcomes on carefully curated evaluation sets. Nevertheless, existing datasets predominantly rely on superficial validation methods rather than exploit-based verification, leading to overestimated performance in security-sensitive applications. This paper introduces VulnRepairEval, an evaluation framework anchored in functional Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits. Our framework delivers a comprehensive, containerized evaluation pipeline that enables reproducible differential assessment, where repair success requires the original exploit to fail execution against the modified code. The benchmark construction involved extensive data curation: we processed over 400 CVEs and approximately 2,500 potential sources to extract a collection of authentic vulnerability instances (23 Python CVEs) amenable to automated testing with working PoCs. Through VulnRepairEval, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 12 popular LLMs and observe a significant performance deficit: even the top-performing model successfully addresses merely 5/23 instances (about 21.7%), exposing critical weaknesses in security-focused applications. Our failure analysis reveals that most unsuccessful attempts stem from imprecise vulnerability identification and patches containing syntactic or semantic errors. Enhanced prompting strategies and multi-agent approaches yield minimal improvements, with overall effectiveness remaining largely unaffected. This work contributes a stringent, practical evaluation framework for LLM-driven vulnerability remediation and underscores the necessity for assessment protocols that authentically reflect real-world exploitation scenarios.

### SESGO: Spanish Evaluation of Stereotypical Generative Outputs
**Authors**: Melissa Robles, Catalina Bernal, Denniss Raigoso, Mateo Dulce Rubio

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:04:51Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the critical gap in evaluating bias in multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), with a specific focus on Spanish language within culturally-aware Latin American contexts. Despite widespread global deployment, current evaluations remain predominantly US-English-centric, leaving potential harms in other linguistic and cultural contexts largely underexamined. We introduce a novel, culturally-grounded framework for detecting social biases in instruction-tuned LLMs. Our approach adapts the underspecified question methodology from the BBQ dataset by incorporating culturally-specific expressions and sayings that encode regional stereotypes across four social categories: gender, race, socioeconomic class, and national origin. Using more than 4,000 prompts, we propose a new metric that combines accuracy with the direction of error to effectively balance model performance and bias alignment in both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts. To our knowledge, our work presents the first systematic evaluation examining how leading commercial LLMs respond to culturally specific bias in the Spanish language, revealing varying patterns of bias manifestation across state-of-the-art models. We also contribute evidence that bias mitigation techniques optimized for English do not effectively transfer to Spanish tasks, and that bias patterns remain largely consistent across different sampling temperatures. Our modular framework offers a natural extension to new stereotypes, bias categories, or languages and cultural contexts, representing a significant step toward more equitable and culturally-aware evaluation of AI systems in the diverse linguistic environments where they operate.

### Empowering Lightweight MLLMs with Reasoning via Long CoT SFT
**Authors**: Linyu Ou

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T13:53:29Z

**Summary**: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs.

### Bayesian Additive Regression Trees for functional ANOVA model
**Authors**: Seokhun Park, Insung Kong, Yongdai Kim

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T12:40:40Z

**Summary**: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a powerful statistical model that leverages the strengths of Bayesian inference and regression trees. It has received significant attention for capturing complex non-linear relationships and interactions among predictors. However, the accuracy of BART often comes at the cost of interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose ANOVA Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (ANOVA-BART), a novel extension of BART based on the functional ANOVA decomposition, which is used to decompose the variability of a function into different interactions, each representing the contribution of a different set of covariates or factors. Our proposed ANOVA-BART enhances interpretability, preserves and extends the theoretical guarantees of BART, and achieves superior predictive performance. Specifically, we establish that the posterior concentration rate of ANOVA-BART is nearly minimax optimal, and further provides the same convergence rates for each interaction that are not available for BART. Moreover, comprehensive experiments confirm that ANOVA-BART surpasses BART in both accuracy and uncertainty quantification, while also demonstrating its effectiveness in component selection. These results suggest that ANOVA-BART offers a compelling alternative to BART by balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and theoretical consistency.

### FedP$^2$EFT: Federated Learning to Personalize PEFT for Multilingual   LLMs
**Authors**: Royson Lee, Minyoung Kim, Fady Rezk, Rui Li, Stylianos I. Venieris, Timothy Hospedales

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T13:46:10Z

**Summary**: Federated learning (FL) has enabled the training of multilingual large language models (LLMs) on diverse and decentralized multilingual data, especially on low-resource languages. To improve client-specific performance, personalization via the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules such as LoRA is common. This involves a personalization strategy (PS), such as the design of the PEFT adapter structures (e.g., in which layers to add LoRAs and what ranks) and choice of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates) for fine-tuning. Instead of manual PS configuration, we propose FedP$^2$EFT, a federated learning-to-personalize method for multilingual LLMs in cross-device FL settings. Unlike most existing PEFT structure selection methods, which are prone to overfitting low-data regimes, FedP$^2$EFT collaboratively learns the optimal personalized PEFT structure for each client via Bayesian sparse rank selection. Evaluations on both simulated and real-world multilingual FL benchmarks demonstrate that FedP$^2$EFT largely outperforms existing personalized fine-tuning methods, while complementing other existing FL methods. Code is available at https://github.com/SamsungLabs/fedp2eft.

### The super learner for time-to-event outcomes: A tutorial
**Authors**: Ruth H. Keogh, Karla Diaz-Ordaz, Nan van Geloven, Jon Michael Gran, Kamaryn T. Tanner

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T13:44:53Z

**Summary**: Estimating risks or survival probabilities conditional on individual characteristics based on censored time-to-event data is a commonly faced task. This may be for the purpose of developing a prediction model or may be part of a wider estimation procedure, such as in causal inference. A challenge is that it is impossible to know at the outset which of a set of candidate models will provide the best predictions. The super learner is a powerful approach for finding the best model or combination of models ('ensemble') among a pre-specified set of candidate models or 'learners', which can include parametric and machine learning models. Super learners for time-to-event outcomes have been developed, but the literature is technical and a reader may find it challenging to gather together the full details of how these methods work and can be implemented. In this paper we provide a practical tutorial on super learner methods for time-to-event outcomes. An overview of the general steps involved in the super learner is given, followed by details of three specific implementations for time-to-event outcomes. We cover discrete-time and continuous-time versions of the super learner, as described by Polley and van der Laan (2011), Westling et al. (2023) and Munch and Gerds (2024). We compare the properties of the methods and provide information on how they can be implemented in R. The methods are illustrated using an open access data set and R code is provided.

### AgenTracer: Who Is Inducing Failure in the LLM Agentic Systems?
**Authors**: Guibin Zhang, Junhao Wang, Junjie Chen, Wangchunshu Zhou, Kun Wang, Shuicheng Yan

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T13:42:14Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning, capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions. On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving agentic AI.

**Authors**: Evgenii Kniazev, Arseny Kravchenko, Igor Rekun, James Broadhead, Nikita Shamgunov, Pranav Sah, Pratik Nichite, Ivan Yamshchikov

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T13:41:45Z

**Summary**: We present app.build (https://github.com/appdotbuild/agent/), an open-source framework that improves LLM-based application generation through systematic validation and structured environments. Our approach combines multi-layered validation pipelines, stack-specific orchestration, and model-agnostic architecture, implemented across three reference stacks. Through evaluation on 30 generation tasks, we demonstrate that comprehensive validation achieves 73.3% viability rate with 30% reaching perfect quality scores, while open-weights models achieve 80.8% of closed-model performance when provided structured environments. The open-source framework has been adopted by the community, with over 3,000 applications generated to date. This work demonstrates that scaling reliable AI agents requires scaling environments, not just models -- providing empirical insights and complete reference implementations for production-oriented agent systems.

### Quantum Data Encoding and Variational Algorithms: A Framework for Hybrid   Quantum Classical Machine Learning
**Authors**: Bhavna Bose, Saurav Verma

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T13:41:36Z

**Summary**: The development of quantum computers has been the stimulus that enables the realization of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), an area that integrates the calculational framework of quantum mechanics with the adaptive properties of classical machine learning. This article suggests a broad architecture that allows the connection between classical data pipelines and quantum algorithms, hybrid quantum-classical models emerge as a promising route to scalable and near-term quantum benefit. At the core of this paradigm lies the Classical-Quantum (CQ) paradigm, in which the qubit states of high-dimensional classical data are encoded using sophisticated classical encoding strategies which encode the data in terms of amplitude and angle of rotation, along with superposition mapping. These techniques allow compression of information exponentially into Hilbert space representations, which, together with reduced sample complexity, allows greater feature expressivity. We also examine variational quantum circuits, quantum gates expressed as trainable variables that run with classical optimizers to overcome decoherence, noise, and gate-depth constraints of the existing Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Experimental comparisons with a Quantum Naive Bayes classifier prove that even small quantum circuits can approximate probabilistic inference with competitive accuracy compared to classical benchmarks, and have much better robustness to noisy data distributionsThis model does not only explain the algorithmic and architectural design of QML, it also offers a roadmap to the implementation of quantum kernels, variational algorithms, and hybrid feedback loops into practice, including optimization, computer vision, and medical diagnostics. The results support the idea that hybrid architectures with strong data encoding and adaptive error protection are key to moving QML out of theory to practice.

### Searching for HWW Anomalous Couplings with Simulation-Based Inference
**Authors**: Marta Silva, Ricardo Barrué, Inês Ochoa, Patricia Conde Muíño

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T13:39:11Z

**Summary**: Understanding the source of the universe's asymmetry between matter and antimatter is one of the major open questions in particle physics. In this work, the sensitivity of novel machine-learning-based inference techniques to CP-odd and CP-even $HWW$ anomalous couplings is studied in the $\\WH \rightarrow \ell \nu b\bar{b}$ channel ($\ell = e, \mu$), within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework. Two machine-learning simulation-based inference (SBI) methods are explored: a per-event likelihood-ratio estimator, which directly approximates the ratio of probability densities between competing hypotheses, is benchmarked against a per-event optimal-observable estimator optimized for sensitivity to the parameters of interest. Both approaches are also compared to traditional summary statistics, in this case histograms of kinematic and angular observables, as commonly used in experimental analyses. SBI methods provide tighter constraints than one-dimensional summary statistics, though their performance is comparable to two-dimensional histogram analysis. The optimal-observable approach remains promising for its ability to probe multiple couplings simultaneously. Restricting the analysis to a region of high $S/B$ also enhances sensitivity to CP-odd operators while preserving sensitivity to CP-even operators, which histogram analyses often lose. Although the likelihood-ratio estimator sometimes struggles with likelihood minima and shapes, optimisations that target its robustness could make it more sensitive than both the optimal-observable estimator and the histogram method. These results underscore the potential of advanced simulation-based inference techniques, encouraging further exploration with LHC Run 3 data to surpass current ATLAS and CMS sensitivities.

### RNE: plug-and-play diffusion inference-time control and energy-based   training
**Authors**: Jiajun He, José Miguel Hernández-Lobato, Yuanqi Du, Francisco Vargas

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T13:30:36Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models generate data by removing noise gradually, which corresponds to the time-reversal of a noising process. However, access to only the denoising kernels is often insufficient. In many applications, we need the knowledge of the marginal densities along the generation trajectory, which enables tasks such as inference-time control. To address this gap, in this paper, we introduce the Radon-Nikodym Estimator (RNE). Based on the concept of the density ratio between path distributions, it reveals a fundamental connection between marginal densities and transition kernels, providing a flexible plug-and-play framework that unifies diffusion density estimation, inference-time control, and energy-based diffusion training under a single perspective. Experiments demonstrated that RNE delivers strong results in inference-time control applications, such as annealing and model composition, with promising inference-time scaling performance. Moreover, RNE provides a simple yet efficient regularisation for training energy-based diffusion.

### Automatic Differentiation of Agent-Based Models
**Authors**: Arnau Quera-Bofarull, Nicholas Bishop, Joel Dyer, Daniel Jarne Ornia, Anisoara Calinescu, Doyne Farmer, Michael Wooldridge

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T13:28:33Z

**Summary**: Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate complex systems by capturing the bottom-up interactions of individual agents comprising the system. Many complex systems of interest, such as epidemics or financial markets, involve thousands or even millions of agents. Consequently, ABMs often become computationally demanding and rely on the calibration of numerous free parameters, which has significantly hindered their widespread adoption. In this paper, we demonstrate that automatic differentiation (AD) techniques can effectively alleviate these computational burdens. By applying AD to ABMs, the gradients of the simulator become readily available, greatly facilitating essential tasks such as calibration and sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we show how AD enables variational inference (VI) techniques for efficient parameter calibration. Our experiments demonstrate substantial performance improvements and computational savings using VI on three prominent ABMs: Axtell's model of firms; Sugarscape; and the SIR epidemiological model. Our approach thus significantly enhances the practicality and scalability of ABMs for studying complex systems.

### ORMind: A Cognitive-Inspired End-to-End Reasoning Framework for   Operations Research
**Authors**: Zhiyuan Wang, Bokui Chen, Yinya Huang, Qingxing Cao, Ming He, Jianping Fan, Xiaodan Liang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T12:09:34Z

**Summary**: Operations research (OR) is widely deployed to solve critical decision-making problems with complex objectives and constraints, impacting manufacturing, logistics, finance, and healthcare outcomes. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in various domains, their practical application in industry-relevant operations research (OR) problems presents significant challenges and opportunities. Preliminary industrial applications of LLMs for operations research face two critical deployment challenges: 1) Self-correction focuses on code syntax rather than mathematical accuracy, causing costly errors; 2) Complex expert selection creates unpredictable workflows that reduce transparency and increase maintenance costs, making them impractical for time-sensitive business applications. To address these business limitations, we introduce ORMind, a cognitive-inspired framework that enhances optimization through counterfactual reasoning. Our approach emulates human cognition, implementing an end-to-end workflow that systematically transforms requirements into mathematical models and executable solver code. It is currently being tested internally in Lenovo's AI Assistant, with plans to enhance optimization capabilities for both business and consumer customers. Experiments demonstrate that ORMind outperforms existing methods, achieving a 9.5\% improvement on the NL4Opt dataset and a 14.6\% improvement on the ComplexOR dataset.

### Structure Transfer: an Inference-Based Calculus for the Transformation   of Representations
**Authors**: Daniel Raggi, Gem Stapleton, Mateja Jamnik, Aaron Stockdill, Grecia Garcia Garcia, Peter C-H. Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T08:55:32Z

**Summary**: Representation choice is of fundamental importance to our ability to communicate and reason effectively. A major unsolved problem, addressed in this paper, is how to devise representational-system (RS) agnostic techniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a novel calculus, called structure transfer, that enables representation transformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a source representation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us to generate a target representation for a target RS. The generality of structure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source representation and the generated target representation satisfy any specified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting schemas, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can express preservation of information across relations between any pair of RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure for the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We formalise this using Representational Systems Theory, building on the key concept of a construction space. The abstract nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a system-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative representations in a wide range of practical settings.

### TeRA: Vector-based Random Tensor Network for High-Rank Adaptation of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yuxuan Gu, Wuyang Zhou, Giorgos Iacovides, Danilo Mandic

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T11:46:24Z

**Summary**: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a vector-based random \underline{\textbf{Te}}nsor network for high-\underline{\textbf{R}}ank \underline{\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

### QualBench: Benchmarking Chinese LLMs with Localized Professional   Qualifications for Vertical Domain Evaluation
**Authors**: Mengze Hong, Wailing Ng, Chen Jason Zhang, Di Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T11:11:28Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Chinese LLMs underscores the need for vertical-domain evaluations to ensure reliable applications. However, existing benchmarks often lack domain coverage and provide limited insights into the Chinese working context. Leveraging qualification exams as a unified framework for expertise evaluation, we introduce QualBench, the first multi-domain Chinese QA benchmark dedicated to localized assessment of Chinese LLMs. The dataset includes over 17,000 questions across six vertical domains, drawn from 24 Chinese qualifications to align with national policies and professional standards. Results reveal an interesting pattern of Chinese LLMs consistently surpassing non-Chinese models, with the Qwen2.5 model outperforming the more advanced GPT-4o, emphasizing the value of localized domain knowledge in meeting qualification requirements. The average accuracy of 53.98% reveals the current gaps in domain coverage within model capabilities. Furthermore, we identify performance degradation caused by LLM crowdsourcing, assess data contamination, and illustrate the effectiveness of prompt engineering and model fine-tuning, suggesting opportunities for future improvements through multi-domain RAG and Federated Learning.

### Dial-In LLM: Human-Aligned LLM-in-the-loop Intent Clustering for   Customer Service Dialogues
**Authors**: Mengze Hong, Wailing Ng, Chen Jason Zhang, Yuanfeng Song, Di Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T11:09:53Z

**Summary**: Discovering customer intentions is crucial for automated service agents, yet existing intent clustering methods often fall short due to their reliance on embedding distance metrics and neglect of underlying semantic structures. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM-in-the-loop (LLM-ITL) intent clustering framework, integrating the language understanding capabilities of LLMs into conventional clustering algorithms. Specifically, this paper (1) examines the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs in semantic coherence evaluation and intent cluster naming, achieving over 95% accuracy aligned with human judgments; (2) designs an LLM-ITL framework that facilitates the iterative discovery of coherent intent clusters and the optimal number of clusters; and (3) introduces context-aware techniques tailored for customer service dialogue. Since existing English benchmarks lack sufficient semantic diversity and intent coverage, we further present a comprehensive Chinese dialogue intent dataset comprising over 100k real customer service calls with 1,507 human-annotated clusters. The proposed approaches significantly outperform LLM-guided baselines, achieving notable improvements in clustering quality, cost efficiency, and downstream applications. Combined with several best practices, our findings highlight the prominence of LLM-in-the-loop techniques for scalable dialogue data mining.

### AIVA: An AI-based Virtual Companion for Emotion-aware Interaction
**Authors**: Chenxi Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T11:00:46Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved natural language understanding and generation, enhancing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). However, LLMs are limited to unimodal text processing and lack the ability to interpret emotional cues from non-verbal signals, hindering more immersive and empathetic interactions. This work explores integrating multimodal sentiment perception into LLMs to create emotion-aware agents. We propose \ours, an AI-based virtual companion that captures multimodal sentiment cues, enabling emotionally aligned and animated HCI. \ours introduces a Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) using a cross-modal fusion transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues. Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework for emotion-aware agents with applications in companion robotics, social care, mental health, and human-centered AI.

### Variational Uncertainty Decomposition for In-Context Learning
**Authors**: I. Shavindra Jayasekera, Jacob Si, Filippo Valdettaro, Wenlong Chen, A. Aldo Faisal, Yingzhen Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T10:56:13Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) gain popularity in conducting prediction tasks in-context, understanding the sources of uncertainty in in-context learning becomes essential to ensuring reliability. The recent hypothesis of in-context learning performing predictive Bayesian inference opens the avenue for Bayesian uncertainty estimation, particularly for decomposing uncertainty into epistemic uncertainty due to lack of in-context data and aleatoric uncertainty inherent in the in-context prediction task. However, the decomposition idea remains under-explored due to the intractability of the latent parameter posterior from the underlying Bayesian model. In this work, we introduce a variational uncertainty decomposition framework for in-context learning without explicitly sampling from the latent parameter posterior, by optimising auxiliary queries as probes to obtain an upper bound to the aleatoric uncertainty of an LLM's in-context learning procedure, which also induces a lower bound to the epistemic uncertainty. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks, we show quantitatively and qualitatively that the decomposed uncertainties obtained from our method exhibit desirable properties of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

### Deconfounding via Profiled Transfer Learning
**Authors**: Ziyuan Chen, Yifan Jiang, Jingyuan Liu, Fang Yao

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T10:52:21Z

**Summary**: Unmeasured confounders are a major source of bias in regression-based effect estimation and causal inference. In this paper, we advocate a new profiled transfer learning framework, ProTrans, to address confounding effects in the target dataset, when additional source datasets that possess similar confounding structures are available. We introduce the concept of profiled residuals to characterize the shared confounding patterns between source and target datasets. By incorporating these profiled residuals into the target debiasing step, we effectively mitigates the latent confounding effects. We also propose a source selection strategy to enhance robustness of ProTrans against noninformative sources. As a byproduct, ProTrans can also be utilized to estimate treatment effects when potential confounders exist, without the use of auxiliary features such as instrumental or proxy variables, which are often challenging to select in practice. Theoretically, we prove that the resulting estimated model shift from sources to target is confounding-free without any assumptions imposed on the true confounding structure, and that the target parameter estimation achieves the minimax optimal rate under mild conditions. Simulated and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of ProTrans and support the theoretical findings.

### Attention-guided Self-reflection for Zero-shot Hallucination Detection   in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Qiang Liu, Xinlong Chen, Yue Ding, Bowen Song, Weiqiang Wang, Shu Wu, Liang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T10:48:53Z

**Summary**: Hallucination has emerged as a significant barrier to the effective application of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Guided SElf-Reflection (AGSER) approach for zero-shot hallucination detection in LLMs. The AGSER method utilizes attention contributions to categorize the input query into attentive and non-attentive queries. Each query is then processed separately through the LLMs, allowing us to compute consistency scores between the generated responses and the original answer. The difference between the two consistency scores serves as a hallucination estimator. In addition to its efficacy in detecting hallucinations, AGSER notably reduces computational overhead, requiring only three passes through the LLM and utilizing two sets of tokens. We have conducted extensive experiments with four widely-used LLMs across three different hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot hallucination detection.

### Avoidance Decoding for Diverse Multi-Branch Story Generation
**Authors**: Kyeongman Park, Nakyeong Yang, Kyomin Jung

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T10:39:50Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2) Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to 2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30% compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration. Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons, demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.

### Can Large Language Models Act as Ensembler for Multi-GNNs?
**Authors**: Hanqi Duan, Yao Cheng, Jianxiang Yu, Yao Liu, Xiang Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T10:35:17Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning from graph-structured data. However, GNNs lack the inherent semantic understanding capability of rich textual node attributes, limiting their effectiveness in applications. On the other hand, we empirically observe that for existing GNN models, no one can consistently outperforms others across diverse datasets. In this paper, we study whether LLMs can act as an ensembler for multi-GNNs and propose the LensGNN model. The model first aligns multiple GNNs, mapping the representations of different GNNs into the same space. Then, through LoRA fine-tuning, it aligns the space between the GNN and the LLM, injecting graph tokens and textual information into LLMs. This allows LensGNN to ensemble multiple GNNs and take advantage of the strengths of LLM, leading to a deeper understanding of both textual semantic information and graph structural information. The experimental results show that LensGNN outperforms existing models. This research advances text-attributed graph ensemble learning by providing a robust and superior solution for integrating semantic and structural information. We provide our code and data here: https://github.com/AquariusAQ/LensGNN.

### Bayesian Network Propensity Score to Evaluate Treatment Effects in   Observational Studies
**Authors**: Clelia Di Serio, Federica Cugnata, Pier Luigi Conti, Alberto Briganti, Fulvia Mecatti, Paola Vicard, Paola Maria Vittoria Rancoita

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T10:28:25Z

**Summary**: This paper focuses on the Bayesian Network Propensity Score (BNPS), a novel approach for estimating treatment effects in observational studies characterized by unknown (and likely unbalanced) designs and complex dependency structures among covariates. Traditional methods, such as logistic regression, often impose rigid parametric assumptions that may lead to misspecification errors, compromising causal inference. Recent classical and machine learning alternatives, such as boosted CART, random forests, and Stable Balancing Weights, seem to be attractive in a predictive perspective, but they typically lack asymptotic properties, such as consistency, efficiency, and valid variance estimation. In contrast, the recently proposed BNPS to estimate propensity scores uses Bayesian Networks to flexibly model conditional dependencies while preserving essential statistical properties such as consistency, asymptotic normality and asymptotic efficiency. Combined with the H\'ajek estimator, BNPS enables robust estimation of the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) in scenarios with strong covariate interactions and unknown data-generating mechanisms. Through extensive simulations across fifteen realistic scenarios and varying sample sizes, BNPS consistently outperforms benchmark methods in both empirical rejection rates and coverage accuracy. Finally, an application to a real-world dataset of 7,162 prostate cancer patients from San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) demonstrates BNPS's practical value in assessing the impact of pelvic lymph node dissection on hospitalization duration and biochemical recurrence. The findings support BNPS as a statistically robust, interpretable and transparent alternative for causal inference in complex observational settings, enhancing the reliability of evidence from real-world biomedical data.

### Tabular foundation model for GEOAI benchmark problems   BM/AirportSoilProperties/2/2025
**Authors**: Taiga Saito, Yu Otake, Stephen Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T10:21:18Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a novel application of the Tabular Prior-Data Fitted Network (TabPFN) - a transformer-based foundation model for tabular data - to geotechnical site characterization problems defined in the GEOAI benchmark BM/AirportSoilProperties/2/2025. Two tasks are addressed: (1) predicting the spatial variation of undrained shear strength (su) across borehole depth profiles, and (2) imputing missing mechanical parameters in a dense-site dataset. We apply TabPFN in a zero-training, few-shot, in-context learning setting - without hyper-parameter tuning - and provide it with additional context from the big indirect database (BID). The study demonstrates that TabPFN, as a general-purpose foundation model, achieved superior accuracy and well-calibrated predictive distributions compared to a conventional hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) baseline, while also offering significant gains in inference efficiency. In Benchmark Problem #1 (spatial su prediction), TabPFN outperformed the HBM in prediction accuracy and delivered an order-of-magnitude faster runtime. In Benchmark Problem #2 (missing mechanical parameter imputation), TabPFN likewise achieved lower RMSE for all target parameters with well-quantified uncertainties, though its cumulative computation cost was higher than HBM's due to its one-variable-at-a-time inference. These results mark the first successful use of a tabular foundation model in geotechnical modeling, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in probabilistic site characterization.

### Symbiotic Agents: A Novel Paradigm for Trustworthy AGI-driven Networks
**Authors**: Ilias Chatzistefanidis, Navid Nikaein

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:49:56Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based autonomous agents are expected to play a vital role in the evolution of 6G networks, by empowering real-time decision-making related to management and service provisioning to end-users. This shift facilitates the transition from a specialized intelligence approach, where artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms handle isolated tasks, to artificial general intelligence (AGI)-driven networks, where agents possess broader reasoning capabilities and can manage diverse network functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel agentic paradigm that combines LLMs with real-time optimization algorithms towards Trustworthy AI, defined as symbiotic agents. Optimizers at the LLM's input-level provide bounded uncertainty steering for numerically precise tasks, whereas output-level optimizers supervised by the LLM enable adaptive real-time control. We design and implement two novel agent types including: (i) Radio Access Network optimizers, and (ii) multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). We further propose an end-to-end architecture for AGI networks and evaluate it on a 5G testbed capturing channel fluctuations from moving vehicles. Results show that symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone LLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy with a 99.9% reduction in GPU resource overhead and in near-real-time loops of 82 ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world testbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and resource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44%. Drawing on our findings and open-source implementations, we introduce the symbiotic paradigm as the foundation for next-generation, AGI-driven networks-systems designed to remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy even as LLMs advance.

### Memory-R1: Enhancing Large Language Model Agents to Manage and Utilize   Memories via Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Sikuan Yan, Xiufeng Yang, Zuchao Huang, Ercong Nie, Zifeng Ding, Zonggen Li, Xiaowen Ma, Hinrich Schütze, Volker Tresp, Yunpu Ma

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:33:30Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of NLP tasks, but they remain fundamentally stateless, constrained by limited context windows that hinder long-horizon reasoning. Recent efforts to address this limitation often augment LLMs with an external memory bank, yet most existing pipelines are static and heuristic-driven, lacking any learned mechanism for deciding what to store, update, or retrieve. We present Memory-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that equips LLMs with the ability to actively manage and utilize external memory through two specialized agents: a Memory Manager that learns to perform structured memory operations, including adding, updating, deleting, or taking no operation on memory entries; and an Answer Agent that selects the most relevant entries and reasons over them to produce an answer. Both agents are fine-tuned with outcome-driven RL (PPO and GRPO), enabling adaptive memory management and utilization with minimal supervision. With as few as 152 question-answer pairs and a corresponding temporal memory bank for training, Memory-R1 outperforms the strongest existing baseline and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse question types and LLM backbones. Beyond presenting an effective approach, this work provides insights into how RL can unlock more agentic, memory-aware behavior in LLMs, pointing toward richer, more persistent reasoning systems.

### RoboMemory: A Brain-inspired Multi-memory Agentic Framework for Lifelong   Learning in Physical Embodied Systems
**Authors**: Mingcong Lei, Honghao Cai, Binbin Que, Zezhou Cui, Liangchen Tan, Junkun Hong, Gehan Hu, Shuangyu Zhu, Yimou Wu, Shaohan Jiang, Ge Wang, Zhen Li, Shuguang Cui, Yiming Zhao, Yatong Han

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:32:27Z

**Summary**: We present RoboMemory, a brain-inspired multi-memory framework for lifelong learning in physical embodied systems, addressing critical challenges in real-world environments: continuous learning, multi-module memory latency, task correlation capture, and infinite-loop mitigation in closed-loop planning. Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, it integrates four core modules: the Information Preprocessor (thalamus-like), the Lifelong Embodied Memory System (hippocampus-like), the Closed-Loop Planning Module (prefrontal lobe-like), and the Low-Level Executer (cerebellum-like) to enable long-term planning and cumulative learning. The Lifelong Embodied Memory System, central to the framework, alleviates inference speed issues in complex memory frameworks via parallelized updates/retrieval across Spatial, Temporal, Episodic, and Semantic submodules. It incorporates a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) and consistent architectural design to enhance memory consistency and scalability. Evaluations on EmbodiedBench show RoboMemory outperforms the open-source baseline (Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins) by 25% in average success rate and surpasses the closed-source State-of-the-Art (SOTA) (Claude3.5-Sonnet) by 5%, establishing new SOTA. Ablation studies validate key components (critic, spatial memory, long-term memory), while real-world deployment confirms its lifelong learning capability with significantly improved success rates across repeated tasks. RoboMemory alleviates high latency challenges with scalability, serving as a foundational reference for integrating multi-modal memory systems in physical robots.

### PatchNet: A hierarchical approach for neural field-level inference from   Quijote Simulations
**Authors**: Anirban Bairagi, Benjamin Wandelt

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:32:13Z

**Summary**: \textit{What is the cosmological information content of a cubic Gigaparsec of dark matter? } Extracting cosmological information from the non-linear matter distribution has high potential to tighten parameter constraints in the era of next-generation surveys such as Euclid, DESI, and the Vera Rubin Observatory. Traditional approaches relying on summary statistics like the power spectrum and bispectrum, though analytically tractable, fail to capture the full non-Gaussian and non-linear structure of the density field. Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) provides a powerful alternative by learning directly from forward-modeled simulations. In this work, we apply SBI to the \textit{Quijote} dark matter simulations and introduce a hierarchical method that integrates small-scale information from field sub-volumes or \textit{patches} with large-scale statistics such as power spectrum and bispectrum. This hybrid strategy is efficient both computationally and in terms of the amount of training data required. It overcomes the memory limitations associated with full-field training. We show that our approach enhances Fisher information relative to analytical summaries and matches that of a very different approach (wavelet-based statistics), providing evidence that we are estimating the full information content of the dark matter density field at the resolution of $\sim 7.8~\mathrm{Mpc}/h$.

### BadPromptFL: A Novel Backdoor Threat to Prompt-based Federated Learning   in Multimodal Models
**Authors**: Maozhen Zhang, Mengnan Zhao, Bo Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:32:04Z

**Summary**: Prompt-based tuning has emerged as a lightweight alternative to full fine-tuning in large vision-language models, enabling efficient adaptation via learned contextual prompts. This paradigm has recently been extended to federated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively train prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning remain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In BadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation process. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling universal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters. Leveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures, BadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \(>90\%\)) with minimal visibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness, stealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.

### OPRA-Vis: Visual Analytics System to Assist Organization-Public   Relationship Assessment with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Sangbong Yoo, Seongbum Seo, Chanyoung Yoon, Hyelim Lee, Jeong-Nam Kim, Chansoo Kim, Yun Jang, Takanori Fujiwara

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:30:39Z

**Summary**: Analysis of public opinions collected from digital media helps organizations maintain positive relationships with the public. Such public relations (PR) analysis often involves assessing opinions, for example, measuring how strongly people trust an organization. Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) hold great promise for supporting Organization-Public Relationship Assessment (OPRA) because they can map unstructured public text to OPRA dimensions and articulate rationales through prompting. However, adapting LLMs for PR analysis typically requires fine-tuning on large labeled datasets, which is both labor-intensive and knowledge-intensive, making it difficult for PR researchers to apply these models. In this paper, we present OPRA-Vis, a visual analytics system that leverages LLMs for OPRA without requiring extensive labeled data. Our framework employs Chain-of-Thought prompting to guide LLMs in analyzing public opinion data by incorporating PR expertise directly into the reasoning process. Furthermore, OPRA-Vis provides visualizations that reveal the clues and reasoning paths used by LLMs, enabling users to explore, critique, and refine model decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OPRA-Vis through two real-world use cases and evaluate it quantitatively, through comparisons with alternative LLMs and prompting strategies, and qualitatively, through assessments of usability, effectiveness, and expert feedback.

### Investigation of mass substructure in gravitational lens system SDP.81   with ALMA long-baseline observations
**Authors**: H. R. Stacey, D. M. Powell, S. Vegetti, J. P. McKean, D. Wen

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:25:53Z

**Summary**: The prevalence and properties of low-mass dark matter haloes serve as a crucial test for understanding the nature of dark matter, and may be constrained through the gravitational deflection of strongly lensed arcs. Previous studies found evidence for the presence of low-mass dark matter haloes in observations of the gravitationally lensed, dusty star-forming galaxy SDP.81, using the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA). In this work, we analyse these observations to assess the robustness of these reported results. While our analysis indicates that the data support additional angular structure in the lensing mass distribution beyond an elliptical power-law density profile, we do not find evidence for two previously reported sub-halo detections. However, we verify with realistic mock data that we could have found evidence in favour of a previously reported $\approx 10^{9}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ sub-halo with a log Bayes factor of 29, should it exist in the real data. After testing various systematics, we find that this previous sub-halo inference was most likely spurious and resulted from an inadequate smooth model, specifically, poorly fitting multipoles. While we do not find evidence in favour of any individual sub-halo, we find evidence for similarity in the lensing signatures of multipoles ($m=3,4$) and single massive sub-haloes, consistent with other recent work. We suggest that future searches for low-mass haloes in lensed arcs include lens angular structure in the form of multipoles up to 4th order and require a good-fitting smooth model as a prerequisite. Overall, our findings demonstrate the suitability of ALMA data of this quality to simultaneously constrain the abundance of low-mass haloes and lens angular structure.

### LATINO-PRO: LAtent consisTency INverse sOlver with PRompt Optimization
**Authors**: Alessio Spagnoletti, Jean Prost, Andrés Almansa, Nicolas Papadakis, Marcelo Pereyra

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:24:00Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) have recently emerged as powerful generative models with great potential for solving inverse problems in imaging. However, leveraging such models in a Plug & Play (PnP), zero-shot manner remains challenging because it requires identifying a suitable text prompt for the unknown image of interest. Also, existing text-to-image PnP approaches are highly computationally expensive. We herein address these challenges by proposing a novel PnP inference paradigm specifically designed for embedding generative models within stochastic inverse solvers, with special attention to Latent Consistency Models (LCMs), which distill LDMs into fast generators. We leverage our framework to propose LAtent consisTency INverse sOlver (LATINO), the first zero-shot PnP framework to solve inverse problems with priors encoded by LCMs. Our conditioning mechanism avoids automatic differentiation and reaches SOTA quality in as little as 8 neural function evaluations. As a result, LATINO delivers remarkably accurate solutions and is significantly more memory and computationally efficient than previous approaches. We then embed LATINO within an empirical Bayesian framework that automatically calibrates the text prompt from the observed measurements by marginal maximum likelihood estimation. Extensive experiments show that prompt self-calibration greatly improves estimation, allowing LATINO with PRompt Optimization to define new SOTAs in image reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. The code is available at https://latino-pro.github.io

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:22:39Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general knowledge and reasoning abilities, yet their evaluation has predominantly focused on global or anglocentric subjects, often neglecting low-resource languages and culturally specific content. While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors and misrepresent the original cultural context. To address this, we introduce SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over 7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects, encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively, overall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.

### Domain Adaptation of LLMs for Process Data
**Authors**: Rafael Seidi Oyamada, Jari Peeperkorn, Jochen De Weerdt, Johannes De Smedt

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:21:35Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent area of interest across various research domains, including Process Mining (PM). Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt engineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style datasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address diverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation, motivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of tokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational overhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses on Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and multi-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in predictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN) approaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the multi-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster convergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.

### MorphAgent: Empowering Agents through Self-Evolving Profiles and   Decentralized Collaboration
**Authors**: Siyuan Lu, Jiaqi Shao, Bing Luo, Tao Lin

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:07:23Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise in tackling complex tasks, but often rely on predefined roles and centralized coordination, limiting their adaptability to evolving challenges. This paper introduces MorphAgent, a novel Autonomous, Self-Organizing, and Self-Adaptive Multi-Agent System for decentralized agent collaboration that enables agents to dynamically evolve their roles and capabilities. Our approach employs self-evolving agent profiles, optimized through three key metrics, guiding agents in refining their individual expertise while maintaining complementary team dynamics. MorphAgent implements a two-phase process: a Profile Update phase for profile optimization, followed by a Task Execution phase where agents continuously adapt their roles based on task feedback. Our experimental results show that MorphAgent outperforms existing frameworks in terms of task performance and adaptability to changing requirements, paving the way for more robust and versatile multi-agent collaborative systems.

**Summary**: The Romansh language, spoken in Switzerland, has limited resources for machine translation evaluation. In this paper, we present a benchmark for six varieties of Romansh: Rumantsch Grischun, a supra-regional variety, and five regional varieties: Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, and Vallader. Our reference translations were created by human translators based on the WMT24++ benchmark, which ensures parallelism with more than 55 other languages. An automatic evaluation of existing MT systems and LLMs shows that translation out of Romansh into German is handled relatively well for all the varieties, but translation into Romansh is still challenging.

### Assessing subhalo finders in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations
**Authors**: Victor J. Forouhar Moreno, John Helly, Robert McGibbon, Joop Schaye, Matthieu Schaller, Jiaxin Han, Roi Kugel, Yannick M. Bahe

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:45:12Z

**Summary**: Cosmological simulations are essential for inferring cosmological and galaxy population properties based on forward-modelling, but this typically requires finding the population of (sub)haloes and galaxies that they contain. The properties of said populations vary depending on the algorithm used to find them, which is concerning as it may bias key statistics. We compare how the predicted (sub)halo mass functions, satellite radial distributions and correlation functions vary across algorithms in the dark-matter-only and hydrodynamical versions of the FLAMINGO simulations. We test three representative approaches to finding subhaloes: grouping particles in configuration- (Subfind), phase- (ROCKSTAR and VELOCIraptor) and history-space (HBT-HERONS). We also present HBT-HERONS, a new version of the HBT+ subhalo finder that improves the tracking of subhaloes. We find 10%-level differences in the $M_{\mathrm{200c}}$ mass function, reflecting different field halo definitions and occasional miscentering. The bound mass functions can differ by 75% at the high mass end, even when using the maximum circular velocity as a mass proxy. The number of well-resolved subhaloes differs by up to 20% near $R_{\mathrm{200c}}$, reflecting differences in the assignment of mass to subhaloes and their identification. The predictions of different subhalo finders increasingly diverge towards the centres of the host haloes. The performance of most subhalo finders does not improve with the resolution of the simulation and is worse for hydrodynamical than for dark-matter-only simulations. We conclude that HBT-HERONS is the preferred choice of subhalo finder due to its low computational cost, self-consistently made and robust merger trees, and robust subhalo identification capabilities.

### Adaptive KV-Cache Compression without Manually Setting Budget
**Authors**: Chenxia Tang, Jianchun Liu, Hongli Xu, Liusheng Huang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:38:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) inference relies heavily on KV-caches to accelerate autoregressive decoding, but the resulting memory footprint grows rapidly with sequence length, posing significant efficiency challenges. Current KV-cache compression methods suffer from a Procrustes' bed problem: they force diverse workloads into fixed compression ratios, leading to suboptimal resource allocation and inference performance. To this end, we present GVote, an adaptive KV-cache compression scheme that eliminates manual budget specification while achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. GVote operates on the principle that the important keys are the aggregation of keys required by future queries. The method predicts future query attention demands by Monte-Carlo style sampling potential queries and aggregating selected keys to determine the optimal cache budget without manual specification. Experimental evaluation demonstrates GVote's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks, including GSM8K, RULER and Longbench. Compared to baselines, GVote exhibits 2$\times$ memory reduction while the accuracy maintains higher or comparable.

### Enhancing Natural Language Inference Performance with Knowledge Graph   for COVID-19 Automated Fact-Checking in Indonesian Language
**Authors**: Arief Purnama Muharram, Ayu Purwarianti

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:36:10Z

**Summary**: Automated fact-checking is a key strategy to overcome the spread of COVID-19 misinformation on the internet. These systems typically leverage deep learning approaches through Natural Language Inference (NLI) to verify the truthfulness of information based on supporting evidence. However, one challenge that arises in deep learning is performance stagnation due to a lack of knowledge during training. This study proposes using a Knowledge Graph (KG) as external knowledge to enhance NLI performance for automated COVID-19 fact-checking in the Indonesian language. The proposed model architecture comprises three modules: a fact module, an NLI module, and a classifier module. The fact module processes information from the KG, while the NLI module handles semantic relationships between the given premise and hypothesis. The representation vectors from both modules are concatenated and fed into the classifier module to produce the final result. The model was trained using the generated Indonesian COVID-19 fact-checking dataset and the COVID-19 KG Bahasa Indonesia. Our study demonstrates that incorporating KGs can significantly improve NLI performance in fact-checking, achieving the best accuracy of 0.8616. This suggests that KGs are a valuable component for enhancing NLI performance in automated fact-checking.

### Towards Explainable Vulnerability Detection with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Qiheng Mao, Zhenhao Li, Xing Hu, Kui Liu, Xin Xia, Jianling Sun

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:35:23Z

**Summary**: Software vulnerabilities pose significant risks to the security and integrity of software systems. Although prior studies have explored vulnerability detection using deep learning and pre-trained models, these approaches often fail to provide the detailed explanations necessary for developers to understand and remediate vulnerabilities effectively. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has introduced transformative potential due to their advanced generative capabilities and ability to comprehend complex contexts, offering new possibilities for addressing these challenges. In this paper, we propose LLMVulExp, an automated framework designed to specialize LLMs for the dual tasks of vulnerability detection and explanation. To address the challenges of acquiring high-quality annotated data and injecting domain-specific knowledge, LLMVulExp leverages prompt-based techniques for annotating vulnerability explanations and finetunes LLMs using instruction tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enabling LLMVulExp to detect vulnerability types in code while generating detailed explanations, including the cause, location, and repair suggestions. Additionally, we employ a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based key code extraction strategy to focus LLMs on analyzing vulnerability-prone code, further enhancing detection accuracy and explanatory depth. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMVulExp achieves over a 90% F1 score on the SeVC dataset, effectively combining high detection accuracy with actionable and coherent explanations. This study highlights the feasibility of utilizing LLMs for real-world vulnerability detection and explanation tasks, providing critical insights into their adaptation and application in software security.

### RecBase: Generative Foundation Model Pretraining for Zero-Shot   Recommendation
**Authors**: Sashuai Zhou, Weinan Gan, Qijiong Liu, Ke Lei, Jieming Zhu, Hai Huang, Yan Xia, Ruiming Tang, Zhenhua Dong, Zhou Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:33:43Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in LLM-based recommendation have shown promise, yet their cross-domain generalization is hindered by a fundamental mismatch between language-centric pretraining and the recommendation task. Existing methods, relying on language-level knowledge, fail to capture dynamic, item-level user interests across domains. To bridge this gap, we propose RecBase, a domain-agnostic foundational model pretrained with a recommendation-oriented objective. RecBase leverages a large-scale, heterogeneous, cross-domain corpus with unified textual representations and feature mappings to enhance cross-domain generalization. To further align item semantics across domains, we introduce a unified item tokenizer that encodes items into hierarchical concept identifiers, enabling structured representation and efficient vocabulary sharing. The model is trained using an autoregressive objective to capture complex item-level sequential patterns. On eight real-world datasets, our 1.5B-parameter model matches or surpasses the performance of LLM baselines up to 7B parameters in zero-shot and cross-domain recommendation tasks.

### Successive Cancellation Decoding For General Monotone Chain Polar Codes
**Authors**: Zichang Ren, Chunhang Zheng, Dou Li, Yuping Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:28:20Z

**Summary**: Monotone chain polar codes generalize classical polar codes to multivariate settings, offering a flexible approach for achieving the entire admissible rate region in the distributed lossless coding problem. However, this flexibility also introduces significant challenges for existing successive cancellation (SC) based decoding schemes. Motivated by the need for a general SC decoding solution, we present a comprehensive decoding strategy for monotone chain polar codes that can handle arbitrary numbers of terminals, non-binary alphabets, and decoding along arbitrary monotone chains. Specifically, we formulate the SC decoding task as a series of inference subtasks over the polar transform and propose a computational graph framework based on probability propagation principles. This approach highlights the impact of variable switching during decoding and shows that time complexity varies between $O(N\log{N})$ and $O(N^2)$, depending on the specific chain structure. Moreover, we demonstrate that the widely used $O(N)$ space optimization is not universally applicable to monotone chain polar codes, which prompts us to introduce a constant-time decoder forking strategy based on the proposed logical computation graphs. This strategy enables time-efficient list decoding without relying on $O(N)$-space techniques. Numerical results verify the superior performance of the proposed scheme compared with the classical lazy-copy scheme.

### Kangaroo: A Private and Amortized Inference Framework over WAN for   Large-Scale Decision Tree Evaluation
**Authors**: Wei Xu, Hui Zhu, Yandong Zheng, Song Bian, Ning Sun, Hao Yuan, Dengguo Feng, Hui Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:22:20Z

**Summary**: With the rapid adoption of Models-as-a-Service, concerns about data and model privacy have become increasingly critical. To solve these problems, various privacy-preserving inference schemes have been proposed. In particular, due to the efficiency and interpretability of decision trees, private decision tree evaluation (PDTE) has garnered significant attention. However, existing PDTE schemes suffer from significant limitations: their communication and computation costs scale with the number of trees, the number of nodes, or the tree depth, which makes them inefficient for large-scale models, especially over WAN networks. To address these issues, we propose Kangaroo, a private and amortized decision tree inference framework build upon packed homomorphic encryption. Specifically, we design a novel model hiding and encoding scheme, together with secure feature selection, oblivious comparison, and secure path evaluation protocols, enabling full amortization of the overhead as the number of nodes or trees scales. Furthermore, we enhance the performance and functionality of the framework through optimizations, including same-sharing-for-same-model, latency-aware, and adaptive encoding adjustment strategies. Kangaroo achieves a $14\times$ to $59\times$ performance improvement over state-of-the-art (SOTA) one-round interactive schemes in WAN environments. For large-scale decision tree inference tasks, it delivers a $3\times$ to $44\times$ speedup compared to existing schemes. Notably, Kangaroo enables the evaluation of a random forest with $969$ trees and $411825$ nodes in approximately $60$ ms per tree (amortized) under WAN environments.

 ### Can LLMs Lie? Investigation beyond Hallucination
**Authors**: Haoran Huan, Mihir Prabhudesai, Mengning Wu, Shantanu Jaiswal, Deepak Pathak

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:59:45Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics, shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in high-stakes environments.

### Embodied AI: Emerging Risks and Opportunities for Policy Action
**Authors**: Jared Perlo, Alexander Robey, Fazl Barez, Luciano Floridi, Jakob Mökander

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:55:11Z

**Summary**: The field of embodied AI (EAI) is rapidly advancing. Unlike virtual AI, EAI systems can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. With recent advances in AI models and hardware, EAI systems are becoming increasingly capable across wider operational domains. While EAI systems can offer many benefits, they also pose significant risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, as well as economic and societal disruption. These risks require urgent attention from policymakers, as existing policies governing industrial robots and autonomous vehicles are insufficient to address the full range of concerns EAI systems present. To help address this issue, this paper makes three contributions. First, we provide a taxonomy of the physical, informational, economic, and social risks EAI systems pose. Second, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to assess how existing frameworks address these risks and to identify critical gaps. We conclude by offering policy recommendations for the safe and beneficial deployment of EAI systems, such as mandatory testing and certification schemes, clarified liability frameworks, and strategies to manage EAI's potentially transformative economic and societal impacts.

### MPCritic: A plug-and-play MPC architecture for reinforcement learning
**Authors**: Nathan P. Lawrence, Thomas Banker, Ali Mesbah

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:46:48Z

**Summary**: The reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) communities have developed vast ecosystems of theoretical approaches and computational tools for solving optimal control problems. Given their conceptual similarities but differing strengths, there has been increasing interest in synergizing RL and MPC. However, existing approaches tend to be limited for various reasons, including computational cost of MPC in an RL algorithm and software hurdles towards seamless integration of MPC and RL tools. These challenges often result in the use of "simple" MPC schemes or RL algorithms, neglecting the state-of-the-art in both areas. This paper presents MPCritic, a machine learning-friendly architecture that interfaces seamlessly with MPC tools. MPCritic utilizes the loss landscape defined by a parameterized MPC problem, focusing on "soft" optimization over batched training steps; thereby updating the MPC parameters while avoiding costly minimization and parametric sensitivities. Since the MPC structure is preserved during training, an MPC agent can be readily used for online deployment, where robust constraint satisfaction is paramount. We demonstrate the versatility of MPCritic, in terms of MPC architectures and RL algorithms that it can accommodate, on classic control benchmarks.

### Strefer: Empowering Video LLMs with Space-Time Referring and Reasoning   via Synthetic Instruction Data
**Authors**: Honglu Zhou, Xiangyu Peng, Shrikant Kendre, Michael S. Ryoo, Silvio Savarese, Caiming Xiong, Juan Carlos Niebles

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:33:20Z

**Summary**: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments. Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally, these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

### OneCAT: Decoder-Only Auto-Regressive Model for Unified Understanding and   Generation
**Authors**: Han Li, Xinyu Peng, Yaoming Wang, Zelin Peng, Xin Chen, Rongxiang Weng, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai, Wenrui Dai, Hongkai Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:29:50Z

**Summary**: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR) objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding.

### On Entropy Control in LLM-RL Algorithms
**Authors**: Han Shen

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:23:19Z

**Summary**: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits. AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently across multiple benchmarks.

### LLM Embedding-based Attribution (LEA): Quantifying Source Contributions   to Generative Model's Response for Vulnerability Analysis
**Authors**: Reza Fayyazi, Michael Zuzak, Shanchieh Jay Yang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:18:40Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for cybersecurity threat analysis, but their deployment in security-sensitive environments raises trust and safety concerns. With over 21,000 vulnerabilities disclosed in 2025, manual analysis is infeasible, making scalable and verifiable AI support critical. When querying LLMs, dealing with emerging vulnerabilities is challenging as they have a training cut-off date. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can inject up-to-date context to alleviate the cut-off date limitation, it remains unclear how much LLMs rely on retrieved evidence versus the model's internal knowledge, and whether the retrieved information is meaningful or even correct. This uncertainty could mislead security analysts, mis-prioritize patches, and increase security risks. Therefore, this work proposes LLM Embedding-based Attribution (LEA) to analyze the generated responses for vulnerability exploitation analysis. More specifically, LEA quantifies the relative contribution of internal knowledge vs. retrieved content in the generated responses. We evaluate LEA on 500 critical vulnerabilities disclosed between 2016 and 2025, across three RAG settings -- valid, generic, and incorrect -- using three state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate LEA's ability to detect clear distinctions between non-retrieval, generic-retrieval, and valid-retrieval scenarios with over 95% accuracy on larger models. Finally, we demonstrate the limitations posed by incorrect retrieval of vulnerability information and raise a cautionary note to the cybersecurity community regarding the blind reliance on LLMs and RAG for vulnerability analysis. LEA offers security analysts with a metric to audit RAG-enhanced workflows, improving the transparent and trustworthy deployment of AI in cybersecurity threat analysis.

### LanternNet: A Hub-and-Spoke System to Seek and Suppress Spotted   Lanternfly Populations
**Authors**: Vinil Polepalli

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:09:49Z

**Summary**: The invasive spotted lanternfly (SLF) poses a significant threat to agriculture and ecosystems, causing widespread damage. Current control methods, such as egg scraping, pesticides, and quarantines, prove labor-intensive, environmentally hazardous, and inadequate for long-term SLF suppression. This research introduces LanternNet, a novel autonomous robotic Hub-and-Spoke system designed for scalable detection and suppression of SLF populations. A central, tree-mimicking hub utilizes a YOLOv8 computer vision model for precise SLF identification. Three specialized robotic spokes perform targeted tasks: pest neutralization, environmental monitoring, and navigation/mapping. Field deployment across multiple infested sites over 5 weeks demonstrated LanternNet's efficacy. Quantitative analysis revealed significant reductions (p < 0.01, paired t-tests) in SLF populations and corresponding improvements in tree health indicators across the majority of test sites. Compared to conventional methods, LanternNet offers substantial cost advantages and improved scalability. Furthermore, the system's adaptability for enhanced autonomy and targeting of other invasive species presents significant potential for broader ecological impact. LanternNet demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating robotics and AI for advanced invasive species management and improved environmental outcomes.

### SimpleTIR: End-to-End Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn   Tool-Integrated Reasoning
**Authors**: Zhenghai Xue, Longtao Zheng, Qian Liu, Yingru Li, Xiaosen Zheng, Zejun Ma, Bo An

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:06:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly improve their reasoning capabilities by interacting with external tools, a paradigm known as Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and performance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by a distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing catastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter out trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code block nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the policy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude gradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show that SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math reasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model. Furthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR encourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns, such as self-correction and cross-validation.

### Efficiently Editing Mixture-of-Experts Models with Compressed Experts
**Authors**: Yifei He, Yang Liu, Chen Liang, Hany Hassan Awadalla

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:06:38Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become a key approach for scaling large language models efficiently by activating only a subset of experts during training and inference. Typically, the number of activated experts presents a trade-off: fewer experts reduce computational costs, while more experts improve performance. Recent studies reveal that not all activated experts contribute equally to model performance, with some providing minimal utility, particularly when finetuning pretrained MoE models for specialized downstream tasks. The co-existence of significant and redundant parameters in experts provides us an opportunity to reduce the number of activated experts while maintaining model performance. In this work, we propose the concept of compressed experts, lightweight modules that serve as compact representations of full experts. Our approach preserves the most important experts while replacing other auxiliary activated experts with compressed experts. The reduction of active parameters significantly lowers inference costs while achieving comparable performance. Extensive experiments on models including Phi-MoE and OLMoE demonstrate that compressed experts recover over 90% of full expert performance across various tasks while reducing more than 30% active parameters and saving 20% in inference costs. This approach enables efficient deployment of MoE models in resource-constrained settings and facilitates scaling to larger models with manageable overhead. Our code is available at https://github.com/yifei-he/Compressed-Experts.

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T17:03:15Z

**Summary**: Automated agents, powered by Large language models (LLMs), are emerging as the go-to tool for querying information. However, evaluation benchmarks for LLM agents rarely feature natural questions that are both information-seeking and genuinely time-consuming for humans. To address this gap we introduce MoNaCo, a benchmark of 1,315 natural and time-consuming questions that require dozens, and at times hundreds, of intermediate steps to solve -- far more than any existing QA benchmark. To build MoNaCo, we developed a decomposed annotation pipeline to elicit and manually answer real-world time-consuming questions at scale. Frontier LLMs evaluated on MoNaCo achieve at most 61.2% F1, hampered by low recall and hallucinations. Our results underscore the limitations of LLM-powered agents in handling the complexity and sheer breadth of real-world information-seeking tasks -- with MoNaCo providing an effective resource for tracking such progress. The MoNaCo benchmark, codebase, prompts and models predictions are all publicly available at: https://tomerwolgithub.github.io/monaco

### Joint Training of Image Generator and Detector for Road Defect Detection
**Authors**: Kuan-Chuan Peng

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T16:41:50Z

**Summary**: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for deployment on edge devices in practice.

### The Impact of Critique on LLM-Based Model Generation from Natural   Language: The Case of Activity Diagrams
**Authors**: Parham Khamsepour, Mark Cole, Ish Ashraf, Sandeep Puri, Mehrdad Sabetzadeh, Shiva Nejati

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T16:39:25Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong potential for automating the generation of models from natural-language descriptions. A common approach is an iterative generate-critique-refine loop, where candidate models are produced, evaluated, and updated based on detected issues. This process needs to address: (1) structural correctness - compliance with well-formedness rules - and (2) semantic alignment - accurate reflection of the intended meaning in the source text. We present LADEX (LLM-based Activity Diagram Extractor), a pipeline for deriving activity diagrams from natural-language process descriptions using an LLM-driven critique-refine process. Structural checks in LADEX can be performed either algorithmically or by an LLM, while alignment checks are always performed by an LLM. We design five ablated variants of LADEX to study: (i) the impact of the critique-refine loop itself, (ii) the role of LLM-based semantic checks, and (iii) the comparative effectiveness of algorithmic versus LLM-based structural checks.   To evaluate LADEX, we compare the generated activity diagrams with expert-created ground truths using trace-based operational semantics. This enables automated measurement of correctness and completeness. Experiments on two datasets indicate that: (1) the critique-refine loop improves structural validity, correctness, and completeness compared to single-pass generation; (2) algorithmic structural checks eliminate inconsistencies that LLM-based checks fail to detect, improving correctness by an average of 17.81% and completeness by 13.24% over LLM-only checks; and (3) combining algorithmic structural checks with LLM-based semantic checks, implemented using the reasoning-focused O4 Mini, achieves the best overall performance - yielding average correctness of up to 86.37% and average completeness of up to 88.56% - while requiring fewer than five LLM calls on average.

### sam-llm: interpretable lane change trajectoryprediction via parametric   finetuning
**Authors**: Zhuo Cao, Yunxiao Shi, Min Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T16:37:49Z

**Summary**: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete, continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.

### Rapid Word Learning Through Meta In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Wentao Wang, Guangyuan Jiang, Tal Linzen, Brenden M. Lake

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T16:36:17Z

**Summary**: Humans can quickly learn a new word from a few illustrative examples, and then systematically and flexibly use it in novel contexts. Yet the abilities of current language models for few-shot word learning, and methods for improving these abilities, are underexplored. In this study, we introduce a novel method, Meta-training for IN-context learNing Of Words (Minnow). This method trains language models to generate new examples of a word's usage given a few in-context examples, using a special placeholder token to represent the new word. This training is repeated on many new words to develop a general word-learning ability. We find that training models from scratch with Minnow on human-scale child-directed language enables strong few-shot word learning, comparable to a large language model (LLM) pre-trained on orders of magnitude more data. Furthermore, through discriminative and generative evaluations, we demonstrate that finetuning pre-trained LLMs with Minnow improves their ability to discriminate between new words, identify syntactic categories of new words, and generate reasonable new usages and definitions for new words, based on one or a few in-context examples. These findings highlight the data efficiency of Minnow and its potential to improve language model performance in word learning tasks.

### WildFireCan-MMD: A Multimodal Dataset for Classification of   User-Generated Content During Wildfires in Canada
**Authors**: Braeden Sherritt, Isar Nejadgholi, Efstratios Aivaliotis, Khaled Mslmani, Marzieh Amini

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T16:22:06Z

**Summary**: Rapid information access is vital during wildfires, yet traditional data sources are slow and costly. Social media offers real-time updates, but extracting relevant insights remains a challenge. In this work, we focus on multimodal wildfire social media data, which, although existing in current datasets, is currently underrepresented in Canadian contexts. We present WildFireCan-MMD, a new multimodal dataset of X posts from recent Canadian wildfires, annotated across twelve key themes. We evaluate zero-shot vision-language models on this dataset and compare their results with those of custom-trained and baseline classifiers. We show that while baseline methods and zero-shot prompting offer quick deployment, custom-trained models outperform them when labelled data is available. Our best-performing custom model reaches 84.48% f-score, outperforming VLMs and baseline classifiers. We also demonstrate how this model can be used to uncover trends during wildfires, through the collection and analysis of a large unlabeled dataset. Our dataset facilitates future research in wildfire response, and our findings highlight the importance of tailored datasets and task-specific training. Importantly, such datasets should be localized, as disaster response requirements vary across regions and contexts.

### A DbC Inspired Neurosymbolic Layer for Trustworthy Agent Design
**Authors**: Claudiu Leoveanu-Condrei

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T16:15:16Z

**Summary**: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs, coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance. The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with respect to those contracts.

### The Ramon Llull's Thinking Machine for Automated Ideation
**Authors**: Xinran Zhao, Boyuan Zheng, Chenglei Si, Haofei Yu, Ken Liu, Runlong Zhou, Ruochen Li, Tong Chen, Xiang Li, Yiming Zhang, Tongshuang Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T16:14:12Z

**Summary**: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g., efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work - motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

### Group-in-Group Policy Optimization for LLM Agent Training
**Authors**: Lang Feng, Zhenghai Xue, Tingcong Liu, Bo An

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T16:13:41Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in group-based reinforcement learning (RL) have driven frontier large language models (LLMs) in single-turn tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, their scalability to long-horizon LLM agent training remains limited. Unlike static tasks, agent-environment interactions unfold over many steps and often yield sparse or delayed rewards, making credit assignment across individual steps significantly more challenging. In this work, we propose Group-in-Group Policy Optimization (GiGPO), a novel RL algorithm that achieves fine-grained credit assignment for LLM agents while preserving the appealing properties of group-based RL: critic-free, low memory, and stable convergence. GiGPO introduces a two-level structure for estimating relative advantage: (i) At the episode-level, GiGPO computes macro relative advantages based on groups of complete trajectories; (ii) At the step-level, GiGPO introduces an anchor state grouping mechanism that retroactively constructs step-level groups by identifying repeated environment states across trajectories. Actions stemming from the same state are grouped together, enabling micro relative advantage estimation. This hierarchical structure effectively captures both global trajectory quality and local step effectiveness without relying on auxiliary models or additional rollouts. We evaluate GiGPO on two challenging agent benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, using Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Crucially, GiGPO delivers fine-grained per-step credit signals and achieves performance gains of > 12\% on ALFWorld and > 9\% on WebShop over the GRPO baseline: all while maintaining the same GPU memory overhead, identical LLM rollout, and incurring little to no additional time cost.

### Problem Solved? Information Extraction Design Space for Layout-Rich   Documents using LLMs
**Authors**: Gaye Colakoglu, Gürkan Solmaz, Jonathan Fürst

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:53:18Z

**Summary**: This paper defines and explores the design space for information extraction (IE) from layout-rich documents using large language models (LLMs). The three core challenges of layout-aware IE with LLMs are 1) data structuring, 2) model engagement, and 3) output refinement. Our study investigates the sub-problems and methods within these core challenges, such as input representation, chunking, prompting, selection of LLMs, and multimodal models. It examines the effect of different design choices through LayIE-LLM, a new, open-source, layout-aware IE test suite, benchmarking against traditional, fine-tuned IE models. The results on two IE datasets show that LLMs require adjustment of the IE pipeline to achieve competitive performance: the optimized configuration found with LayIE-LLM achieves 13.3--37.5 F1 points more than a general-practice baseline configuration using the same LLM. To find a well-working configuration, we develop a one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method that achieves near-optimal results. Our method is only 0.8--1.8 points lower than the best full factorial exploration with a fraction (2.8%) of the required computation. Overall, we demonstrate that, if well-configured, general-purpose LLMs match the performance of specialized models, providing a cost-effective, finetuning-free alternative. Our test-suite is available at https://github.com/gayecolakoglu/LayIE-LLM.

### Curse of Knowledge: When Complex Evaluation Context Benefits yet Biases   LLM Judges
**Authors**: Weiyuan Li, Xintao Wang, Siyu Yuan, Rui Xu, Jiangjie Chen, Qingqing Dong, Yanghua Xiao, Deqing Yang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:48:33Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face increasingly diverse and complex tasks, making reliable evaluation challenging. The paradigm of LLMs as judges has emerged as a scalable solution, yet prior work primarily focuses on simple settings. Their reliability in complex tasks--where multi-faceted rubrics, unstructured reference answers, and nuanced criteria are critical--remains understudied. In this paper, we constructed ComplexEval, a challenge benchmark designed to systematically expose and quantify Auxiliary Information Induced Biases. We systematically investigated and validated 6 previously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios. Key findings reveal: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant susceptibility to these biases, with bias magnitude scaling with task complexity; (2) notably, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) show paradoxical vulnerability. Our in-depth analysis offers crucial insights for improving the accuracy and verifiability of evaluation signals, paving the way for more general and robust evaluation models.

### A Privacy-Preserving Recommender for Filling Web Forms Using a Local   Large Language Model
**Authors**: Amirreza Nayyeri, Abbas Rasoolzadegan

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:43:01Z

**Summary**: Web applications are increasingly used in critical domains such as education, finance, and e-commerce. This highlights the need to ensure their failure-free performance. One effective method for evaluating failure-free performance is web form testing, where defining effective test scenarios is key to a complete and accurate evaluation. A core aspect of this process involves filling form fields with suitable values to create effective test cases. However, manually generating these values is time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this, various tools have been developed to assist testers. With the appearance of large language models (LLMs), a new generation of tools seeks to handle this task more intelligently. Although many LLM-based tools have been introduced, as these models typically rely on cloud infrastructure, their use in testing confidential web forms raises concerns about unintended data leakage and breaches of confidentiality. This paper introduces a privacy-preserving recommender that operates locally using a large language model. The tool assists testers in web form testing by suggesting effective field values. This tool analyzes the HTML structure of forms, detects input types, and extracts constraints based on each field's type and contextual content, guiding proper field filling.

**Authors**: Yuxuan Huang, Yihang Chen, Haozheng Zhang, Kang Li, Huichi Zhou, Meng Fang, Linyi Yang, Xiaoguang Li, Lifeng Shang, Songcen Xu, Jianye Hao, Kun Shao, Jun Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:32:23Z

**Summary**: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a new category of autonomous AI systems, referred to as Deep Research (DR) agents. These agents are designed to tackle complex, multi-turn informational research tasks by leveraging a combination of dynamic reasoning, adaptive long-horizon planning, multi-hop information retrieval, iterative tool use, and the generation of structured analytical reports. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of the foundational technologies and architectural components that constitute Deep Research agents. We begin by reviewing information acquisition strategies, contrasting API-based retrieval methods with browser-based exploration. We then examine modular tool-use frameworks, including code execution, multimodal input processing, and the integration of Model Context Protocols (MCPs) to support extensibility and ecosystem development. To systematize existing approaches, we propose a taxonomy that differentiates between static and dynamic workflows, and we classify agent architectures based on planning strategies and agent composition, including single-agent and multi-agent configurations. We also provide a critical evaluation of current benchmarks, highlighting key limitations such as restricted access to external knowledge, sequential execution inefficiencies, and misalignment between evaluation metrics and the practical objectives of DR agents. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising directions for future research. A curated and continuously updated repository of DR agent research is available at: {https://github.com/ai-agents-2030/awesome-deep-research-agent}.

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:20:53Z

**Summary**: This paper presents MagicGUI, a foundational mobile GUI agent designed to address critical challenges in perception, grounding, and reasoning within real-world mobile GUI environments. The framework is underpinned by following six key components: (1) a comprehensive and accurate dataset, constructed via the scalable GUI Data Pipeline, which aggregates the largest and most diverse GUI-centric multimodal data to date from open-source repositories, automated crawling, and targeted manual annotation; (2) enhanced perception and grounding capabilities, facilitating fine-grained multimodal alignment for UI element referencing, grounding, and screen comprehension; (3) a comprehensive and unified action space, encompassing both fundamental UI operations and complex interactive intents to support human-agent interactions; (4) planning-oriented reasoning mechanisms that enable the model to decompose complex user instructions into sequential actions with explicit intermediate meta-paln reasoning; (5) an iterative two-stage training procedure, combining large-scale continue pre-training on 7.8M samples with reinforcement fine-tuning utilizing a spatially enhanced composite reward and dual filtering strategy; and (6) competitive performance on both the proprietary Magic-RICH benchmark and over a dozen public benchmarks, achieving superior performance across GUI perception and agent tasks, while demonstrating robust generalization and real-world deployment potential in practical mobile GUI scenarios, as detailed in Figure 1.

**Authors**: Trent D. Buskirk, Florian Keusch, Leah von der Heyde, Adam Eck

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:15:31Z

**Summary**: Survey research has a long-standing history of being a human-powered field, but one that embraces various technologies for the collection, processing, and analysis of various behavioral, political, and social outcomes of interest, among others. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) bring new technological challenges and prerequisites in order to fully harness their potential. In this paper, we report work-in-progress on a systematic literature review based on keyword searches from multiple large-scale databases as well as citation networks that assesses how LLMs are currently being applied within the survey research process. We synthesize and organize our findings according to the survey research process to include examples of LLM usage across three broad phases: pre-data collection, data collection, and post-data collection. We discuss selected examples of potential use cases for LLMs as well as its pitfalls based on examples from existing literature. Considering survey research has rich experience and history regarding data quality, we discuss some opportunities and describe future outlooks for survey research to contribute to the continued development and refinement of LLMs.

### Breaking the HBM Bit Cost Barrier: Domain-Specific ECC for AI Inference   Infrastructure
**Authors**: Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Yunhua Fang, Linsen Ma, Sanchari Sen, Swagath Venkataramani, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:58:07Z

**Summary**: High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) delivers exceptional bandwidth and energy efficiency for AI workloads, but its high cost per bit, driven in part by stringent on-die reliability requirements, poses a growing barrier to scalable deployment. This work explores a system-level approach to cost reduction by eliminating on-die ECC and shifting all fault management to the memory controller. We introduce a domain-specific ECC framework combining large-codeword Reed--Solomon~(RS) correction with lightweight fine-grained CRC detection, differential parity updates to mitigate write amplification, and tunable protection based on data importance. Our evaluation using LLM inference workloads shows that, even under raw HBM bit error rates up to $10^{-3}$, the system retains over 78\% of throughput and 97\% of model accuracy compared with systems equipped with ideal error-free HBM. By treating reliability as a tunable system parameter rather than a fixed hardware constraint, our design opens a new path toward low-cost, high-performance HBM deployment in AI infrastructure.

### Pruning Weights but Not Truth: Safeguarding Truthfulness While Pruning   LLMs
**Authors**: Yao Fu, Runchao Li, Xianxuan Long, Haotian Yu, Xiaotian Han, Yu Yin, Pan Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:58:03Z

**Summary**: Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance. However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs' internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection. Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at 50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

### Dependency Chain Analysis of ROS 2 DDS QoS Policies: From Lifecycle   Tutorial to Static Verification
**Authors**: Sanghoon Lee, Junha Kang, Kyung-Joon Park

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:57:21Z

**Summary**: Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) relies on the Data Distribution Service (DDS), which offers more than 20 Quality of Service (QoS) policies governing availability, reliability, and resource usage. Yet ROS 2 users lack clear guidance on safe policy combinations and validation processes prior to deployment, which often leads to trial-and-error tuning and unexpected runtime failures. To address these challenges, we analyze DDS Publisher-Subscriber communication over a life cycle divided into Discovery, Data Exchange, and Disassociation, and provide a user oriented tutorial explaining how 16 QoS policies operate in each phase. Building on this analysis, we derive a QoS dependency chain that formalizes inter-policy relationships and classifies 41 dependency violation rules, capturing constraints that commonly cause communication failures in practice. Finally, we introduce QoS Guard, a ROS 2 package that statically validates DDS XML profiles offline, flags conflicts, and enables safe, predeployment tuning without establishing a live ROS 2 session. Together, these contributions give ROS 2 users both conceptual insight and a concrete tool that enables early detection of misconfigurations, improving the reliability and resource efficiency of ROS 2 based robotic systems.

### Situating AI Agents in their World: Aspective Agentic AI for Dynamic   Partially Observable Information Systems
**Authors**: Peter J. Bentley, Soo Ling Lim, Fuyuki Ishikawa

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:57:04Z

**Summary**: Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment, with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control of information. We provide an illustrative implementation and show that compared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time, aspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this concept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information niches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency.

**Authors**: Zhilong Chen, Chengzong Zhao, Boyuan Chen, Dayi Lin, Yihao Chen, Arthur Leung, Gopi Krishnan Rajbahadur, Gustavo A. Oliva, Haoxiang Zhang, Aaditya Bhatia, Chong Chun Yong, Ahmed E. Hassan

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:56:47Z

**Summary**: Training software engineering (SWE) LLMs is bottlenecked by expensive infrastructure, inefficient evaluation pipelines, scarce training data, and costly quality control. We present RepoForge, an autonomous, end-to-end pipeline that generates, evaluates, and trains SWE agents at scale. Our key contributions include: (1) RepoForge-8B-Agent, achieving 17.4\% on SWE-Bench-Verified~\citep{swebench_verified2024}, establishing new state-of-the-art for $\leq$8B non-thinking LLMs; (2) 7,304 executable environments auto-generated from real GitHub commits with zero manual intervention; (3) 14$\times$ storage reduction (1.4GB $\rightarrow$ 102MB per instance) via intelligent dependency management and image pruning; (4) $>$70\% faster evaluation using a Ray-powered~\citep{ray2018} distributed RepoForge harness; (5) 19,000$\times$ cheaper labeling through our automated SPICE~\citep{spice2024} difficulty assessment technique. By unifying storage-efficient sandboxing, Ray-powered evaluation harness, automated data generation, SPICE-based labeling, and bubble-free RL scaffold, we demonstrate that even $\leq$8B models can reach new state-of-the-art performance on demanding benchmarks like SWE-Bench-Verified. Our approach addresses critical bottlenecks in SWE agent training: high storage costs of container-based evaluation, inefficient sequential reward pipelines, limited availability of high-quality training data, expensive manual labeling, and multi-turn RL pipeline bottlenecks.

### Mooncake: A KVCache-centric Disaggregated Architecture for LLM Serving
**Authors**: Ruoyu Qin, Zheming Li, Weiran He, Mingxing Zhang, Yongwei Wu, Weimin Zheng, Xinran Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:56:29Z

**Summary**: Mooncake is the serving platform for Kimi, a leading LLM service provided by Moonshot AI. It features a KVCache-centric disaggregated architecture that separates the prefill and decoding clusters. It also leverages the underutilized CPU, DRAM, and SSD resources of the GPU cluster to implement a disaggregated cache of KVCache. The core of Mooncake is its KVCache-centric scheduler, which balances maximizing overall effective throughput while meeting latency-related Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Unlike traditional studies that assume all requests will be processed, Mooncake faces challenges due to highly overloaded scenarios. To mitigate these, we developed a prediction-based early rejection policy. Experiments show that Mooncake excels in long-context scenarios. Compared to the baseline method, Mooncake can achieve up to a 525% increase in throughput in certain simulated scenarios while adhering to SLOs. Under real workloads, Mooncake's innovative architecture enables Kimi to handle 75% more requests.

### Amplifying Effective CXL Memory Bandwidth for LLM Inference via   Transparent Near-Data Processing
**Authors**: Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Linsen Ma, Yunhua Fang, Zirak Burzin Engineer, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:53:45Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) inference is bottlenecked by the limited bandwidth of CXL-based memory used for capacity expansion. We introduce CXL-NDP, a transparent near-data processing architecture that amplifies effective CXL bandwidth without requiring changes to the CXL.mem interface or AI models. CXL-NDP integrates a precision-scalable bit-plane layout for dynamic quantization with transparent lossless compression of weights and KV caches directly within the CXL device. In end-to-end serving, CXL-NDP improves throughput by 43%, extends the maximum context length by 87%, and reduces the KV cache footprint by 46.9% without accuracy loss. Hardware synthesis confirms its practicality with a modest silicon footprint, lowering the barrier for adopting efficient, scalable CXL-based memory in generative AI infrastructure.

### Variation-matching sensitivity-based virtual fields for hyperelastic   material model calibration
**Authors**: Denislav P. Nikolov, Zhiren Zhu, Jonathan B. Estrada

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:46:57Z

**Summary**: Accurate identification of nonlinear material parameters from three-dimensional full-field deformation data remains a challenge in experimental mechanics. The virtual fields method (VFM) provides a powerful, computationally efficient approach for material model calibration, however, its success depends critically on the choice of virtual fields and the informativeness of available kinematic data. In this work, we advance the state-of-the-art discrete formulation of the sensitivity-based virtual fields (SBVF) method by systematically developing and comparing alternative variational and analytical SBVFs within a strain-invariant-based modeling framework.   A central contribution of this work is the implementation and assessment of variation-based SBVFs (vSBVFs), formulated using directional G\^ateaux derivatives, as well as virtual fields derived from analytical differentiation (aSBVFs) which provide explicit, model-tailored virtual displacement fields for parameter identification. Using simulated noisy volumetric datasets, we demonstrate that vSBVFs and aSBVFs enable procedural, automated construction of optimal virtual fields for each material parameter, substantially enhancing the robustness and efficiency of calibration without the need for manual field selection or high temporal resolution in the data acquisition. We quantify data richness -- the effective diversity of sampled kinematic states -- showing that increased data richness via sample geometry and loading protocols leads to improved parameter identifiability. These findings establish a pathway for automated, noise-robust material model calibration suitable for future deployment with experimental full-field imaging of soft, complex materials, and provide a foundation for optimizing shape topology and extending to viscoelastic and anisotropic behaviors.

### CoT-Self-Instruct: Building high-quality synthetic prompts for reasoning   and non-reasoning tasks
**Authors**: Ping Yu, Jack Lanchantin, Tianlu Wang, Weizhe Yuan, Olga Golovneva, Ilia Kulikov, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Jason Weston, Jing Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:36:00Z

**Summary**: We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on given seed tasks, and then generate a new synthetic example of similar quality and complexity. This is followed by a filtering step to select high-quality data using automatic metrics, which are then used for LLM training. In verifiable reasoning, our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as s1k and OpenMathReasoning, when evaluated on MATH500, AMC23, AIME24, and GPQA-Diamond. For non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the performance of both human and standard Self-Instruct training data on the AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard benchmarks.

### LLM as an Execution Estimator: Recovering Missing Dependency for   Practical Time-travelling Debugging
**Authors**: Yunrui Pei, Hongshu Wang, Wenjie Zhang, Yun Lin, Weiyu Kong, Jin song Dong

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:34:30Z

**Summary**: Determining the dynamic data dependency of a step that reads a variable $v$ is challenging. It typically requires either exhaustive instrumentation, which becomes prohibitively expensive when $v$ is defined within library calls, or repeated executions, which are impractical for non-deterministic programs. In this work, we propose RecovSlicing for computing dynamic data dependency in a single run, with only partial instrumentation. We explore the intuition that LLM can potentially infer program dynamics based on a partially recorded trace and relevant code as its context. Given (1) a partially recorded trace of a program $P$ and (2) the slicing criteria consisting of a query step $s$ and a query variable $v$ read by $s$, RecovSlicing computes the runtime definition of $v$ on the trace by estimating the miss-recorded execution of $P$. In this work, we allow the user to specify implicit query variable. Technically, built upon non-deterministic LLM, we address the challenges of (1) precise recovery of runtime variable value and structure from the recorded execution and (2) aligning the memory address of recovered variables and the recorded variables for definition analysis. We evaluate RecovSlicing on 8300 data dependencies across three slicing benchmarks, comparing it with Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer. RecovSlicing achieves significantly higher accuracy (80.3%, 91.1%, 98.3%) and recall (up to 98.3%) than the best baseline (accuracy: 39.0%, 82.0%, 59.9%; recall: 53.4%, 79.1%, 87.1%). Integrated into a dual-slicing regression bug localizer, it identifies 16% more regressions.

### Language Models Do Not Follow Occam's Razor: A Benchmark for Inductive   and Abductive Reasoning
**Authors**: Yunxin Sun, Abulhair Saparov

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:22:42Z

**Summary**: Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However, most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs' inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.

### EvolveSignal: A Large Language Model Powered Coding Agent for   Discovering Traffic Signal Control Algorithms
**Authors**: Leizhen Wang, Peibo Duan, Hao Wang, Yue Wang, Jian Xu, Nan Zheng, Zhenliang Ma

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T09:25:05Z

**Summary**: In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator) and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers. This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation engineering.

### VulnRepairEval: An Exploit-Based Evaluation Framework for Assessing   Large Language Model Vulnerability Repair Capabilities
**Authors**: Weizhe Wang, Wei Ma, Qiang Hu, Yao Zhang, Jianfei Sun, Bin Wu, Yang Liu, Guangquan Xu, Lingxiao Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:06:10Z

**Summary**: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated software vulnerability patching has shown promising outcomes on carefully curated evaluation sets. Nevertheless, existing datasets predominantly rely on superficial validation methods rather than exploit-based verification, leading to overestimated performance in security-sensitive applications. This paper introduces VulnRepairEval, an evaluation framework anchored in functional Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits. Our framework delivers a comprehensive, containerized evaluation pipeline that enables reproducible differential assessment, where repair success requires the original exploit to fail execution against the modified code. The benchmark construction involved extensive data curation: we processed over 400 CVEs and approximately 2,500 potential sources to extract a collection of authentic vulnerability instances (23 Python CVEs) amenable to automated testing with working PoCs. Through VulnRepairEval, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 12 popular LLMs and observe a significant performance deficit: even the top-performing model successfully addresses merely 5/23 instances (about 21.7%), exposing critical weaknesses in security-focused applications. Our failure analysis reveals that most unsuccessful attempts stem from imprecise vulnerability identification and patches containing syntactic or semantic errors. Enhanced prompting strategies and multi-agent approaches yield minimal improvements, with overall effectiveness remaining largely unaffected. This work contributes a stringent, practical evaluation framework for LLM-driven vulnerability remediation and underscores the necessity for assessment protocols that authentically reflect real-world exploitation scenarios.

### SESGO: Spanish Evaluation of Stereotypical Generative Outputs
**Authors**: Melissa Robles, Catalina Bernal, Denniss Raigoso, Mateo Dulce Rubio

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:04:51Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the critical gap in evaluating bias in multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), with a specific focus on Spanish language within culturally-aware Latin American contexts. Despite widespread global deployment, current evaluations remain predominantly US-English-centric, leaving potential harms in other linguistic and cultural contexts largely underexamined. We introduce a novel, culturally-grounded framework for detecting social biases in instruction-tuned LLMs. Our approach adapts the underspecified question methodology from the BBQ dataset by incorporating culturally-specific expressions and sayings that encode regional stereotypes across four social categories: gender, race, socioeconomic class, and national origin. Using more than 4,000 prompts, we propose a new metric that combines accuracy with the direction of error to effectively balance model performance and bias alignment in both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts. To our knowledge, our work presents the first systematic evaluation examining how leading commercial LLMs respond to culturally specific bias in the Spanish language, revealing varying patterns of bias manifestation across state-of-the-art models. We also contribute evidence that bias mitigation techniques optimized for English do not effectively transfer to Spanish tasks, and that bias patterns remain largely consistent across different sampling temperatures. Our modular framework offers a natural extension to new stereotypes, bias categories, or languages and cultural contexts, representing a significant step toward more equitable and culturally-aware evaluation of AI systems in the diverse linguistic environments where they operate.

### Empowering Lightweight MLLMs with Reasoning via Long CoT SFT
**Authors**: Linyu Ou

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T13:53:29Z

**Summary**: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs.

### FedP$^2$EFT: Federated Learning to Personalize PEFT for Multilingual   LLMs
**Authors**: Royson Lee, Minyoung Kim, Fady Rezk, Rui Li, Stylianos I. Venieris, Timothy Hospedales

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T13:46:10Z

**Summary**: Federated learning (FL) has enabled the training of multilingual large language models (LLMs) on diverse and decentralized multilingual data, especially on low-resource languages. To improve client-specific performance, personalization via the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules such as LoRA is common. This involves a personalization strategy (PS), such as the design of the PEFT adapter structures (e.g., in which layers to add LoRAs and what ranks) and choice of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates) for fine-tuning. Instead of manual PS configuration, we propose FedP$^2$EFT, a federated learning-to-personalize method for multilingual LLMs in cross-device FL settings. Unlike most existing PEFT structure selection methods, which are prone to overfitting low-data regimes, FedP$^2$EFT collaboratively learns the optimal personalized PEFT structure for each client via Bayesian sparse rank selection. Evaluations on both simulated and real-world multilingual FL benchmarks demonstrate that FedP$^2$EFT largely outperforms existing personalized fine-tuning methods, while complementing other existing FL methods. Code is available at https://github.com/SamsungLabs/fedp2eft.

### AgenTracer: Who Is Inducing Failure in the LLM Agentic Systems?
**Authors**: Guibin Zhang, Junhao Wang, Junjie Chen, Wangchunshu Zhou, Kun Wang, Shuicheng Yan

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T13:42:14Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning, capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions. On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving agentic AI.

**Authors**: Evgenii Kniazev, Arseny Kravchenko, Igor Rekun, James Broadhead, Nikita Shamgunov, Pranav Sah, Pratik Nichite, Ivan Yamshchikov

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T13:41:45Z

**Summary**: We present app.build (https://github.com/appdotbuild/agent/), an open-source framework that improves LLM-based application generation through systematic validation and structured environments. Our approach combines multi-layered validation pipelines, stack-specific orchestration, and model-agnostic architecture, implemented across three reference stacks. Through evaluation on 30 generation tasks, we demonstrate that comprehensive validation achieves 73.3% viability rate with 30% reaching perfect quality scores, while open-weights models achieve 80.8% of closed-model performance when provided structured environments. The open-source framework has been adopted by the community, with over 3,000 applications generated to date. This work demonstrates that scaling reliable AI agents requires scaling environments, not just models -- providing empirical insights and complete reference implementations for production-oriented agent systems.

### LatPhon: Lightweight Multilingual G2P for Romance Languages and English
**Authors**: Luis Felipe Chary, Miguel Arjona Ramirez

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T13:25:44Z

**Summary**: Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion is a key front-end for text-to-speech (TTS), automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) and alignment systems, especially across multiple Latin-script languages.We present LatPhon, a 7.5 M - parameter Transformer jointly trained on six such languages--English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian. On the public ipa-dict corpus, it attains a mean phoneme error rate (PER) of 3.5%, outperforming the byte-level ByT5 baseline (5.4%) and approaching language-specific WFSTs (3.2%) while occupying 30 MB of memory, which makes on-device deployment feasible when needed. These results indicate that compact multilingual G2P can serve as a universal front-end for Latin-language speech pipelines.

### Machine Learning-Driven Anomaly Detection for 5G O-RAN Performance   Metrics
**Authors**: Babak Azkaei, Kishor Chandra Joshi, George Exarchakos

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T13:18:41Z

**Summary**: The ever-increasing reliance of critical services on network infrastructure coupled with the increased operational complexity of beyond-5G/6G networks necessitate the need for proactive and automated network fault management. The provision for open interfaces among different radio access network\,(RAN) elements and the integration of AI/ML into network architecture enabled by the Open RAN\,(O-RAN) specifications bring new possibilities for active network health monitoring and anomaly detection. In this paper we leverage these advantages and develop an anomaly detection framework that proactively detect the possible throughput drops for a UE and minimize the post-handover failures. We propose two actionable anomaly detection algorithms tailored for real-world deployment. The first algorithm identifies user equipment (UE) at risk of severe throughput degradation by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as resource block utilization and signal quality metrics, enabling proactive handover initiation. The second algorithm evaluates neighbor cell radio coverage quality, filtering out cells with anomalous signal strength or interference levels. This reduces candidate targets for handover by 41.27\% on average. Together, these methods mitigate post-handover failures and throughput drops while operating much faster than the near-real-time latency constraints. This paves the way for self-healing 6G networks.

### Bridging Gaps Between Student and Expert Evaluations of AI-Generated   Programming Hints
**Authors**: Tung Phung, Mengyan Wu, Heeryung Choi, Gustavo Soares, Sumit Gulwani, Adish Singla, Christopher Brooks

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T12:38:35Z

**Summary**: Generative AI has the potential to enhance education by providing personalized feedback to students at scale. Recent work has proposed techniques to improve AI-generated programming hints and has evaluated their performance based on expert-designed rubrics or student ratings. However, it remains unclear how the rubrics used to design these techniques align with students' perceived helpfulness of hints. In this paper, we systematically study the mismatches in perceived hint quality from students' and experts' perspectives based on the deployment of AI-generated hints in a Python programming course. We analyze scenarios with discrepancies between student and expert evaluations, in particular, where experts rated a hint as high-quality while the student found it unhelpful. We identify key reasons for these discrepancies and classify them into categories, such as hints not accounting for the student's main concern or not considering previous help requests. Finally, we propose and discuss preliminary results on potential methods to bridge these gaps, first by extending the expert-designed quality rubric and then by adapting the hint generation process, e.g., incorporating the student's comments or history. These efforts contribute toward scalable, personalized, and pedagogically sound AI-assisted feedback systems, which are particularly important for high-enrollment educational settings.

### ORMind: A Cognitive-Inspired End-to-End Reasoning Framework for   Operations Research
**Authors**: Zhiyuan Wang, Bokui Chen, Yinya Huang, Qingxing Cao, Ming He, Jianping Fan, Xiaodan Liang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T12:09:34Z

**Summary**: Operations research (OR) is widely deployed to solve critical decision-making problems with complex objectives and constraints, impacting manufacturing, logistics, finance, and healthcare outcomes. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in various domains, their practical application in industry-relevant operations research (OR) problems presents significant challenges and opportunities. Preliminary industrial applications of LLMs for operations research face two critical deployment challenges: 1) Self-correction focuses on code syntax rather than mathematical accuracy, causing costly errors; 2) Complex expert selection creates unpredictable workflows that reduce transparency and increase maintenance costs, making them impractical for time-sensitive business applications. To address these business limitations, we introduce ORMind, a cognitive-inspired framework that enhances optimization through counterfactual reasoning. Our approach emulates human cognition, implementing an end-to-end workflow that systematically transforms requirements into mathematical models and executable solver code. It is currently being tested internally in Lenovo's AI Assistant, with plans to enhance optimization capabilities for both business and consumer customers. Experiments demonstrate that ORMind outperforms existing methods, achieving a 9.5\% improvement on the NL4Opt dataset and a 14.6\% improvement on the ComplexOR dataset.

### TeRA: Vector-based Random Tensor Network for High-Rank Adaptation of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yuxuan Gu, Wuyang Zhou, Giorgos Iacovides, Danilo Mandic

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T11:46:24Z

**Summary**: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a vector-based random \underline{\textbf{Te}}nsor network for high-\underline{\textbf{R}}ank \underline{\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

### QualBench: Benchmarking Chinese LLMs with Localized Professional   Qualifications for Vertical Domain Evaluation
**Authors**: Mengze Hong, Wailing Ng, Chen Jason Zhang, Di Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T11:11:28Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Chinese LLMs underscores the need for vertical-domain evaluations to ensure reliable applications. However, existing benchmarks often lack domain coverage and provide limited insights into the Chinese working context. Leveraging qualification exams as a unified framework for expertise evaluation, we introduce QualBench, the first multi-domain Chinese QA benchmark dedicated to localized assessment of Chinese LLMs. The dataset includes over 17,000 questions across six vertical domains, drawn from 24 Chinese qualifications to align with national policies and professional standards. Results reveal an interesting pattern of Chinese LLMs consistently surpassing non-Chinese models, with the Qwen2.5 model outperforming the more advanced GPT-4o, emphasizing the value of localized domain knowledge in meeting qualification requirements. The average accuracy of 53.98% reveals the current gaps in domain coverage within model capabilities. Furthermore, we identify performance degradation caused by LLM crowdsourcing, assess data contamination, and illustrate the effectiveness of prompt engineering and model fine-tuning, suggesting opportunities for future improvements through multi-domain RAG and Federated Learning.

### Dial-In LLM: Human-Aligned LLM-in-the-loop Intent Clustering for   Customer Service Dialogues
**Authors**: Mengze Hong, Wailing Ng, Chen Jason Zhang, Yuanfeng Song, Di Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T11:09:53Z

**Summary**: Discovering customer intentions is crucial for automated service agents, yet existing intent clustering methods often fall short due to their reliance on embedding distance metrics and neglect of underlying semantic structures. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM-in-the-loop (LLM-ITL) intent clustering framework, integrating the language understanding capabilities of LLMs into conventional clustering algorithms. Specifically, this paper (1) examines the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs in semantic coherence evaluation and intent cluster naming, achieving over 95% accuracy aligned with human judgments; (2) designs an LLM-ITL framework that facilitates the iterative discovery of coherent intent clusters and the optimal number of clusters; and (3) introduces context-aware techniques tailored for customer service dialogue. Since existing English benchmarks lack sufficient semantic diversity and intent coverage, we further present a comprehensive Chinese dialogue intent dataset comprising over 100k real customer service calls with 1,507 human-annotated clusters. The proposed approaches significantly outperform LLM-guided baselines, achieving notable improvements in clustering quality, cost efficiency, and downstream applications. Combined with several best practices, our findings highlight the prominence of LLM-in-the-loop techniques for scalable dialogue data mining.

### AIVA: An AI-based Virtual Companion for Emotion-aware Interaction
**Authors**: Chenxi Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T11:00:46Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved natural language understanding and generation, enhancing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). However, LLMs are limited to unimodal text processing and lack the ability to interpret emotional cues from non-verbal signals, hindering more immersive and empathetic interactions. This work explores integrating multimodal sentiment perception into LLMs to create emotion-aware agents. We propose \ours, an AI-based virtual companion that captures multimodal sentiment cues, enabling emotionally aligned and animated HCI. \ours introduces a Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) using a cross-modal fusion transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues. Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework for emotion-aware agents with applications in companion robotics, social care, mental health, and human-centered AI.

### Variational Uncertainty Decomposition for In-Context Learning
**Authors**: I. Shavindra Jayasekera, Jacob Si, Filippo Valdettaro, Wenlong Chen, A. Aldo Faisal, Yingzhen Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T10:56:13Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) gain popularity in conducting prediction tasks in-context, understanding the sources of uncertainty in in-context learning becomes essential to ensuring reliability. The recent hypothesis of in-context learning performing predictive Bayesian inference opens the avenue for Bayesian uncertainty estimation, particularly for decomposing uncertainty into epistemic uncertainty due to lack of in-context data and aleatoric uncertainty inherent in the in-context prediction task. However, the decomposition idea remains under-explored due to the intractability of the latent parameter posterior from the underlying Bayesian model. In this work, we introduce a variational uncertainty decomposition framework for in-context learning without explicitly sampling from the latent parameter posterior, by optimising auxiliary queries as probes to obtain an upper bound to the aleatoric uncertainty of an LLM's in-context learning procedure, which also induces a lower bound to the epistemic uncertainty. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks, we show quantitatively and qualitatively that the decomposed uncertainties obtained from our method exhibit desirable properties of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

### Attention-guided Self-reflection for Zero-shot Hallucination Detection   in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Qiang Liu, Xinlong Chen, Yue Ding, Bowen Song, Weiqiang Wang, Shu Wu, Liang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T10:48:53Z

**Summary**: Hallucination has emerged as a significant barrier to the effective application of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Guided SElf-Reflection (AGSER) approach for zero-shot hallucination detection in LLMs. The AGSER method utilizes attention contributions to categorize the input query into attentive and non-attentive queries. Each query is then processed separately through the LLMs, allowing us to compute consistency scores between the generated responses and the original answer. The difference between the two consistency scores serves as a hallucination estimator. In addition to its efficacy in detecting hallucinations, AGSER notably reduces computational overhead, requiring only three passes through the LLM and utilizing two sets of tokens. We have conducted extensive experiments with four widely-used LLMs across three different hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot hallucination detection.

### Avoidance Decoding for Diverse Multi-Branch Story Generation
**Authors**: Kyeongman Park, Nakyeong Yang, Kyomin Jung

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2) Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to 2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30% compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration. Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons, demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.

### Can Large Language Models Act as Ensembler for Multi-GNNs?
**Authors**: Hanqi Duan, Yao Cheng, Jianxiang Yu, Yao Liu, Xiang Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T10:35:17Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning from graph-structured data. However, GNNs lack the inherent semantic understanding capability of rich textual node attributes, limiting their effectiveness in applications. On the other hand, we empirically observe that for existing GNN models, no one can consistently outperforms others across diverse datasets. In this paper, we study whether LLMs can act as an ensembler for multi-GNNs and propose the LensGNN model. The model first aligns multiple GNNs, mapping the representations of different GNNs into the same space. Then, through LoRA fine-tuning, it aligns the space between the GNN and the LLM, injecting graph tokens and textual information into LLMs. This allows LensGNN to ensemble multiple GNNs and take advantage of the strengths of LLM, leading to a deeper understanding of both textual semantic information and graph structural information. The experimental results show that LensGNN outperforms existing models. This research advances text-attributed graph ensemble learning by providing a robust and superior solution for integrating semantic and structural information. We provide our code and data here: https://github.com/AquariusAQ/LensGNN.

### Symbiotic Agents: A Novel Paradigm for Trustworthy AGI-driven Networks
**Authors**: Ilias Chatzistefanidis, Navid Nikaein

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:49:56Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based autonomous agents are expected to play a vital role in the evolution of 6G networks, by empowering real-time decision-making related to management and service provisioning to end-users. This shift facilitates the transition from a specialized intelligence approach, where artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms handle isolated tasks, to artificial general intelligence (AGI)-driven networks, where agents possess broader reasoning capabilities and can manage diverse network functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel agentic paradigm that combines LLMs with real-time optimization algorithms towards Trustworthy AI, defined as symbiotic agents. Optimizers at the LLM's input-level provide bounded uncertainty steering for numerically precise tasks, whereas output-level optimizers supervised by the LLM enable adaptive real-time control. We design and implement two novel agent types including: (i) Radio Access Network optimizers, and (ii) multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). We further propose an end-to-end architecture for AGI networks and evaluate it on a 5G testbed capturing channel fluctuations from moving vehicles. Results show that symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone LLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy with a 99.9% reduction in GPU resource overhead and in near-real-time loops of 82 ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world testbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and resource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44%. Drawing on our findings and open-source implementations, we introduce the symbiotic paradigm as the foundation for next-generation, AGI-driven networks-systems designed to remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy even as LLMs advance.

### Memory-R1: Enhancing Large Language Model Agents to Manage and Utilize   Memories via Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Sikuan Yan, Xiufeng Yang, Zuchao Huang, Ercong Nie, Zifeng Ding, Zonggen Li, Xiaowen Ma, Hinrich Schütze, Volker Tresp, Yunpu Ma

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:33:30Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of NLP tasks, but they remain fundamentally stateless, constrained by limited context windows that hinder long-horizon reasoning. Recent efforts to address this limitation often augment LLMs with an external memory bank, yet most existing pipelines are static and heuristic-driven, lacking any learned mechanism for deciding what to store, update, or retrieve. We present Memory-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that equips LLMs with the ability to actively manage and utilize external memory through two specialized agents: a Memory Manager that learns to perform structured memory operations, including adding, updating, deleting, or taking no operation on memory entries; and an Answer Agent that selects the most relevant entries and reasons over them to produce an answer. Both agents are fine-tuned with outcome-driven RL (PPO and GRPO), enabling adaptive memory management and utilization with minimal supervision. With as few as 152 question-answer pairs and a corresponding temporal memory bank for training, Memory-R1 outperforms the strongest existing baseline and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse question types and LLM backbones. Beyond presenting an effective approach, this work provides insights into how RL can unlock more agentic, memory-aware behavior in LLMs, pointing toward richer, more persistent reasoning systems.

**Authors**: Mingcong Lei, Honghao Cai, Binbin Que, Zezhou Cui, Liangchen Tan, Junkun Hong, Gehan Hu, Shuangyu Zhu, Yimou Wu, Shaohan Jiang, Ge Wang, Zhen Li, Shuguang Cui, Yiming Zhao, Yatong Han

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:32:27Z

**Summary**: We present RoboMemory, a brain-inspired multi-memory framework for lifelong learning in physical embodied systems, addressing critical challenges in real-world environments: continuous learning, multi-module memory latency, task correlation capture, and infinite-loop mitigation in closed-loop planning. Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, it integrates four core modules: the Information Preprocessor (thalamus-like), the Lifelong Embodied Memory System (hippocampus-like), the Closed-Loop Planning Module (prefrontal lobe-like), and the Low-Level Executer (cerebellum-like) to enable long-term planning and cumulative learning. The Lifelong Embodied Memory System, central to the framework, alleviates inference speed issues in complex memory frameworks via parallelized updates/retrieval across Spatial, Temporal, Episodic, and Semantic submodules. It incorporates a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) and consistent architectural design to enhance memory consistency and scalability. Evaluations on EmbodiedBench show RoboMemory outperforms the open-source baseline (Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins) by 25% in average success rate and surpasses the closed-source State-of-the-Art (SOTA) (Claude3.5-Sonnet) by 5%, establishing new SOTA. Ablation studies validate key components (critic, spatial memory, long-term memory), while real-world deployment confirms its lifelong learning capability with significantly improved success rates across repeated tasks. RoboMemory alleviates high latency challenges with scalability, serving as a foundational reference for integrating multi-modal memory systems in physical robots.

### BadPromptFL: A Novel Backdoor Threat to Prompt-based Federated Learning   in Multimodal Models
**Authors**: Maozhen Zhang, Mengnan Zhao, Bo Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:32:04Z

**Summary**: Prompt-based tuning has emerged as a lightweight alternative to full fine-tuning in large vision-language models, enabling efficient adaptation via learned contextual prompts. This paradigm has recently been extended to federated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively train prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning remain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In BadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation process. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling universal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters. Leveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures, BadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \(>90\%\)) with minimal visibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness, stealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.

### OPRA-Vis: Visual Analytics System to Assist Organization-Public   Relationship Assessment with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Sangbong Yoo, Seongbum Seo, Chanyoung Yoon, Hyelim Lee, Jeong-Nam Kim, Chansoo Kim, Yun Jang, Takanori Fujiwara

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:30:39Z

**Summary**: Analysis of public opinions collected from digital media helps organizations maintain positive relationships with the public. Such public relations (PR) analysis often involves assessing opinions, for example, measuring how strongly people trust an organization. Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) hold great promise for supporting Organization-Public Relationship Assessment (OPRA) because they can map unstructured public text to OPRA dimensions and articulate rationales through prompting. However, adapting LLMs for PR analysis typically requires fine-tuning on large labeled datasets, which is both labor-intensive and knowledge-intensive, making it difficult for PR researchers to apply these models. In this paper, we present OPRA-Vis, a visual analytics system that leverages LLMs for OPRA without requiring extensive labeled data. Our framework employs Chain-of-Thought prompting to guide LLMs in analyzing public opinion data by incorporating PR expertise directly into the reasoning process. Furthermore, OPRA-Vis provides visualizations that reveal the clues and reasoning paths used by LLMs, enabling users to explore, critique, and refine model decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OPRA-Vis through two real-world use cases and evaluate it quantitatively, through comparisons with alternative LLMs and prompting strategies, and qualitatively, through assessments of usability, effectiveness, and expert feedback.

**Authors**: Ashmari Pramodya, Nirasha Nelki, Heshan Shalinda, Chamila Liyanage, Yusuke Sakai, Randil Pushpananda, Ruvan Weerasinghe, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:22:39Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general knowledge and reasoning abilities, yet their evaluation has predominantly focused on global or anglocentric subjects, often neglecting low-resource languages and culturally specific content. While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors and misrepresent the original cultural context. To address this, we introduce SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over 7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects, encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively, overall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.

### Domain Adaptation of LLMs for Process Data
**Authors**: Rafael Seidi Oyamada, Jari Peeperkorn, Jochen De Weerdt, Johannes De Smedt

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:21:35Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent area of interest across various research domains, including Process Mining (PM). Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt engineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style datasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address diverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation, motivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of tokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational overhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses on Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and multi-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in predictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN) approaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the multi-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster convergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.

### MorphAgent: Empowering Agents through Self-Evolving Profiles and   Decentralized Collaboration
**Authors**: Siyuan Lu, Jiaqi Shao, Bing Luo, Tao Lin

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:07:23Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise in tackling complex tasks, but often rely on predefined roles and centralized coordination, limiting their adaptability to evolving challenges. This paper introduces MorphAgent, a novel Autonomous, Self-Organizing, and Self-Adaptive Multi-Agent System for decentralized agent collaboration that enables agents to dynamically evolve their roles and capabilities. Our approach employs self-evolving agent profiles, optimized through three key metrics, guiding agents in refining their individual expertise while maintaining complementary team dynamics. MorphAgent implements a two-phase process: a Profile Update phase for profile optimization, followed by a Task Execution phase where agents continuously adapt their roles based on task feedback. Our experimental results show that MorphAgent outperforms existing frameworks in terms of task performance and adaptability to changing requirements, paving the way for more robust and versatile multi-agent collaborative systems.

**Authors**: Xinyu Shi, Dina Ali Abdelhamid, Thomas Ilsche, Saeideh Alinezhad Chamazcoti, Timon Evenblij, Mohit Gupta, Francky Catthoor

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T09:04:30Z

**Summary**: Main memory's rising energy consumption has emerged as a critical challenge in modern computing architectures, particularly in large-scale systems, driven by frequent access patterns, growing data volumes, and insufficient power management strategies. Accurate modeling of DRAM power consumption is essential to address this challenge and optimize energy efficiency. However, existing modeling tools often rely on vendor-provided datasheet values that are obtained under worst-case or idealized conditions. As a result, they fail to capture important system-level factors, such as temperature variations, chip aging, and workload-induced variability, which leads to significant discrepancies between estimated and actual power consumption observed in real deployments. In this work, we propose a runtime calibration methodology for the DRAMPower model using energy measurements collected from real-system experiments. By applying custom memory benchmarks on an HPC cluster and leveraging fine-grained power monitoring infrastructure, we refine key current parameters (IDD values) in the model. Our calibration reduces the average energy estimation error to less than 5%, substantially improving modeling accuracy and making DRAMPower a more reliable tool for power-aware system design and optimization on the target server platform.

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:57:10Z

**Summary**: The Romansh language, spoken in Switzerland, has limited resources for machine translation evaluation. In this paper, we present a benchmark for six varieties of Romansh: Rumantsch Grischun, a supra-regional variety, and five regional varieties: Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, and Vallader. Our reference translations were created by human translators based on the WMT24++ benchmark, which ensures parallelism with more than 55 other languages. An automatic evaluation of existing MT systems and LLMs shows that translation out of Romansh into German is handled relatively well for all the varieties, but translation into Romansh is still challenging.

### Adaptive KV-Cache Compression without Manually Setting Budget
**Authors**: Chenxia Tang, Jianchun Liu, Hongli Xu, Liusheng Huang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:38:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) inference relies heavily on KV-caches to accelerate autoregressive decoding, but the resulting memory footprint grows rapidly with sequence length, posing significant efficiency challenges. Current KV-cache compression methods suffer from a Procrustes' bed problem: they force diverse workloads into fixed compression ratios, leading to suboptimal resource allocation and inference performance. To this end, we present GVote, an adaptive KV-cache compression scheme that eliminates manual budget specification while achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. GVote operates on the principle that the important keys are the aggregation of keys required by future queries. The method predicts future query attention demands by Monte-Carlo style sampling potential queries and aggregating selected keys to determine the optimal cache budget without manual specification. Experimental evaluation demonstrates GVote's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks, including GSM8K, RULER and Longbench. Compared to baselines, GVote exhibits 2$\times$ memory reduction while the accuracy maintains higher or comparable.

### Memorization in Graph Neural Networks
**Authors**: Adarsh Jamadandi, Jing Xu, Adam Dziedzic, Franziska Boenisch

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:38:08Z

**Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to memorize their training data, yet similar analyses for graph neural networks (GNNs) remain largely under-explored. We introduce NCMemo (Node Classification Memorization), the first framework to quantify label memorization in semi-supervised node classification. We first establish an inverse relationship between memorization and graph homophily, i.e., the property that connected nodes share similar labels/features. We find that lower homophily significantly increases memorization, indicating that GNNs rely on memorization to learn less homophilic graphs. Secondly, we analyze GNN training dynamics. We find that the increased memorization in low homophily graphs is tightly coupled to the GNNs' implicit bias on using graph structure during learning. In low homophily regimes, this structure is less informative, hence inducing memorization of the node labels to minimize training loss. Finally, we show that nodes with higher label inconsistency in their feature-space neighborhood are significantly more prone to memorization. Building on our insights into the link between graph homophily and memorization, we investigate graph rewiring as a means to mitigate memorization. Our results demonstrate that this approach effectively reduces memorization without compromising model performance. Moreover, we show that it lowers the privacy risk for previously memorized data points in practice. Thus, our work not only advances understanding of GNN learning but also supports more privacy-preserving GNN deployment.

### Towards Explainable Vulnerability Detection with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Qiheng Mao, Zhenhao Li, Xing Hu, Kui Liu, Xin Xia, Jianling Sun

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:35:23Z

**Summary**: Software vulnerabilities pose significant risks to the security and integrity of software systems. Although prior studies have explored vulnerability detection using deep learning and pre-trained models, these approaches often fail to provide the detailed explanations necessary for developers to understand and remediate vulnerabilities effectively. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has introduced transformative potential due to their advanced generative capabilities and ability to comprehend complex contexts, offering new possibilities for addressing these challenges. In this paper, we propose LLMVulExp, an automated framework designed to specialize LLMs for the dual tasks of vulnerability detection and explanation. To address the challenges of acquiring high-quality annotated data and injecting domain-specific knowledge, LLMVulExp leverages prompt-based techniques for annotating vulnerability explanations and finetunes LLMs using instruction tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enabling LLMVulExp to detect vulnerability types in code while generating detailed explanations, including the cause, location, and repair suggestions. Additionally, we employ a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based key code extraction strategy to focus LLMs on analyzing vulnerability-prone code, further enhancing detection accuracy and explanatory depth. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMVulExp achieves over a 90% F1 score on the SeVC dataset, effectively combining high detection accuracy with actionable and coherent explanations. This study highlights the feasibility of utilizing LLMs for real-world vulnerability detection and explanation tasks, providing critical insights into their adaptation and application in software security.

### RecBase: Generative Foundation Model Pretraining for Zero-Shot   Recommendation

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:33:43Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in LLM-based recommendation have shown promise, yet their cross-domain generalization is hindered by a fundamental mismatch between language-centric pretraining and the recommendation task. Existing methods, relying on language-level knowledge, fail to capture dynamic, item-level user interests across domains. To bridge this gap, we propose RecBase, a domain-agnostic foundational model pretrained with a recommendation-oriented objective. RecBase leverages a large-scale, heterogeneous, cross-domain corpus with unified textual representations and feature mappings to enhance cross-domain generalization. To further align item semantics across domains, we introduce a unified item tokenizer that encodes items into hierarchical concept identifiers, enabling structured representation and efficient vocabulary sharing. The model is trained using an autoregressive objective to capture complex item-level sequential patterns. On eight real-world datasets, our 1.5B-parameter model matches or surpasses the performance of LLM baselines up to 7B parameters in zero-shot and cross-domain recommendation tasks.

### From Evaluation to Defense: Constructing Persistent Edit-Based   Fingerprints for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yue Li, Xin Yi, Dongsheng Shi, Yongyi Cui, Gerard de Melo, Xiaoling Wang, Linlin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:22:04Z

**Summary**: The intellectual property (IP) protection of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly critical. Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through instruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may significantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational resources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue that knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable for fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to fingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability. Despite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being overwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning (FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the fingerprint subspace. The performance of FSFT exceeds fine-tuning by 10% even in the worst-case scenario. Additionally, we observe that the fingerprint-injected models struggle to distinguish between fingerprints and similar texts due to the high similarity of their features. This finding underscores the urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting injection methods for LLMs.

### Threshold Signatures for Central Bank Digital Currencies
**Authors**: Mostafa Abdelrahman, Filip Rezabek, Lars Hupel, Kilian Glas, Georg Carle

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:22:01Z

**Summary**: Digital signatures are crucial for securing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) transactions. Like most forms of digital currencies, CBDC solutions rely on signatures for transaction authenticity and integrity, leading to major issues in the case of private key compromise. Our work explores threshold signature schemes (TSSs) in the context of CBDCs. TSSs allow distributed key management and signing, reducing the risk of a compromised key. We analyze CBDC-specific requirements, considering the applicability of TSSs, and use Filia CBDC solution as a base for a detailed evaluation. As most of the current solutions rely on ECDSA for compatibility, we focus on ECDSA-based TSSs and their supporting libraries. Our performance evaluation measured the computational and communication complexity across key processes, as well as the throughput and latency of end-to-end transactions. The results confirm that TSS can enhance the security of CBDC implementations while maintaining acceptable performance for real-world deployments.

### PromptCOS: Towards System Prompt Copyright Auditing for LLMs via   Content-level Output Similarity
**Authors**: Yuchen Yang, Yiming Li, Hongwei Yao, Enhao Huang, Shuo Shao, Bingrun Yang, Zhibo Wang, Dacheng Tao, Zhan Qin

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:19:40Z

**Summary**: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has greatly enhanced reasoning tasks and facilitated the development of LLM-based applications. A critical factor in improving LLM-based applications is the design of effective system prompts, which significantly impact the behavior and output quality of LLMs. However, system prompts are susceptible to theft and misuse, which could undermine the interests of prompt owners. Existing methods protect prompt copyrights through watermark injection and verification but face challenges due to their reliance on intermediate LLM outputs (e.g., logits), which limits their practical feasibility.   In this paper, we propose PromptCOS, a method for auditing prompt copyright based on content-level output similarity. It embeds watermarks by optimizing the prompt while simultaneously co-optimizing a special verification query and content-level signal marks. This is achieved by leveraging cyclic output signals and injecting auxiliary tokens to ensure reliable auditing in content-only scenarios. Additionally, it incorporates cover tokens to protect the watermark from malicious deletion. For copyright verification, PromptCOS identifies unauthorized usage by comparing the similarity between the suspicious output and the signal mark. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high effectiveness (99.3% average watermark similarity), strong distinctiveness (60.8% greater than the best baseline), high fidelity (accuracy degradation of no more than 0.58%), robustness (resilience against three types of potential attacks), and computational efficiency (up to 98.1% reduction in computational cost). Our code is available at GitHub https://github.com/LianPing-cyber/PromptCOS.

### Measuring Scalar Constructs in Social Science with LLMs
**Authors**: Hauke Licht, Rupak Sarkar, Patrick Y. Wu, Pranav Goel, Niklas Stoehr, Elliott Ash, Alexander Miserlis Hoyle

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:19:13Z

**Summary**: Many constructs that characterize language, like its complexity or emotionality, have a naturally continuous semantic structure; a public speech is not just "simple" or "complex," but exists on a continuum between extremes. Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive tool for measuring scalar constructs, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical outputs raises questions of how to best apply them. We address these questions with a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct measurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the political science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct pointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons, token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study yields actionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate pointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with bunching at arbitrary numbers. The quality of the measurements improves with pairwise comparisons made by LLMs, but it improves even more by taking pointwise scores and weighting them by token probability. Finally, finetuning smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the performance of prompted LLMs.

**Summary**: Despite their powerful chat, coding, and reasoning abilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate. Conventional wisdom suggests that hallucinations are a consequence of a balance between creativity and factuality, which can be mitigated, but not eliminated, by grounding the LLM in external knowledge sources. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show that these traditional approaches fail to explain why LLMs hallucinate in practice. Specifically, we show that LLMs augmented with a massive Mixture of Memory Experts (MoME) can easily memorize large datasets of random numbers. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple neural networks trained to predict the next token hallucinate when the training loss is above a threshold as it usually does in practice when training on internet scale data. We interpret our findings by comparing against traditional retrieval methods for mitigating hallucinations. We use our findings to design a first generation model for removing hallucinations -- Lamini-1 -- that stores facts in a massive mixture of millions of memory experts that are retrieved dynamically.

### The High Cost of Keeping Warm: Characterizing Overhead in Serverless   Autoscaling Policies
**Authors**: Leonid Kondrashov, Boxi Zhou, Hancheng Wang, Dmitrii Ustiugov

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:02:03Z

**Summary**: Serverless computing is transforming cloud application development, but the performance-cost trade-offs of control plane designs remain poorly understood due to a lack of open, cross-platform benchmarks and detailed system analyses. In this work, we address these gaps by designing a serverless system that approximates the scaling behaviors of commercial providers, including AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Run. We systematically compare the performance and cost-efficiency of both synchronous and asynchronous autoscaling policies by replaying real-world workloads and varying key autoscaling parameters.   We demonstrate that our open-source systems can closely replicate the operational characteristics of commercial platforms, enabling reproducible and transparent experimentation. By evaluating how autoscaling parameters affect latency, memory usage, and CPU overhead, we reveal several key findings. First, we find that serverless systems exhibit significant computational overhead due to instance churn equivalent to 10-40% of the CPU cycles spent on request handling, primarily originating from worker nodes. Second, we observe high memory allocation due to scaling policy: 2-10 times more than actively used. Finally, we demonstrate that reducing these overheads typically results in significant performance degradation in the current systems, underscoring the need for new, cost-efficient autoscaling strategies. Additionally, we employ a hybrid methodology that combines real control plane deployments with large-scale simulation to extend our evaluation closer to a production scale, thereby bridging the gap between small research clusters and real-world environments.

### FastCaps: A Design Methodology for Accelerating Capsule Network on Field   Programmable Gate Arrays
**Authors**: Abdul Rahoof, Vivek Chaturvedi, Muhammad Shafique

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T07:59:31Z

**Summary**: Capsule Network (CapsNet) has shown significant improvement in understanding the variation in images along with better generalization ability compared to traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CapsNet preserves spatial relationship among extracted features and apply dynamic routing to efficiently learn the internal connections between capsules. However, due to the capsule structure and the complexity of the routing mechanism, it is non-trivial to accelerate CapsNet performance in its original form on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Most of the existing works on CapsNet have achieved limited acceleration as they implement only the dynamic routing algorithm on FPGA, while considering all the processing steps synergistically is important for real-world applications of Capsule Networks. Towards this, we propose a novel two-step approach that deploys a full-fledged CapsNet on FPGA. First, we prune the network using a novel Look-Ahead Kernel Pruning (LAKP) methodology that uses the sum of look-ahead scores of the model parameters. Next, we simplify the nonlinear operations, reorder loops, and parallelize operations of the routing algorithm to reduce CapsNet hardware complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work accelerating a full-fledged CapsNet on FPGA. Experimental results on the MNIST and F-MNIST datasets (typical in Capsule Network community) show that the proposed LAKP approach achieves an effective compression rate of 99.26% and 98.84%, and achieves a throughput of 82 FPS and 48 FPS on Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 FPGA, respectively. Furthermore, reducing the hardware complexity of the routing algorithm increases the throughput to 1351 FPS and 934 FPS respectively. As corroborated by our results, this work enables highly performance-efficient deployment of CapsNets on low-cost FPGA that are popular in modern edge devices.

### Are We SOLID Yet? An Empirical Study on Prompting LLMs to Detect Design   Principle Violations
**Authors**: Fatih Pehlivan, Arçin Ülkü Ergüzen, Sahand Moslemi Yengejeh, Mayasah Lami, Anil Koyuncu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T07:48:38Z

**Summary**: Traditional static analysis methods struggle to detect semantic design flaws, such as violations of the SOLID principles, which require a strong understanding of object-oriented design patterns and principles. Existing solutions typically focus on individual SOLID principles or specific programming languages, leaving a gap in the ability to detect violations across all five principles in multi-language codebases. This paper presents a new approach: a methodology that leverages tailored prompt engineering to assess LLMs on their ability to detect SOLID violations across multiple languages. We present a benchmark of four leading LLMs-CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder, and GPT-4o Mini-on their ability to detect violations of all five SOLID principles. For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240 manually validated code examples. Using this dataset, we test four distinct prompt strategies inspired by established zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought techniques to systematically measure their impact on detection accuracy. Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with GPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with challenging principles like DIP. Crucially, we show that prompt strategy has a dramatic impact, but no single strategy is universally best; for instance, a deliberative ENSEMBLE prompt excels at OCP detection while a hint-based EXAMPLE prompt is superior for DIP violations. Across all experiments, detection accuracy is heavily influenced by language characteristics and degrades sharply with increasing code complexity. These initial findings demonstrate that effective, AI-driven design analysis requires not a single best model, but a tailored approach that matches the right model and prompt to the specific design context, highlighting the potential of LLMs to support maintainability through AI-assisted code analysis.

### GUARD: Glocal Uncertainty-Aware Robust Decoding for Effective and   Efficient Open-Ended Text Generation
**Authors**: Yuanhao Ding, Esteban Garces Arias, Meimingwei Li, Julian Rodemann, Matthias Aßenmacher, Danlu Chen, Gaojuan Fan, Christian Heumann, Chongsheng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T07:21:02Z

**Summary**: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/YecanLee/GUARD.

**Authors**: Huaicheng Zhang, Ruoxin Wang, Chenlian Zhou, Jiguang Shi, Yue Ge, Zhoutong Li, Sheng Chang, Hao Wang, Jin He, Qijun Huang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T06:52:50Z

**Summary**: As one of the most effective methods for cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis, multi-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals present a characteristic multi-sensor information fusion challenge that has been continuously researched in deep learning domains. Despite the numerous algorithms proposed with different DL architectures, maintaining a balance among performance, computational complexity, and multi-source ECG feature fusion remains challenging. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across various fields. Their inherent design for high-efficiency computation and linear complexity makes them particularly suitable for low-dimensional data like ECGs. This work proposes S2M2ECG, an SSM architecture featuring three-level fusion mechanisms: (1) Spatio-temporal bi-directional SSMs with segment tokenization for low-level signal fusion, (2) Intra-lead temporal information fusion with bi-directional scanning to enhance recognition accuracy in both forward and backward directions, (3) Cross-lead feature interaction modules for spatial information fusion. To fully leverage the ECG-specific multi-lead mechanisms inherent in ECG signals, a multi-branch design and lead fusion modules are incorporated, enabling individual analysis of each lead while ensuring seamless integration with others. Experimental results reveal that S2M2ECG achieves superior performance in the rhythmic, morphological, and clinical scenarios. Moreover, its lightweight architecture ensures it has nearly the fewest parameters among existing models, making it highly suitable for efficient inference and convenient deployment. Collectively, S2M2ECG offers a promising alternative that strikes an excellent balance among performance, computational complexity, and ECG-specific characteristics, paving the way for high-performance, lightweight computations in CVD diagnosis.

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T06:42:40Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), particularly in domains like mathematics and programming, where ground-truth correctness can be automatically evaluated. However, extending this success to other reasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In this work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for scalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of reasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1) LoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples across 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired with executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic data generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to produce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an agent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based agent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align with code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad suite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and reveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness, difficulty, and diversity. Code and documentation are available at https://github.com/camel-ai/loong.

### EverTracer: Hunting Stolen Large Language Models via Stealthy and Robust   Probabilistic Fingerprint
**Authors**: Zhenhua Xu, Meng Han, Wenpeng Xing

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T06:40:57Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified concerns over model theft and license violations, necessitating robust and stealthy ownership verification. Existing fingerprinting methods either require impractical white-box access or introduce detectable statistical anomalies. We propose EverTracer, a novel gray-box fingerprinting framework that ensures stealthy and robust model provenance tracing. EverTracer is the first to repurpose Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) for defensive use, embedding ownership signals via memorization instead of artificial trigger-output overfitting. It consists of Fingerprint Injection, which fine-tunes the model on any natural language data without detectable artifacts, and Verification, which leverages calibrated probability variation signal to distinguish fingerprinted models. This approach remains robust against adaptive adversaries, including input level modification, and model-level modifications. Extensive experiments across architectures demonstrate EverTracer's state-of-the-art effectiveness, stealthness, and resilience, establishing it as a practical solution for securing LLM intellectual property. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/Xuzhenhua55/EverTracer.

### Binary Quantization For LLMs Through Dynamic Grouping
**Authors**: Xinzhe Zheng, Zhen-Qun Yang, Haoran Xie, S. Joe Qin, Arlene Chen, Fangzhen Lin

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T06:36:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in {-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However, such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007 bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA 3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original 7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90. Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

### Rethinking Data Protection in the (Generative) Artificial Intelligence   Era
**Authors**: Yiming Li, Shuo Shao, Yu He, Junfeng Guo, Tianwei Zhang, Zhan Qin, Pin-Yu Chen, Michael Backes, Philip Torr, Dacheng Tao, Kui Ren

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T06:34:12Z

**Summary**: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation, traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control, spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights, system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

### FlashRecovery: Fast and Low-Cost Recovery from Failures for Large-Scale   Training of LLMs

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T06:19:59Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have made a profound impact across various fields due to their advanced capabilities. However, training these models at unprecedented scales requires extensive AI accelerator clusters and sophisticated parallelism strategies, which pose significant challenges in maintaining system reliability over prolonged training periods. A major concern is the substantial loss of training time caused by inevitable hardware and software failures. To address these challenges, we present FlashRecovery, a fast and low-cost failure recovery system comprising three core modules: (1) Active and real-time failure detection. This module performs continuous training state monitoring, enabling immediate identification of hardware and software failures within seconds, thus ensuring rapid incident response; (2) Scale-independent task restart. By employing different recovery strategies for normal and faulty nodes, combined with an optimized communication group reconstruction protocol, our approach ensures that the recovery time remains nearly constant, regardless of cluster scale; (3) Checkpoint-free recovery within one step. Our novel recovery mechanism enables single-step restoration, completely eliminating dependence on traditional checkpointing methods and their associated overhead. Collectively, these innovations enable FlashRecovery to achieve optimal Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO), substantially improving the reliability and efficiency of long-duration LLM training. Experimental results demonstrate that FlashRecovery system can achieve training restoration on training cluster with 4, 800 devices in 150 seconds. We also verify that the time required for failure recovery is nearly consistent for different scales of training tasks.

### Towards Agentic OS: An LLM Agent Framework for Linux Schedulers
**Authors**: Yusheng Zheng, Yanpeng Hu, Wei Zhang, Andi Quinn

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T06:09:05Z

**Summary**: Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act"). Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic analysis.   We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems. The code is open-sourced in https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/schedcp

### Probe-Rewrite-Evaluate: A Workflow for Reliable Benchmarks and   Quantifying Evaluation Awareness
**Authors**: Lang Xiong, Nishant Bhargava, Wesley Chang, Jianhang Hong, Haihao Liu, Kevin Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T06:00:33Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like" and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%, indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model alignment before deployment.

### Spatially Adaptive SWIPT with Pinching Antenna under Probabilistic LoS   Blockage
**Authors**: Ruihong Jiang, Ruichen Zhang, Yanqing Xu, Huimin Hu, Yang Lu, Dusit Niyato

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T05:55:22Z

**Summary**: This paper considers a power-splitting (PS)-based simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system employing a reconfigurable pinching antenna (PA) under probabilistic line-of-sight (LoS) blockage. We formulate a joint optimization of the PA position and the PS ratio to maximize the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at a user, subject to its average energy harvesting (EH) and PA placement limits. We derive a closed-form optimal solution. Results demonstrate that the EH requirement has a deterministic impact on the optimal PA position as well as its feasible region, requiring deployment of the PA as close to the user as possible to maximize average channel gain. This spatial adaptation, combined with dynamic PS, enables robust SWIPT performance in the presence of probabilistic LoS blockage, revealing that mechanical reconfigurability primarily enhances sustainability by ensuring energy feasibility in dynamic environments.

### TraceLLM: Security Diagnosis Through Traces and Smart Contracts in   Ethereum
**Authors**: Shuzheng Wang, Yue Huang, Zhuoer Xu, Yuming Huang, Jing Tang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T05:53:56Z

**Summary**: Ethereum smart contracts hold tens of billions of USD in DeFi and NFTs, yet comprehensive security analysis remains difficult due to unverified code, proxy-based architectures, and the reliance on manual inspection of complex execution traces. Existing approaches fall into two main categories: anomaly transaction detection, which flags suspicious transactions but offers limited insight into specific attack strategies hidden in execution traces inside transactions, and code vulnerability detection, which cannot analyze unverified contracts and struggles to show how identified flaws are exploited in real incidents. As a result, analysts must still manually align transaction traces with contract code to reconstruct attack scenarios and conduct forensics. To address this gap, TraceLLM is proposed as a framework that leverages LLMs to integrate execution trace-level detection with decompiled contract code. We introduce a new anomaly execution path identification algorithm and an LLM-refined decompile tool to identify vulnerable functions and provide explicit attack paths to LLM. TraceLLM establishes the first benchmark for joint trace and contract code-driven security analysis. For comparison, proxy baselines are created by jointly transmitting the results of three representative code analysis along with raw traces to LLM. TraceLLM identifies attacker and victim addresses with 85.19\% precision and produces automated reports with 70.37\% factual precision across 27 cases with ground truth expert reports, achieving 25.93\% higher accuracy than the best baseline. Moreover, across 148 real-world Ethereum incidents, TraceLLM automatically generates reports with 66.22\% expert-verified accuracy, demonstrating strong generalizability.

### Knowledge Integration for Physics-informed Symbolic Regression Using   Pre-trained Large Language Models
**Authors**: Bilge Taskin, Wenxiong Xie, Teddy Lazebnik

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T05:53:40Z

**Summary**: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from experimental data. A growing body of work illustrates the promise of integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function, adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve performance.

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T05:49:24Z

**Summary**: Legal practitioners, particularly those early in their careers, face complex, high-stakes tasks that require adaptive, context-sensitive reasoning. While AI holds promise in supporting legal work, current datasets and models are narrowly focused on isolated subtasks and fail to capture the end-to-end decision-making required in real-world practice. To address this gap, we introduce LawFlow, a dataset of complete end-to-end legal workflows collected from trained law students, grounded in real-world business entity formation scenarios. Unlike prior datasets focused on input-output pairs or linear chains of thought, LawFlow captures dynamic, modular, and iterative reasoning processes that reflect the ambiguity, revision, and client-adaptive strategies of legal practice. Using LawFlow, we compare human and LLM-generated workflows, revealing systematic differences in structure, reasoning flexibility, and plan execution. Human workflows tend to be modular and adaptive, while LLM workflows are more sequential, exhaustive, and less sensitive to downstream implications. Our findings also suggest that legal professionals prefer AI to carry out supportive roles, such as brainstorming, identifying blind spots, and surfacing alternatives, rather than executing complex workflows end-to-end. Our results highlight both the current limitations of LLMs in supporting complex legal workflows and opportunities for developing more collaborative, reasoning-aware legal AI systems.   All data and code are available on our project page (https://minnesotanlp.github.io/LawFlow-website/).

### CoreThink: A Symbolic Reasoning Layer to reason over Long Horizon Tasks   with LLMs
**Authors**: Jay Vaghasiya, Omkar Ghugarkar, Vishvesh Bhat, Vipul Dholaria, Julian McAuley

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T05:36:42Z

**Summary**: We introduce CoreThink, a state-of-the-art Reasoning Layer built upon a novel reasoning method called General Symbolics. This approach diverges from reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases: tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas. Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66% on Livecodebench v6, 89% on Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3% on SWE-Bench Lite. We are able to achieve these improvements without any fine-tuning or training costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift, ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.

### HERCULES: Hierarchical Embedding-based Recursive Clustering Using LLMs   for Efficient Summarization
**Authors**: Gabor Petnehazi, Bernadett Aradi

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T05:10:20Z

**Summary**: The explosive growth of complex datasets across various modalities necessitates advanced analytical tools that not only group data effectively but also provide human-understandable insights into the discovered structures. We introduce HERCULES (Hierarchical Embedding-based Recursive Clustering Using LLMs for Efficient Summarization), a novel algorithm and Python package designed for hierarchical k-means clustering of diverse data types, including text, images, and numeric data (processed one modality per run). HERCULES constructs a cluster hierarchy by recursively applying k-means clustering, starting from individual data points at level 0. A key innovation is its deep integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically rich titles and descriptions for clusters at each level of the hierarchy, significantly enhancing interpretability. The algorithm supports two main representation modes: `direct' mode, which clusters based on original data embeddings or scaled numeric features, and `description' mode, which clusters based on embeddings derived from LLM-generated summaries. Users can provide a `topic\_seed' to guide LLM-generated summaries towards specific themes. An interactive visualization tool facilitates thorough analysis and understanding of the clustering results. We demonstrate HERCULES's capabilities and discuss its potential for extracting meaningful, hierarchical knowledge from complex datasets.

### SeePhys: Does Seeing Help Thinking? -- Benchmarking Vision-Based Physics   Reasoning
**Authors**: Kun Xiang, Heng Li, Terry Jingchen Zhang, Yinya Huang, Zirong Liu, Peixin Qu, Jixi He, Jiaqi Chen, Yu-Jie Yuan, Jianhua Han, Hang Xu, Hanhui Li, Mrinmaya Sachan, Xiaodan Liang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T05:05:25Z

**Summary**: We present SeePhys, a large-scale multimodal benchmark for LLM reasoning grounded in physics questions ranging from middle school to PhD qualifying exams. The benchmark covers 7 fundamental domains spanning the physics discipline, incorporating 21 categories of highly heterogeneous diagrams. In contrast to prior works where visual elements mainly serve auxiliary purposes, our benchmark features a substantial proportion of vision-essential problems (75%) that mandate visual information extraction for correct solutions. Through extensive evaluation, we observe that even the most advanced visual reasoning models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-pro and o4-mini) achieve sub-60% accuracy on our benchmark. These results reveal fundamental challenges in current large language models' visual understanding capabilities, particularly in: (i) establishing rigorous coupling between diagram interpretation and physics reasoning, and (ii) overcoming their persistent reliance on textual cues as cognitive shortcuts.

### A Study on Zero-Shot Non-Intrusive Speech Intelligibility for Hearing   Aids Using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ryandhimas E. Zezario, Dyah A. M. G. Wisnu, Hsin-Min Wang, Yu Tsao

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T04:56:21Z

**Summary**: This work focuses on zero-shot non-intrusive speech assessment for hearing aids (HA) using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we introduce GPT-Whisper-HA, an extension of GPT-Whisper, a zero-shot non-intrusive speech assessment model based on LLMs. GPT-Whisper-HA is designed for speech assessment for HA, incorporating MSBG hearing loss and NAL-R simulations to process audio input based on each individual's audiogram, two automatic speech recognition (ASR) modules for audio-to-text representation, and GPT-4o to predict two corresponding scores, followed by score averaging for the final estimated score. Experimental results indicate that GPT-Whisper-HA achieves a 2.59% relative root mean square error (RMSE) improvement over GPT-Whisper, confirming the potential of LLMs for zero-shot speech assessment in predicting subjective intelligibility for HA users.

### ChatCLIDS: Simulating Persuasive AI Dialogues to Promote Closed-Loop   Insulin Adoption in Type 1 Diabetes Care
**Authors**: Zonghai Yao, Talha Chafekar, Junda Wang, Shuo Han, Feiyun Ouyang, Junhui Qian, Lingxi Li, Hong Yu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T04:55:57Z

**Summary**: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1 diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies. ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

### Training LLMs to be Better Text Embedders through Bidirectional   Reconstruction
**Authors**: Chang Su, Dengliang Shi, Siyuan Huang, Jintao Du, Changhua Meng, Yu Cheng, Weiqiang Wang, Zhouhan Lin

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T08:02:20Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS]. However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings, especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks, namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

### Mycroft: Tracing Dependencies in Collective Communication Towards   Reliable LLM Training

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T04:49:20Z

**Summary**: Reliability is essential for ensuring efficiency in LLM training. However, many real-world reliability issues remain difficult to resolve, resulting in wasted resources and degraded model performance. Unfortunately, today's collective communication libraries operate as black boxes, hiding critical information needed for effective root cause analysis. We propose Mycroft, a lightweight distributed tracing and root cause analysis system designed to address previously hidden reliability issues in collective communication. Mycroft's key idea is to trace collective communication states and leverage internal control and data dependencies to resolve reliability problems in LLM training. Mycroft has been deployed at ByteDance for over six months to debug collective communication related issues at runtime. It detected anomalies within 15 seconds in 90% of cases and identified the root cause within 20 seconds in 60% of cases. We also conducted extensive fault injection experiments to demonstrate Mycroft's capability and efficiency.

### Learn and Unlearn: Addressing Misinformation in Multilingual LLMs
**Authors**: Taiming Lu, Philipp Koehn

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T04:23:51Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates the propagation of harmful information in multilingual large language models (LLMs) and evaluates the efficacy of various unlearning methods. We demonstrate that fake information, regardless of the language it is in, once introduced into these models through training data, can spread across different languages, compromising the integrity and reliability of the generated content. Our findings reveal that standard unlearning techniques, which typically focus on English data, are insufficient in mitigating the spread of harmful content in multilingual contexts and could inadvertently reinforce harmful content across languages. We show that only by addressing harmful responses in both English and the original language of the harmful data can we effectively eliminate generations for all languages. This underscores the critical need for comprehensive unlearning strategies that consider the multilingual nature of modern LLMs to enhance their safety and reliability across diverse linguistic landscapes.

### Closing the Visibility Gap: A Monitoring Framework for Verifiable Open   RAN Operations
**Authors**: Hexuan Yu, Md Mohaimin Al Barat, Yang Xiao, Y. Thomas Hou, Wenjing Lou

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T04:17:57Z

**Summary**: Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) is reshaping mobile network architecture by promoting openness, disaggregation, and cross-vendor interoperability. However, this architectural flexibility introduces new security challenges, especially in deployments where multiple mobile network operators (MNOs) jointly operate shared components. Existing Zero Trust Architectures (ZTA) in O-RAN, as defined by governmental and industry standards, implicitly assume that authenticated components will comply with operational policies. However, this assumption creates a critical blind spot: misconfigured or compromised components can silently violate policies, misuse resources, or corrupt downstream processes (e.g., ML-based RIC xApps).   To address this critical gap, we propose a monitoring framework for low-trust O-RAN environments that proactively verifies configuration state and control behavior against tenant-defined policies. Our system provides scalable, verifiable oversight to enhance transparency and trust in O-RAN operations. We implement and evaluate the framework using standardized O-RAN configurations, with total processing latency of approximately 200 ms, demonstrating its efficiency and practicality for timely policy enforcement and compliance auditing in multi-MNO deployments.
