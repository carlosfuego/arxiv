 ### Flash Cache: Reducing Bias in Radiance Cache Based Inverse Rendering
**Authors**: Benjamin Attal, Dor Verbin, Ben Mildenhall, Peter Hedman, Jonathan T. Barron, Matthew O'Toole, Pratul P. Srinivasan

**Summary**: State-of-the-art techniques for 3D reconstruction are largely based on volumetric scene representations, which require sampling multiple points to compute the color arriving along a ray. Using these representations for more general inverse rendering -- reconstructing geometry, materials, and lighting from observed images -- is challenging because recursively path-tracing such volumetric representations is expensive. Recent works alleviate this issue through the use of radiance caches: data structures that store the steady-state, infinite-bounce radiance arriving at any point from any direction. However, these solutions rely on approximations that introduce bias into the renderings and, more importantly, into the gradients used for optimization. We present a method that avoids these approximations while remaining computationally efficient. In particular, we leverage two techniques to reduce variance for unbiased estimators of the rendering equation: (1) an occlusion-aware importance sampler for incoming illumination and (2) a fast cache architecture that can be used as a control variate for the radiance from a high-quality, but more expensive, volumetric cache. We show that by removing these biases our approach improves the generality of radiance cache based inverse rendering, as well as increasing quality in the presence of challenging light transport effects such as specular reflections.

**Authors**: Yuntian Deng, Wenting Zhao, Jack Hessel, Xiang Ren, Claire Cardie, Yejin Choi

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T10:04:00Z

**Summary**: The increasing availability of real-world conversation data offers exciting opportunities for researchers to study user-chatbot interactions. However, the sheer volume of this data makes manually examining individual conversations impractical. To overcome this challenge, we introduce WildVis, an interactive tool that enables fast, versatile, and large-scale conversation analysis. WildVis provides search and visualization capabilities in the text and embedding spaces based on a list of criteria. To manage million-scale datasets, we implemented optimizations including search index construction, embedding precomputation and compression, and caching to ensure responsive user interactions within seconds. We demonstrate WildVis' utility through three case studies: facilitating chatbot misuse research, visualizing and comparing topic distributions across datasets, and characterizing user-specific conversation patterns. WildVis is open-source and designed to be extendable, supporting additional datasets and customized search and visualization functionalities.

### Cooperative Learning-Based Framework for VNF Caching and Placement   Optimization over Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks
**Authors**: Khai Doan, Marios Avgeris, Aris Leivadeas, Ioannis Lambadaris, Wonjae Shin

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T08:39:50Z

**Summary**: Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks (LSNs) are integral to supporting a broad range of modern applications, which are typically modeled as Service Function Chains (SFCs). Each SFC is composed of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), where each VNF performs a specific task. In this work, we tackle two key challenges in deploying SFCs across an LSN. Firstly, we aim to optimize the long-term system performance by minimizing the average end-to-end SFC execution delay, given that each satellite comes with a pre-installed/cached subset of VNFs. To achieve optimal SFC placement, we formulate an offline Dynamic Programming (DP) equation. To overcome the challenges associated with DP, such as its complexity, the need for probability knowledge, and centralized decision-making, we put forth an online Multi-Agent Q-Learning (MAQL) solution. Our MAQL approach addresses convergence issues in the non-stationary LSN environment by enabling satellites to share learning parameters and update their Q-tables based on distinct rules for their selected actions. Secondly, to determine the optimal VNF subsets for satellite caching, we develop a Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based learning mechanism that operates both offline and continuously in the background during runtime. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MAQL approach achieves near-optimal performance comparable to the DP model and significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, the BO-based approach effectively enhances the request serving rate over time.

### InstInfer: In-Storage Attention Offloading for Cost-Effective   Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Xiurui Pan, Endian Li, Qiao Li, Shengwen Liang, Yizhou Shan, Ke Zhou, Yingwei Luo, Xiaolin Wang, Jie Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T06:06:44Z

**Summary**: The widespread of Large Language Models (LLMs) marks a significant milestone in generative AI. Nevertheless, the increasing context length and batch size in offline LLM inference escalate the memory requirement of the key-value (KV) cache, which imposes a huge burden on the GPU VRAM, especially for resource-constraint scenarios (e.g., edge computing and personal devices). Several cost-effective solutions leverage host memory or SSDs to reduce storage costs for offline inference scenarios and improve the throughput. Nevertheless, they suffer from significant performance penalties imposed by intensive KV cache accesses due to limited PCIe bandwidth. To address these issues, we propose InstInfer, a novel LLM inference system that offloads the most performance-critical computation (i.e., attention in decoding phase) and data (i.e., KV cache) parts to Computational Storage Drives (CSDs), which minimize the enormous KV transfer overheads. InstInfer designs a dedicated flash-aware in-storage attention engine with KV cache management mechanisms to exploit the high internal bandwidths of CSDs instead of being limited by the PCIe bandwidth. The optimized P2P transmission between GPU and CSDs further reduces data migration overheads. Experimental results demonstrate that for a 13B model using an NVIDIA A6000 GPU, InstInfer improves throughput for long-sequence inference by up to 11.1$\times$, compared to existing SSD-based solutions such as FlexGen.

### Training-Free Style Consistent Image Synthesis with Condition and Mask   Guidance in E-Commerce
**Authors**: Guandong Li

**Updated**: 2024-09-07T07:50:13Z

**Summary**: Generating style-consistent images is a common task in the e-commerce field, and current methods are largely based on diffusion models, which have achieved excellent results. This paper introduces the concept of the QKV (query/key/value) level, referring to modifications in the attention maps (self-attention and cross-attention) when integrating UNet with image conditions. Without disrupting the product's main composition in e-commerce images, we aim to use a train-free method guided by pre-set conditions. This involves using shared KV to enhance similarity in cross-attention and generating mask guidance from the attention map to cleverly direct the generation of style-consistent images. Our method has shown promising results in practical applications.

### MiniCache: KV Cache Compression in Depth Dimension for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Akide Liu, Jing Liu, Zizheng Pan, Yefei He, Gholamreza Haffari, Bohan Zhuang

**Updated**: 2024-09-07T02:52:29Z

**Summary**: A critical approach for efficiently deploying computationally demanding large language models (LLMs) is Key-Value (KV) caching. The KV cache stores key-value states of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for repetitive computations and thereby lowering latency in autoregressive generation. However, the size of the KV cache grows linearly with sequence length, posing challenges for applications requiring long context input and extensive sequence generation. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach, called MiniCache, to compress the KV cache across layers from a novel depth perspective, significantly reducing the memory footprint for LLM inference. Our approach is based on the observation that KV cache states exhibit high similarity between the adjacent layers in the middle-to-deep portion of LLMs. To facilitate merging, we propose disentangling the states into the magnitude and direction components, interpolating the directions of the state vectors while preserving their lengths unchanged. Furthermore, we introduce a token retention strategy to keep highly distinct state pairs unmerged, thus preserving the information with minimal additional storage overhead. Our MiniCache is training-free and general, complementing existing KV cache compression strategies, such as quantization and sparsity. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of MiniCache utilizing various models including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, Phi-3, Mistral, and Mixtral across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its exceptional performance in achieving superior compression ratios and high throughput. On the ShareGPT dataset, LLaMA-2-7B with 4-bit MiniCache achieves a remarkable compression ratio of up to 5.02x, enhances inference throughput by approximately 5x, and reduces the memory footprint by 41% compared to the FP16 full cache baseline, all while maintaining near-lossless performance.

### QET: Enhancing Quantized LLM Parameters and KV cache Compression through   Element Substitution and Residual Clustering
**Authors**: Yanshu Wang, Wang Li, Zhaoqian Yao, Tong Yang

**Updated**: 2024-09-06T08:28:01Z

**Summary**: The matrix quantization entails representing matrix elements in a more space-efficient form to reduce storage usage, with dequantization restoring the original matrix for use. We formulate the Quantization Error Minimization (QEM) problem as minimizing the distance between a matrix before and after quantization, under the condition that the quantized matrix occupies the same memory space. Matrix quantization is crucial in various applications, including Large Language Models (LLMs) weight quantization, vector databases, KV cache quantization, graph compression, and image compression. Recent advancements in LLMs, such as GPT-4 and BERT, have highlighted the importance of matrix compression due to the large size of parameters and KV cache, which are stored as matrices.   We propose Quantum Entanglement Trees (QET) to address the QEM problem by leveraging the local orderliness of matrix elements, involving iterative element swapping to form a locally ordered matrix. This matrix is then grouped and quantized by columns. To enhance QET, we introduce two optimizations: further quantizing residuals to reduce MSE, and using masking and batch processing to accelerate the algorithm.   Experimental results demonstrate that QET can effectively reduce MSE to 5.05%, 13.33%, and 11.89% of the current best method on the LLM dataset, K cache, and V cache, respectively. Our contributions include the abstraction of the QEM problem, the design of the QET algorithm, and the proposal of two optimizations to improve accuracy and speed.

### A First Look At Efficient And Secure On-Device LLM Inference Against KV   Leakage
**Authors**: Huan Yang, Deyu Zhang, Yudong Zhao, Yuanchun Li, Yunxin Liu

**Updated**: 2024-09-06T06:16:55Z

**Summary**: Running LLMs on end devices has garnered significant attention recently due to their advantages in privacy preservation. With the advent of lightweight LLM models and specially designed GPUs, on-device LLM inference has achieved the necessary accuracy and performance metrics. However, we have identified that LLM inference on GPUs can leak privacy-sensitive intermediate information, specifically the KV pairs. An attacker could exploit these KV pairs to reconstruct the entire user conversation, leading to significant vulnerabilities. Existing solutions, such as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), are either too computation-intensive or resource-limited. To address these issues, we designed KV-Shield, which operates in two phases. In the initialization phase, it permutes the weight matrices so that all KV pairs are correspondingly permuted. During the runtime phase, the attention vector is inversely permuted to ensure the correctness of the layer output. All permutation-related operations are executed within the TEE, ensuring that insecure GPUs cannot access the original KV pairs, thus preventing conversation reconstruction. Finally, we theoretically analyze the correctness of KV-Shield, along with its advantages and overhead.

### Potential and Limitation of High-Frequency Cores and Caches
**Authors**: Kunal Pai, Anusheel Nand, Jason Lowe-Power

**Updated**: 2024-09-05T20:21:54Z

**Summary**: This paper explores the potential of cryogenic semiconductor computing and superconductor electronics as promising alternatives to traditional semiconductor devices. As semiconductor devices face challenges such as increased leakage currents and reduced performance at higher temperatures, these novel technologies offer high performance and low power computation. Conventional semiconductor electronics operating at cryogenic temperatures (below -150{\deg}C or 123.15 K) can benefit from reduced leakage currents and improved electron mobility. On the other hand, superconductor electronics, operating below 10 K, allow electrons to flow without resistance, offering the potential for ultra-low-power, high-speed computation. This study presents a comprehensive performance modeling and analysis of these technologies and provides insights into their potential benefits and limitations. We implement models of in-order and out-of-order cores operating at high clock frequencies associated with superconductor electronics and cryogenic semiconductor computing in gem5. We evaluate the performance of these components using workloads representative of real-world applications like NPB, SPEC CPU2006, and GAPBS. Our results show the potential speedups achievable by these components and the limitations posed by cache bandwidth. This work provides valuable insights into the performance implications and design trade-offs associated with cryogenic and superconductor technologies, laying the foundation for future research in this field using gem5.

### Libra: Architectural Support For Principled, Secure And Efficient   Balanced Execution On High-End Processors (Extended Version)
**Authors**: Hans Winderix, Marton Bognar, Lesly-Ann Daniel, Frank Piessens

**Updated**: 2024-09-05T17:56:19Z

**Summary**: Control-flow leakage (CFL) attacks enable an attacker to expose control-flow decisions of a victim program via side-channel observations. Linearization (i.e., elimination) of secret-dependent control flow is the main countermeasure against these attacks, yet it comes at a non-negligible cost. Conversely, balancing secret-dependent branches often incurs a smaller overhead, but is notoriously insecure on high-end processors. Hence, linearization has been widely believed to be the only effective countermeasure against CFL attacks. In this paper, we challenge this belief and investigate an unexplored alternative: how to securely balance secret-dependent branches on higher-end processors?   We propose Libra, a generic and principled hardware-software codesign to efficiently address CFL on high-end processors. We perform a systematic classification of hardware primitives leaking control flow from the literature, and provide guidelines to handle them with our design. Importantly, Libra enables secure control-flow balancing without the need to disable performance-critical hardware such as the instruction cache and the prefetcher. We formalize the semantics of Libra and propose a code transformation algorithm for securing programs, which we prove correct and secure. Finally, we implement and evaluate Libra on an out-of-order RISC-V processor, showing performance overhead on par with insecure balanced code, and outperforming state-of-the-art linearized code by 19.3%.

### Enabling Practical and Privacy-Preserving Image Processing
**Authors**: Chao Wang, Shubing Yang, Xiaoyan Sun, Jun Dai, Dongfang Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-09-05T14:22:02Z

**Summary**: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computations on encrypted data, preserving confidentiality without the need for decryption. However, FHE is often hindered by significant performance overhead, particularly for high-precision and complex data like images. Due to serious efficiency issues, traditional FHE methods often encrypt images by monolithic data blocks (such as pixel rows), instead of pixels. However, this strategy compromises the advantages of homomorphic operations and disables pixel-level image processing. In this study, we address these challenges by proposing and implementing a pixel-level homomorphic encryption approach, iCHEETAH, based on the CKKS scheme. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce three novel caching mechanisms to pre-encrypt radix values or frequently occurring pixel values, substantially reducing redundant encryption operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 19-fold improvement in encryption speed compared to the original CKKS, while maintaining high image quality. Additionally, real-world image applications such as mean filtering, brightness enhancement, image matching and watermarking are tested based on FHE, showcasing up to a 91.53% speed improvement. We also proved that our method is IND-CPA (Indistinguishability under Chosen Plaintext Attack) secure, providing strong encryption security. These results underscore the practicality and efficiency of iCHEETAH, marking a significant advancement in privacy-preserving image processing at scale.

### SELCC: Coherent Caching over Compute-Limited Disaggregated Memory
**Authors**: Ruihong Wang, Jianguo Wang, Walid G. Aref

**Updated**: 2024-09-05T01:12:04Z

**Summary**: Disaggregating memory from compute offers the opportunity to better utilize stranded memory in data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute nodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes to save on round-trip communication cost between the disaggregated memory and the compute nodes. However, the limited computing power on the disaggregated memory servers makes it challenging to maintain cache coherence among multiple compute-side caches over disaggregated shared memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a Shared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence without imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. SELCC builds on a one-sided shared-exclusive latch protocol by introducing lazy latch release and invalidation messages among the compute nodes so that it can guarantee both data access atomicity and cache coherence. SELCC minimizes communication round-trips by embedding the current cache copy holder IDs into RDMA latch words and prioritizes local concurrency control over global concurrency control. We instantiate the SELCC protocol onto compute-sided cache, forming an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory. This abstraction layer provides main-memory-like APIs to upper-level applications, and thus enabling existing data structures and algorithms to function over disaggregated memory with minimal code change. To demonstrate the usability of SELCC, we implement a B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms over SELCC's APIs. Micro-benchmark results show that the SELCC protocol achieves better performance compared to RPC-based cache-coherence protocols. Additionally, YCSB and TPC-C benchmarks indicate that applications over SELCC can achieve comparable or superior performance against competitors over disaggregated memory.

### Simultaneous Masking, Not Prompting Optimization: A Paradigm Shift in   Fine-tuning LLMs for Simultaneous Translation
**Authors**: Matthew Raffel, Victor Agostinelli, Lizhong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-05T01:06:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.

### SparQ Attention: Bandwidth-Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Luka Ribar, Ivan Chelombiev, Luke Hudlass-Galley, Charlie Blake, Carlo Luschi, Douglas Orr

**Updated**: 2024-09-04T10:04:52Z

**Summary**: The computational difficulties of large language model (LLM) inference remain a significant obstacle to their widespread deployment. The need for many applications to support long input sequences and process them in large batches typically causes token-generation to be bottlenecked by data transfer. For this reason, we introduce SparQ Attention, a technique for increasing the inference throughput of LLMs by utilising memory bandwidth more efficiently within the attention layers, through selective fetching of the cached history. Our proposed technique can be applied directly to off-the-shelf LLMs during inference, without requiring any modification to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. We show that SparQ Attention brings up to 8x savings in attention data transfers without substantial drops in accuracy, by evaluating Llama 2 and 3, Mistral, Gemma and Pythia models on a wide range of downstream tasks.

**Updated**: 2024-09-04T07:13:01Z

**Summary**: KV Vel is a non-eclipsing short-period (P = 0.3571 days) close binary containing a very hot subdwarf primary (77000 K) and a cool low-mass secondary star (3400 K) that is located at the center of the planetary nebula DS 1. The changes in the orbital period of the close binary were analyzed based on 262 new times of light maximum together with those compiled from the literature. It is discovered that the O-C curve shows a small-amplitude (0.0034 days) cyclic period variation with a period of 29.55 years. The explanation by the solar-type magnetic activity cycles of the cool component is ruled out because the required energies are much larger than the total radiant energy of this component in a whole cycle. Therefore, the cyclic variation was plausibly explained as the light-travel time effect via the presence of a tertiary component, which is supported by the periodic changes of the O-C curve and the rather symmetric and stable light curves obtained by TESS. The mass of the tertiary companion is determined to be M_3sini' = 0.060(7) M_sun. If the third body is coplanar with the central binary (i.e., i' = 62.5{\deg}), the mass of the tertiary component is computed as M_3 ~ 0.068 M\sun, and thus it would be below the stable hydrogen-burning limit and is a brown dwarf. The orbital separation is shorter than 9.35 astronomical units (AU). KV Vel together with its surrounding planetary nebula and the brown-dwarf companion may be formed through the common-envelope evolution after the primary filled its Roche lobe during the early asymptotic giant branch stage.

### Contemporary Model Compression on Large Language Models Inference
**Authors**: Dong Liu

**Updated**: 2024-09-03T15:35:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by achieving state-of-the-art results across a variety of tasks. However, the computational demands of LLM inference, including high memory consumption and slow processing speeds, pose significant challenges for real-world applications, particularly on resource-constrained devices. Efficient inference is crucial for scaling the deployment of LLMs to a broader range of platforms, including mobile and edge devices.   This survey explores contemporary techniques in model compression that address these challenges by reducing the size and computational requirements of LLMs while maintaining their performance. We focus on model-level compression methods, including quantization, knowledge distillation, and pruning, as well as system-level optimizations like KV cache efficient design. Each of these methodologies offers a unique approach to optimizing LLMs, from reducing numerical precision to transferring knowledge between models and structurally simplifying neural networks. Additionally, we discuss emerging trends in system-level design that further enhance the efficiency of LLM inference. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current advancements in model compression and their potential to make LLMs more accessible and practical for diverse applications.

### A Fresh Take on Stale Embeddings: Improving Dense Retriever Training   with Corrector Networks
**Authors**: Nicholas Monath, Will Grathwohl, Michael Boratko, Rob Fergus, Andrew McCallum, Manzil Zaheer

**Updated**: 2024-09-03T13:29:13Z

**Summary**: In dense retrieval, deep encoders provide embeddings for both inputs and targets, and the softmax function is used to parameterize a distribution over a large number of candidate targets (e.g., textual passages for information retrieval). Significant challenges arise in training such encoders in the increasingly prevalent scenario of (1) a large number of targets, (2) a computationally expensive target encoder model, (3) cached target embeddings that are out-of-date due to ongoing training of target encoder parameters. This paper presents a simple and highly scalable response to these challenges by training a small parametric corrector network that adjusts stale cached target embeddings, enabling an accurate softmax approximation and thereby sampling of up-to-date high scoring "hard negatives." We theoretically investigate the generalization properties of our proposed target corrector, relating the complexity of the network, staleness of cached representations, and the amount of training data. We present experimental results on large benchmark dense retrieval datasets as well as on QA with retrieval augmented language models. Our approach matches state-of-the-art results even when no target embedding updates are made during training beyond an initial cache from the unsupervised pre-trained model, providing a 4-80x reduction in re-embedding computational cost.

### Reward Augmentation in Reinforcement Learning for Testing Distributed   Systems
**Authors**: Andrea Borgarelli, Constantin Enea, Rupak Majumdar, Srinidhi Nagendra

**Updated**: 2024-09-02T15:07:05Z

**Summary**: Bugs in popular distributed protocol implementations have been the source of many downtimes in popular internet services. We describe a randomized testing approach for distributed protocol implementations based on reinforcement learning. Since the natural reward structure is very sparse, the key to successful exploration in reinforcement learning is reward augmentation. We show two different techniques that build on one another. First, we provide a decaying exploration bonus based on the discovery of new states -- the reward decays as the same state is visited multiple times. The exploration bonus captures the intuition from coverage-guided fuzzing of prioritizing new coverage points; in contrast to other schemes, we show that taking the maximum of the bonus and the Q-value leads to more effective exploration. Second, we provide waypoints to the algorithm as a sequence of predicates that capture interesting semantic scenarios. Waypoints exploit designer insight about the protocol and guide the exploration to ``interesting'' parts of the state space. Our reward structure ensures that new episodes can reliably get to deep interesting states even without execution caching. We have implemented our algorithm in Go. Our evaluation on three large benchmarks (RedisRaft, Etcd, and RSL) shows that our algorithm can significantly outperform baseline approaches in terms of coverage and bug finding.

### Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models
**Authors**: Poppy Collis, Ryan Singh, Paul F Kinghorn, Christopher L Buckley

**Updated**: 2024-09-02T08:41:45Z

**Summary**: An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work in computational neuroscience has considered this functional integration of discrete and continuous variables during decision-making under the formalism of active inference (Parr, Friston & de Vries, 2017; Parr & Friston, 2018). However, their focus is on the expressive physical implementation of categorical decisions and the hierarchical mixed generative model is assumed to be known. As a consequence, it is unclear how this framework might be extended to learning. We therefore present a novel hierarchical hybrid active inference agent in which a high-level discrete active inference planner sits above a low-level continuous active inference controller. We make use of recent work in recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) which implement end-to-end learning of meaningful discrete representations via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). The representations learned by the rSLDS inform the structure of the hybrid decision-making agent and allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and successful planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.

### Throughput Optimization in Cache-aided Networks: An Opportunistic   Probing and Scheduling Approach
**Authors**: Zhou Zhang, Saman Atapattu, Yizhu Wang, Marco Di Renzo

**Updated**: 2024-09-02T02:36:22Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the challenges of throughput optimization in wireless cache-aided cooperative networks. We propose an opportunistic cooperative probing and scheduling strategy for efficient content delivery. The strategy involves the base station probing the relaying channels and cache states of multiple cooperative nodes, thereby enabling opportunistic user scheduling for content delivery. Leveraging the theory of Sequentially Planned Decision (SPD) optimization, we dynamically formulate decisions on cooperative probing and stopping time. Our proposed Reward Expected Thresholds (RET)-based strategy optimizes opportunistic probing and scheduling. This approach significantly enhances system throughput by exploiting gains from local caching, cooperative transmission and time diversity.

**Authors**: Jiajie Li, Jan-Niklas Schmelzle, Yixiao Du, Simon Heumos, Andrea Guarracino, Giulia Guidi, Pjotr Prins, Erik Garrison, Zhiru Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-02T00:05:20Z

**Summary**: Computational Pangenomics is an emerging field that studies genetic variation using a graph structure encompassing multiple genomes. Visualizing pangenome graphs is vital for understanding genome diversity. Yet, handling large graphs can be challenging due to the high computational demands of the graph layout process.   In this work, we conduct a thorough performance characterization of a state-of-the-art pangenome graph layout algorithm, revealing significant data-level parallelism, which makes GPUs a promising option for compute acceleration. However, irregular data access and the algorithm's memory-bound nature present significant hurdles. To overcome these challenges, we develop a solution implementing three key optimizations: a cache-friendly data layout, coalesced random states, and warp merging. Additionally, we propose a quantitative metric for scalable evaluation of pangenome layout quality.   Evaluated on 24 human whole-chromosome pangenomes, our GPU-based solution achieves a 57.3x speedup over the state-of-the-art multithreaded CPU baseline without layout quality loss, reducing execution time from hours to minutes.

### Resource Management for IRS-Assisted Full-Duplex Integrated Sensing,   Communication and Computing Systems
**Authors**: Wanming Hao, Xue Wu, Xingwang Li, Gangcan Sun, Qingqing Wu, Liang Yang

**Updated**: 2024-08-31T06:33:50Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we investigate an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted full-duplex (FD) integrated sensing, communication and computing system. Specifically, an FD base station (BS) provides service for uplink and downlink transmission, and a local cache is connected to the BS through a backhaul link to store data. Meanwhile, active sensing elements are deployed on the IRS to receive target echo signals. On this basis, in order to evaluate the overall performance of the system under consideration, we propose a system utility maximization problem while ensuring the sensing quality, expressed as the difference between the sum of communication throughput, total computation bits (offloading bits and local computation bits) and the total backhaul cost for content delivery. This makes the problem difficult to solve due to the highly non-convex coupling of the optimization variables. To effectively solve this problem, we first design the most effective caching strategy. Then, we develop an algorithm based on weighted minimum mean square error, alternative direction method of multipliers, majorization-minimization framework, semi-definite relaxation techniques, and several complex transformations to jointly solve the optimization variables. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the utility performance of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme compared with the baseline scheme.

**Authors**: Advait Gilankar, Abishek Katta, Nabasindhu Das, Nidhin Kurian Kalarickal

**Updated**: 2024-08-31T04:20:58Z

**Summary**: This work demonstrates high-performance vertical NiO/Ga2O3 heterojunction diodes (HJDs) with a 2-step space-modulated junction termination extension. Distinct from the current state-of-the-art Ga2O3 HJDs, we achieve breakdown voltage exceeding 3 kV with a low turn on voltage (VON) of 0.8V, estimated at a forward current density (IF) of 1 A-cm-2. The measured devices exhibit excellent turn-on characteristics achieving 100 A-cm-2 current density at a forward bias of 1.5V along with a low differential specific on-resistance (Ron,sp) of 4.4 m{\Omega}-cm2. The SM-JTE was realized using concentric NiO rings with varying widths and spacing that approximates a gradual reduction in JTE charge. The unipolar figure of merit (FOM) calculated exceeds 2 GW-cm2 and is among the best reported for devices with a sub-1V turn-on. The fabricated devices also displayed minimal change in forward I-V characteristics post reverse bias stress of 3 kV applied during breakdown voltage testing.

### Adaptive Multi-Resolution Encoding for Interactive Large-Scale Volume   Visualization through Functional Approximation
**Authors**: Jianxin Sun, David Lenz, Hongfeng Yu, Tom Peterka

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T18:04:53Z

**Summary**: Functional approximation as a high-order continuous representation provides a more accurate value and gradient query compared to the traditional discrete volume representation. Volume visualization directly rendered from functional approximation generates high-quality rendering results without high-order artifacts caused by trilinear interpolations. However, querying an encoded functional approximation is computationally expensive, especially when the input dataset is large, making functional approximation impractical for interactive visualization. In this paper, we proposed a novel functional approximation multi-resolution representation, Adaptive-FAM, which is lightweight and fast to query. We also design a GPU-accelerated out-of-core multi-resolution volume visualization framework that directly utilizes the Adaptive-FAM representation to generate high-quality rendering with interactive responsiveness. Our method can not only dramatically decrease the caching time, one of the main contributors to input latency, but also effectively improve the cache hit rate through prefetching. Our approach significantly outperforms the traditional function approximation method in terms of input latency while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

**Authors**: Bobby Xiong, Davide Fioriti, Fabian Neumann, Iegor Riepin, Tom Brown

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T10:26:50Z

**Summary**: This paper provides the background, methodology and validation for constructing a representation of the European high-voltage grid, including and above 200 kV, based on public data provided by OpenStreetMap. The model-independent grid dataset is published under the Open Data Commons Open Database (ODbL 1.0) licence and can be used for large-scale electricity as well as energy system modelling. The dataset and workflow are provided as part of PyPSA-Eur -- an open-source, sector-coupled optimisation model of the European energy system. By integrating with the codebase for initiatives such as PyPSA-Earth, the value of open and maintainable high-voltage grid data extends to the global context. By accessing the latest data through the the Overpass turbo API, the dataset can be easily reconstructed and updated within minutes. To assess the data quality, this paper further compares the dataset with official statistics and representative model runs using PyPSA-Eur based on different electricity grid representations.

### MemLong: Memory-Augmented Retrieval for Long Text Modeling
**Authors**: Weijie Liu, Zecheng Tang, Juntao Li, Kehai Chen, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T02:01:56Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have yielded remarkable success across diverse fields. However, handling long contexts remains a significant challenge for LLMs due to the quadratic time and space complexity of attention mechanisms and the growing memory consumption of the key-value cache during generation. This work introduces MemLong: Memory-Augmented Retrieval for Long Text Generation, a method designed to enhance the capabilities of long-context language modeling by utilizing an external retriever for historical information retrieval. MemLong combines a non-differentiable ``ret-mem'' module with a partially trainable decoder-only language model and introduces a fine-grained, controllable retrieval attention mechanism that leverages semantic-level relevant chunks. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple long-context language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that MemLong consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art LLMs. More importantly, MemLong can extend the context length on a single 3090 GPU from 4k up to 80k. Our code is available at https://github.com/Bui1dMySea/MemLong

### Smart Helper-Aided F-RANs: Improving Delay and Reducing Fronthaul Load
**Authors**: Hesameddin Mokhtarzadeh, Mohammed S. Al-Abiad, Md Jahangir Hossain, Julian Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T17:43:26Z

**Summary**: In traditional Fog-Radio Access Networks (F-RANs), enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs) are connected to a macro base station (MBS) through fronthaul links. Deploying a massive number of eRRHs is not always feasible due to site constraints and the cost of fronthaul links. This paper introduces an innovative concept of using smart helpers (SHs) in F-RANs. These SHs do not require fronthaul links and listen to the nearby eRRHs' communications. Then, they smartly select and cache popular content. This capability enables SHs to serve users with frequent on-demand service requests potentially. As such, network operators have the flexibility to easily deploy SHs in various scenarios, such as dense urban areas and temporary public events, to expand their F-RANs and improve the quality of service (QoS). To study the performance of the proposed SH-aided F-RAN, we formulate an optimization problem of minimizing the average transmission delay that jointly optimizes cache resources and user scheduling. To tackle the formulated problem, we develop an innovative multi-stage algorithm that uses a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Various performance measures, e.g., the average transmission delay, fronthaul load, and cache hit rate of the proposed SH-aided F-RAN are evaluated numerically and compared with those of traditional F-RANs.

### VideoLLM-MoD: Efficient Video-Language Streaming with Mixture-of-Depths   Vision Computation
**Authors**: Shiwei Wu, Joya Chen, Kevin Qinghong Lin, Qimeng Wang, Yan Gao, Qianli Xu, Tong Xu, Yao Hu, Enhong Chen, Mike Zheng Shou

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T17:21:58Z

**Summary**: A well-known dilemma in large vision-language models (e.g., GPT-4, LLaVA) is that while increasing the number of vision tokens generally enhances visual understanding, it also significantly raises memory and computational costs, especially in long-term, dense video frame streaming scenarios. Although learnable approaches like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler have been developed to reduce the vision token burden, they overlook the context causally modeled by LLMs (i.e., key-value cache), potentially leading to missed visual cues when addressing user queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce vision compute by leveraging redundant vision tokens "skipping layers" rather than decreasing the number of vision tokens. Our method, VideoLLM-MoD, is inspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs and addresses the challenge of numerous vision tokens in long-term or streaming video. Specifically, for each transformer layer, we learn to skip the computation for a high proportion (e.g., 80\%) of vision tokens, passing them directly to the next layer. This approach significantly enhances model efficiency, achieving approximately \textasciitilde42\% time and \textasciitilde30\% memory savings for the entire training. Moreover, our method reduces the computation in the context and avoid decreasing the vision tokens, thus preserving or even improving performance compared to the vanilla model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of VideoLLM-MoD, showing its state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including narration, forecasting, and summarization tasks in COIN, Ego4D, and Ego-Exo4D datasets.

### GEAR: An Efficient KV Cache Compression Recipe for Near-Lossless   Generative Inference of LLM
**Authors**: Hao Kang, Qingru Zhang, Souvik Kundu, Geonhwa Jeong, Zaoxing Liu, Tushar Krishna, Tuo Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T16:48:58Z

**Summary**: Key-value (KV) caching has become the de-facto to accelerate generation speed for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, the growing cache demand with increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory bound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing methods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing all entries uniformly. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to represent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further compounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model generation and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose GEAR, an efficient KV cache compression framework that achieves near-lossless high-ratio compression. GEAR first applies quantization to majority of entries of similar magnitudes to ultra-low precision. It then employs a low rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse matrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating three techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to alternatives, GEAR achieves near-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression with up to 2.38x throughput improvement, while reducing peak-memory size up to 2.29x. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoKang-Timmy/GEAR.

### LightSLH: Provable and Low-Overhead Spectre v1 Mitigation through   Targeted Instruction Hardening
**Authors**: Yiming Zhu, Wenchao Huang, Yan Xiong

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T02:31:28Z

**Summary**: Several software mitigations have been proposed to defend against Spectre vulnerabilities. However, these countermeasures often suffer from high performance overhead, largely due to unnecessary protections. We propose LightSLH, designed to mitigate this overhead by hardening instructions only when they are under threat from Spectre vulnerabilities. LightSLH leverages program analysis techniques based on abstract interpretation to identify all instructions that could potentially lead to Spectre vulnerabilities and provides provable protection. To enhance analysis efficiency and precision, LightSLH employs novel taint and value domains. The taint domain enables bit-level taint tracking, while the value domain allows LightSLH to analyze complex program structures such as pointers and structures. Furthermore, LightSLH uses a two-stage abstract interpretation approach to circumvent potential analysis paralysis issues.   We demonstrate the security guarantees of LightSLH and evaluate its performance on cryptographic algorithm implementations from OpenSSL. LightSLH significantly reduces the overhead associated with speculative-load-hardening techniques. Our results show that LightSLH introduces no protection and thus no overhead on 4 out of the 7 studied algorithms, which contrasts with existing countermeasures that introduce additional overhead due to unnecessary hardening. Additionally, LightSLH performs, for the first time, a rigorous analysis of the security guarantees of RSA against Spectre v1, highlighting that the memory access patterns generated by the scatter-gather algorithm depend on secrets, even for observers at the cache line granularity, necessitating protection for such accesses.

### RIP Linked List
**Authors**: Benoît Sonntag, Dominique Colnet

**Updated**: 2024-08-28T08:41:45Z

**Summary**: Linked lists have long served as a valuable teaching tool in programming. However, the question arises: Are they truly practical for everyday program use? In most cases, it appears that array-based data structures offer distinct advantages, particularly in terms of memory efficiency and,more importantly, execution speed. While it's relatively straightforward to calculate the complexity of operations, gauging actual execution efficiency remains a challenge. This paper addresses this question by introducing a new benchmark. Our study compares various linked list implementations with several array-based alternatives. We also demonstrate the ease of incorporating memory caching for linked lists, enhancing their performance. Additionally, we introduce a new array-based data structure designed to excel in a wide range of operations.

### Efficient LLM Training and Serving with Heterogeneous Context Sharding   among Attention Heads
**Authors**: Xihui Lin, Yunan Zhang, Suyu Ge, Barun Patra, Vishrav Chaudhary, Hao Peng, Xia Song

**Updated**: 2024-08-27T22:06:20Z

**Summary**: Existing LLM training and inference frameworks struggle in boosting efficiency with sparsity while maintaining the integrity of context and model architecture. Inspired by the sharding concept in database and the fact that attention parallelizes over heads on accelerators, we propose Sparsely-Sharded (S2) Attention, an attention algorithm that allocates heterogeneous context partitions for different attention heads to divide and conquer. S2-Attention enforces each attention head to only attend to a partition of contexts following a strided sparsity pattern, while the full context is preserved as the union of all the shards. As attention heads are processed in separate thread blocks, the context reduction for each head can thus produce end-to-end speed-up and memory reduction. At inference, LLMs trained with S2-Attention can then take the KV cache reduction as free meals with guaranteed model quality preserve. In experiments, we show S2-Attentioncan provide as much as (1) 25.3X wall-clock attention speed-up over FlashAttention-2, resulting in 6X reduction in end-to-end training time and 10X inference latency, (2) on-par model training quality compared to default attention, (3)perfect needle retrieval accuracy over 32K context window. On top of the algorithm, we build DKernel, an LLM training and inference kernel library that allows users to customize sparsity patterns for their own models. We open-sourced DKerneland make it compatible with Megatron, Pytorch, and vLLM.

### Styx: Transactional Stateful Functions on Streaming Dataflows
**Authors**: Kyriakos Psarakis, George Siachamis, George Christodoulou, Marios Fragkoulis, Asterios Katsifodimos

**Updated**: 2024-08-27T17:30:41Z

**Summary**: Developing stateful cloud applications, such as low-latency workflows and microservices with strict consistency requirements, remains arduous for programmers. The Stateful Functions-as-a-Service (SFaaS) paradigm aims to serve these use cases. However, existing approaches either provide serializable transactional guarantees at the level of individual functions, or separate application logic from the state and use inefficient transactional protocols. These design choices increase the execution latency, limiting the adoption of SFaaS systems.   In this paper, we present Styx, a novel SFaaS runtime that executes serializable transactions across functions with exactly-once guarantees. Styx extends a deterministic transactional protocol to support an arbitrary call graph of stateful functions. It introduces a transaction-execution acknowledgment scheme that allows tracking a transactional workflow's SFaaS calls, guaranteeing atomicity and exactly-once processing. Finally, Styx features a function-execution caching mechanism and early transactional commit replies for optimized performance. Experiments with the YCSB-T, TPC-C, and Deathstar benchmarks show that Styx outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving at least one order of magnitude higher throughput while exhibiting near-linear scalability and low latency.

### Writing in the Margins: Better Inference Pattern for Long Context   Retrieval
**Authors**: Melisa Russak, Umar Jamil, Christopher Bryant, Kiran Kamble, Axel Magnuson, Mateusz Russak, Waseem AlShikh

**Updated**: 2024-08-27T09:34:38Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce Writing in the Margins (WiM), a new inference pattern for Large Language Models designed to optimize the handling of long input sequences in retrieval-oriented tasks. This approach leverages the chunked prefill of the key-value cache to perform segment-wise inference, which enables efficient processing of extensive contexts along with the generation and classification of intermediate information ("margins") that guide the model towards specific tasks. This method increases computational overhead marginally while significantly enhancing the performance of off-the-shelf models without the need for fine-tuning. Specifically, we observe that WiM provides an average enhancement of 7.5% in accuracy for reasoning skills (HotpotQA, MultiHop-RAG) and more than a 30.0% increase in the F1-score for aggregation tasks (CWE). Additionally, we show how the proposed pattern fits into an interactive retrieval design that provides end-users with ongoing updates about the progress of context processing, and pinpoints the integration of relevant information into the final response. We release our implementation of WiM using Hugging Face Transformers library at https://github.com/writer/writing-in-the-margins.

### PPVF: An Efficient Privacy-Preserving Online Video Fetching Framework   with Correlated Differential Privacy
**Authors**: Xianzhi Zhang, Yipeng Zhou, Di Wu, Quan Z. Sheng, Miao Hu, Linchang Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-08-27T02:03:36Z

**Summary**: Online video streaming has evolved into an integral component of the contemporary Internet landscape. Yet, the disclosure of user requests presents formidable privacy challenges. As users stream their preferred online videos, their requests are automatically seized by video content providers, potentially leaking users' privacy.   Unfortunately, current protection methods are not well-suited to preserving user request privacy from content providers while maintaining high-quality online video services. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel Privacy-Preserving Video Fetching (PPVF) framework, which utilizes trusted edge devices to pre-fetch and cache videos, ensuring the privacy of users' requests while optimizing the efficiency of edge caching. More specifically, we design PPVF with three core components: (1) \textit{Online privacy budget scheduler}, which employs a theoretically guaranteed online algorithm to select non-requested videos as candidates with assigned privacy budgets. Alternative videos are chosen by an online algorithm that is theoretically guaranteed to consider both video utilities and available privacy budgets. (2) \textit{Noisy video request generator}, which generates redundant video requests (in addition to original ones) utilizing correlated differential privacy to obfuscate request privacy. (3) \textit{Online video utility predictor}, which leverages federated learning to collaboratively evaluate video utility in an online fashion, aiding in video selection in (1) and noise generation in (2). Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using real-world video request traces from Tencent Video. The results demonstrate that PPVF effectively safeguards user request privacy while upholding high video caching performance.

### Quest: Query-Aware Sparsity for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Jiaming Tang, Yilong Zhao, Kan Zhu, Guangxuan Xiao, Baris Kasikci, Song Han

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T21:01:02Z

**Summary**: As the demand for long-context large language models (LLMs) increases, models with context windows of up to 128K or 1M tokens are becoming increasingly prevalent. However, long-context LLM inference is challenging since the inference speed decreases significantly as the sequence length grows. This slowdown is primarily caused by loading a large KV cache during self-attention. Previous works have shown that a small portion of critical tokens will dominate the attention outcomes. However, we observe the criticality of a token highly depends on the query. To this end, we propose Quest, a query-aware KV cache selection algorithm. Quest keeps track of the minimal and maximal Key values in KV cache pages and estimates the criticality of a given page using Query vectors. By only loading the Top-K critical KV cache pages for attention, Quest significantly speeds up self-attention without sacrificing accuracy. We show that Quest can achieve up to 2.23x self-attention speedup, which reduces inference latency by 7.03x while performing well on tasks with long dependencies with negligible accuracy loss. Code is available at http://github.com/mit-han-lab/Quest .

### Employing Artificial Intelligence to Steer Exascale Workflows with   Colmena
**Authors**: Logan Ward, J. Gregory Pauloski, Valerie Hayot-Sasson, Yadu Babuji, Alexander Brace, Ryan Chard, Kyle Chard, Rajeev Thakur, Ian Foster

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T17:21:19Z

**Summary**: Computational workflows are a common class of application on supercomputers, yet the loosely coupled and heterogeneous nature of workflows often fails to take full advantage of their capabilities. We created Colmena to leverage the massive parallelism of a supercomputer by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to learn from and adapt a workflow as it executes. Colmena allows scientists to define how their application should respond to events (e.g., task completion) as a series of cooperative agents. In this paper, we describe the design of Colmena, the challenges we overcame while deploying applications on exascale systems, and the science workflows we have enhanced through interweaving AI. The scaling challenges we discuss include developing steering strategies that maximize node utilization, introducing data fabrics that reduce communication overhead of data-intensive tasks, and implementing workflow tasks that cache costly operations between invocations. These innovations coupled with a variety of application patterns accessible through our agent-based steering model have enabled science advances in chemistry, biophysics, and materials science using different types of AI. Our vision is that Colmena will spur creative solutions that harness AI across many domains of scientific computing.

### Decision-Focused Learning to Predict Action Costs for Planning
**Authors**: Jayanta Mandi, Marco Foschini, Daniel Holler, Sylvie Thiebaux, Jorg Hoffmann, Tias Guns

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T11:29:07Z

**Summary**: In many automated planning applications, action costs can be hard to specify. An example is the time needed to travel through a certain road segment, which depends on many factors, such as the current weather conditions. A natural way to address this issue is to learn to predict these parameters based on input features (e.g., weather forecasts) and use the predicted action costs in automated planning afterward. Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) has been successful in learning to predict the parameters of combinatorial optimization problems in a way that optimizes solution quality rather than prediction quality. This approach yields better results than treating prediction and optimization as separate tasks. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the challenges of implementing DFL for automated planning in order to learn to predict the action costs. There are two main challenges to overcome: (1) planning systems are called during gradient descent learning, to solve planning problems with negative action costs, which are not supported in planning. We propose novel methods for gradient computation to avoid this issue. (2) DFL requires repeated planner calls during training, which can limit the scalability of the method. We experiment with different methods approximating the optimal plan as well as an easy-to-implement caching mechanism to speed up the learning process. As the first work that addresses DFL for automated planning, we demonstrate that the proposed gradient computation consistently yields significantly better plans than predictions aimed at minimizing prediction error; and that caching can temper the computation requirements.

### Trimma: Trimming Metadata Storage and Latency for Hybrid Memory Systems
**Authors**: Yiwei Li, Boyu Tian, Mingyu Gao

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T07:26:27Z

**Summary**: Hybrid main memory systems combine both performance and capacity advantages from heterogeneous memory technologies. With larger capacities, higher associativities, and finer granularities, hybrid memory systems currently exhibit significant metadata storage and lookup overheads for flexibly remapping data blocks between the two memory tiers. To alleviate the inefficiencies of existing designs, we propose Trimma, the combination of a multi-level metadata structure and an efficient metadata cache design. Trimma uses a multi-level metadata table to only track truly necessary address remap entries. The saved memory space is effectively utilized as extra DRAM cache capacity to improve performance. Trimma also uses separate formats to store the entries with non-identity and identity address mappings. This improves the overall remap cache hit rate, further boosting the performance. Trimma is transparent to software and compatible with various types of hybrid memory systems. When evaluated on a representative hybrid memory system with HBM3 and DDR5, Trimma achieves up to 1.68$\times$ and on average 1.33$\times$ speedup benefits, compared to state-of-the-art hybrid memory designs. These results show that Trimma effectively addresses metadata management overheads, especially for future scalable large-scale hybrid memory architectures.

### RollingCache: Using Runtime Behavior to Defend Against Cache Side   Channel Attacks
**Authors**: Divya Ojha, Sandhya Dwarkadas

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T04:32:56Z

**Summary**: Shared caches are vulnerable to side channel attacks through contention in cache sets. Besides being a simple source of information leak, these side channels form useful gadgets for more sophisticated attacks that compromise the security of shared systems.   The fundamental design aspect that contention attacks exploit is the deterministic nature of the set of addresses contending for a cache set. In this paper, we present RollingCache, a cache design that defends against contention attacks by dynamically changing the set of addresses contending for cache sets. Unlike prior defenses, RollingCache does not rely on address encryption/decryption, data relocation, or cache partitioning. We use one level of indirection to implement dynamic mapping controlled by the whole-cache runtime behavior. Our solution does not depend on having defined security domains, and can defend against an attacker running on the same or another core.   We evaluate RollingCache on ChampSim using the SPEC-2017 benchmark suite.

### Decentralized Federated Learning with Model Caching on Mobile Agents
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Wang, Guojun Xiong, Houwei Cao, Jian Li, Yong Liu

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T03:58:20Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a shared model using data and computation power on distributed agents coordinated by a central server. Decentralized FL (DFL) utilizes local model exchange and aggregation between agents to reduce the communication and computation overheads on the central server. However, when agents are mobile, the communication opportunity between agents can be sporadic, largely hindering the convergence and accuracy of DFL. In this paper, we study delay-tolerant model spreading and aggregation enabled by model caching on mobile agents. Each agent stores not only its own model, but also models of agents encountered in the recent past. When two agents meet, they exchange their own models as well as the cached models. Local model aggregation works on all models in the cache. We theoretically analyze the convergence of DFL with cached models, explicitly taking into account the model staleness introduced by caching. We design and compare different model caching algorithms for different DFL and mobility scenarios. We conduct detailed case studies in a vehicular network to systematically investigate the interplay between agent mobility, cache staleness, and model convergence. In our experiments, cached DFL converges quickly, and significantly outperforms DFL without caching.

### Mobile Edge Computing Networks: Online Low-Latency and Fresh Service   Provisioning
**Authors**: Yuhan Yi, Guanglin Zhang, Hai Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-08-24T15:23:32Z

**Summary**: Edge service caching can significantly mitigate latency and reduce communication and computing overhead by fetching and initializing services (applications) from clouds. The freshness of cached service data is critical when providing satisfactory services to users, but has been overlooked in existing research efforts. In this paper, we study the online low-latency and fresh service provisioning in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. Specifically, we jointly optimize the service caching, task offloading, and resource allocation without knowledge of future system information, which is formulated as a joint online long-term optimization problem. This problem is NP-hard. To solve the problem, we design a Lyapunov-based online framework that decouples the problem at temporal level into a series of per-time-slot subproblems. For each subproblem, we propose an online integrated optimization-deep reinforcement learning (OIODRL) method, which contains an optimization stage including a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) transformation and a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method, and a learning stage including a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. Extensive simulations show that the proposed OIODRL method achieves a near-optimal solution and outperforms other benchmark methods.

### MagicDec: Breaking the Latency-Throughput Tradeoff for Long Context   Generation with Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Jian Chen, Vashisth Tiwari, Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Zhuoming Chen, Jinyuan Shi, Ian En-Hsu Yen, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:54:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency without sacrificing performance but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy speculative decoding more effectively for high throughput inference. Then, it leverages draft models with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck that scales with both sequence length and batch size. This finding underscores the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2x speedup for LLaMA-2-7B-32K and 1.84x speedup for LLaMA-3.1-8B when serving batch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/MagicDec/.

### Cyclic Wrap-Around Multi-Access Coded Caching with Private Caches
**Authors**: Dhruv Pratap Singh, Anjana A. Mahesh, B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T15:39:20Z

**Summary**: We consider a variant of the coded caching problem where users connect to two types of caches, called private caches and access caches. The problem setting consists of a server having a library of files and a set of access caches. Every user, equipped with a private cache, connects to $L$ neighboring access caches in a cyclic wrap-around fashion. The server populates the private and access caches with file contents in either coded or uncoded format. For this setting, we derive a lower bound on the optimal worst-case transmission rate using cut-set arguments. This lower bound applies to both coded and uncoded placements. We then provide an achievable scheme with uncoded placement and show that our scheme specializes to the well-known Maddah-Ali-Niesen scheme for the dedicated cache network in the absence of access caches. Finally, we show that the proposed scheme achieves optimality in large memory regimes and provide numerical plots comparing the rate of the proposed scheme with the derived lower bound, demonstrating the optimality of our scheme.

### Fundamental Limits of Multi-Message Private Computation
**Authors**: Ali Gholami, Kai Wan, Tayyebeh Jahani-Nezhad, Hua Sun, Mingyue Ji, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T13:25:07Z

**Summary**: In a typical formulation of the private information retrieval (PIR) problem, a single user wishes to retrieve one out of $ K$ files from $N$ servers without revealing the demanded file index to any server. This paper formulates an extended model of PIR, referred to as multi-message private computation (MM-PC), where instead of retrieving a single file, the user wishes to retrieve $P>1$ linear combinations of files while preserving the privacy of the demand information. The MM-PC problem is a generalization of the private computation (PC) problem (where the user requests one linear combination of the files), and the multi-message private information retrieval (MM-PIR) problem (where the user requests $P>1$ files). A baseline achievable scheme repeats the optimal PC scheme by Sun and Jafar $P$ times, or treats each possible demanded linear combination as an independent file and then uses the near optimal MM-PIR scheme by Banawan and Ulukus. In this paper, we propose a new MM-PC scheme that significantly improves upon the baseline schemes. In doing so, we design the queries inspired by the structure in the cache-aided scalar linear function retrieval scheme by Wan {\it et al.}, which leverages the dependency between linear functions to reduce the amount of communications. To ensure the decodability of our scheme, we propose a new method to benefit from the existing dependency, referred to as the sign assignment step. In the end, we use Maximum Distance Separable matrices to code the queries, which allows the reduction of download from the servers, while preserving privacy. By the proposed schemes, we characterize the capacity within a multiplicative factor of $2$.

### Which Part of the Heap is Useful? Improving Heap Liveness Analysis
**Authors**: Vini Kanvar, Uday P. Khedker

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T09:54:22Z

**Summary**: With the growing sizes of data structures allocated in heap, understanding the actual use of heap memory is critically important for minimizing cache misses and reclaiming unused memory. A static analysis aimed at this is difficult because the heap locations are unnamed. Using allocation sites to name them creates very few distinctions making it difficult to identify allocated heap locations that are not used. Heap liveness analysis using access graphs solves this problem by (a) using a storeless model of heap memory by naming the locations with access paths, and (b) representing the unbounded sets of access paths (which are regular languages) as finite automata.   We improve the scalability and efficiency of heap liveness analysis, and reduce the amount of computed heap liveness information by using deterministic automata and by minimizing the inclusion of aliased access paths in the language. Practically, our field-, flow-, context-sensitive liveness analysis on SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks scales to 36 kLoC (existing analysis scales to 10.5 kLoC) and improves efficiency even up to 99%. For some of the benchmarks, our technique shows multifold reduction in the computed liveness information, ranging from 2 to 100 times (in terms of the number of live access paths), without compromising on soundness.

### Exposing Shadow Branches
**Authors**: Chrysanthos Pepi, Bhargav Reddy Godala, Krishnam Tibrewala, Gino Chacon, Paul V. Gratz, Daniel A. Jiménez, Gilles A. Pokam, David I. August

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T17:56:29Z

**Summary**: Modern processors implement a decoupled front-end in the form of Fetch Directed Instruction Prefetching (FDIP) to avoid front-end stalls. FDIP is driven by the Branch Prediction Unit (BPU), relying on the BPU's accuracy and branch target tracking structures to speculatively fetch instructions into the Instruction Cache (L1I). As data center applications become more complex, their code footprints also grow, resulting in an increase in Branch Target Buffer (BTB) misses. FDIP can alleviate L1I cache misses, but when it encounters a BTB miss, the BPU may not identify the current instruction as a branch to FDIP. This can prevent FDIP from prefetching or cause it to speculate down the wrong path, further polluting the L1I cache. We observe that the vast majority, 75%, of BTB-missing, unidentified branches are actually present in instruction cache lines that FDIP has previously fetched but, these missing branches have not yet been decoded and inserted into the BTB. This is because the instruction line is decoded from an entry point (which is the target of the previous taken branch) till an exit point (the taken branch). Branch instructions present in the ignored portion of the cache line we call them "Shadow Branches". Here we present Skeia, a novel shadow branch decoding technique that identifies and decodes unused bytes in cache lines fetched by FDIP, inserting them into a Shadow Branch Buffer (SBB). The SBB is accessed in parallel with the BTB, allowing FDIP to speculate despite a BTB miss. With a minimal storage state of 12.25KB, Skeia delivers a geomean speedup of ~5.7% over an 8K-entry BTB (78KB) and ~2% versus adding an equal amount of state to the BTB across 16 front-end bound applications. Since many branches stored in the SBB are unique compared to those in a similarly sized BTB, we consistently observe greater performance gains with Skeia across all examined sizes until saturation.

### Stable CoO$_2$ Nanoscrolls With Outstanding Electrical Properties
**Authors**: Simon Hettler, Kankona Singha Roy, Raul Arenal, Leela S. Panchakarla

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T17:47:49Z

**Summary**: Layered CoO$_2$ is of great interest for its promising properties but is meta-stable in its bulk form. CoO$_2$ was synthesized by converting the quasi-one-dimensional crystal structure of bulk Ca$_3$Co$_2$O$_6$ via a hydrothermal treatment. The resulting nanostructures were predominantly nanoscrolls with very thin walls, which exhibit long-term stability. A detailed structural investigation reveals that the CoO$_2$ is found to crystallize in monoclinic form, similar to the related CaCoO$_2$-CoO$_2$ misfit structure. Individual nanoscrolls are characterized electrically and show a p-type semiconducting nature with a high current-carrying capacity of 4$\cdot$10$^5$ A cm$^{-2}$ and an extremely high breakdown voltage of up to 270 kV/cm. The results demonstrate the possibility to stabilize meta-stable materials in low-dimensional forms and a promising application of the nanoscrolls as interconnect in high-voltage electronic circuitry.

### Rheological behavior of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) inks under electric   fields: influence of concentration and voltage
**Authors**: Pedro C Rijo, Francisco J. Galindo-Rosales

**Updated**: 2024-08-21T10:26:26Z

**Summary**: This work provides a complete rheological characterization of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) inks in the presence of electric fields. Several concentrations of MoS2 are studied and dispersed in a viscoelastic fluid. The lubrication effects are present in the ink when the MoS2 concentration is higher than 0.10% w/w. The dielectric properties show the impossibility of a positive electrorheological effect for all MoS2-inks studied. The formation of vortices and electromigration of MoS2 particles occur under the influence of an external electric field. These two phenomena affect the rheological behavior of MoS2-inks under shear flow condition. Relatively to the extensional rheology experiments, the particle migration and the vortex formation promote anisotropy on the rheological properties of the inks which affects the relaxation time, the formation of beads-on-a-string and the uniaxial elongational flow condition is no longer valid. When the electric field strength is 1.5 kV/mm, the formation of Taylor's cone is observed and independent of MoS2 concentration.

### Towards End-to-End GPS Localization with Neural Pseudorange Correction
**Authors**: Xu Weng, KV Ling, Haochen Liu, Kun Cao

**Updated**: 2024-08-21T06:10:02Z

**Summary**: The pseudorange error is one of the root causes of localization inaccuracy in GPS. Previous data-driven methods regress and eliminate pseudorange errors using handcrafted intermediate labels. Unlike them, we propose an end-to-end GPS localization framework, E2E-PrNet, to train a neural network for pseudorange correction (PrNet) directly using the final task loss calculated with the ground truth of GPS receiver states. The gradients of the loss with respect to learnable parameters are backpropagated through a Differentiable Nonlinear Least Squares (DNLS) optimizer to PrNet. The feasibility of fusing the data-driven neural network and the model-based DNLS module is verified with GPS data collected by Android phones, showing that E2E-PrNet outperforms the baseline weighted least squares method and the state-of-the-art end-to-end data-driven approach. Finally, we discuss the explainability of E2E-PrNet.

### Telepathic Datacenters: Fast RPCs using Shared CXL Memory
**Authors**: Suyash Mahar, Ehsan Hajyjasini, Seungjin Lee, Zifeng Zhang, Mingyao Shen, Steven Swanson

**Updated**: 2024-08-21T04:16:49Z

**Summary**: Datacenter applications often rely on remote procedure calls (RPCs) for fast, efficient, and secure communication. However, RPCs are slow, inefficient, and hard to use as they require expensive serialization and compression to communicate over a packetized serial network link. Compute Express Link 3.0 (CXL) offers an alternative solution, allowing applications to share data using a cache-coherent, shared-memory interface across clusters of machines.   RPCool is a new framework that exploits CXL's shared memory capabilities. RPCool avoids serialization by passing pointers to data structures in shared memory. While avoiding serialization is useful, directly sharing pointer-rich data eliminates the isolation that copying data over traditional networks provides, leaving the receiver vulnerable to invalid pointers and concurrent updates to shared data by the sender. RPCool restores this safety with careful and efficient management of memory permissions. Another significant challenge with CXL shared memory capabilities is that they are unlikely to scale to an entire datacenter. RPCool addresses this by falling back to RDMA-based communication.   Overall, RPCool reduces the round-trip latency by 1.93$\times$ and 7.2$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art RDMA and CXL-based RPC mechanisms, respectively. Moreover, RPCool performs either comparably or better than other RPC mechanisms across a range of workloads.

### Hybrid Recurrent Models Support Emergent Descriptions for Hierarchical   Planning and Control
**Authors**: Poppy Collis, Ryan Singh, Paul F Kinghorn, Christopher L Buckley

**Updated**: 2024-08-20T16:02:54Z

**Summary**: An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work has demonstrated that a class of hybrid state-space model known as recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) discover meaningful behavioural units via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). Furthermore, they model how the underlying continuous states drive these discrete mode switches. We propose that the rich representations formed by an rSLDS can provide useful abstractions for planning and control. We present a novel hierarchical model-based algorithm inspired by Active Inference in which a discrete MDP sits above a low-level linear-quadratic controller. The recurrent transition dynamics learned by the rSLDS allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We successfully apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and non-trivial planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.

### Pluto and Charon: A Time and Memory Efficient Collaborative Edge AI   Framework for Personal LLMs Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Bei Ouyang, Shengyuan Ye, Liekang Zeng, Tianyi Qian, Jingyi Li, Xu Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-20T11:30:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a plethora of powerful applications at the network edge, such as intelligent personal assistants. Data privacy and security concerns have prompted a shift towards edge-based fine-tuning of personal LLMs, away from cloud reliance. However, this raises issues of computational intensity and resource scarcity, hindering training efficiency and feasibility. While current studies investigate parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to mitigate resource constraints, our analysis indicates that these techniques are not sufficiently resource-efficient for edge devices. To tackle these challenges, we propose Pluto and Charon (PAC), a time and memory efficient collaborative edge AI framework for personal LLMs fine-tuning. PAC breaks the resource wall of personal LLMs fine-tuning with a sophisticated algorithm-system co-design. (1) Algorithmically, PAC implements a personal LLMs fine-tuning technique that is efficient in terms of parameters, time, and memory. It utilizes Parallel Adapters to circumvent the need for a full backward pass through the LLM backbone. Additionally, an activation cache mechanism further streamlining the process by negating the necessity for repeated forward passes across multiple epochs. (2) Systematically, PAC leverages edge devices in close proximity, pooling them as a collective resource for in-situ personal LLMs fine-tuning, utilizing a hybrid data and pipeline parallelism to orchestrate distributed training. The use of the activation cache eliminates the need for forward pass through the LLM backbone,enabling exclusive fine-tuning of the Parallel Adapters using data parallelism. Extensive evaluation based on prototype implementation demonstrates that PAC remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 8.64x end-to-end speedup and up to 88.16% reduction in memory footprint.

### Heta: Distributed Training of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks
**Authors**: Yuchen Zhong, Junwei Su, Chuan Wu, Minjie Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-20T04:46:18Z

**Summary**: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) leverage diverse semantic relationships in Heterogeneous Graphs (HetGs) and have demonstrated remarkable learning performance in various applications. However, current distributed GNN training systems often overlook unique characteristics of HetGs, such as varying feature dimensions and the prevalence of missing features among nodes, leading to suboptimal performance or even incompatibility with distributed HGNN training. We introduce Heta, a framework designed to address the communication bottleneck in distributed HGNN training. Heta leverages the inherent structure of HGNNs - independent relation-specific aggregations for each relation, followed by a cross-relation aggregation - and advocates for a novel Relation-Aggregation-First computation paradigm. It performs relation-specific aggregations within graph partitions and then exchanges partial aggregations. This design, coupled with a new graph partitioning method that divides a HetG based on its graph schema and HGNN computation dependency, substantially reduces communication overhead. Heta further incorporates an innovative GPU feature caching strategy that accounts for the different cache miss-penalties associated with diverse node types. Comprehensive evaluations of various HGNN models and large heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that Heta outperforms state-of-the-art systems like DGL and GraphLearn by up to 5.8x and 2.3x in end-to-end epoch time, respectively.

### Multi-Mode Lens for Momentum Microscopy and XPEEM: Theory
**Authors**: Olena Tkach, Gerd Schoenhense

**Updated**: 2024-08-19T15:47:17Z

**Summary**: The strong electric field between the sample and the extractor is the core of cathode lenses and a pivotal determinant of high resolution. Nevertheless, fields in the range of 3-8 kV/mm can be a source of complications. Local field enhancement at sharp edges or microscopic protrusions of cleaved samples may result in field emission or flashovers. Moreover, slow background electrons are drawn into the microscope column, where they contribute to space charge effects. A novel front lens configuration, optimized through ray-tracing simulations, significantly reduces the field at the sample and allows even for zero field or retarding field, which serves to suppress space charge effects. One or several annular electrodes, situated in a concentric position relative to the extractor, serve to form an additional lens within the gap between the sample and the extractor. The refractory power of this lens, and consequently the field at the sample surface, can be modified by adjusting the potentials of the annular electrodes. The imaging properties and aberrations of this gap lens have been investigated with regard to momentum imaging and XPEEM. The study encompasses the energy range from the few-eV level for laser-ARPES to 6 keV, for hard X-ray ARPES. The additional converging lens situated in close proximity to the sample exhibits a reduced field curvature of the k-image in the backfocal plane. This allows for the acquisition of larger fields of view in both momentum and real-space imaging.

### Abstract Environment Trimming
**Authors**: Daniel Jurjo-Rivas, Jose F. Morales, Pedro López-García, Manuel V. Hermenegildo

**Updated**: 2024-08-19T09:50:35Z

**Summary**: Variable sharing is a fundamental property in the static analysis of logic programs, since it is instrumental for ensuring correctness and increasing precision while inferring many useful program properties. Such properties include modes, determinacy, non-failure, cost, etc. This has motivated significant work on developing abstract domains to improve the precision and performance of sharing analyses. Much of this work has centered around the family of set-sharing domains, because of the high precision they offer. However, this comes at a price: their scalability to a wide set of realistic programs remains challenging and this hinders their wider adoption. In this work, rather than defining new sharing abstract domains, we focus instead on developing techniques which can be incorporated in the analyzers to address aspects that are known to affect the efficiency of these domains, such as the number of variables, without affecting precision. These techniques are inspired in others used in the context of compiler optimizations, such as expression reassociation and variable trimming. We present several such techniques and provide an extensive experimental evaluation of over 1100 program modules taken from both production code and classical benchmarks. This includes the Spectector cache analyzer, the s(CASP) system, the libraries of the Ciao system, the LPdoc documenter, the PLAI analyzer itself, etc. The experimental results are quite encouraging: we have obtained significant speed-ups, and, more importantly, the number of modules that require a timeout was cut in half. As a result, many more programs can be analyzed precisely in reasonable times.

### AdapMoE: Adaptive Sensitivity-based Expert Gating and Management for   Efficient MoE Inference
**Authors**: Shuzhang Zhong, Ling Liang, Yuan Wang, Runsheng Wang, Ru Huang, Meng Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-19T03:27:15Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are designed to enhance the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) without proportionally increasing the computational demands. However, their deployment on edge devices still faces significant challenges due to high on-demand loading overheads from managing sparsely activated experts. This paper introduces AdapMoE, an algorithm-system co-design framework for efficient MoE inference. AdapMoE features adaptive expert gating and management to reduce the on-demand loading overheads. We observe the heterogeneity of experts loading across layers and tokens, based on which we propose a sensitivity-based strategy to adjust the number of activated experts dynamically. Meanwhile, we also integrate advanced prefetching and cache management techniques to further reduce the loading latency. Through comprehensive evaluations on various platforms, we demonstrate AdapMoE consistently outperforms existing techniques, reducing the average number of activated experts by 25% and achieving a 1.35x speedup without accuracy degradation.

### Post-Training Sparse Attention with Double Sparsity
**Authors**: Shuo Yang, Ying Sheng, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Ion Stoica, Lianmin Zheng

**Updated**: 2024-08-18T17:27:17Z

**Summary**: The inference process for large language models is slow and memory-intensive, with one of the most critical bottlenecks being excessive Key-Value (KV) cache accesses. This paper introduces "Double Sparsity," a novel post-training sparse attention technique designed to alleviate this bottleneck by reducing KV cache access. Double Sparsity combines token sparsity, which focuses on utilizing only the important tokens for computing self-attention, with channel sparsity, an approach that uses important feature channels for identifying important tokens. Our key insight is that the pattern of channel sparsity is relatively static, allowing us to use offline calibration to make it efficient at runtime, thereby enabling accurate and efficient identification of important tokens. Moreover, this method can be combined with offloading to achieve significant memory usage reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that Double Sparsity can achieve $\frac{1}{16}$ token and channel sparsity with minimal impact on accuracy across various tasks, including wiki-2 perplexity, key-value retrieval, and long context benchmarks with models including Llama-2-7B, Llama-2-70B, and Mixtral-8x7B. It brings up to a 14.1$\times$ acceleration in attention operations and a 1.9$\times$ improvement in end-to-end inference on GPUs. With offloading, it achieves a decoding speed acceleration of 16.3$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions at a sequence length of 256K. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/andy-yang-1/DoubleSparse.

### CMD: A Cache-assisted GPU Memory Deduplication Architecture
**Authors**: Wei Zhao, Dan Feng, Wei Tong, Xueliang Wei, Bing Wu

**Updated**: 2024-08-18T13:54:46Z

**Summary**: Massive off-chip accesses in GPUs are the main performance bottleneck, and we divided these accesses into three types: (1) Write, (2) Data-Read, and (3) Read-Only. Besides, We find that many writes are duplicate, and the duplication can be inter-dup and intra-dup. While inter-dup means different memory blocks are identical, and intra-dup means all the 4B elements in a line are the same. In this work, we propose a cache-assisted GPU memory deduplication architecture named CMD to reduce the off-chip accesses via utilizing the data duplication in GPU applications. CMD includes three key design contributions which aim to reduce the three kinds of accesses: (1) A novel GPU memory deduplication architecture that removes the inter-dup and inter-dup lines. As for the inter-dup detection, we reduce the extra read requests caused by the traditional read-verify hash process. Besides, we design several techniques to manage duplicate blocks. (2) We propose a cache-assisted read scheme to reduce the reads to duplicate data. When an L2 cache miss wants to read the duplicate block, if the reference block has been fetched to L2 and it is clean, we can copy it to the L2 missed block without accessing off-chip DRAM. As for the reads to intra-dup data, CMD uses the on-chip metadata cache to get the data. (3) When a cache line is evicted, the clean sectors in the line are invalidated while the dirty sectors are written back. However, most read-only victims are re-referenced from DRAM more than twice. Therefore, we add a full-associate FIFO to accommodate the read-only (it is also clean) victims to reduce the re-reference counts. Experiments show that CMD can decrease the off-chip accesses by 31.01%, reduce the energy by 32.78% and improve performance by 37.79%. Besides, CMD can improve the performance of memory-intensive workloads by 50.18%.

### Ada-KV: Optimizing KV Cache Eviction by Adaptive Budget Allocation for   Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yuan Feng, Junlin Lv, Yukun Cao, Xike Xie, S. Kevin Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-08-16T08:46:33Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models have excelled in various fields but encounter challenges in memory and time efficiency due to the expanding Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-sequence inference. Recent efforts try to reduce KV cache size to a given memory budget by evicting vast non-critical cache elements during runtime, while preserving generation quality. Our revisiting of current eviction methods reveals that they fundamentally minimize an upper bound of the $L_1$ eviction loss between the pre- and post-eviction outputs of multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the common practices of uniformly assigning budgets across attention heads harm their post-eviction generation quality. In light of these findings, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive budget allocation algorithm. This algorithm not only optimizes the theoretical loss upper bound but also reduces the $L_1$ eviction loss in practice by aligning with the varied characteristics across different heads. By integrating this algorithm into two state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using adaptive budget allocation to optimize KV cache eviction. Extensive evaluations on 16 datasets and the Needle-in-a-Haystack test confirm significant performance improvements across various tasks.

### SelectLLM: Query-Aware Efficient Selection Algorithm for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2024-08-16T06:11:21Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have gained increased popularity due to their remarkable success across various tasks, which has led to the active development of a large set of diverse LLMs. However, individual LLMs have limitations when applied to complex tasks because of such factors as training biases, model sizes, and the datasets used. A promising approach is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. Towards this goal, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM. This algorithm directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring they collectively provide the correct response efficiently. SelectLLM uses a multi-label classifier, utilizing the classifier's predictions and confidence scores to design optimal policies for selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings show that the proposed model outperforms individual LLMs and achieves competitive performance compared to similarly sized, computationally expensive top-performing LLM subsets. Specifically, with a similarly sized top-performing LLM subset, we achieve a significant reduction in latency on two standard reasoning benchmarks: 13% lower latency for GSM8K and 70% lower latency for MMLU. Additionally, we conduct comprehensive analyses and ablation studies, which validate the robustness of the proposed model.

### Symmetric Locality: Definition and Initial Results
**Authors**: Giordan Escalona, Dylan McKellips, Chen Ding

**Updated**: 2024-08-16T04:12:25Z

**Summary**: In this short paper, we characterize symmetric locality. In designing algorithms, compilers, and systems, data movement is a common bottleneck in high-performance computation, in which we improve cache and memory performance. We study a special type of data reuse in the form of repeated traversals, or re-traversals, which are based on the symmetric group. The cyclic and sawtooth traces are previously known results in symmetric locality, and in this work, we would like to generalize this result for any re-traversal. Then, we also provide an abstract framework for applications in compiler design and machine learning models to improve the memory performance of certain programs.

### ConfusedPilot: Confused Deputy Risks in RAG-based LLMs
**Authors**: Ayush RoyChowdhury, Mulong Luo, Prateek Sahu, Sarbartha Banerjee, Mohit Tiwari

**Updated**: 2024-08-15T05:24:19Z

**Summary**: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.   In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.

### A Case for Enabling Delegation of 5G Core Decisions to the RAN
**Authors**: Lucas Vancina, Geoffrey Xie

**Updated**: 2024-08-14T23:42:46Z

**Summary**: Under conventional 5G system design, the authentication and continuous monitoring of user equipment (UE) demands a reliable backhaul connection between the radio access network (RAN) and the core network functions (AMF, AUSF, UDM, etc.). This is not a given, especially in disaster response and military operations. We propose that, in these scenarios, decisions made by core functions can be effectively delegated to the RAN by leveraging the RAN's computing resources and the micro-service programmability of the O-RAN system architecture. This paper presents several concrete designs of core-RAN decision delegation, including caching of core decisions and replicating some of the core decision logic. Each design has revealed interesting performance and security trade-offs that warrant further investigation.

### The Bicameral Cache: a split cache for vector architectures
**Authors**: Susana Rebolledo, Borja Perez, Jose Luis Bosque, Peter Hsu

**Updated**: 2024-08-14T09:18:02Z

**Summary**: The Bicameral Cache is a cache organization proposal for a vector architecture that segregates data according to their access type, distinguishing scalar from vector references. Its aim is to avoid both types of references from interfering in each other's data locality, with a special focus on prioritizing the performance on vector references. The proposed system incorporates an additional, non-polluting prefetching mechanism to help populate the long vector cache lines in advance to increase the hit rate by further exploiting the spatial locality on vector data. Its evaluation was conducted on the Cavatools simulator, comparing the performance to a standard conventional cache, over different typical vector benchmarks for several vector lengths. The results proved the proposed cache speeds up performance on stride-1 vector benchmarks, while hardly impacting non-stride-1's. In addition, the prefetching feature consistently provided an additional value.

### At Least Factor-of-Two Optimization for RWLE-Based Homomorphic   Encryption
**Authors**: Jonathan Ly

**Updated**: 2024-08-14T05:42:35Z

**Summary**: Many modern applications that deal with sensitive data, such as healthcare and government services, outsource computation to cloud platforms. In such untrusted environments, privacy is of vital importance. One solution to this problem is homomorphic encryption (HE), a family of cryptographic schemes that support certain algebraic operations on encrypted data without the need for decryption. However, despite major advancements, encryption in modern HE schemes still comes with a non-trivial computational overhead that can hamper data-intensive workloads. To resolve this, recent research has shown that leveraging caching techniques, such as Rache, can significantly enhance the performance of HE schemes while maintaining security. Rache unfortunately displays a key limitation in the time complexity of its caching procedure, which scales with the size of the plaintext space. Smuche is another caching scheme that simultaneously improves the scalability of the caching procedure and turns the encryption process into a constant-time operation, utilizing only a single scalar multiplication. Even still, more can be done. In this paper, we present an encryption method we call ``Zinc" which entirely forgoes the multiple caching process, replacing it with a single scalar addition, and then injecting randomness that takes constant time with respect to the plaintext space. This injection of randomness is similar to Smuche, and a great improvement from Rache, allowing Zinc to achieve efficiency without compromising security. We implement the scheme using Microsoft SEAL and compare its performance to vanilla CKKS.

### Cache-Aided MIMO Communications: DoF Analysis and Transmitter   Optimization
**Authors**: Mohammad NaseriTehrani, MohammadJavad Salehi, Antti Tölli

**Updated**: 2024-08-13T13:56:14Z

**Summary**: Cache-aided MIMO communications aims to jointly exploit both coded caching~(CC) and spatial multiplexing gains to enhance communication efficiency. In this paper, we first analyze the achievable degrees of freedom~(DoF) in a MIMO-CC system with CC gain \(t\), where a server with \(L\) transmit antennas communicates with \(K\) users, each equipped with \(G\) receive antennas. We demonstrate that the enhanced achievable DoF is \(\max_{\beta, \Omega} \Omega \beta\), where the number of users \(\Omega\) served in each transmission is fine-tuned to maximize DoF, and \(\beta \le \min\big(G, \nicefrac{L \binom{\Omega-1}{t}}{1 + (\Omega - t - 1)\binom{\Omega-1}{t}}\big)\) represents the number of parallel streams decoded by each user. Second, we introduce an effective transmit covariance matrix design aimed at maximizing the symmetric rate, solved iteratively via successive convex approximation. Third, we propose a new class of MIMO-CC schemes using a novel scheduling mechanism leveraging maximal multicasting opportunities to maximize delivery rates at given SNR levels while adhering to linear processing constraints. Lastly, we devise linear multicast beamforming strategies tailored for the flexible scheduling schemes in MIMO-CC systems and present an iterative solution for the efficient design of beamformers. Extensive numerical simulations are used to verify the results of the paper.

### Ownership in low-level intermediate representation
**Authors**: Siddharth Priya, Arie Gurfinkel

**Updated**: 2024-08-13T13:31:34Z

**Summary**: The concept of ownership in high level languages can aid both the programmer and the compiler to reason about the validity of memory operations. Previously, ownership semantics has been used successfully in high level automatic program verification to model a reference to data by a first order logic (FOL) representation of data instead of maintaining an address map. However, ownership semantics is not used in low level program verification. We have identified two challenges. First, ownership information is lost when a program is compiled to a low level intermediate representation (e.g., in LLVM IR). Second, pointers in low level programs point to bytes using an address map (e.g., in unsafe Rust) and thus the verification condition (VC) cannot always replace a pointer by its FOL abstraction. To remedy the situation, we develop ownership semantics for an LLVM like low level intermediate representation. Using these semantics, the VC can opportunistically model some memory accesses by a direct access of a pointer cache that stores byte representation of data. This scheme reduces instances where an address map must be maintained, especially for mostly safe programs that follow ownership semantics. For unsafe functionality, memory accesses are modelled by operations on an address map and we provide mechanisms to keep the address map and pointer cache in sync. We implement these semantics in SEABMC, a bit precise bounded model checker for LLVM. For evaluation, the source programs are assumed to be written in C. Since C does not have ownership built in, suitable macros are added that introduce and preserve ownership during translation to LLVM like IR for verification. This approach is evaluated on mature open source C code. For both handcrafted benchmarks and practical programs, we observe a speedup of $1.3x-5x$ during SMT solving.

### Keep the Cost Down: A Review on Methods to Optimize LLM' s KV-Cache   Consumption
**Authors**: Luohe Shi, Hongyi Zhang, Yao Yao, Zuchao Li, Hai Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-08-13T09:55:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by ChatGPT' s release in late 2022, have revolutionized various industries with their advanced language comprehension. However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture' s struggle with handling long texts. KV-Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV-Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV-Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV-Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our review thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering insights into future advancements in this dynamic field.

### Finch: Prompt-guided Key-Value Cache Compression
**Authors**: Giulio Corallo, Paolo Papotti

**Updated**: 2024-08-13T09:08:55Z

**Summary**: Recent large language model applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation and chatbots, have led to an increased need to process longer input contexts. However, this requirement is hampered by inherent limitations. Architecturally, models are constrained by a context window defined during training. Additionally, processing extensive texts requires substantial GPU memory. We propose a novel approach, Finch, to compress the input context by leveraging the pre-trained model weights of the self-attention. Given a prompt and a long text, Finch iteratively identifies the most relevant Key (K) and Value (V) pairs over chunks of the text conditioned on the prompt. Only such pairs are stored in the KV cache, which, within the space constrained by the context window, ultimately contains a compressed version of the long text. Our proposal enables models to consume large inputs even with high compression (up to 93x) while preserving semantic integrity without the need for fine-tuning.

### Value-based Proactive Caching for Sensing Data in Internet of Vehicles
**Authors**: Yantong Wang, Ke Liu, Hui Ji, Jiande Sun

**Updated**: 2024-08-12T08:46:30Z

**Summary**: Sensing data (SD) plays an important role in safe-related applications for Internet of Vehicles. Proactively caching required sensing data (SD) is a pivotal strategy for alleviating network congestion and improving data accessibility. Despite merits, existing studies predominantly address SD caching within a single time slot, which may not be scalable to scenarios involving multi-slots. Furthermore, the oversight of service capacity at caching nodes could lead to significant queuing delays in SD reception. To tackle these limitations, we jointly consider the problem of anchoring caching placement and requests allocation for SD. A value model incorporating both temporal and spacial characteristics is first proposed to estimate the significance of different caching decisions. Subsequently, a stochastic integer nonlinear programming model is provided to optimize the long-term system performance, which is converted into a series of online optimization problem by leveraging the Lyapunov method and linearized via introducing auxiliary variables. To expedite the solution, we provide a binary quantum particle swarm optimization based algorithm with quadratic time complexity. Numerical investigations demonstrate the superiority of proposed algorithms compared with other schemes in terms of energy consumption, response latency, and cache-hit ratio.

**Authors**: Riccardo Tedeschi, Luca Valente, Gianmarco Ottavi, Enrico Zelioli, Nils Wistoff, Massimiliano Giacometti, Abdul Basit Sajjad, Luca Benini, Davide Rossi

**Updated**: 2024-08-12T07:47:28Z

**Summary**: Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) based on cache coherency is crucial for high-end embedded systems like automotive applications. RISC-V is gaining traction, and open-source hardware (OSH) platforms offer solutions to issues such as IP costs and vendor dependency. Existing multi-core cache-coherent RISC-V platforms are complex and not efficient for small embedded core clusters. We propose an open-source SystemVerilog implementation of a lightweight snoop-based cache-coherent cluster of Linux-capable CVA6 cores. Our design uses the MOESI protocol via the Arm's AMBA ACE protocol. Evaluated with Splash-3 benchmarks, our solution shows up to 32.87% faster performance in a dual-core setup and an average improvement of 15.8% over OpenPiton. Synthesized using GF 22nm FDSOI technology, the Cache Coherency Unit occupies only 1.6% of the system area.

### Correct Wrong Path

**Updated**: 2024-08-12T03:53:51Z

**Summary**: Modern OOO CPUs have very deep pipelines with large branch misprediction recovery penalties. Speculatively executed instructions on the wrong path can significantly change cache state, depending on speculation levels. Architects often employ trace-driven simulation models in the design exploration stage, which sacrifice precision for speed. Trace-driven simulators are orders of magnitude faster than execution-driven models, reducing the often hundreds of thousands of simulation hours needed to explore new micro-architectural ideas. Despite this strong benefit of trace-driven simulation, these often fail to adequately model the consequences of wrong path because obtaining them is nontrivial. Prior works consider either a positive or negative impact of wrong path but not both. Here, we examine wrong path execution in simulation results and design a set of infrastructure for enabling wrong-path execution in a trace driven simulator. Our analysis shows the wrong path affects structures on both the instruction and data sides extensively, resulting in performance variations ranging from $-3.05$\% to $20.9$\% when ignoring wrong path. To benefit the research community and enhance the accuracy of simulators, we opened our traces and tracing utility in the hopes that industry can provide wrong-path traces generated by their internal simulators, enabling academic simulation without exposing industry IP.

### Hierarchical Coded Caching with Low Subpacketization and Coding Delay
**Authors**: Rashid Ummer N. T., B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2024-08-11T16:35:10Z

**Summary**: Coded caching scheme originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) considered a broadcast network consisting of a single server connected to a set of users each having a cache memory. Motivated by practical scenarios, Karamchandani \textit{et al.} in [16] proposed a coded caching scheme for a two-layer hierarchical network consisting of a single server connected to multiple mirror sites and each mirror site connected to a distinct set of users, in which both mirror sites and users having cache memories. Low subpacketization level coded caching schemes are desirable for practical implementations. Placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed as a tool to design coded caching schemes with reduced subpacketization level by Yan \textit{et al.} in [4]. Schemes with reduced subpacketization levels are studied extensively in the literature for single-layer networks. Kong \textit{et al.} in [17] proposed a structure called hierarchical placement delivery arrays (HPDA), which characterizes a hierarchical coded caching system and also proposed a class of HPDAs that gives low subpacketization level schemes by using two PDAs. Low subpacketization level hierarchical schemes using combinatorial $t$-designs is proposed in [20]. Apart from that there is no other existing work that discusses the subpacketization problem in a hierarchical network. This paper proposes a class of HPDA construction that gives low subpacketization level hierarchical coded caching schemes, by first constructing a new class of PDAs. Compared with the existing schemes, in cases where the system parameters and subpacketization level are the same, the proposed hierarchical scheme has a better coding delay. Further, the new class of PDAs constructed either subsumes several known PDA constructions or achieves better transmission load for the same system parameters.

### Genie: Smart ROS-based Caching for Connected Autonomous Robots
**Authors**: Zexin Li, Soroush Bateni, Cong Liu

**Updated**: 2024-08-11T08:07:28Z

**Summary**: Despite the promising future of autonomous robots, several key issues currently remain that can lead to compromised performance and safety. One such issue is latency, where we find that even the latest embedded platforms from NVIDIA fail to execute intelligence tasks (e.g., object detection) of autonomous vehicles in a real-time fashion. One remedy to this problem is the promising paradigm of edge computing. Through collaboration with our industry partner, we identify key prohibitive limitations of the current edge mindset: (1) servers are not distributed enough and thus, are not close enough to vehicles, (2) current proposed edge solutions do not provide substantially better performance and extra information specific to autonomous vehicles to warrant their cost to the user, and (3) the state-of-the-art solutions are not compatible with popular frameworks used in autonomous systems, particularly the Robot Operating System (ROS).   To remedy these issues, we provide Genie, an encapsulation technique that can enable transparent caching in ROS in a non-intrusive way (i.e., without modifying the source code), can build the cache in a distributed manner (in contrast to traditional central caching methods), and can construct a collective three-dimensional object map to provide substantially better latency (even on low-power edge servers) and higher quality data to all vehicles in a certain locality. We fully implement our design on state-of-the-art industry-adopted embedded and edge platforms, using the prominent autonomous driving software Autoware, and find that Genie can enhance the latency of Autoware Vision Detector by 82% on average, enable object reusability 31% of the time on average and as much as 67% for the incoming requests, and boost the confidence in its object map considerably over time.

### Eigen Attention: Attention in Low-Rank Space for KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Utkarsh Saxena, Gobinda Saha, Sakshi Choudhary, Kaushik Roy

**Updated**: 2024-08-10T22:47:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the domain of natural language processing due to their impressive reasoning abilities. Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the context lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex tasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new bottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen Attention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby reducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we demonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache sizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop in performance.

### ICGMM: CXL-enabled Memory Expansion with Intelligent Caching Using   Gaussian Mixture Model
**Authors**: Hanqiu Chen, Yitu Wang, Luis Vitorio Cargnini, Mohammadreza Soltaniyeh, Dongyang Li, Gongjin Sun, Pradeep Subedi, Andrew Chang, Yiran Chen, Cong Hao

**Updated**: 2024-08-10T19:17:46Z

**Summary**: Compute Express Link (CXL) emerges as a solution for wide gap between computational speed and data communication rates among host and multiple devices. It fosters a unified and coherent memory space between host and CXL storage devices such as such as Solid-state drive (SSD) for memory expansion, with a corresponding DRAM implemented as the device cache. However, this introduces challenges such as substantial cache miss penalties, sub-optimal caching due to data access granularity mismatch between the DRAM "cache" and SSD "memory", and inefficient hardware cache management. To address these issues, we propose a novel solution, named ICGMM, which optimizes caching and eviction directly on hardware, employing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based approach. We prototype our solution on an FPGA board, which demonstrates a noteworthy improvement compared to the classic Least Recently Used (LRU) cache strategy. We observe a decrease in the cache miss rate ranging from 0.32% to 6.14%, leading to a substantial 16.23% to 39.14% reduction in the average SSD access latency. Furthermore, when compared to the state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based cache policies, our GMM algorithm on FPGA showcases an impressive latency reduction of over 10,000 times. Remarkably, this is achieved while demanding much fewer hardware resources.

### Time-resolved measurement of neutron energy isotropy in a   sheared-flow-stabilized Z pinch
**Authors**: R. A. Ryan, P. E. Tsai, A. R. Johansen, A. Youmans, D. P. Higginson, J. M. Mitrani, C. S. Adams, D. A. Sutherland, B. Levitt, U. Shumlak

**Updated**: 2024-08-09T16:48:01Z

**Summary**: Previous measurements of neutron energy using fast plastic scintillators while operating the Fusion Z Pinch Experiment (FuZE) constrained the energy of any yield-producing deuteron beams to less than $4.65 keV$. FuZE has since been operated at increasingly higher input power, resulting in increased plasma current and larger fusion neutron yields. A detailed experimental study of the neutron energy isotropy in these regimes applies more stringent limits to possible contributions from beam-target fusion. The FuZE device operated at $-25~kV$ charge voltage has resulted in average plasma currents of $370~kA$ and D-D fusion neutron yields of $4\times10^7$ neutrons per discharge. Measurements of the neutron energy isotropy under these operating conditions demonstrates the energy of deuteron beams is less than $7.4 \pm 5.6^\mathrm{(stat)} \pm 3.7^\mathrm{(syst)}~keV$. Characterization of the detector response has reduced the number of free parameters in the fit of the neutron energy distribution, improving the confidence in the forward-fit method. Gamma backgrounds have been measured and the impact of these contributions on the isotropy results have been studied. Additionally, a time dependent measurement of the isotropy has been resolved for the first time, indicating increases to possible deuteron beam energies at late times. This suggests the possible growth of $m$=0 instabilities at the end of the main radiation event but confirms that the majority of the neutron production exhibits isotropy consistent with thermonuclear origin.

### NACL: A General and Effective KV Cache Eviction Framework for LLMs at   Inference Time
**Authors**: Yilong Chen, Guoxia Wang, Junyuan Shang, Shiyao Cui, Zhenyu Zhang, Tingwen Liu, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun, Dianhai Yu, Hua Wu

**Updated**: 2024-08-08T01:20:13Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ignited an innovative surge of AI applications, marking a new era of exciting possibilities equipped with extended context windows. However, hosting these models is cost-prohibitive mainly due to the extensive memory consumption of KV Cache involving long-context modeling. Despite several works proposing to evict unnecessary tokens from the KV Cache, most of them rely on the biased local statistics of accumulated attention scores and report performance using unconvincing metric like perplexity on inadequate short-text evaluation. In this paper, we propose NACL, a general framework for long-context KV cache eviction that achieves more optimal and efficient eviction in a single operation during the encoding phase. Due to NACL's efficiency, we combine more accurate attention score statistics in PROXY TOKENS EVICTION with the diversified random eviction strategy of RANDOM EVICTION, aiming to alleviate the issue of attention bias and enhance the robustness in maintaining pivotal tokens for long-context modeling tasks. Notably, our method significantly improves the performance on short- and long-text tasks by 80% and 76% respectively, reducing KV Cache by up to 50% with over 95% performance maintenance.

**Authors**: Yao Zhao, Youyang Qu, Yong Xiang, Md Palash Uddin, Dezhong Peng, Longxiang Gao

**Updated**: 2024-08-07T23:48:59Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in edge computing~(EC) have pushed cloud-based data caching services to edge, however, such emerging edge storage comes with numerous challenging and unique security issues. One of them is the problem of edge data integrity verification (EDIV) which coordinates multiple participants (e.g., data owners and edge nodes) to inspect whether data cached on edge is authentic. To date, various solutions have been proposed to address the EDIV problem, while there is no systematic review. Thus, we offer a comprehensive survey for the first time, aiming to show current research status, open problems, and potentially promising insights for readers to further investigate this under-explored field. Specifically, we begin by stating the significance of the EDIV problem, the integrity verification difference between data cached on cloud and edge, and three typical system models with corresponding inspection processes. To thoroughly assess prior research efforts, we synthesize a universal criteria framework that an effective verification approach should satisfy. On top of it, a schematic development timeline is developed to reveal the research advance on EDIV in a sequential manner, followed by a detailed review of the existing EDIV solutions. Finally, we highlight intriguing research challenges and possible directions for future work, along with a discussion on how forthcoming technology, e.g., machine learning and context-aware security, can augment security in EC. Given our findings, some major observations are: there is a noticeable trend to equip EDIV solutions with various functions and diversify study scenarios; completing EDIV within two types of participants (i.e., data owner and edge nodes) is garnering escalating interest among researchers; although the majority of existing methods rely on cryptography, emerging technology is being explored to handle the EDIV problem.

### Zero-Delay QKV Compression for Mitigating KV Cache and Network   Bottlenecks in LLM Inference
**Authors**: Zeyu Zhang, Haiying Shen

**Updated**: 2024-08-07T22:10:26Z

**Summary**: In large-language models, memory constraints in the key-value cache (KVC) pose a challenge during inference, especially with long prompts. In this work, we observed that compressing KV values is more effective than compressing the model regarding accuracy and job completion time (JCT). However, quantizing KV values and dropping less-important tokens incur significant runtime computational time overhead, delaying JCT. These methods also cannot reduce computation time or high network communication time overhead in sequence-parallelism (SP) frameworks for long prompts. To tackle these issues, based on our insightful observations from experimental analysis, we propose ZeroC, a Zero-delay QKV Compression system that eliminates time overhead and even reduces computation and communication time of the model operations. ZeroC innovatively embeds compression and decompression operations within model operations and adaptively determines compression ratios at a hybrid layer-token level. Further, it enables a communication-efficient SP inference framework. Trace-driven experiments demonstrate that ZeroC achieves up to 80% lower average JCT, 35% lower average perplexity, and 2.8x higher throughput with the same latency compared to state-of-the-art compression methods. ZeroC also reduces the average JCT of current LLM serving systems by up to 91% with the constraint of 0.1 perplexity increase. We open-sourced the code.

### Temporal Feature Matters: A Framework for Diffusion Model Quantization
**Authors**: Yushi Huang, Ruihao Gong, Xianglong Liu, Jing Liu, Yuhang Li, Jiwen Lu, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2024-08-07T20:43:10Z

**Summary**: The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant challenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference times and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising. Typically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are developed to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two maintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and hardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration..

### mucAI at WojoodNER 2024: Arabic Named Entity Recognition with Nearest   Neighbor Search
**Authors**: Ahmed Abdou, Tasneem Mohsen

**Updated**: 2024-08-07T09:34:55Z

**Summary**: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to identify and classify entities in text into predefined categories. However, when applied to Arabic data, NER encounters unique challenges stemming from the language's rich morphological inflections, absence of capitalization cues, and spelling variants, where a single word can comprise multiple morphemes. In this paper, we introduce Arabic KNN-NER, our submission to the Wojood NER Shared Task 2024 (ArabicNLP 2024). We have participated in the shared sub-task 1 Flat NER. In this shared sub-task, we tackle fine-grained flat-entity recognition for Arabic text, where we identify a single main entity and possibly zero or multiple sub-entities for each word. Arabic KNN-NER augments the probability distribution of a fine-tuned model with another label probability distribution derived from performing a KNN search over the cached training data. Our submission achieved 91% on the test set on the WojoodFine dataset, placing Arabic KNN-NER on top of the leaderboard for the shared task.

### LLMs as Probabilistic Minimally Adequate Teachers for DFA Learning
**Authors**: Lekai Chen, Ashutosh Trivedi, Alvaro Velasquez

**Updated**: 2024-08-06T07:12:09Z

**Summary**: The emergence of intelligence in large language models (LLMs) has inspired investigations into their integration into automata learning. This paper introduces the probabilistic Minimally Adequate Teacher (pMAT) formulation, which leverages a probabilistic oracle that could give persistent errors randomly during answering the membership queries for deterministic finite automata (DFA) learning. Given the tendency of LLMs to produce hallucinatory content, we have developed techniques to improve answer accuracy and ensure the correctness of the learned automata. We propose the $\mathtt{Discrimination}$ prompt as well as the $\mathtt{Verification}$ prompt and explore their advantages over common prompts. Additionally, we compare DFA learning performance between the TTT algorithm and common active learning algorithms. To address the exponential number of persistent errors, we implement a dynamic query cache refinement algorithm that identifies and corrects conflicting queries by combining the active and passive learning algorithms. The empirical results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach, providing a theoretical foundation for automata learning with LLMs in the loop.

### NVPC: A Transparent NVM Page Cache
**Authors**: Guoyu Wang, Xilong Che, Haoyang Wei, Shuo Chen, Puyi He, Juncheng Hu

**Updated**: 2024-08-06T02:51:22Z

**Summary**: Towards a compatible utilization of NVM, NVM-specialized kernel file systems and NVM-based disk file system accelerators have been proposed. However, these studies only focus on one or several characteristics of NVM, while failing to exploit its best practice by putting NVM in the proper position of the whole storage stack. In this paper, we present NVPC, a transparent acceleration to existing kernel file systems with an NVM-enhanced page cache. The acceleration lies in two aspects, respectively matching the desperate needs of existing disk file systems: sync writes and cache-missed operations. Besides, the fast DRAM page cache is preserved for cache-hit operations. For sync writes, a high-performance log-based sync absorbing area is provided to redirect data destination from the slow disk to the fast NVM. Meanwhile, the byte-addressable feature of NVM is used to prevent write amplification. For cache-missed operations, NVPC makes use of the idle space on NVM to extend the DRAM page cache, so that more and larger workloads can fit into the cache. NVPC is entirely implemented as a page cache, thus can provide efficient speed-up to disk file systems with full transparency to users and full compatibility to lower file systems.   In Filebench macro-benchmarks, NVPC achieves at most 3.55x, 2.84x, and 2.64x faster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS. In RocksDB workloads with working set larger than DRAM, NVPC achieves 1.12x, 2.59x, and 2.11x faster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS. Meanwhile, NVPC gains positive revenue from NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS in 62.5% of the tested cases in our read/write/sync mixed evaluation, demonstrating that NVPC is more balanced and adaptive to complex real-world workloads. Experimental results also show that NVPC is the only method that accelerates Ext-4 in particular cases for up to 15.19x, with no slow-down to any other use cases.

### Electron-beam-induced modification of gold microparticles in an SEM
**Authors**: Kristina Weinel, Marc Benjamin Hahn, Axel Lubk, Wen Feng, Ignacio Gonzalez Martinez, Bernd Büchner, Leonardo Agudo Jácome

**Updated**: 2024-08-05T12:09:50Z

**Summary**: Electron-beam-induced conversion of materials in a transmission electron microscope uses the high power density of a localized electron beam of acceleration voltages above 100 kV as an energy source to transform matter at the sub-micron scale. Here, the e-beam-induced transformation of precursor microparticles employing a low-energy e-beam with an acceleration voltage of 30 kV in a scanning electron microscope is developed to increase the versatility and efficiency of the technique. Under these conditions, the technique can be classified between e-beam lithography, where the e-beam is used to mill holes in or grow some different material onto a substrate, and e-beam welding, where matter can be welded together when overcoming the melting phase. Modifying gold microparticles on an amorphous SiOx substrate reveals the dominant role of inelastic electron-matter interaction and subsequent localized heating for the observed melting and vaporization of the precursor microparticles under the electron beam. Monte-Carlo scattering simulations and thermodynamic modeling further support the findings.

### SLO-aware GPU Frequency Scaling for Energy Efficient LLM Inference   Serving
**Authors**: Andreas Kosmas Kakolyris, Dimosthenis Masouros, Petros Vavaroutsos, Sotirios Xydis, Dimitrios Soudris

**Updated**: 2024-08-05T09:07:06Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction, their reliance on power-hungry GPUs places ever-increasing energy demands, raising environmental and monetary concerns. Inference dominates LLM workloads, presenting a critical challenge for providers: minimizing energy costs under Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) that ensure optimal user experience. In this paper, we present \textit{throttLL'eM}, a framework that reduces energy consumption while meeting SLOs through the use of instance and GPU frequency scaling. \textit{throttLL'eM} features mechanisms that project future KV cache usage and batch size. Leveraging a Machine-Learning (ML) model that receives these projections as inputs, \textit{throttLL'eM} manages performance at the iteration level to satisfy SLOs with reduced frequencies and instance sizes. We show that the proposed ML model achieves $R^2$ scores greater than 0.97 and miss-predicts performance by less than 1 iteration per second on average. Experimental results on LLM inference traces show that \textit{throttLL'eM} achieves up to 43.8\% lower energy consumption and an energy efficiency improvement of at least $1.71\times$ under SLOs, when compared to NVIDIA's Triton server.

### TriForce: Lossless Acceleration of Long Sequence Generation with   Hierarchical Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Hanshi Sun, Zhuoming Chen, Xinyu Yang, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-04T00:58:04Z

**Summary**: With large language models (LLMs) widely deployed in long content generation recently, there has emerged an increasing demand for efficient long-sequence inference support. However, key-value (KV) cache, which is stored to avoid re-computation, has emerged as a critical bottleneck by growing linearly in size with the sequence length. Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the entire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low utilization of computational cores and high latency. While various compression methods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer from degradation in generation quality. We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical speculative decoding system that is scalable for long sequence generation. This approach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via retrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the hierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting latency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K, achieving up to 2.31$\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in handling even longer contexts. For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs, TriForce achieves 0.108s/token$\unicode{x2014}$only half as slow as the auto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\times$ on our optimized offloading system. Additionally, TriForce performs 4.86$\times$ than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference on a single RTX 4090 GPU. TriForce's robustness is highlighted by its consistently outstanding performance across various temperatures. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/TriForce.

### Cross-layer Attention Sharing for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yongyu Mu, Yuzhang Wu, Yuchun Fan, Chenglong Wang, Hengyu Li, Qiaozhi He, Murun Yang, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-08-04T00:38:34Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) evolve, the increase in model depth and parameter number leads to substantial redundancy. To enhance the efficiency of the attention mechanism, previous works primarily compress the KV cache or group attention heads, while largely overlooking redundancy between layers. Our comprehensive analyses across various LLMs show that highly similar attention patterns persist within most layers. It's intuitive to save the computation by sharing attention weights across layers. However, further analysis reveals two challenges: (1) Directly sharing the weight matrix without carefully rearranging the attention heads proves to be ineffective; (2) Shallow layers are vulnerable to small deviations in attention weights. Driven by these insights, we introduce LiSA, a lightweight substitute for self-attention in well-trained LLMs. LiSA employs tiny feed-forward networks to align attention heads between adjacent layers and low-rank matrices to approximate differences in layer-wise attention weights. Evaluations encompassing 13 typical benchmarks demonstrate that LiSA maintains high response quality in terms of accuracy and perplexity while reducing redundant attention calculations within 53-84% of the total layers. Our implementations of LiSA achieve a 6X compression of Q and K, with maximum throughput improvements of 19.5% for LLaMA3-8B and 32.3% for LLaMA2-7B.

### Multi-Material Decomposition Using Spectral Diffusion Posterior Sampling
**Authors**: Xiao Jiang, Grace J. Gang, J. Webster Stayman

**Updated**: 2024-08-02T18:25:57Z

**Summary**: Many spectral CT applications require accurate material decomposition. Existing material decomposition algorithms are often susceptible to significant noise magnification or, in the case of one-step model-based approaches, hampered by slow convergence rates and large computational requirements. In this work, we proposed a novel framework - spectral diffusion posterior sampling (spectral DPS) - for one-step reconstruction and multi-material decomposition, which combines sophisticated prior information captured by one-time unsupervised learning and an arbitrary analytic physical system model. Spectral DPS is built upon a general DPS framework for nonlinear inverse problems. Several strategies developed in previous work, including jumpstart sampling, Jacobian approximation, and multi-step likelihood updates are applied facilitate stable and accurate decompositions. The effectiveness of spectral DPS was evaluated on a simulated dual-layer and a kV-switching spectral system as well as on a physical cone-beam CT (CBCT) test bench. In simulation studies, spectral DPS improved PSNR by 27.49% to 71.93% over baseline DPS and by 26.53% to 57.30% over MBMD, depending on the the region of interest. In physical phantom study, spectral DPS achieved a <1% error in estimating the mean density in a homogeneous region. Compared with baseline DPS, spectral DPS effectively avoided generating false structures in the homogeneous phantom and reduced the variability around edges. Both simulation and physical phantom studies demonstrated the superior performance of spectral DPS for stable and accurate material decomposition.

### Search-in-Memory (SiM): Reliable, Versatile, and Efficient Data Matching   in SSD's NAND Flash Memory Chip for Data Indexing Acceleration
**Authors**: Yun-Chih Chen, Yuan-Hao Chang, Tei-Wei Kuo

**Updated**: 2024-08-02T07:37:51Z

**Summary**: To index the increasing volume of data, modern data indexes are typically stored on SSDs and cached in DRAM. However, searching such an index has resulted in significant I/O traffic due to limited access locality and inefficient cache utilization. At the heart of index searching is the operation of filtering through vast data spans to isolate a small, relevant subset, which involves basic equality tests rather than the complex arithmetic provided by modern CPUs. This paper introduces the Search-in-Memory (SiM) chip, which demonstrates the feasibility of performing data filtering directly within a NAND flash memory chip, transmitting only relevant search results rather than complete pages. Instead of adding complex circuits, we propose repurposing existing circuitry for efficient and accurate bitwise parallel matching. We demonstrate how different data structures can use our flexible SIMD command interface to offload index searches. This strategy not only frees up the CPU for more computationally demanding tasks, but it also optimizes DRAM usage for write buffering, significantly lowering energy consumption associated with I/O transmission between the CPU and DRAM. Extensive testing across a wide range of workloads reveals up to a 9X speedup in write-heavy workloads and up to 45% energy savings due to reduced read and write I/O. Furthermore, we achieve significant reductions in median and tail read latencies of up to 89% and 85% respectively.

### Caching Aided Multi-Tenant Serverless Computing
**Authors**: Chu Qiao, Cong Wang, Zhenkai Zhang, Yuede Ji, Xing Gao

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T23:52:43Z

**Summary**: One key to enabling high-performance serverless computing is to mitigate cold-starts. Current solutions utilize a warm pool to keep function alive: a warm-start can be analogous to a CPU cache-hit. However, modern cache has multiple hierarchies and the last-level cache is shared among cores, whereas the warm pool is limited to a single tenant for security concerns. Also, the warm pool keep-alive policy can be further optimized using cache replacement algorithms. In this paper, we borrow practical optimizations from caching, and design FaasCamp, a caching-aided multi-tenant serverless computing framework. FaasCamp extends the single-tier warm pool into multi-tiers, with a reclaim pool introduced enabling secure function instance sharing among tenants. Also, FaasCamp leverages machine learning to approximate the optimal cache replacement policy to improve the warm rate. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments under multiple scenarios. The results show that FaasCamp can outperform existing platforms with minimal overhead.

### Do language models plan ahead for future tokens?
**Authors**: Wilson Wu, John X. Morris, Lionel Levine

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T21:21:28Z

**Summary**: Do transformers "think ahead" during inference at a given position? It is known transformers prepare information in the hidden states of the forward pass at time step $t$ that is then used in future forward passes $t+\tau$. We posit two explanations for this phenomenon: pre-caching, in which off-diagonal gradient terms present during training result in the model computing features at $t$ irrelevant to the present inference task but useful for the future, and breadcrumbs, in which features most relevant to time step $t$ are already the same as those that would most benefit inference at time $t+\tau$. We test these hypotheses by training language models without propagating gradients to past timesteps, a scheme we formalize as myopic training. In a constructed synthetic data setting, we find clear evidence for pre-caching. In the autoregressive language modeling setting, our experiments are more suggestive of the breadcrumbs hypothesis, though pre-caching increases with model scale.

### Intermittent Semi-working Mask: A New Masking Paradigm for LLMs
**Authors**: Mingcong Lu, Jiangcai Zhu, Wang Hao, Zheng Li, Shusheng Zhang, Kailai Shao, Chao Chen, Nan Li, Feng Wang, Xin Lu

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T13:22:01Z

**Summary**: Multi-turn dialogues are a key interaction method between humans and Large Language Models (LLMs), as conversations extend over multiple rounds, keeping LLMs' high generation quality and low latency is a challenge. Mainstream LLMs can be grouped into two categories based on masking strategy: causal LLM and prefix LLM. Several works have demonstrated that prefix LLMs tend to outperform causal ones in scenarios that heavily depend on historical context such as multi-turn dialogues or in-context learning, thanks to their bidirectional attention on prefix sequences. However, prefix LLMs have an inherent inefficient training problem in multi-turn dialogue datasets. In addition, the attention mechanism of prefix LLM makes it unable to reuse Key-Value Cache (KV Cache) across dialogue rounds to reduce generation latency. In this paper, we propose a novel masking scheme called Intermittent Semi-working Mask (ISM) to address these problems. Specifically, we apply alternate bidirectional and unidirectional attention on queries and answers in the dialogue history. In this way, ISM is able to maintain the high quality of prefix LLM and low generation latency of causal LLM, simultaneously. Extensive experiments illustrate that our ISM achieves significant performance.

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T13:21:24Z

**Summary**: This paper presents MoE-Infinity, an offloading-efficient serving system for sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. To optimize offloading, MoE-Infinity achieves novel request-level tracing for expert activation, capturing MoE's sparse execution patterns such as selective activation, group activation, and skewed reuse. Leveraging the request-level trace, MoE-Infinity performs effective expert prefetching and expert caching, achieving high efficiency in transferring model parameters from host memory to GPU memory. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-Infinity achieves low latency comparable to expensive full-GPU deployments, which require up to 4X more GPU resources than MoE-Infinity. Compared to offloading-supporting LLM serving systems such as DeepSpeed-Inference, Llama.cpp, Mixtral Offloading, and BrainStorm, MoE-Infinity exhibits superior latency performance, providing 2-20X improvements when serving various MoE models for a large collection of LLM tasks.

### ChunkAttention: Efficient Self-Attention with Prefix-Aware KV Cache and   Two-Phase Partition
**Authors**: Lu Ye, Ze Tao, Yong Huang, Yang Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T07:51:25Z

**Summary**: Self-attention is an essential component of large language models (LLM) but a significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant LLM serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8$\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096.

### CDFGNN: a Systematic Design of Cache-based Distributed Full-Batch Graph   Neural Network Training with Communication Reduction
**Authors**: Shuai Zhang, Zite Jiang, Haihang You

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T01:57:09Z

**Summary**: Graph neural network training is mainly categorized into mini-batch and full-batch training methods. The mini-batch training method samples subgraphs from the original graph in each iteration. This sampling operation introduces extra computation overhead and reduces the training accuracy. Meanwhile, the full-batch training method calculates the features and corresponding gradients of all vertices in each iteration, and therefore has higher convergence accuracy. However, in the distributed cluster, frequent remote accesses of vertex features and gradients lead to huge communication overhead, thus restricting the overall training efficiency.   In this paper, we introduce the cached-based distributed full-batch graph neural network training framework (CDFGNN). We propose the adaptive cache mechanism to reduce the remote vertex access by caching the historical features and gradients of neighbor vertices. Besides, we further optimize the communication overhead by quantifying the messages and designing the graph partition algorithm for the hierarchical communication architecture. Experiments show that the adaptive cache mechanism reduces remote vertex accesses by 63.14% on average. Combined with communication quantization and hierarchical GP algorithm, CDFGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed full-batch training frameworks by 30.39% in our experiments. Our results indicate that CDFGNN has great potential in accelerating distributed full-batch GNN training tasks.

### Towards Variable-Length In-Network Caching
**Authors**: Gyuyeong Kim

**Updated**: 2024-08-01T00:41:52Z

**Summary**: We present StarCache, a new in-network caching architecture that can cache variable-length items to balance a wide range of key-value workloads. Unlike existing works, StarCache does not cache hot items in the switch memory. Instead, we make hot items revisit the switch data plane continuously by exploiting packet recirculation. Our approach keeps cached key-value pairs in the switch data plane while freeing them from item size limitations caused by hardware constraints. We implement a StarCache prototype on an Intel Tofino switch. Our experimental results show that StarCache can balance highly skewed workloads with various key and value sizes.

### A2SF: Accumulative Attention Scoring with Forgetting Factor for Token   Pruning in Transformer Decoder
**Authors**: Hyun-rae Jo, Dongkun Shin

**Updated**: 2024-07-31T02:02:40Z

**Summary**: Recently, large language models (LLM) based on transformers are facing memory bottleneck issues due to KV cache, especially in long sequence handling. Previous researches proposed KV cache compression techniques that identify insignificant tokens based on Accumulative Attention Scores and removes their items from KV cache, noting that only few tokens play an important role in attention operations. However, we have observed that the existing Accumulative Attention Score is not suitable for the transformer decoder structure. In the decoder model, the number of times the Attention Score accumulates varies depending on the order of token appearance due to the effect of masking, causing an uneven comparison between tokens. To solve this, we propose Accumulative Attention Score with Forgetting Factor (A2SF) technique, which introduces a Forgetting Factor in the Attention Score accumulation process. A2SF applies a penalty to the past Attention Score generated from old tokens by repeatedly multiplying the Forgetting Factor to the Attention Score over time. Therefore, older tokens receive a larger penalty, providing fairness among different ages of tokens. Through the fair comparison among tokens, we can more effectively select important tokens. We have verified the accuracy improvement through A2SF in the OPT and LLaMA models and A2SF improves the accuracy of LLaMA 2 by up to 7.8% and 5.1% on 1-shot and 0-shot.

**Updated**: 2024-07-30T21:27:00Z

**Summary**: The possibility of electric field control of magnetocaloric effect through quasi-isostatic compression as a result of the converse piezoelectric effect was demonstrated on cylindrical type magnetoelectric composite MnAs/PZT. It was shown that an electric voltage of 100 V corresponding to an electric field of E ~0.3 kV/mm applied to the walls of the piezoelectric component PZT of the MnAs/PZT composite contributes to an increase in the maximum adiabatic temperature change by 0.2 K in the temperature range of the magnetostructural phase transition of MnAs ~317 K at magnetic field change of 1.8 T. Calculations using the finite element method have shown that an electric field voltage of 100 V is capable of creating a quasi-isostatic mechanical stress in the region inside a cylindrical PZT tube of ~3 MPa. Moreover, in the region of weak pressures up to 10 MPa, the contribution to the MCE from piezo compression linearly depends on the electrical voltage that can be used for control the MCE

 ### Evaluating Multiview Object Consistency in Humans and Image Models
**Authors**: Tyler Bonnen, Stephanie Fu, Yutong Bai, Thomas O'Connell, Yoni Friedman, Nancy Kanwisher, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Alexei A. Efros

**Updated**: 2024-09-10T02:28:40Z

**Summary**: We introduce a benchmark to directly evaluate the alignment between human observers and vision models on a 3D shape inference task. We leverage an experimental design from the cognitive sciences which requires zero-shot visual inferences about object shape: given a set of images, participants identify which contain the same/different objects, despite considerable viewpoint variation. We draw from a diverse range of images that include common objects (e.g., chairs) as well as abstract shapes (i.e., procedurally generated `nonsense' objects). After constructing over 2000 unique image sets, we administer these tasks to human participants, collecting 35K trials of behavioral data from over 500 participants. This includes explicit choice behaviors as well as intermediate measures, such as reaction time and gaze data. We then evaluate the performance of common vision models (e.g., DINOv2, MAE, CLIP). We find that humans outperform all models by a wide margin. Using a multi-scale evaluation approach, we identify underlying similarities and differences between models and humans: while human-model performance is correlated, humans allocate more time/processing on challenging trials. All images, data, and code can be accessed via our project page.

### Using Natural Language Explanations to Rescale Human Judgments
**Authors**: Manya Wadhwa, Jifan Chen, Junyi Jessy Li, Greg Durrett

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T17:37:16Z

**Summary**: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has brought a critical need for high-quality human-labeled data, particularly for processes like human feedback and evaluation. A common practice is to label data via consensus annotation over human judgments. However, annotators' judgments for subjective tasks can differ in many ways: they may reflect different qualitative judgments about an example, and they may be mapped to a labeling scheme in different ways. We show that these nuances can be captured by natural language explanations, and propose a method to rescale ordinal annotations and explanations using LLMs. Specifically, we feed annotators' Likert ratings and corresponding explanations into an LLM and prompt it to produce a numeric score anchored in a scoring rubric. These scores should reflect the annotators' underlying assessments of the example. The rubric can be designed or modified after annotation, and include distinctions that may not have been known when the original error taxonomy was devised. We explore our technique in the context of rating system outputs for a document-grounded question answering task, where LLMs achieve near-human performance. Our method rescales the raw judgments without impacting agreement and brings the scores closer to human judgments grounded in the same scoring rubric.

### Are Large Language Models a Threat to Programming Platforms? An   Exploratory Study
**Authors**: Md Mustakim Billah, Palash Ranjan Roy, Zadia Codabux, Banani Roy

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T17:30:20Z

**Summary**: Competitive programming platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank evaluate programming skills, often used by recruiters for screening. With the rise of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Meta AI, their problem-solving ability on these platforms needs assessment. This study explores LLMs' ability to tackle diverse programming challenges across platforms with varying difficulty, offering insights into their real-time and offline performance and comparing them with human programmers.   We tested 98 problems from LeetCode, 126 from Codeforces, covering 15 categories. Nine online contests from Codeforces and LeetCode were conducted, along with two certification tests on HackerRank, to assess real-time performance. Prompts and feedback mechanisms were used to guide LLMs, and correlations were explored across different scenarios.   LLMs, like ChatGPT (71.43% success on LeetCode), excelled in LeetCode and HackerRank certifications but struggled in virtual contests, particularly on Codeforces. They performed better than users in LeetCode archives, excelling in time and memory efficiency but underperforming in harder Codeforces contests. While not immediately threatening, LLMs performance on these platforms is concerning, and future improvements will need addressing.

### Improving Pretraining Data Using Perplexity Correlations
**Authors**: Tristan Thrush, Christopher Potts, Tatsunori Hashimoto

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T17:23:29Z

**Summary**: Quality pretraining data is often seen as the key to high-performance language models. However, progress in understanding pretraining data has been slow due to the costly pretraining runs required for data selection experiments. We present a framework that avoids these costs and selects high-quality pretraining data without any LLM training of our own. Our work is based on a simple observation: LLM losses on many pretraining texts are correlated with downstream benchmark performance, and selecting high-correlation documents is an effective pretraining data selection method. We build a new statistical framework for data selection centered around estimates of perplexity-benchmark correlations and perform data selection using a sample of 90 LLMs taken from the Open LLM Leaderboard on texts from tens of thousands of web domains. In controlled pretraining experiments at the 160M parameter scale on 8 benchmarks, our approach outperforms DSIR on every benchmark, while matching the best data selector found in DataComp-LM, a hand-engineered bigram classifier.

### Benchmarking Chinese Knowledge Rectification in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Tianhe Lu, Jizhan Fang, Yunzhi Yao, Xin Xu, Ningyu Zhang, Huajun Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T17:11:51Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities, they are not without flaws, particularly in the form of hallucinations. This issue is even more pronounced when LLMs are applied to specific languages and domains. For example, LLMs may generate nonsense information when handling Chinese ancient poetry, proverbs, or idioms, owing to the lack of specific knowledge. To this end, this paper introduces a benchmark for rectifying Chinese knowledge in LLMs via knowledge editing. Specifically, we introduce a new Chinese dataset, CKnowEdit, by collecting seven type of knowledge from various sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, thereby accounting for the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical constructs inherent in the Chinese language. Through the analysis of this dataset, we uncover the challenges faced by current LLMs in mastering Chinese. Furthermore, our evaluation of state-of-the-art knowledge editing techniques on this dataset unveil the substantial scope for advancement in the rectification of Chinese knowledge. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.

### Uncertainty Quantification under Noisy Constraints, with Applications to   Raking
**Authors**: Ariane Ducellier, Alexander Hsu, Parkes Kendrick, Bill Gustafson, Laura Dwyer-Lindgren, Christopher Murray, Peng Zheng, Aleksandr Aravkin

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T17:08:47Z

**Summary**: We consider statistical inference problems under uncertain equality constraints, and provide asymptotically valid uncertainty estimates for inferred parameters. The proposed approach leverages the implicit function theorem and primal-dual optimality conditions for a particular problem class. The motivating application is multi-dimensional raking, where observations are adjusted to match marginals; for example, adjusting estimated deaths across race, county, and cause in order to match state all-race all-cause totals. We review raking from a convex optimization perspective, providing explicit primal-dual formulations, algorithms, and optimality conditions for a wide array of raking applications, which are then leveraged to obtain the uncertainty estimates. Empirical results show that the approach obtains, at the cost of a single solve, nearly the same uncertainty estimates as computationally intensive Monte Carlo techniques that pass thousands of observed and of marginal draws through the entire raking process.

### Environmental dependence on galaxy-halo connections for satellites using   HSC weak lensing
**Authors**: Amit Kumar, Surhud More

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T17:00:53Z

**Summary**: We present the luminosity-halo mass relations of satellite (sLHMRs) galaxies in the SDSS redMaPPer cluster catalogue and the effects of the dense cluster environment on subhalo mass evolution. We use data from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey Year-3 catalogue of galaxy shapes to measure the weak lensing signal around these satellites. This signal serves as a probe of the matter distribution around the satellites, thereby providing the masses of their associated subhalos. We bin our satellites based on physical observable quantities such as their luminosity or the host cluster's richness, combined with their cluster-centric radial separations. Our results indicate that although more luminous satellites tend to reside in more massive halos, the sLHMRs depend on the distance of the satellite from the cluster centre. Subhalos near the cluster centre (within $<0.3 h^{-1}Mpc$) are stripped of mass. Consequently, the ratio of subhalo mass to luminosity decreases near the cluster centre. For low luminosity galaxies ($L < 10^{10} h^{-2}L_{\odot}$), the lack of evidence of increasing subhalo masses with luminosity shows the impact of tidal stripping. We also present stellar-to-subhalo mass relations (sSHMRs) for our satellite sample evolving at different cluster-centric separations. Inferred sSHMRs in the outer radial bin appear to match that observed for the field galaxies. We show that the sSHMRs from the mock-redMaPPer run on galaxy catalogues generated by the empirical UniverseMachine galaxy formation model are in good agreement with our observational results. Satellites, when binned based on the host cluster's richness, show very little dependence of the subhalo mass on the richness.

### Weak-instrument-robust subvector inference in instrumental variables   regression: A subvector Lagrange multiplier test and properties of subvector   Anderson-Rubin confidence sets
**Authors**: Malte Londschien, Peter Bühlmann

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T16:42:22Z

**Summary**: We propose a weak-instrument-robust subvector Lagrange multiplier test for instrumental variables regression. We show that it is asymptotically size-correct under a technical condition. This is the first weak-instrument-robust subvector test for instrumental variables regression to recover the degrees of freedom of the commonly used non-weak-instrument-robust Wald test. Additionally, we provide a closed-form solution for subvector confidence sets obtained by inverting the subvector Anderson-Rubin test. We show that they are centered around a k-class estimator. Also, we show that the subvector confidence sets for single coefficients of the causal parameter are jointly bounded if and only if Anderson's likelihood-ratio test rejects the hypothesis that the first-stage regression parameter is of reduced rank, that is, that the causal parameter is not identified. Finally, we show that if a confidence set obtained by inverting the Anderson-Rubin test is bounded and nonempty, it is equal to a Wald-based confidence set with a data-dependent confidence level. We explicitly compute this Wald-based confidence test.

### Instruct-SkillMix: A Powerful Pipeline for LLM Instruction Tuning
**Authors**: Simran Kaur, Simon Park, Anirudh Goyal, Sanjeev Arora

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T16:41:36Z

**Summary**: We introduce Instruct-SkillMix, an automated approach for creating diverse, high quality SFT data. The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline involves two stages, each leveraging an existing powerful LLM: (1) Skill extraction: uses the LLM to extract core "skills" for instruction-following, either from existing datasets, or by directly prompting the model; (2) Data generation: uses the powerful LLM to generate (instruction, response) data that exhibit a randomly chosen pair of these skills. Here, the use of random skill combinations promotes diversity and difficulty.   Vanilla SFT (i.e., no PPO, DPO, or RL methods) on data generated from Instruct-SkillMix leads to strong gains on instruction following benchmarks such as AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and WildBench. With just $4$K examples, LLaMA-3-8B-Base achieves 42.76% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. To our knowledge, this achieves state-of-the-art performance among all models that have only undergone SFT (no RL methods) and competes with proprietary models such as Claude 3 Opus and LLaMA-3.1-405B-Instruct.   Ablation studies also suggest plausible reasons for why creating open instruction-tuning datasets via naive crowd-sourcing has proved difficult. Introducing low quality answers ("shirkers") in $20\%$ of Instruct-SkillMix examples causes performance to plummet, sometimes catastrophically.   The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline is flexible and is adaptable to other settings.

### Evidence from fMRI Supports a Two-Phase Abstraction Process in Language   Models
**Authors**: Emily Cheng, Richard J. Antonello

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T16:33:16Z

**Summary**: Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.

### Model Input Verification of Large Scale Simulations
**Authors**: Rumyana Neykova, Derek Groen

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T16:32:14Z

**Summary**: Reliable simulations are critical for analyzing and understanding complex systems, but their accuracy depends on correct input data. Incorrect inputs such as invalid or out-of-range values, missing data, and format inconsistencies can cause simulation crashes or unnoticed result distortions, ultimately undermining the validity of the conclusions. This paper presents a methodology for verifying the validity of input data in simulations, a process we term model input verification (MIV). We implement this approach in FabGuard, a toolset that uses established data schema and validation tools for the specific needs of simulation modeling. We introduce a formalism for categorizing MIV patterns and offer a streamlined verification pipeline that integrates into existing simulation workflows. FabGuard's applicability is demonstrated across three diverse domains: conflict-driven migration, disaster evacuation, and disease spread models. We also explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating constraint generation and inference. In a case study with a migration simulation, LLMs not only correctly inferred 22 out of 23 developer-defined constraints, but also identified errors in existing constraints and proposed new, valid constraints. Our evaluation demonstrates that MIV is feasible on large datasets, with FabGuard efficiently processing 12,000 input files in 140 seconds and maintaining consistent performance across varying file sizes.

### Balancing Rigor and Utility: Mitigating Cognitive Biases in Large   Language Models for Multiple-Choice Questions
**Authors**: Liman Wang, Hanyang Zhong, Wenting Cao, Zeyuan Sun

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T16:28:09Z

**Summary**: This paper examines the role of cognitive biases in the decision-making processes of large language models (LLMs), challenging the conventional goal of eliminating all biases. We show that certain cognitive biases when properly balanced, can enhance decision-making efficiency through rational deviations and heuristic shortcuts. By introducing heuristic moderation and an abstention option, which allows LLMs to withhold responses when uncertain, we reduce error rates, improve decision accuracy, and optimize decision rates. Using the Balance Rigor and Utility (BRU) dataset, developed through expert collaboration, our findings demonstrate that targeted inspection of cognitive biases aligns LLM decisions more closely with human reasoning, enhancing reliability and suggesting strategies for future improvements. This approach offers a novel way to leverage cognitive biases to improve the practical utility of LLMs across various applications.

### jaxspec : a fast and robust Python library for X-ray spectral fitting
**Authors**: Simon Dupourqué, Didier Barret, Camille M. Diez, Sébastien Guillot, Erwan Quintin

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T16:14:47Z

**Summary**: Context. Inferring spectral parameters from X-ray data is one of the cornerstones of high-energy astrophysics, and is achieved using software stacks that have been developed over the last twenty years and more. However, as models get more complex and spectra reach higher resolutions, these established software solutions become more feature-heavy, difficult to maintain and less efficient. Aims. We present jaxspec, a Python package for performing this task quickly and robustly in a fully Bayesian framework. Based on the JAX ecosystem, jaxspec allows the generation of differentiable likelihood functions compilable on core or graphical process units (resp. CPU and GPU), enabling the use of robust algorithms for Bayesian inference. Methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of jaxspec samplers, in particular the No U-Turn Sampler, using a composite model and comparing what we obtain with the existing frameworks. We also demonstrate its ability to process high-resolution spectroscopy data and using original methods, by reproducing the results of the Hitomi collaboration on the Perseus cluster, while solving the inference problem using variational inference on a GPU. Results. We obtain identical results when compared to other softwares and approaches, meaning that jaxspec provides reliable results while being $\sim 10$ times faster than existing alternatives. In addition, we show that variational inference can produce convincing results even on high-resolution data in less than 10 minutes on a GPU. Conclusions. With this package, we aim to pursue the goal of opening up X-ray spectroscopy to the existing ecosystem of machine learning and Bayesian inference, enabling researchers to apply new methods to solve increasingly complex problems in the best possible way. Our long-term ambition is the scientific exploitation of the data from the newAthena X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU).

### A Novel Idea Generation Tool using a Structured Conversational AI (CAI)   System
**Authors**: B. Sankar, Dibakar Sen

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T16:02:27Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a novel conversational AI-enabled active ideation interface as a creative idea-generation tool to assist novice designers in mitigating the initial latency and ideation bottlenecks that are commonly observed. It is a dynamic, interactive, and contextually responsive approach, actively involving a large language model (LLM) from the domain of natural language processing (NLP) in artificial intelligence (AI) to produce multiple statements of potential ideas for different design problems. Integrating such AI models with ideation creates what we refer to as an Active Ideation scenario, which helps foster continuous dialogue-based interaction, context-sensitive conversation, and prolific idea generation. A pilot study was conducted with thirty novice designers to generate ideas for given problems using traditional methods and the new CAI-based interface. The key parameters of fluency, novelty, and variety were used to compare the outcomes qualitatively by a panel of experts. The findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed tool for generating prolific, diverse and novel ideas. The interface was enhanced by incorporating a prompt-engineered structured dialogue style for each ideation stage to make it uniform and more convenient for the designers. The resulting responses of such a structured CAI interface were found to be more succinct and aligned towards the subsequent design stage, namely conceptualization. The paper thus established the rich potential of using Generative AI (Gen-AI) for the early ill-structured phase of the creative product design process.

### LLMs Will Always Hallucinate, and We Need to Live With This
**Authors**: Sourav Banerjee, Ayushi Agarwal, Saloni Singla

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T16:01:58Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models become more ubiquitous across domains, it becomes important to examine their inherent limitations critically. This work argues that hallucinations in language models are not just occasional errors but an inevitable feature of these systems. We demonstrate that hallucinations stem from the fundamental mathematical and logical structure of LLMs. It is, therefore, impossible to eliminate them through architectural improvements, dataset enhancements, or fact-checking mechanisms. Our analysis draws on computational theory and Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem, which references the undecidability of problems like the Halting, Emptiness, and Acceptance Problems. We demonstrate that every stage of the LLM process-from training data compilation to fact retrieval, intent classification, and text generation-will have a non-zero probability of producing hallucinations. This work introduces the concept of Structural Hallucination as an intrinsic nature of these systems. By establishing the mathematical certainty of hallucinations, we challenge the prevailing notion that they can be fully mitigated.

### X-InstructBLIP: A Framework for aligning X-Modal instruction-aware   representations to LLMs and Emergent Cross-modal Reasoning
**Authors**: Artemis Panagopoulou, Le Xue, Ning Yu, Junnan Li, Dongxu Li, Shafiq Joty, Ran Xu, Silvio Savarese, Caiming Xiong, Juan Carlos Niebles

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T16:00:04Z

**Summary**: Recent research has achieved significant advancements in visual reasoning tasks through learning image-to-language projections and leveraging the impressive reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces an efficient and effective framework that integrates multiple modalities (images, 3D, audio and video) to a frozen LLM and demonstrates an emergent ability for cross-modal reasoning (2+ modality inputs). Our approach explores two distinct projection mechanisms: Q-Formers and Linear Projections (LPs). Through extensive experimentation across all four modalities on 16 benchmarks, we explore both methods and assess their adaptability in integrated and separate cross-modal reasoning. The Q-Former projection demonstrates superior performance in single modality scenarios and adaptability in joint versus discriminative reasoning involving two or more modalities. However, it exhibits lower generalization capabilities than linear projection in contexts where task-modality data are limited. To enable this framework, we devise a scalable pipeline that automatically generates high-quality, instruction-tuning datasets from readily available captioning data across different modalities, and contribute 24K QA data for audio and 250K QA data for 3D. To facilitate further research in cross-modal reasoning, we introduce the DisCRn (Discriminative Cross-modal Reasoning) benchmark comprising 9K audio-video QA samples and 28K image-3D QA samples that require the model to reason discriminatively across disparate input modalities.

### Examining the Relationship Between the Persistent Emission and the   Accretion Rate During a Type I X-ray Burst
**Authors**: J. Speicher, D. R. Ballantyne, P. C. Fragile

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T15:49:27Z

**Summary**: The accretion flow onto a neutron star will be impacted due to irradiation by a Type I X-ray burst. The burst radiation exerts Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag on the accretion disk, leading to an enhanced mass accretion rate. Observations of X-ray bursts often find evidence that the normalization of the disk-generated persistent emission (commonly denoted by the factor $f_a$) increases during a burst, and changes in $f_a$ have been used to infer the evolution in the mass accretion rate due to PR drag. Here, we examine this proposed relationship between $f_a$ and mass accretion rate enhancement using time-resolved data from simulations of accretion disks impacted by Type I X-ray bursts. We consider bursts from both spinning and non-spinning neutron stars and track both the change in accretion rate due to PR grad and the disk emission spectra during the burst. Regardless of the neutron star spin, we find that $f_a$ strongly correlates with the disk temperature and only weakly follows the mass accretion rate (the Pearson correlation coefficients are $\leq 0.63$ in the latter case). Additionally, heating causes the disk to emit at higher energies, reducing its contribution to a soft excess. We conclude that $f_a$ cannot accurately capture the mass accretion rate enhancement and is rather a tracer of the disk temperature.

**Summary**: In many industrial settings, users wish to ask questions whose answers may be found in structured data sources such as a spreadsheets, databases, APIs, or combinations thereof. Often, the user doesn't know how to identify or access the right data source. This problem is compounded even further if multiple (and potentially siloed) data sources must be assembled to derive the answer. Recently, various Text-to-SQL applications that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) have addressed some of these problems by enabling users to ask questions in natural language. However, these applications remain impractical in realistic industrial settings because they fail to cope with the data source heterogeneity that typifies such environments. In this paper, we address heterogeneity by introducing the siwarex platform, which enables seamless natural language access to both databases and APIs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of siwarex, we extend the popular Spider dataset and benchmark by replacing some of its tables by data retrieval APIs. We find that siwarex does a good job of coping with data source heterogeneity. Our modified Spider benchmark will soon be available to the research community

### Markov Chain Variance Estimation: A Stochastic Approximation Approach
**Authors**: Shubhada Agrawal, Prashanth L. A., Siva Theja Maguluri

**Summary**: We consider the problem of estimating the asymptotic variance of a function defined on a Markov chain, an important step for statistical inference of the stationary mean. We design the first recursive estimator that requires $O(1)$ computation at each step, does not require storing any historical samples or any prior knowledge of run-length, and has optimal $O(\frac{1}{n})$ rate of convergence for the mean-squared error (MSE) with provable finite sample guarantees. Here, $n$ refers to the total number of samples generated. The previously best-known rate of convergence in MSE was $O(\frac{\log n}{n})$, achieved by jackknifed estimators, which also do not enjoy these other desirable properties. Our estimator is based on linear stochastic approximation of an equivalent formulation of the asymptotic variance in terms of the solution of the Poisson equation.   We generalize our estimator in several directions, including estimating the covariance matrix for vector-valued functions, estimating the stationary variance of a Markov chain, and approximately estimating the asymptotic variance in settings where the state space of the underlying Markov chain is large. We also show applications of our estimator in average reward reinforcement learning (RL), where we work with asymptotic variance as a risk measure to model safety-critical applications. We design a temporal-difference type algorithm tailored for policy evaluation in this context. We consider both the tabular and linear function approximation settings. Our work paves the way for developing actor-critic style algorithms for variance-constrained RL.

### Towards Democratizing Multilingual Large Language Models For Medicine   Through A Two-Stage Instruction Fine-tuning Approach
**Authors**: Meng Zhou, Surajsinh Parmar, Anubhav Bhatti

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T15:42:19Z

**Summary**: Open-source, multilingual medical large language models (LLMs) have the potential to serve linguistically diverse populations across different regions. Adapting generic LLMs for healthcare often requires continual pretraining, but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes impractical. Instruction fine-tuning on a specific task may not always guarantee optimal performance due to the lack of broader domain knowledge that the model needs to understand and reason effectively in diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce two multilingual instruction fine-tuning datasets, MMed-IFT and MMed-IFT-MC, containing over 200k high-quality medical samples in six languages. We propose a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage injects general medical knowledge using MMed-IFT, while the second stage fine-tunes task-specific multiple-choice questions with MMed-IFT-MC. Our method achieves competitive results on both English and multilingual benchmarks, striking a balance between computational efficiency and performance. We plan to make our dataset and model weights public at \url{https://github.com/SpassMed/Med-Llama3} in the future.

### Optical Spiking Neurons Enable High-Speed and Energy-Efficient Optical   Neural Networks
**Authors**: Bo Xu, Zefeng Huang, Yuetong Fang, Xin Wang, Bojun Cheng, Shaoliang Yu, Zhongrui Wang, Renjing Xu

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T15:39:59Z

**Summary**: Optical neural networks (ONNs) perform extensive computations using photons instead of electrons, resulting in passively energy-efficient and low-latency computing. Among various ONNs, the diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) particularly excel in energy efficiency, bandwidth, and parallelism, therefore attract considerable attention. However, their performance is limited by the inherent constraints of traditional frame-based sensors, which process and produce dense and redundant information at low operating frequency. Inspired by the spiking neurons in human neural system, which utilize a thresholding mechanism to transmit information sparsely and efficiently, we propose integrating a threshold-locking method into neuromorphic vision sensors to generate sparse and binary information, achieving microsecond-level accurate perception similar to human spiking neurons. By introducing novel Binary Dual Adaptive Training (BAT) and Optically Parallel Mixture of Experts (OPMoE) inference methods, the high-speed, spike-based diffractive optical neural network (S2NN) demonstrates an ultra-fast operating speed of 3649 FPS, which is 30 fold faster than that of reported DONNs, delivering a remarkable computational speed of 417.96 TOPS and a system energy efficiency of 12.6 TOPS/W. Our work demonstrates the potential of incorporating neuromorphic architecture to facilitate optical neural network applications in real-world scenarios for both low-level and high-level machine vision tasks.

### Implications of feedback solutions to the $S_8$ tension for the baryon   fractions of galaxy groups and clusters
**Authors**: Jaime Salcido, Ian G. McCarthy

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T15:25:53Z

**Summary**: Recent large-scale structure (LSS) surveys have revealed a persistent tension in the value of $S_8$ compared to predictions from the standard cosmological model. This tension may suggest the need for new physics beyond the standard model, but an accurate characterisation of baryonic effects is essential to avoid biases. Although some studies indicate that baryonic effects are too small to resolve this tension, others propose that more aggressive feedback mechanisms could reconcile differences between cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements and low-redshift LSS observations. In this paper, we investigate the role of baryonic effects in alleviating the $S_8$ tension. We extend the SP(k) model (Salcido et al. 2023), which was trained on hundreds of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to map the suppression of the matter power spectrum to the baryon fraction in groups and clusters, to predict the required baryon fraction for a given $P(k)$ suppression. We then compare predictions from recent cosmic shear (weak lensing) analyses with the latest baryon budget measurements from X-ray and weak gravitational lensing studies. Our findings show that studies marginalising over baryonic effects while fixing cosmological parameters to a Planck-like cosmology predict strong $P(k)$ suppression and baryon fractions that are much lower than existing low-redshift baryon budget estimates of galaxy groups and clusters. Conversely, most studies that marginalise over both cosmological parameters and baryonic effects imply baryon fractions that are consistent with observations but lower values of $S_8$ than inferred from the CMB. Unless the observed baryon fractions are biased high by a factor of several, these results suggest that a mechanism beyond baryonic physics alone is required to modify or slow down the growth of structure in the universe in order to resolve the $S_8$ tension.

### Uniform Estimation and Inference for Nonparametric Partitioning-Based   M-Estimators
**Authors**: Matias D. Cattaneo, Yingjie Feng, Boris Shigida

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T15:25:41Z

**Summary**: This paper presents uniform estimation and inference theory for a large class of nonparametric partitioning-based M-estimators. The main theoretical results include: (i) uniform consistency for convex and non-convex objective functions; (ii) optimal uniform Bahadur representations; (iii) optimal uniform (and mean square) convergence rates; (iv) valid strong approximations and feasible uniform inference methods; and (v) extensions to functional transformations of underlying estimators. Uniformity is established over both the evaluation point of the nonparametric functional parameter and a Euclidean parameter indexing the class of loss functions. The results also account explicitly for the smoothness degree of the loss function (if any), and allow for a possibly non-identity (inverse) link function. We illustrate the main theoretical and methodological results with four substantive applications: quantile regression, distribution regression, $L_p$ regression, and Logistic regression; many other possibly non-smooth, nonlinear, generalized, robust M-estimation settings are covered by our theoretical results. We provide detailed comparisons with the existing literature and demonstrate substantive improvements: we achieve the best (in some cases optimal) known results under improved (in some cases minimal) requirements in terms of regularity conditions and side rate restrictions. The supplemental appendix reports other technical results that may be of independent interest.

### Jointly Learning Cost and Constraints from Demonstrations for Safe   Trajectory Generation
**Authors**: Shivam Chaubey, Francesco Verdoja, Ville Kyrki

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T15:24:15Z

**Summary**: Learning from Demonstration allows robots to mimic human actions. However, these methods do not model constraints crucial to ensure safety of the learned skill. Moreover, even when explicitly modelling constraints, they rely on the assumption of a known cost function, which limits their practical usability for task with unknown cost. In this work we propose a two-step optimization process that allow to estimate cost and constraints by decoupling the learning of cost functions from the identification of unknown constraints within the demonstrated trajectories. Initially, we identify the cost function by isolating the effect of constraints on parts of the demonstrations. Subsequently, a constraint leaning method is used to identify the unknown constraints. Our approach is validated both on simulated trajectories and a real robotic manipulation task. Our experiments show the impact that incorrect cost estimation has on the learned constraints and illustrate how the proposed method is able to infer unknown constraints, such as obstacles, from demonstrated trajectories without any initial knowledge of the cost.

### Mixed additive modelling of global alien species co-invasions of plants   and insects
**Authors**: Martina Boschi, Rūta Juozaitienė, Ernst-Jan Camiel Wit

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T15:23:14Z

**Summary**: Alien species refer to non-native species introduced into an ecosystem, potentially causing harm to the environment, economy, or human health. Presence of confounding factors has so far prevented a comprehensive picture of relative importance of various drivers of such invasions. In this manuscript, we aim to develop and apply a general mixed additive Relational Event Model (REM) to describe the pattern of global invasions of alien species. An alien species invasion can be seen as a relational event, where the species - sender - reaches a region - receiver - at a specific time in history. We consider the First Record Database and focus on co-invasions by insects and plants between 1880 and 2005. REM aims to describe underlying hazard of each sender-receiver pair. Besides potentially time-varying, exogenous, and endogenous covariates, our mixed additive REM incorporates time-varying and random effects. Our efficient inference procedure relies on case-control sampling, yielding the same likelihood as that of a degenerate logistic regression. Resulting computational efficiency means that complex models for large dynamic networks can be estimated in seconds on a standard computer. We also present a framework for testing the goodness-of-fit of REMs via cumulative martingale-residuals. Implementation is performed through R package mgcv.

### The Influence of Task and Group Disparities over Users' Attitudes Toward   Using Large Language Models for Psychotherapy
**Authors**: Qihang He, Jiyao Wang, Dengbo He

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T15:14:31Z

**Summary**: The population suffering from mental health disorders has kept increasing in recent years. With the advancements in large language models (LLMs) in diverse fields, LLM-based psychotherapy has also attracted increasingly more attention. However, the factors influencing users' attitudes to LLM-based psychotherapy have rarely been explored. As the first attempt, this paper investigated the influence of task and group disparities on user attitudes toward LLM-based psychotherapy tools. Utilizing the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Automation Acceptance Model (AAM), based on an online survey, we collected and analyzed responses from 222 LLM-based psychotherapy users in mainland China. The results revealed that group disparity (i.e., mental health conditions) can influence users' attitudes toward LLM tools. Further, one of the typical task disparities, i.e., the privacy concern, was not found to have a significant effect on trust and usage intention. These findings can guide the design of future LLM-based psychotherapy services.

### Large Language Models Synergize with Automated Machine Learning
**Authors**: Jinglue Xu, Jialong Li, Zhen Liu, Nagar Anthel Venkatesh Suryanarayanan, Guoyuan Zhou, Jia Guo, Hitoshi Iba, Kenji Tei

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T15:04:15Z

**Summary**: Recently, program synthesis driven by large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly popular. However, program synthesis for machine learning (ML) tasks still poses significant challenges. This paper explores a novel form of program synthesis, targeting ML programs, by combining LLMs and automated machine learning (autoML). Specifically, our goal is to fully automate the generation and optimization of the code of the entire ML workflow, from data preparation to modeling and post-processing, utilizing only textual descriptions of the ML tasks. To manage the length and diversity of ML programs, we propose to break each ML program into smaller, manageable parts. Each part is generated separately by the LLM, with careful consideration of their compatibilities. To ensure compatibilities, we design a testing technique for ML programs. Unlike traditional program synthesis, which typically relies on binary evaluations (i.e., correct or incorrect), evaluating ML programs necessitates more than just binary judgments. Our approach automates the numerical evaluation and optimization of these programs, selecting the best candidates through autoML techniques. In experiments across various ML tasks, our method outperforms existing methods in 10 out of 12 tasks for generating ML programs. In addition, autoML significantly improves the performance of the generated ML programs. In experiments, given the textual task description, our method, Text-to-ML, generates the complete and optimized ML program in a fully autonomous process. The implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/JLX0/llm-automl.

### Auto-ACD: A Large-scale Dataset for Audio-Language Representation   Learning
**Authors**: Luoyi Sun, Xuenan Xu, Mengyue Wu, Weidi Xie

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T14:52:15Z

**Summary**: Recently, the AI community has made significant strides in developing powerful foundation models, driven by large-scale multimodal datasets. However, for audio representation learning, existing datasets suffer from limitations in the following aspects: insufficient volume, simplistic content, and arduous collection procedures. To establish an audio dataset with high-quality captions, we propose an innovative, automatic approach leveraging multimodal inputs, such as video frames, audio streams. Specifically, we construct a large-scale, high-quality, audio-language dataset, named as Auto-ACD, comprising over 1.5M audio-text pairs. We exploit a series of pre-trained models or APIs, to determine audio-visual synchronisation, generate image captions, object detection, or audio tags for specific videos. Subsequently, we employ LLM to paraphrase a congruent caption for each audio, guided by the extracted multi-modality clues. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset, we train widely used models on our dataset and show performance improvement on various downstream tasks, for example, audio-language retrieval, audio captioning, zero-shot classification. In addition, we establish a novel benchmark with environmental information and provide a benchmark for audio-text tasks.

### Bayesian calibration of bubble size dynamics applied to CO2 gas   fermenters
**Authors**: Malik Hassanaly, John M. Parra-Alvarez, Mohammad J. Rahimi, Hariswaran Sitaraman

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T14:48:32Z

**Summary**: To accelerate the scale-up of gaseous CO2 fermentation reactors, computational models need to predict gas-to-liquid mass transfer which requires capturing the bubble size dynamics, i.e. bubble breakup and coalescence. However, the applicability of existing models beyond air-water mixtures remains to be established. Here, an inverse modeling approach, accelerated with a neural network surrogate, calibrates the breakup and coalescence closure models, that are used in the Multiple-Size-Group (MUSIG) population balance modeling (PBM). The calibration is performed based on experimental results obtained in a CO2-air-water-coflowing bubble column reactor. Bayesian inference is used to account for noise in the experimental dataset and bias in the simulation results. To accurately capture gas holdup and interphase mass transfer, the results show that the breakage rate needs to be increased by one order of magnitude. The inferred model parameters are then used on a separate configuration and shown to also improve bubble size distribution predictions.

### Zero-shot Outlier Detection via Prior-data Fitted Networks: Model   Selection Bygone!
**Authors**: Yuchen Shen, Haomin Wen, Leman Akoglu

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T14:41:24Z

**Summary**: Outlier detection (OD) has a vast literature as it finds numerous applications in environmental monitoring, cybersecurity, finance, and medicine to name a few. Being an inherently unsupervised task, model selection is a key bottleneck for OD (both algorithm and hyperparameter selection) without label supervision. There is a long list of techniques to choose from -- both classical algorithms and deep neural architectures -- and while several studies report their hyperparameter sensitivity, the literature is quite slim on unsupervised model selection -- limiting the effective use of OD in practice. In this paper we present FoMo-0D, for zero/0-shot OD exploring a transformative new direction that bypasses the hurdle of model selection altogether (!), thus breaking new ground. The fundamental idea behind FoMo-0D is the Prior-data Fitted Networks, recently introduced by Muller et al.(2022), which trains a Transformer model on a large body of synthetically generated data from a prior data distribution. In essence, FoMo-0D is a pretrained Foundation Model for zero/0-shot OD on tabular data, which can directly predict the (outlier/inlier) label of any test data at inference time, by merely a single forward pass -- making obsolete the need for choosing an algorithm/architecture, tuning its associated hyperparameters, and even training any model parameters when given a new OD dataset. Extensive experiments on 57 public benchmark datasets against 26 baseline methods show that FoMo-0D performs statistically no different from the top 2nd baseline, while significantly outperforming the majority of the baselines, with an average inference time of 7.7 ms per test sample.

### HyperSteiner: Computing Heuristic Hyperbolic Steiner Minimal Trees
**Authors**: Alejandro García-Castellanos, Aniss Aiman Medbouhi, Giovanni Luca Marchetti, Erik J. Bekkers, Danica Kragic

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T14:40:21Z

**Summary**: We propose HyperSteiner -- an efficient heuristic algorithm for computing Steiner minimal trees in the hyperbolic space. HyperSteiner extends the Euclidean Smith-Lee-Liebman algorithm, which is grounded in a divide-and-conquer approach involving the Delaunay triangulation. The central idea is rephrasing Steiner tree problems with three terminals as a system of equations in the Klein-Beltrami model. Motivated by the fact that hyperbolic geometry is well-suited for representing hierarchies, we explore applications to hierarchy discovery in data. Results show that HyperSteiner infers more realistic hierarchies than the Minimum Spanning Tree and is more scalable to large datasets than Neighbor Joining.

### Unlearning or Concealment? A Critical Analysis and Evaluation Metrics   for Unlearning in Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Aakash Sen Sharma, Niladri Sarkar, Vikram Chundawat, Ankur A Mali, Murari Mandal

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T14:38:31Z

**Summary**: Recent research has seen significant interest in methods for concept removal and targeted forgetting in diffusion models. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive white-box analysis to expose significant vulnerabilities in existing diffusion model unlearning methods. We show that the objective functions used for unlearning in the existing methods lead to decoupling of the targeted concepts (meant to be forgotten) for the corresponding prompts. This is concealment and not actual unlearning, which was the original goal. The ineffectiveness of current methods stems primarily from their narrow focus on reducing generation probabilities for specific prompt sets, neglecting the diverse modalities of intermediate guidance employed during the inference process. The paper presents a rigorous theoretical and empirical examination of four commonly used techniques for unlearning in diffusion models. We introduce two new evaluation metrics: Concept Retrieval Score (CRS) and Concept Confidence Score (CCS). These metrics are based on a successful adversarial attack setup that can recover forgotten concepts from unlearned diffusion models. The CRS measures the similarity between the latent representations of the unlearned and fully trained models after unlearning. It reports the extent of retrieval of the forgotten concepts with increasing amount of guidance. The CCS quantifies the confidence of the model in assigning the target concept to the manipulated data. It reports the probability of the unlearned model's generations to be aligned with the original domain knowledge with increasing amount of guidance. Evaluating existing unlearning methods with our proposed stringent metrics for diffusion models reveals significant shortcomings in their ability to truly unlearn concepts.

### K-Fold Causal BART for CATE Estimation
**Authors**: Hugo Gobato Souto, Francisco Louzada Neto

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T14:36:33Z

**Summary**: This research aims to propose and evaluate a novel model named K-Fold Causal Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (K-Fold Causal BART) for improved estimation of Average Treatment Effects (ATE) and Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE). The study employs synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, including the widely recognized Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP) benchmark dataset, to validate the model's performance. Despite promising results in synthetic scenarios, the IHDP dataset reveals that the proposed model is not state-of-the-art for ATE and CATE estimation. Nonetheless, the research provides several novel insights: 1. The ps-BART model is likely the preferred choice for CATE and ATE estimation due to better generalization compared to the other benchmark models - including the Bayesian Causal Forest (BCF) model, which is considered by many the current best model for CATE estimation, 2. The BCF model's performance deteriorates significantly with increasing treatment effect heterogeneity, while the ps-BART model remains robust, 3. Models tend to be overconfident in CATE uncertainty quantification when treatment effect heterogeneity is low, 4. A second K-Fold method is unnecessary for avoiding overfitting in CATE estimation, as it adds computational costs without improving performance, 5. Detailed analysis reveals the importance of understanding dataset characteristics and using nuanced evaluation methods, 6. The conclusion of Curth et al. (2021) that indirect strategies for CATE estimation are superior for the IHDP dataset is contradicted by the results of this research. These findings challenge existing assumptions and suggest directions for future research to enhance causal inference methodologies.

### LoQT: Low-Rank Adapters for Quantized Pre-Training
**Authors**: Sebastian Loeschcke, Mads Toftrup, Michael J. Kastoryano, Serge Belongie, Vésteinn Snæbjarnarson

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T14:31:26Z

**Summary**: Training of large neural networks requires significant computational resources. Despite advances using low-rank adapters and quantization, pretraining of models such as LLMs on consumer hardware has not been possible without model sharding, offloading during training, or per-layer gradient updates. To address these limitations, we propose LoQT, a method for efficiently training quantized models. LoQT uses gradient-based tensor factorization to initialize low-rank trainable weight matrices that are periodically merged into quantized full-rank weight matrices. Our approach is suitable for both pretraining and fine-tuning of models, which we demonstrate experimentally for language modeling and downstream task adaptation. We find that LoQT enables efficient training of models up to 7B parameters on a consumer-grade 24GB GPU. We also demonstrate the feasibility of training a 13B parameter model using per-layer gradient updates on the same hardware.

### PINN surrogate of Li-ion battery models for parameter inference. Part   II: Regularization and application of the pseudo-2D model
**Authors**: Malik Hassanaly, Peter J. Weddle, Ryan N. King, Subhayan De, Alireza Doostan, Corey R. Randall, Eric J. Dufek, Andrew M. Colclasure, Kandler Smith

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T14:24:54Z

**Summary**: Bayesian parameter inference is useful to improve Li-ion battery diagnostics and can help formulate battery aging models. However, it is computationally intensive and cannot be easily repeated for multiple cycles, multiple operating conditions, or multiple replicate cells. To reduce the computational cost of Bayesian calibration, numerical solvers for physics-based models can be replaced with faster surrogates. A physics-informed neural network (PINN) is developed as a surrogate for the pseudo-2D (P2D) battery model calibration. For the P2D surrogate, additional training regularization was needed as compared to the PINN single-particle model (SPM) developed in Part I. Both the PINN SPM and P2D surrogate models are exercised for parameter inference and compared to data obtained from a direct numerical solution of the governing equations. A parameter inference study highlights the ability to use these PINNs to calibrate scaling parameters for the cathode Li diffusion and the anode exchange current density. By realizing computational speed-ups of 2250x for the P2D model, as compared to using standard integrating methods, the PINN surrogates enable rapid state-of-health diagnostics. In the low-data availability scenario, the testing error was estimated to 2mV for the SPM surrogate and 10mV for the P2D surrogate which could be mitigated with additional data.

### Adversarial Attacks on Data Attribution
**Authors**: Xinhe Wang, Pingbang Hu, Junwei Deng, Jiaqi W. Ma

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T14:23:19Z

**Summary**: Data attribution aims to quantify the contribution of individual training data points to the outputs of an AI model, which has been used to measure the value of training data and compensate data providers. Given the impact on financial decisions and compensation mechanisms, a critical question arises concerning the adversarial robustness of data attribution methods. However, there has been little to no systematic research addressing this issue. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by detailing a threat model with clear assumptions about the adversary's goal and capabilities, and by proposing principled adversarial attack methods on data attribution. We present two such methods, Shadow Attack and Outlier Attack, both of which generate manipulated datasets to adversarially inflate the compensation. The Shadow Attack leverages knowledge about the data distribution in the AI applications, and derives adversarial perturbations through "shadow training", a technique commonly used in membership inference attacks. In contrast, the Outlier Attack does not assume any knowledge about the data distribution and relies solely on black-box queries to the target model's predictions. It exploits an inductive bias present in many data attribution methods - outlier data points are more likely to be influential - and employs adversarial examples to generate manipulated datasets. Empirically, in image classification and text generation tasks, the Shadow Attack can inflate the data-attribution-based compensation by at least 200%, while the Outlier Attack achieves compensation inflation ranging from 185% to as much as 643%.

### Multilevel testing of constraints induced by structural equation   modeling in fMRI effective connectivity analysis: A proof of concept
**Authors**: G. Marrelec, A. Giron

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T14:00:35Z

**Summary**: In functional MRI (fMRI), effective connectivity analysis aims at inferring the causal influences that brain regions exert on one another. A common method for this type of analysis is structural equation modeling (SEM). We here propose a novel method to test the validity of a given model of structural equation. Given a structural model in the form of a directed graph, the method extracts the set of all constraints of conditional independence induced by the absence of links between pairs of regions in the model and tests for their validity in a Bayesian framework, either individually (constraint by constraint), jointly (e.g., by gathering all constraints associated with a given missing link), or globally (i.e., all constraints associated with the structural model). This approach has two main advantages. First, it only tests what is testable from observational data and does allow for false causal interpretation. Second, it makes it possible to test each constraint (or group of constraints) separately and, therefore, quantify in what measure each constraint (or, e..g., missing link) is respected in the data. We validate our approach using a simulation study and illustrate its potential benefits through the reanalysis of published data.

### G-NeLF: Memory- and Data-Efficient Hybrid Neural Light Field for Novel   View Synthesis
**Authors**: Lutao Jiang, Lin Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T13:52:58Z

**Summary**: Following the burgeoning interest in implicit neural representation, Neural Light Field (NeLF) has been introduced to predict the color of a ray directly. Unlike Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), NeLF does not create a point-wise representation by predicting color and volume density for each point in space. However, the current NeLF methods face a challenge as they need to train a NeRF model first and then synthesize over 10K views to train NeLF for improved performance. Additionally, the rendering quality of NeLF methods is lower compared to NeRF methods. In this paper, we propose G-NeLF, a versatile grid-based NeLF approach that utilizes spatial-aware features to unleash the potential of the neural network's inference capability, and consequently overcome the difficulties of NeLF training. Specifically, we employ a spatial-aware feature sequence derived from a meticulously crafted grid as the ray's representation. Drawing from our empirical studies on the adaptability of multi-resolution hash tables, we introduce a novel grid-based ray representation for NeLF that can represent the entire space with a very limited number of parameters. To better utilize the sequence feature, we design a lightweight ray color decoder that simulates the ray propagation process, enabling a more efficient inference of the ray's color. G-NeLF can be trained without necessitating significant storage overhead and with the model size of only 0.95 MB to surpass previous state-of-the-art NeLF. Moreover, compared with grid-based NeRF methods, e.g., Instant-NGP, we only utilize one-tenth of its parameters to achieve higher performance. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

### An Empirical Study on Information Extraction using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ridong Han, Chaohao Yang, Tao Peng, Prayag Tiwari, Xiang Wan, Lu Liu, Benyou Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T13:50:30Z

**Summary**: Human-like large language models (LLMs), especially the most powerful and popular ones in OpenAI's GPT family, have proven to be very helpful for many natural language processing (NLP) related tasks. Therefore, various attempts have been made to apply LLMs to information extraction (IE), which is a fundamental NLP task that involves extracting information from unstructured plain text. To demonstrate the latest representative progress in LLMs' information extraction ability, we assess the information extraction ability of GPT-4 (the latest version of GPT at the time of writing this paper) from four perspectives: Performance, Evaluation Criteria, Robustness, and Error Types. Our results suggest a visible performance gap between GPT-4 and state-of-the-art (SOTA) IE methods. To alleviate this problem, considering the LLMs' human-like characteristics, we propose and analyze the effects of a series of simple prompt-based methods, which can be generalized to other LLMs and NLP tasks. Rich experiments show our methods' effectiveness and some of their remaining issues in improving GPT-4's information extraction ability.

### OD-VAE: An Omni-dimensional Video Compressor for Improving Latent Video   Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Liuhan Chen, Zongjian Li, Bin Lin, Bin Zhu, Qian Wang, Shenghai Yuan, Xing Zhou, Xinhua Cheng, Li Yuan

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T13:49:53Z

**Summary**: Variational Autoencoder (VAE), compressing videos into latent representations, is a crucial preceding component of Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs). With the same reconstruction quality, the more sufficient the VAE's compression for videos is, the more efficient the LVDMs are. However, most LVDMs utilize 2D image VAE, whose compression for videos is only in the spatial dimension and often ignored in the temporal dimension. How to conduct temporal compression for videos in a VAE to obtain more concise latent representations while promising accurate reconstruction is seldom explored. To fill this gap, we propose an omni-dimension compression VAE, named OD-VAE, which can temporally and spatially compress videos. Although OD-VAE's more sufficient compression brings a great challenge to video reconstruction, it can still achieve high reconstructed accuracy by our fine design. To obtain a better trade-off between video reconstruction quality and compression speed, four variants of OD-VAE are introduced and analyzed. In addition, a novel tail initialization is designed to train OD-VAE more efficiently, and a novel inference strategy is proposed to enable OD-VAE to handle videos of arbitrary length with limited GPU memory. Comprehensive experiments on video reconstruction and LVDM-based video generation demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods.

**Authors**: Shu-Yuan Guo, Maxim Khlopov, Xuewen Liu, Lei Wu, Yongcheng Wu, Bin Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T13:34:39Z

**Summary**: Several Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have recently reported the evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), which can unveil the formation of primordial seeds of inhomogeneities in the early universe. With the SGWB parameters inferred from PTAs data, we can make a prediction of the seeds for early galaxy formation from the domain walls in the axion-like particles (ALPs) field distribution. This also naturally provides a solution to the observation of high redshifts by the James Webb Space Telescope. The predicted photon coupling of the ALP is within the reach of future experimental searches.

### MemoRAG: Moving towards Next-Gen RAG Via Memory-Inspired Knowledge   Discovery
**Authors**: Hongjin Qian, Peitian Zhang, Zheng Liu, Kelong Mao, Zhicheng Dou

**Updated**: 2024-09-10T02:01:43Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages retrieval tools to access external databases, thereby enhancing the generation quality of large language models (LLMs) through optimized context. However, the existing retrieval methods are constrained inherently, as they can only perform relevance matching between explicitly stated queries and well-formed knowledge, but unable to handle tasks involving ambiguous information needs or unstructured knowledge. Consequently, existing RAG systems are primarily effective for straightforward question-answering tasks. In this work, we propose MemoRAG, a novel retrieval-augmented generation paradigm empowered by long-term memory. MemoRAG adopts a dual-system architecture. On the one hand, it employs a light but long-range LLM to form the global memory of database. Once a task is presented, it generates draft answers, cluing the retrieval tools to locate useful information within the database. On the other hand, it leverages an expensive but expressive LLM, which generates the ultimate answer based on the retrieved information. Building on this general framework, we further optimize MemoRAG's performance by enhancing its cluing mechanism and memorization capacity. In our experiment, MemoRAG achieves superior performance across a variety of evaluation tasks, including both complex ones where conventional RAG fails and straightforward ones where RAG is commonly applied.

### Improving Factuality in Large Language Models via Decoding-Time   Hallucinatory and Truthful Comparators
**Authors**: Dingkang Yang, Dongling Xiao, Jinjie Wei, Mingcheng Li, Zhaoyu Chen, Ke Li, Lihua Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T13:10:50Z

**Summary**: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generate responses that contradict verifiable facts, i.e., unfaithful hallucination content. Existing efforts generally focus on optimizing model parameters or editing semantic representations, which compromise the internal factual knowledge of target LLMs. In addition, hallucinations typically exhibit multifaceted patterns in downstream tasks, limiting the model's holistic performance across tasks. In this paper, we propose a Comparator-driven Decoding-Time (CDT) framework to alleviate the response hallucination. Firstly, we construct hallucinatory and truthful comparators with multi-task fine-tuning samples. In this case, we present an instruction prototype-guided mixture of experts strategy to enhance the ability of the corresponding comparators to capture different hallucination or truthfulness patterns in distinct task instructions. CDT constrains next-token predictions to factuality-robust distributions by contrasting the logit differences between the target LLMs and these comparators. Systematic experiments on multiple downstream tasks show that our framework can significantly improve the model performance and response factuality.

### LEROjD: Lidar Extended Radar-Only Object Detection
**Authors**: Patrick Palmer, Martin Krüger, Stefan Schütte, Richard Altendorfer, Ganesh Adam, Torsten Bertram

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T12:43:25Z

**Summary**: Accurate 3D object detection is vital for automated driving. While lidar sensors are well suited for this task, they are expensive and have limitations in adverse weather conditions. 3+1D imaging radar sensors offer a cost-effective, robust alternative but face challenges due to their low resolution and high measurement noise. Existing 3+1D imaging radar datasets include radar and lidar data, enabling cross-modal model improvements. Although lidar should not be used during inference, it can aid the training of radar-only object detectors. We explore two strategies to transfer knowledge from the lidar to the radar domain and radar-only object detectors: 1. multi-stage training with sequential lidar point cloud thin-out, and 2. cross-modal knowledge distillation. In the multi-stage process, three thin-out methods are examined. Our results show significant performance gains of up to 4.2 percentage points in mean Average Precision with multi-stage training and up to 3.9 percentage points with knowledge distillation by initializing the student with the teacher's weights. The main benefit of these approaches is their applicability to other 3D object detection networks without altering their architecture, as we show by analyzing it on two different object detectors. Our code is available at https://github.com/rst-tu-dortmund/lerojd

### CMMMU: A Chinese Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding   Benchmark

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T12:38:11Z

**Summary**: As the capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) continue to advance, evaluating the performance of LMMs emerges as an increasing need. Additionally, there is an even larger gap in evaluating the advanced knowledge and reasoning abilities of LMMs in non-English contexts such as Chinese. We introduce CMMMU, a new Chinese Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs on tasks demanding college-level subject knowledge and deliberate reasoning in a Chinese context. CMMMU is inspired by and strictly follows the annotation and analysis pattern of MMMU. CMMMU includes 12k manually collected multimodal questions from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks, covering six core disciplines: Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering, like its companion, MMMU. These questions span 30 subjects and comprise 39 highly heterogeneous image types, such as charts, diagrams, maps, tables, music sheets, and chemical structures. CMMMU focuses on complex perception and reasoning with domain-specific knowledge in the Chinese context. We evaluate 11 open-source LLMs and one proprietary GPT-4V(ision). Even GPT-4V only achieves accuracies of 42%, indicating a large space for improvement. CMMMU will boost the community to build the next-generation LMMs towards expert artificial intelligence and promote the democratization of LMMs by providing diverse language contexts.

### Self-convolved Bootstrap for M-regression under Complex Temporal   Dynamics
**Authors**: Miaoshiqi Liu, Zhou Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T12:37:44Z

**Summary**: The paper considers simultaneous nonparametric inference for a wide class of M-regression models with time-varying coefficients. The covariates and errors of the regression model are tackled as a general class of nonstationary time series and are allowed to be cross-dependent. A novel and easy-to-implement self-convolved bootstrap procedure is proposed. With only one tuning parameter, the bootstrap facilitates a $\sqrt{n}$-consistent inference of the cumulative regression function for the M-estimators under complex temporal dynamics, even under the possible presence of breakpoints in time series. Our methodology leads to a unified framework to conduct general classes of Exact Function Tests, Lack-of-fit Tests, and Qualitative Tests for the time-varying coefficients. These tests enable one to, among many others, conduct variable selection, check for constancy and linearity, as well as verify shape assumptions, including monotonicity and convexity. As applications, our method is utilized to study the time-varying properties of global climate data and Microsoft stock return, respectively.

### R-SFLLM: Jamming Resilient Framework for Split Federated Learning with   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Aladin Djuhera, Vlad C. Andrei, Xinyang Li, Ullrich J. Mönich, Holger Boche, Walid Saad

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T12:36:29Z

**Summary**: Split federated learning (SFL) is a compute-efficient paradigm in distributed machine learning (ML), where components of large ML models are outsourced to remote servers. A significant challenge in SFL, particularly when deployed over wireless channels, is the susceptibility of transmitted model parameters to adversarial jamming that could jeopardize the learning process. This is particularly pronounced for word embedding parameters in large language models (LLMs), which are crucial for language understanding. In this paper, rigorous insights are provided into the influence of jamming LLM word embeddings in SFL by deriving an expression for the ML training loss divergence and showing that it is upper-bounded by the mean squared error (MSE). Based on this analysis, a physical layer framework is developed for resilient SFL with LLMs (R-SFLLM) over wireless networks. R-SFLLM leverages wireless sensing data to gather information on the jamming directions-of-arrival (DoAs) for the purpose of devising a novel, sensing-assisted anti-jamming strategy while jointly optimizing beamforming, user scheduling, and resource allocation. Extensive experiments using BERT and RoBERTa models demonstrate R-SFLLM's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks and datasets. The proposed methodology further introduces an adversarial training component, where controlled noise exposure significantly enhances the LLM's resilience to perturbed parameters during training. The results show that more noise-sensitive models, such as RoBERTa, benefit from this feature, especially when resource allocation is unfair. It is also shown that worst-case jamming in particular translates into worst-case model outcomes, thereby necessitating the need for jamming-resilient SFL protocols.

### CauseJudger: Identifying the Cause with LLMs for Abductive Logical   Reasoning
**Authors**: Jinwei He, Feng Lu

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T12:30:43Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been utilized in solving diverse reasoning tasks, encompassing common sense, arithmetic and deduction tasks. However, with difficulties of reversing thinking patterns and irrelevant premises, how to determine the authenticity of the cause in abductive logical reasoning remains underexplored. Inspired by hypothesis and verification method and identification of irrelevant information in human thinking process, we propose a new framework for LLMs abductive logical reasoning called CauseJudger (CJ), which identifies the authenticity of possible cause by transforming thinking from reverse to forward and removing irrelevant information. In addition, we construct an abductive logical reasoning dataset for decision task called CauseLogics, which contains 200,000 tasks of varying reasoning lengths. Our experiments show the efficiency of CJ with overall experiments and ablation experiments as well as case studies on our dataset and reconstructed public dataset. Notably, CJ's implementation is efficient, requiring only two calls to LLM. Its impact is profound: when using gpt-3.5, CJ achieves a maximum correctness improvement of 41% compared to Zero-Shot-CoT. Moreover, with gpt-4, CJ attains an accuracy exceeding 90% across all datasets.

### SciAgents: Automating scientific discovery through multi-agent   intelligent graph reasoning
**Authors**: Alireza Ghafarollahi, Markus J. Buehler

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T12:25:10Z

**Summary**: A key challenge in artificial intelligence is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in vast scientific data. In this work, we present SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts: (1) the use of large-scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi-agent systems with in-situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses traditional human-driven research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the intelligent system yields material discoveries, critique and improve existing hypotheses, retrieve up-to-date data about existing research, and highlights their strengths and limitations. Our case studies demonstrate scalable capabilities to combine generative AI, ontological representations, and multi-agent modeling, harnessing a `swarm of intelligence' similar to biological systems. This provides new avenues for materials discovery and accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles.

### Dynamics in the nonequilibrium energy landscape of a frustrated Mott   insulator
**Authors**: Sankha Subhra Bakshi, Tanmoy Mondal, Pinaki Majumdar

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T12:22:38Z

**Summary**: In a Mott insulator, a laser pulse with frequency tuned to the gap scale can create a holon-doublon plasma, suppressing the magnetic moment ${\vec m}_i$ and destroying magnetic order. While this disruptive effect is well established experimentally on a square lattice, we investigate the effect of laser pumping on the triangular lattice, where geometric frustration leads to a richer set of ordering possibilities. We work with the Mott-Hubbard problem at a coupling where $120^{\circ}$ order is just stable and employ spatio-temporal mean field dynamics to study the pump response. Moderate pump amplitude just leads to the reduction of $120^{\circ}$ order, but at larger amplitude the suppression of $120^{\circ}$ order is followed by the appearance of `spiral order'. On the electronic side the density of `excited carriers' $n_{exc}$ in the upper Hubbard band increases monotonically with pump amplitude. We show that the long time ordering possibilities in the pumped system, e.g., the emergence of spiral order, can be inferred from a nonequilibrium `energy landscape'. We analyse the growth of spiral order by using an exact diagonalisation based Langevin equation on large lattices and discover that the new order can take $\sim 10^3-10^4$ times the electronic timescale to appear. The threefold combination, of mean field dynamics, landscape construction, and Langevin dynamics, readily generalises to the search for pump induced `hidden order' in other gapped systems.

### No Captions, No Problem: Captionless 3D-CLIP Alignment with Hard   Negatives via CLIP Knowledge and LLMs
**Authors**: Cristian Sbrolli, Matteo Matteucci

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T12:04:27Z

**Summary**: In this study, we explore an alternative approach to enhance contrastive text-image-3D alignment in the absence of textual descriptions for 3D objects. We introduce two unsupervised methods, $I2I$ and $(I2L)^2$, which leverage CLIP knowledge about textual and 2D data to compute the neural perceived similarity between two 3D samples. We employ the proposed methods to mine 3D hard negatives, establishing a multimodal contrastive pipeline with hard negative weighting via a custom loss function. We train on different configurations of the proposed hard negative mining approach, and we evaluate the accuracy of our models in 3D classification and on the cross-modal retrieval benchmark, testing image-to-shape and shape-to-image retrieval. Results demonstrate that our approach, even without explicit text alignment, achieves comparable or superior performance on zero-shot and standard 3D classification, while significantly improving both image-to-shape and shape-to-image retrieval compared to previous methods.

### Double Machine Learning for Static Panel Models with Fixed Effects
**Authors**: Paul Clarke, Annalivia Polselli

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T12:00:58Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in causal inference have seen the development of methods which make use of the predictive power of machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we use these algorithms to approximate high-dimensional and non-linear nuisance functions of the confounders and double machine learning (DML) to make inferences about the effects of policy interventions from panel data. We propose new estimators by extending correlated random effects, within-group and first-difference estimation for linear models to an extension of Robinson (1988)'s partially linear regression model to static panel data models with individual fixed effects and unspecified non-linear confounding effects. We provide an illustrative example of DML for observational panel data showing the impact of the introduction of the minimum wage on voting behaviour in the UK.

**Authors**: Xianfu Chen, Celimuge Wu, Yi Shen, Yusheng Ji, Tsutomu Yoshinaga, Qiang Ni, Charilaos C. Zarakovitis, Honggang Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T11:38:24Z

**Summary**: This article investigates a control system within the context of six-generation wireless networks. The control performance optimization confronts the technical challenges that arise from the intricate interactions between communication and control sub-systems, asking for a co-design. Accounting for the system dynamics, we formulate the sequential co-design decision-makings of communication and control over the discrete time horizon as a Markov decision process, for which a practical offline learning framework is proposed. Our proposed framework integrates large language models into the elements of reinforcement learning. We present a case study on the age of semantics-aware communication and control co-design to showcase the potentials from our proposed learning framework. Furthermore, we discuss the open issues remaining to make our proposed offline learning framework feasible for real-world implementations, and highlight the research directions for future explorations.

### Bootstrapping Estimators based on the Block Maxima Method
**Authors**: Axel Bücher, Torben Staud

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T11:37:32Z

**Summary**: The block maxima method is a standard approach for analyzing the extremal behavior of a potentially multivariate time series. It has recently been found that the classical approach based on disjoint block maxima may be universally improved by considering sliding block maxima instead. However, the asymptotic variance formula for estimators based on sliding block maxima involves an integral over the covariance of a certain family of multivariate extreme value distributions, which makes its estimation, and inference in general, an intricate problem. As an alternative, one may rely on bootstrap approximations: we show that naive block-bootstrap approaches from time series analysis are inconsistent even in i.i.d.\ situations, and provide a consistent alternative based on resampling circular block maxima. As a by-product, we show consistency of the classical resampling bootstrap for disjoint block maxima, and that estimators based on circular block maxima have the same asymptotic variance as their sliding block maxima counterparts. The finite sample properties are illustrated by Monte Carlo experiments, and the methods are demonstrated by a case study of precipitation extremes.

### AnyMatch -- Efficient Zero-Shot Entity Matching with a Small Language   Model
**Authors**: Zeyu Zhang, Paul Groth, Iacer Calixto, Sebastian Schelter

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T11:33:00Z

**Summary**: Entity matching (EM) is the problem of determining whether two records refer to same real-world entity, which is crucial in data integration, e.g., for product catalogs or address databases. A major drawback of many EM approaches is their dependence on labelled examples. We thus focus on the challenging setting of zero-shot entity matching where no labelled examples are available for an unseen target dataset. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results for zero-shot EM, but their low throughput and high deployment cost limit their applicability and scalability.   We revisit the zero-shot EM problem with AnyMatch, a small language model fine-tuned in a transfer learning setup. We propose several novel data selection techniques to generate fine-tuning data for our model, e.g., by selecting difficult pairs to match via an AutoML filter, by generating additional attribute-level examples, and by controlling label imbalance in the data.   We conduct an extensive evaluation of the prediction quality and deployment cost of our model, in a comparison to thirteen baselines on nine benchmark datasets. We find that AnyMatch provides competitive prediction quality despite its small parameter size: it achieves the second-highest F1 score overall, and outperforms several other approaches that employ models with hundreds of billions of parameters. Furthermore, our approach exhibits major cost benefits: the average prediction quality of AnyMatch is within 4.4% of the state-of-the-art method MatchGPT with the proprietary trillion-parameter model GPT-4, yet AnyMatch requires four orders of magnitude less parameters and incurs a 3,899 times lower inference cost (in dollars per 1,000 tokens).

### Harmonic Reasoning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Anna Kruspe

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T11:28:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming very popular and are used for many different purposes, including creative tasks in the arts. However, these models sometimes have trouble with specific reasoning tasks, especially those that involve logical thinking and counting. This paper looks at how well LLMs understand and reason when dealing with musical tasks like figuring out notes from intervals and identifying chords and scales. We tested GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o to see how they handle these tasks. Our results show that while LLMs do well with note intervals, they struggle with more complicated tasks like recognizing chords and scales. This points out clear limits in current LLM abilities and shows where we need to make them better, which could help improve how they think and work in both artistic and other complex areas. We also provide an automatically generated benchmark data set for the described tasks.

**Authors**: Xuanwang Zhang, Yunze Song, Yidong Wang, Shuyun Tang, Xinfeng Li, Zhengran Zeng, Zhen Wu, Wei Ye, Wenyuan Xu, Yue Zhang, Xinyu Dai, Shikun Zhang, Qingsong Wen

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T11:18:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level capabilities in dialogue, reasoning, and knowledge retention. However, even the most advanced LLMs face challenges such as hallucinations and real-time updating of their knowledge. Current research addresses this bottleneck by equipping LLMs with external knowledge, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, two key issues constrained the development of RAG. First, there is a growing lack of comprehensive and fair comparisons between novel RAG algorithms. Second, open-source tools such as LlamaIndex and LangChain employ high-level abstractions, which results in a lack of transparency and limits the ability to develop novel algorithms and evaluation metrics. To close this gap, we introduce RAGLAB, a modular and research-oriented open-source library. RAGLAB reproduces 6 existing algorithms and provides a comprehensive ecosystem for investigating RAG algorithms. Leveraging RAGLAB, we conduct a fair comparison of 6 RAG algorithms across 10 benchmarks. With RAGLAB, researchers can efficiently compare the performance of various algorithms and develop novel algorithms.

### Enhancing Critical Thinking in Education by means of a Socratic Chatbot
**Authors**: Lucile Favero, Juan Antonio Pérez-Ortiz, Tanja Käser, Nuria Oliver

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T11:09:28Z

**Summary**: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly playing a pivotal role in education by providing instantaneous, adaptive responses, their potential to promote critical thinking remains understudied. In this paper, we fill such a gap and present an innovative educational chatbot designed to foster critical thinking through Socratic questioning. Unlike traditional intelligent tutoring systems, including educational chatbots, that tend to offer direct answers, the proposed Socratic tutor encourages students to explore various perspectives and engage in self-reflection by posing structured, thought-provoking questions. Our Socratic questioning is implemented by fine and prompt-tuning the open-source pretrained LLM with a specialized dataset that stimulates critical thinking and offers multiple viewpoints. In an effort to democratize access and to protect the students' privacy, the proposed tutor is based on small LLMs (Llama2 7B and 13B-parameter models) that are able to run locally on off-the-shelf hardware. We validate our approach in a battery of experiments consisting of interactions between a simulated student and the chatbot to evaluate its effectiveness in enhancing critical thinking skills. Results indicate that the Socratic tutor supports the development of reflection and critical thinking significantly better than standard chatbots. Our approach opens the door for improving educational outcomes by cultivating active learning and encouraging intellectual autonomy.

**Authors**: Q. Gontier, C. Tsigros, F. Horlin, J. Wiart, C. Oestges, P. De Doncker

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T09:50:13Z

**Summary**: Stochastic geometry is a highly studied field in telecommunications as in many other scientific fields. In the last ten years in particular, theoretical knowledge has evolved a lot, whether for the calculation of metrics to characterize interference, coverage, energy or spectral efficiency, or exposure to electromagnetic fields. Many spatial point process models have been developed but are often left aside because of their unfamiliarity, their lack of tractability in favor of the Poisson point process or the regular lattice, easier to use. This article is intended to be a short guide presenting a complete and simple methodology to follow to infer a real stationary macro antenna network using tractable spatial models. The focus is mainly on repulsive point processes and in particular on determinantal point processes which are among the most tractable repulsive point processes. This methodology is applied on Belgian and French cell towers. The results show that for all stationary distributions in France and Belgium, the best inference model is the $\beta$-Ginibre point process.

### Bayesian Inference General Procedures for A Single-subject Test Study
**Authors**: Jie Li, Gary Green, Sarah J. A. Carr, Peng Liu, Jian Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T09:46:04Z

**Summary**: Abnormality detection in the identification of a single-subject which deviates from the majority of the dataset that comes from a control group is a critical problem. A common approach is to assume that the control group can be characterised in terms of standard Normal statistics and the detection of single abnormal subject is in that context. But in many situations the control group can not be described in terms of Gaussian statistics and the use of standard statistics is inappropriate. This paper presents a Bayesian Inference General Procedures for A Single-Subject Test (BIGPAST), designed to mitigate the effects of skewness under the assumption that the dataset of control group comes from the skewed Student's \( t \) distribution. BIGPAST operates under the null hypothesis that the single-subject follows the same distribution as the control group. We assess BIGPAST's performance against other methods through a series of simulation studies. The results demonstrate that BIGPAST is robust against deviations from normality and outperforms the existing approaches in terms of accuracy. This is because BIGPAST can effectively reduce model misspecification errors under the skewed Student's \( t \) assumption. We apply BIGPAST to a MEG dataset consisting of an individual with mild traumatic brain injury and an age and gender-matched control group, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting abnormalities in the single-subject.

### Federated Transfer Learning Based Cooperative Wideband Spectrum Sensing   with Model Pruning
**Authors**: Jibin Jia, Peihao Dong, Fuhui Zhou, Qihui Wu

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T09:42:46Z

**Summary**: For ultra-wideband and high-rate wireless communication systems, wideband spectrum sensing (WSS) is critical, since it empowers secondary users (SUs) to capture the spectrum holes for opportunistic transmission. However, WSS encounters challenges such as excessive costs of hardware and computation due to the high sampling rate, as well as robustness issues arising from scenario mismatch. In this paper, a WSS neural network (WSSNet) is proposed by exploiting multicoset preprocessing to enable the sub-Nyquist sampling, with the two dimensional convolution design specifically tailored to work with the preprocessed samples. A federated transfer learning (FTL) based framework mobilizing multiple SUs is further developed to achieve a robust model adaptable to various scenarios, which is paved by the selective weight pruning for the fast model adaptation and inference. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FTL-WSSNet achieves the fairly good performance in different target scenarios even without local adaptation samples.

### Beyond Flatland: A Geometric Take on Matching Methods for Treatment   Effect Estimation
**Authors**: Melanie F. Pradier, Javier González

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T09:39:47Z

**Summary**: Matching is a popular approach in causal inference to estimate treatment effects by pairing treated and control units that are most similar in terms of their covariate information. However, classic matching methods completely ignore the geometry of the data manifold, which is crucial to define a meaningful distance for matching, and struggle when covariates are noisy and high-dimensional. In this work, we propose GeoMatching, a matching method to estimate treatment effects that takes into account the intrinsic data geometry induced by existing causal mechanisms among the confounding variables. First, we learn a low-dimensional, latent Riemannian manifold that accounts for uncertainty and geometry of the original input data. Second, we estimate treatment effects via matching in the latent space based on the learned latent Riemannian metric. We provide theoretical insights and empirical results in synthetic and real-world scenarios, demonstrating that GeoMatching yields more effective treatment effect estimators, even as we increase input dimensionality, in the presence of outliers, or in semi-supervised scenarios.

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T09:31:30Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkably powerful capabilities. One of the crucial factors to achieve success is aligning the LLM's output with human preferences. This alignment process often requires only a small amount of data to efficiently enhance the LLM's performance. While effective, research in this area spans multiple domains, and the methods involved are relatively complex to understand. The relationships between different methods have been under-explored, limiting the development of the preference alignment. In light of this, we break down the existing popular alignment strategies into different components and provide a unified framework to study the current alignment strategies, thereby establishing connections among them. In this survey, we decompose all the strategies in preference learning into four components: model, data, feedback, and algorithm. This unified view offers an in-depth understanding of existing alignment algorithms and also opens up possibilities to synergize the strengths of different strategies. Furthermore, we present detailed working examples of prevalent existing algorithms to facilitate a comprehensive understanding for the readers. Finally, based on our unified perspective, we explore the challenges and future research directions for aligning large language models with human preferences.

### Representational Analysis of Binding in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Qin Dai, Benjamin Heinzerling, Kentaro Inui

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T09:04:56Z

**Summary**: Entity tracking is essential for complex reasoning. To perform in-context entity tracking, language models (LMs) must bind an entity to its attribute (e.g., bind a container to its content) to recall attribute for a given entity. For example, given a context mentioning ``The coffee is in Box Z, the stone is in Box M, the map is in Box H'', to infer ``Box Z contains the coffee'' later, LMs must bind ``Box Z'' to ``coffee''. To explain the binding behaviour of LMs, Feng and Steinhardt (2023) introduce a Binding ID mechanism and state that LMs use a abstract concept called Binding ID (BI) to internally mark entity-attribute pairs. However, they have not directly captured the BI determinant information from entity activations. In this work, we provide a novel view of the Binding ID mechanism by localizing the prototype of BI information. Specifically, we discover that there exists a low-rank subspace in the hidden state (or activation) of LMs, that primarily encodes the order of entity and attribute and which is used as the prototype of BI to causally determine the binding. To identify this subspace, we choose principle component analysis as our first attempt and it is empirically proven to be effective. Moreover, we also discover that when editing representations along directions in the subspace, LMs tend to bind a given entity to other attributes accordingly. For example, by patching activations along the BI encoding direction we can make the LM to infer ``Box Z contains the stone'' and ``Box Z contains the map''.

### Cross-Sectional Dynamics Under Network Structure: Theory and   Macroeconomic Applications
**Authors**: Marko Mlikota

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T08:58:17Z

**Summary**: Many environments in economics feature a cross-section of units linked by bilateral ties. I develop a framework for studying dynamics of cross-sectional variables that exploits this network structure. The Network-VAR (NVAR) is a vector autoregression in which innovations transmit cross-sectionally via bilateral links and which can accommodate rich patterns of how network effects of higher order accumulate over time. It can be used to estimate dynamic network effects, with the network given or inferred from dynamic cross-correlations in the data. It also offers a dimensionality-reduction technique for modeling high-dimensional (cross-sectional) processes, owing to networks' ability to summarize complex relations among variables (units) by relatively few bilateral links. In a first application, consistent with an RBC economy with lagged input-output conversion, I estimate how sectoral productivity shocks transmit along supply chains and affect sectoral prices in the US economy. In a second application, I forecast monthly industrial production growth across 44 countries by assuming and estimating a network underlying the dynamics. This reduces out-of-sample mean squared errors by up to 23% relative to a factor model, consistent with an equivalence result I derive.

**Summary**: This paper explores the potential for leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in the realm of online advertising systems. We introduce a general framework for LLM advertisement, consisting of modification, bidding, prediction, and auction modules. Different design considerations for each module are presented. These design choices are evaluated and discussed based on essential desiderata required to maintain a sustainable system. Further fundamental questions regarding practicality, efficiency, and implementation challenges are raised for future research. Finally, we exposit how recent approaches on mechanism design for LLM can be framed in our unified perspective.

### Intelligent tutoring systems by Bayesian nets with noisy gates
**Authors**: Alessandro Antonucci, Francesca Mangili, Claudio Bonesana, Giorgia Adorni

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T08:55:22Z

**Summary**: Directed graphical models such as Bayesian nets are often used to implement intelligent tutoring systems able to interact in real-time with learners in a purely automatic way. When coping with such models, keeping a bound on the number of parameters might be important for multiple reasons. First, as these models are typically based on expert knowledge, a huge number of parameters to elicit might discourage practitioners from adopting them. Moreover, the number of model parameters affects the complexity of the inferences, while a fast computation of the queries is needed for real-time feedback. We advocate logical gates with uncertainty for a compact parametrization of the conditional probability tables in the underlying Bayesian net used by tutoring systems. We discuss the semantics of the model parameters to elicit and the assumptions required to apply such approach in this domain. We also derive a dedicated inference scheme to speed up computations.

### Maximum likelihood estimation in the ergodic Volterra Ornstein-Uhlenbeck   process
**Authors**: Mohamed Ben Alaya, Martin Friesen, Jonas Kremer

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T08:39:53Z

**Summary**: We study statistical inference of the drift parameters for the Volterra Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on R in the ergodic regime. For continuous-time observations, we derive the corresponding maximum likelihood estimators and show that they are strongly consistent and asymptotically normal locally uniformly in the parameters. For the case of discrete high-frequency observations, we prove similar results by discretization of the continuous-time maximum likelihood estimator. Finally, for discrete low-frequency observations, we show that the method of moments is consistent. Our proofs are crucially based on the law of large numbers.

### Density and speed of sound of (iodobenzene + n-alkane) liquid mixtures   at $T$ = (288.15 to 308.15) K. Application of the Prigogine-Flory-Patterson   model
**Authors**: Fernando Hevia, Daniel Lozano-Martín, Juan Antonio González, Luis Felipe Sanz, Isaías García de la Fuente, José Carlos Cobos

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T08:23:13Z

**Summary**: (Iodobenzene + n-alkane) liquid mixtures have been studied experimentally, in terms of densities and speeds of sound at a pressure $p$ = 0.1 MPa and in the temperature range $T$ = (288.15 to 308.15) K, and theoretically, by the application of the Prigogine-Flory-Patterson (PFP) model. The n-alkanes considered are n-heptane, n-decane, n-dodecane, and n-tetradecane. Excess molar volumes ($V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$) and excess isentropic compressibilities ($\kappa_S^{\text{E}}$) have been calculated and correlated by Redlich-Kister polynomials. ${(\partial{V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}}/\partial T)}_p$ curves at the same (p,T) conditions have been obtained from correlated $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values. From these experimental results and the knowledge of the excess molar enthalpies and volumes of mixtures containing fluorobenzene, chlorobenzene or bromobenzene with n-alkanes, we have inferred: (i) the presence of structural effects, especially important for the n-heptane mixture and less relevant for volumetric properties as the length of the n-alkane increases; and (ii) that the interactional effects on $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ do not vary appreciably with the length of the n-alkane, so the observed $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ variation is fundamentally determined by the corresponding variation of the contribution from structural effects. The application of the PFP model supports this interpretation, providing free volume contributions to $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ that vary parallelly to $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ with the length of the n-alkane, and interactional contributions that rest approximately constant independently of the n-alkane size.

### Natural Language Processing RELIES on Linguistics
**Authors**: Juri Opitz, Shira Wein, Nathan Schneider

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T08:21:13Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become capable of generating highly fluent text in certain languages, without modules specially designed to capture grammar or semantic coherence. What does this mean for the future of linguistic expertise in NLP? We highlight several aspects in which NLP (still) relies on linguistics, or where linguistic thinking can illuminate new directions. We argue our case around the acronym RELIES that encapsulates six major facets where linguistics contributes to NLP: Resources, Evaluation, Low-resource settings, Interpretability, Explanation, and the Study of language. This list is not exhaustive, nor is linguistics the main point of reference for every effort under these themes; but at a macro level, these facets highlight the enduring importance of studying machine systems vis-\`a-vis systems of human language.

### Errors-In-Variables Model Fitting for Partially Unpaired Data Utilizing   Mixture Models
**Authors**: Wolfgang Hoegele, Sarah Brockhaus

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T08:19:00Z

**Summary**: We introduce a general framework for regression in the errors-in-variables regime, allowing for full flexibility about the dimensionality of the data, observational error probability density types, the (nonlinear) model type and the avoidance of ad-hoc definitions of loss functions. In this framework, we introduce model fitting for partially unpaired data, i.e. for given data groups the pairing information of input and output is lost (semi-supervised). This is achieved by constructing mixture model densities, which directly model the loss of pairing information allowing inference. In a numerical simulation study linear and nonlinear model fits are illustrated as well as a real data study is presented based on life expectancy data from the world bank utilizing a multiple linear regression model. These results show that high quality model fitting is possible with partially unpaired data, which opens the possibility for new applications with unfortunate or deliberate loss of pairing information in data.

### CipherDM: Secure Three-Party Inference for Diffusion Model Sampling
**Authors**: Xin Zhao, Xiaojun Chen, Xudong Chen, He Li, Tingyu Fan, Zhendong Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T08:16:17Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results in image generation and have been applied to various fields. However, DMs sometimes seriously violate user privacy during usage, making the protection of privacy an urgent issue. Using traditional privacy computing schemes like Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) directly in DMs faces significant computation and communication challenges. To address these issues, we propose CipherDM, the first novel, versatile and universal framework applying MPC technology to DMs for secure sampling, which can be widely implemented on multiple DM based tasks. We thoroughly analyze sampling latency breakdown, find time-consuming parts and design corresponding secure MPC protocols for computing nonlinear activations including SoftMax, SiLU and Mish. CipherDM is evaluated on popular architectures (DDPM, DDIM) using MNIST dataset and on SD deployed by diffusers. Compared to direct implementation on SPU, our approach improves running time by approximately 1.084\times \sim 2.328\times, and reduces communication costs by approximately 1.212\times \sim 1.791\times.

### Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Models with LLM-Based Agents
**Authors**: Yingkai Dong, Zheng Li, Xiangtao Meng, Ning Yu, Shanqing Guo

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T08:09:14Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements have significantly improved automated task-solving capabilities using autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). However, most LLM-based agents focus on dialogue, programming, or specialized domains, leaving their potential for addressing generative AI safety tasks largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose Atlas, an advanced LLM-based multi-agent framework targeting generative AI models, specifically focusing on jailbreak attacks against text-to-image (T2I) models with built-in safety filters. Atlas consists of two agents, namely the mutation agent and the selection agent, each comprising four key modules: a vision-language model (VLM) or LLM brain, planning, memory, and tool usage. The mutation agent uses its VLM brain to determine whether a prompt triggers the T2I model's safety filter. It then collaborates iteratively with the LLM brain of the selection agent to generate new candidate jailbreak prompts with the highest potential to bypass the filter. In addition to multi-agent communication, we leverage in-context learning (ICL) memory mechanisms and the chain-of-thought (COT) approach to learn from past successes and failures, thereby enhancing Atlas's performance. Our evaluation demonstrates that Atlas successfully jailbreaks several state-of-the-art T2I models equipped with multi-modal safety filters in a black-box setting. Additionally, Atlas outperforms existing methods in both query efficiency and the quality of generated images. This work convincingly demonstrates the successful application of LLM-based agents in studying the safety vulnerabilities of popular text-to-image generation models. We urge the community to consider advanced techniques like ours in response to the rapidly evolving text-to-image generation field.

### KRONC: Keypoint-based Robust Camera Optimization for 3D Car   Reconstruction
**Authors**: Davide Di Nucci, Alessandro Simoni, Matteo Tomei, Luca Ciuffreda, Roberto Vezzani, Rita Cucchiara

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T08:08:05Z

**Summary**: The three-dimensional representation of objects or scenes starting from a set of images has been a widely discussed topic for years and has gained additional attention after the diffusion of NeRF-based approaches. However, an underestimated prerequisite is the knowledge of camera poses or, more specifically, the estimation of the extrinsic calibration parameters. Although excellent general-purpose Structure-from-Motion methods are available as a pre-processing step, their computational load is high and they require a lot of frames to guarantee sufficient overlapping among the views. This paper introduces KRONC, a novel approach aimed at inferring view poses by leveraging prior knowledge about the object to reconstruct and its representation through semantic keypoints. With a focus on vehicle scenes, KRONC is able to estimate the position of the views as a solution to a light optimization problem targeting the convergence of keypoints' back-projections to a singular point. To validate the method, a specific dataset of real-world car scenes has been collected. Experiments confirm KRONC's ability to generate excellent estimates of camera poses starting from very coarse initialization. Results are comparable with Structure-from-Motion methods with huge savings in computation. Code and data will be made publicly available.

### Reinforcement Unlearning
**Authors**: Dayong Ye, Tianqing Zhu, Congcong Zhu, Derui Wang, Kun Gao, Zewei Shi, Sheng Shen, Wanlei Zhou, Minhui Xue

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T08:07:43Z

**Summary**: Machine unlearning refers to the process of mitigating the influence of specific training data on machine learning models based on removal requests from data owners. However, one important area that has been largely overlooked in the research of unlearning is reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning focuses on training an agent to make optimal decisions within an environment to maximize its cumulative rewards. During the training, the agent tends to memorize the features of the environment, which raises a significant concern about privacy. As per data protection regulations, the owner of the environment holds the right to revoke access to the agent's training data, thus necessitating the development of a novel and pressing research field, known as \emph{reinforcement unlearning}. Reinforcement unlearning focuses on revoking entire environments rather than individual data samples. This unique characteristic presents three distinct challenges: 1) how to propose unlearning schemes for environments; 2) how to avoid degrading the agent's performance in remaining environments; and 3) how to evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning. To tackle these challenges, we propose two reinforcement unlearning methods. The first method is based on decremental reinforcement learning, which aims to erase the agent's previously acquired knowledge gradually. The second method leverages environment poisoning attacks, which encourage the agent to learn new, albeit incorrect, knowledge to remove the unlearning environment. Particularly, to tackle the third challenge, we introduce the concept of ``environment inference attack'' to evaluate the unlearning outcomes.

### DFabric: Scaling Out Data Parallel Applications with CXL-Ethernet Hybrid   Interconnects
**Authors**: Xu Zhang, Ke Liu, Yisong Chang, Hui Yuan, Xiaolong Zheng, Ke Zhang, Mingyu Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T08:05:43Z

**Summary**: Emerging interconnects, such as CXL and NVLink, have been integrated into the intra-host topology to scale more accelerators and facilitate efficient communication between them, such as GPUs. To keep pace with the accelerator's growing computing throughput, the interconnect has seen substantial enhancement in link bandwidth, e.g., 256GBps for CXL 3.0 links, which surpasses Ethernet and InfiniBand network links by an order of magnitude or more. Consequently, when data-intensive jobs, such as LLM training, scale across multiple hosts beyond the reach limit of the interconnect, the performance is significantly hindered by the limiting bandwidth of the network infrastructure. We address the problem by proposing DFabric, a two-tier interconnect architecture. We address the problem by proposing DFabric, a two-tier interconnect architecture. First, DFabric disaggregates rack's computing units with an interconnect fabric, i.e., CXL fabric, which scales at rack-level, so that they can enjoy intra-rack efficient interconnecting. Second, DFabric disaggregates NICs from hosts, and consolidates them to form a NIC pool with CXL fabric. By providing sufficient aggregated capacity comparable to interconnect bandwidth, the NIC pool bridges efficient communication across racks or beyond the reach limit of interconnect fabric. However, the local memory accessing becomes the bottleneck when enabling each host to utilize the NIC pool efficiently. To the end, DFabric builds a memory pool with sufficient bandwidth by disaggregating host local memory and adding more memory devices. We have implemented a prototype of DFabric that can run applications transparently. We validated its performance gain by running various microbenchmarks and compute-intensive applications such as DNN and graph.

### Sequential Posterior Sampling with Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Tristan S. W. Stevens, Oisín Nolan, Jean-Luc Robert, Ruud J. G. van Sloun

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T07:55:59Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have quickly risen in popularity for their ability to model complex distributions and perform effective posterior sampling. Unfortunately, the iterative nature of these generative models makes them computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time sequential inverse problems such as ultrasound imaging. Considering the strong temporal structure across sequences of frames, we propose a novel approach that models the transition dynamics to improve the efficiency of sequential diffusion posterior sampling in conditional image synthesis. Through modeling sequence data using a video vision transformer (ViViT) transition model based on previous diffusion outputs, we can initialize the reverse diffusion trajectory at a lower noise scale, greatly reducing the number of iterations required for convergence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world dataset of high frame rate cardiac ultrasound images and show that it achieves the same performance as a full diffusion trajectory while accelerating inference 25$\times$, enabling real-time posterior sampling. Furthermore, we show that the addition of a transition model improves the PSNR up to 8\% in cases with severe motion. Our method opens up new possibilities for real-time applications of diffusion models in imaging and other domains requiring real-time inference.

### Towards Building a Robust Knowledge Intensive Question Answering Model   with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Hong Xingyun Hong, Shao Yan Shao, Wang Zhilin Wang, Duan Manni Duan, Jin Xiongnan

**Updated**: 2024-09-10T06:11:28Z

**Summary**: The development of LLMs has greatly enhanced the intelligence and fluency of question answering, while the emergence of retrieval enhancement has enabled models to better utilize external information. However, the presence of noise and errors in retrieved information poses challenges to the robustness of LLMs. In this work, to evaluate the model's performance under multiple interferences, we first construct a dataset based on machine reading comprehension datasets simulating various scenarios, including critical information absence, noise, and conflicts. To address the issue of model accuracy decline caused by noisy external information, we propose a data augmentation-based fine-tuning method to enhance LLM's robustness against noise. Additionally, contrastive learning approach is utilized to preserve the model's discrimination capability of external information. We have conducted experiments on both existing LLMs and our approach, the results are evaluated by GPT-4, which indicates that our proposed methods improve model robustness while strengthening the model's discrimination capability.

### Seq1F1B: Efficient Sequence-Level Pipeline Parallelism for Large   Language Model Training
**Authors**: Ao Sun, Weilin Zhao, Xu Han, Cheng Yang, Xinrong Zhang, Zhiyuan Liu, Chuan Shi, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T07:31:36Z

**Summary**: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on distributed training strategies, among which pipeline parallelism plays a crucial role. As LLMs' training sequence length extends to 32k or even 128k, the current pipeline parallel methods face severe bottlenecks, including high memory footprints and substantial pipeline bubbles, greatly hindering model scalability and training throughput. To enhance memory efficiency and training throughput, in this work, we introduce an efficient sequence-level one-forward-one-backward (1F1B) pipeline scheduling method tailored for training LLMs on long sequences named Seq1F1B. Seq1F1B decomposes batch-level schedulable units into finer sequence-level units, reducing bubble size and memory footprint. Considering that Seq1F1B may produce slight extra bubbles if sequences are split evenly, we design a computation-wise strategy to partition input sequences and mitigate this side effect. Compared to competitive pipeline baseline methods such as Megatron 1F1B pipeline parallelism, our method achieves higher training throughput with less memory footprint. Notably, Seq1F1B efficiently trains a LLM with 30B parameters on sequences up to 64k using 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs without recomputation strategies, a feat unachievable with existing methods. Our source code is based on Megatron-LM, and now is avaiable at: https://github.com/MayDomine/Seq1F1B.git.

### GLAD: Towards Better Reconstruction with Global and Local Adaptive   Diffusion Models for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
**Authors**: Hang Yao, Ming Liu, Haolin Wang, Zhicun Yin, Zifei Yan, Xiaopeng Hong, Wangmeng Zuo

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T07:23:36Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have shown superior performance on unsupervised anomaly detection tasks. Since trained with normal data only, diffusion models tend to reconstruct normal counterparts of test images with certain noises added. However, these methods treat all potential anomalies equally, which may cause two main problems. From the global perspective, the difficulty of reconstructing images with different anomalies is uneven. Therefore, instead of utilizing the same setting for all samples, we propose to predict a particular denoising step for each sample by evaluating the difference between image contents and the priors extracted from diffusion models. From the local perspective, reconstructing abnormal regions differs from normal areas even in the same image. Theoretically, the diffusion model predicts a noise for each step, typically following a standard Gaussian distribution. However, due to the difference between the anomaly and its potential normal counterpart, the predicted noise in abnormal regions will inevitably deviate from the standard Gaussian distribution. To this end, we propose introducing synthetic abnormal samples in training to encourage the diffusion models to break through the limitation of standard Gaussian distribution, and a spatial-adaptive feature fusion scheme is utilized during inference. With the above modifications, we propose a global and local adaptive diffusion model (abbreviated to GLAD) for unsupervised anomaly detection, which introduces appealing flexibility and achieves anomaly-free reconstruction while retaining as much normal information as possible. Extensive experiments are conducted on three commonly used anomaly detection datasets (MVTec-AD, MPDD, and VisA) and a printed circuit board dataset (PCB-Bank) we integrated, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method.

**Summary**: Combining the public JWST/NIRCam imaging programs CEERS, PRIMER and JADES, spanning a total area of $\sim500\,{\rm arcmin}^2$, we obtain a sample of $>$30,000 galaxies at $z_{\rm phot}\sim4-9$ that allows us to perform a complete, rest-optical selected census of the galaxy population at $z>3$. Comparing the stellar mass $M_*$ and the UV-slope $\beta$ distributions between JWST- and HST-selected samples, we generally find very good agreement and no significant biases. Nevertheless, JWST enables us to probe a new population of UV-red galaxies that was missing from previous HST-based Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) samples. We measure galaxy stellar mass functions (SMFs) at $z\sim4-9$ down to limiting masses of $10^{7.5}-10^{8.5}\,{\rm M_\odot}$, finding steep low mass slopes over the entire redshift range, reaching values of $\alpha\approx-2$ at $z\gtrsim6$. At the high-mass end, UV-red galaxies dominate at least out to $z\sim6$. The implied redshift evolution of the SMF suggests a rapid build-up of massive dust-obscured or quiescent galaxies from $z\sim6$ to $z\sim4$ as well as an enhanced efficiency of star formation towards earlier times ($z\gtrsim6$). Finally, we show that the galaxy mass density grows by a factor $\sim20\times$ from $z\sim9$ to $z\sim4$. Our results emphasize the importance of rest-frame optically-selected samples in inferring accurate distributions of physical properties and studying the mass build-up of galaxies in the first 1.5 Gyr of cosmic history.

### AriGraph: Learning Knowledge Graph World Models with Episodic Memory for   LLM Agents
**Authors**: Petr Anokhin, Nikita Semenov, Artyom Sorokin, Dmitry Evseev, Mikhail Burtsev, Evgeny Burnaev

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T07:01:56Z

**Summary**: Advancements in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have created a promising foundation for developing autonomous agents. With the right tools, these agents could learn to solve tasks in new environments by accumulating and updating their knowledge. Current LLM-based agents process past experiences using a full history of observations, summarization, retrieval augmentation. However, these unstructured memory representations do not facilitate the reasoning and planning essential for complex decision-making. In our study, we introduce AriGraph, a novel method wherein the agent constructs and updates a memory graph that integrates semantic and episodic memories while exploring the environment. We demonstrate that our Ariadne LLM agent, consisting of the proposed memory architecture augmented with planning and decision-making, effectively handles complex tasks within interactive text game environments difficult even for human players. Results show that our approach markedly outperforms other established memory methods and strong RL baselines in a range of problems of varying complexity. Additionally, AriGraph demonstrates competitive performance compared to dedicated knowledge graph-based methods in static multi-hop question-answering.

### KARGEN: Knowledge-enhanced Automated Radiology Report Generation Using   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yingshu Li, Zhanyu Wang, Yunyi Liu, Lei Wang, Lingqiao Liu, Luping Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T06:57:22Z

**Summary**: Harnessing the robust capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for narrative generation, logical reasoning, and common-sense knowledge integration, this study delves into utilizing LLMs to enhance automated radiology report generation (R2Gen). Despite the wealth of knowledge within LLMs, efficiently triggering relevant knowledge within these large models for specific tasks like R2Gen poses a critical research challenge. This paper presents KARGEN, a Knowledge-enhanced Automated radiology Report GENeration framework based on LLMs. Utilizing a frozen LLM to generate reports, the framework integrates a knowledge graph to unlock chest disease-related knowledge within the LLM to enhance the clinical utility of generated reports. This is achieved by leveraging the knowledge graph to distill disease-related features in a designed way. Since a radiology report encompasses both normal and disease-related findings, the extracted graph-enhanced disease-related features are integrated with regional image features, attending to both aspects. We explore two fusion methods to automatically prioritize and select the most relevant features. The fused features are employed by LLM to generate reports that are more sensitive to diseases and of improved quality. Our approach demonstrates promising results on the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray datasets.

### Application Specific Compression of Deep Learning Models
**Authors**: Rohit Raj Rai, Angana Borah, Amit Awekar

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T06:55:38Z

**Summary**: Large Deep Learning models are compressed and deployed for specific applications. However, current Deep Learning model compression methods do not utilize the information about the target application. As a result, the compressed models are application agnostic. Our goal is to customize the model compression process to create a compressed model that will perform better for the target application. Our method, Application Specific Compression (ASC), identifies and prunes components of the large Deep Learning model that are redundant specifically for the given target application. The intuition of our work is to prune the parts of the network that do not contribute significantly to updating the data representation for the given application. We have experimented with the BERT family of models for three applications: Extractive QA, Natural Language Inference, and Paraphrase Identification. We observe that customized compressed models created using ASC method perform better than existing model compression methods and off-the-shelf compressed models.

### Diagnostic Reasoning in Natural Language: Computational Model and   Application
**Authors**: Nils Dycke, Matej Zečević, Ilia Kuznetsov, Beatrix Suess, Kristian Kersting, Iryna Gurevych

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T06:55:37Z

**Summary**: Diagnostic reasoning is a key component of expert work in many domains. It is a hard, time-consuming activity that requires expertise, and AI research has investigated the ways automated systems can support this process. Yet, due to the complexity of natural language, the applications of AI for diagnostic reasoning to language-related tasks are lacking. To close this gap, we investigate diagnostic abductive reasoning (DAR) in the context of language-grounded tasks (NL-DAR). We propose a novel modeling framework for NL-DAR based on Pearl's structural causal models and instantiate it in a comprehensive study of scientific paper assessment in the biomedical domain. We use the resulting dataset to investigate the human decision-making process in NL-DAR and determine the potential of LLMs to support structured decision-making over text. Our framework, open resources and tools lay the groundwork for the empirical study of collaborative diagnostic reasoning in the age of LLMs, in the scholarly domain and beyond.

### Diffusion-Occ: 3D Point Cloud Completion via Occupancy Diffusion
**Authors**: Guoqing Zhang, Jian Liu

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T06:50:18Z

**Summary**: Point clouds are crucial for capturing three-dimensional data but often suffer from incompleteness due to limitations such as resolution and occlusion. Traditional methods typically rely on point-based approaches within discriminative frameworks for point cloud completion. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Diffusion-Occ}, a novel framework for Diffusion Point Cloud Completion. Diffusion-Occ utilizes a two-stage coarse-to-fine approach. In the first stage, the Coarse Density Voxel Prediction Network (CDNet) processes partial points to predict coarse density voxels, streamlining global feature extraction through voxel classification, as opposed to previous regression-based methods. In the second stage, we introduce the Occupancy Generation Network (OccGen), a conditional occupancy diffusion model based on a transformer architecture and enhanced by our Point-Voxel Fuse (PVF) block. This block integrates coarse density voxels with partial points to leverage both global and local features for comprehensive completion. By thresholding the occupancy field, we convert it into a complete point cloud. Additionally, our method employs diverse training mixtures and efficient diffusion parameterization to enable effective one-step sampling during both training and inference. Experimental results demonstrate that Diffusion-Occ outperforms existing discriminative and generative methods.

### Fine-Tuning, Quantization, and LLMs: Navigating Unintended Outcomes
**Authors**: Divyanshu Kumar, Anurakt Kumar, Sahil Agarwal, Prashanth Harshangi

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T06:25:33Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption across various domains, including chatbots and auto-task completion agents. However, these models are susceptible to safety vulnerabilities such as jailbreaking, prompt injection, and privacy leakage attacks. These vulnerabilities can lead to the generation of malicious content, unauthorized actions, or the disclosure of confidential information. While foundational LLMs undergo alignment training and incorporate safety measures, they are often subject to fine-tuning, or doing quantization resource-constrained environments. This study investigates the impact of these modifications on LLM safety, a critical consideration for building reliable and secure AI systems. We evaluate foundational models including Mistral, Llama series, Qwen, and MosaicML, along with their fine-tuned variants. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that fine-tuning generally increases the success rates of jailbreak attacks, while quantization has variable effects on attack success rates. Importantly, we find that properly implemented guardrails significantly enhance resistance to jailbreak attempts. These findings contribute to our understanding of LLM vulnerabilities and provide insights for developing more robust safety strategies in the deployment of language models.

### ChatQA 2: Bridging the Gap to Proprietary LLMs in Long Context and RAG   Capabilities
**Authors**: Peng Xu, Wei Ping, Xianchao Wu, Chejian Xu, Zihan Liu, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T06:19:07Z

**Summary**: In this work, we introduce ChatQA 2, an Llama 3.0-based model with a 128K context window, designed to bridge the gap between open-source LLMs and leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4-Turbo) in long-context understanding and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. These two capabilities are essential for LLMs to process large volumes of information that cannot fit into a single prompt and are complementary to each other, depending on the downstream tasks and computational budgets. We present a detailed continued training recipe to extend the context window of Llama3-70B-base from 8K to 128K tokens, along with a three-stage instruction tuning process to enhance the model's instruction-following, RAG performance, and long-context understanding capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B model outperforms most existing state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct, on ultra-long tasks beyond 100K tokens, as well as on the RAG benchmark using only a 4K context window, showing the strong long context capability across varying sequence lengths. We further provide extensive comparisons between direct long-context and RAG solutions using the same state-of-the-art long-context LLMs. Interestingly, we find that the performance of strong long-context LLMs using RAG improves when retrieving a larger number of chunks. With a large set of top-k chunks, RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context solution using the same state-of-the-art long-context models (e.g., Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B and Qwen2-72B-Instruct) on both 32K benchmarks and real-world 128K tasks. To advance research in this field, we open-sourced the model weights, training data, and the evaluation setup for the for the community: https://chatqa2-project.github.io/

### A Survey on Employing Large Language Models for Text-to-SQL Tasks
**Authors**: Liang Shi, Zhengju Tang, Nan Zhang, Xiaotong Zhang, Zhi Yang

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T06:17:21Z

**Summary**: The increasing volume of data stored in relational databases has led to the need for efficient querying and utilization of this data in various sectors. However, writing SQL queries requires specialized knowledge, which poses a challenge for non-professional users trying to access and query databases. Text-to-SQL parsing solves this issue by converting natural language queries into SQL queries, thus making database access more accessible for non-expert users. To take advantage of the recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs), a range of new methods have emerged, with a primary focus on prompt engineering and fine-tuning. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of LLMs in text-to-SQL tasks, discussing benchmark datasets, prompt engineering, fine-tuning methods, and future research directions. We hope this review will enable readers to gain a broader understanding of the recent advances in this field and offer some insights into its future trajectory.

### Invariant Causal Knowledge Distillation in Neural Networks
**Authors**: Nikolaos Giakoumoglou, Tania Stathaki

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T06:17:15Z

**Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) involves transferring the knowledge from one neural network to another, often from a larger, well-trained model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student). Traditional KD methods minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the probabilistic outputs of the teacher and student networks. However, this approach often overlooks crucial structural knowledge embedded within the teacher's network. In this paper, we introduce Invariant Consistency Distillation (ICD), a novel methodology designed to enhance KD by ensuring that the student model's representations are both discriminative and invariant with respect to the teacher's outputs. Our approach is based on causal inference principles and combines contrastive learning with an explicit invariance penalty, capturing significantly more information from the teacher's representation. ICD uses an efficient, parameter-free approach for flexible teacher-student alignment. We provide a theoretical foundation for ICD and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments. Our results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 show that ICD outperforms traditional KD techniques and surpasses state-of-the-art methods. In some cases, the student model even exceeds the teacher model in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, we successfully apply our method to other datasets, such as Tiny ImageNet and STL-10, demonstrating superior cross-dataset generalization. Code is available at https://github.com/giakoumoglou/distillers.

### GDFlow: Anomaly Detection with NCDE-based Normalizing Flow for Advanced   Driver Assistance System
**Authors**: Kangjun Lee, Minha Kim, Youngho Jun, Simon S. Woo

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T06:04:41Z

**Summary**: For electric vehicles, the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is designed to assist braking based on driving conditions, road inclines, predefined deceleration strengths, and user braking patterns. However, the driving data collected during the development of ADAS are generally limited and lack diversity. This deficiency leads to late or aggressive braking for different users. Crucially, it is necessary to effectively identify anomalies, such as unexpected or inconsistent braking patterns in ADAS, especially given the challenge of working with unlabelled, limited, and noisy datasets from real-world electric vehicles. In order to tackle the aforementioned challenges in ADAS, we propose Graph Neural Controlled Differential Equation Normalizing Flow (GDFlow), a model that leverages Normalizing Flow (NF) with Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDE) to learn the distribution of normal driving patterns continuously. Compared to the traditional clustering or anomaly detection algorithms, our approach effectively captures the spatio-temporal information from different sensor data and more accurately models continuous changes in driving patterns. Additionally, we introduce a quantile-based maximum likelihood objective to improve the likelihood estimate of the normal data near the boundary of the distribution, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns. We validate GDFlow using real-world electric vehicle driving data that we collected from Hyundai IONIQ5 and GV80EV, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to six baselines across four dataset configurations of different vehicle types and drivers. Furthermore, our model outperforms the latest anomaly detection methods across four time series benchmark datasets. Our approach demonstrates superior efficiency in inference time compared to existing methods.

### GOPT: Generalizable Online 3D Bin Packing via Transformer-based Deep   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Heng Xiong, Changrong Guo, Jian Peng, Kai Ding, Xuchong Qiu, Long Bai, Jianfeng Xu

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T06:02:17Z

**Summary**: Robotic object packing has broad practical applications in the logistics and automation industry, often formulated by researchers as the online 3D Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP). However, existing DRL-based methods primarily focus on enhancing performance in limited packing environments while neglecting the ability to generalize across multiple environments characterized by different bin dimensions. To this end, we propose GOPT, a generalizable online 3D Bin Packing approach via Transformer-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL). First, we design a Placement Generator module to yield finite subspaces as placement candidates and the representation of the bin. Second, we propose a Packing Transformer, which fuses the features of the items and bin, to identify the spatial correlation between the item to be packed and available sub-spaces within the bin. Coupling these two components enables GOPT's ability to perform inference on bins of varying dimensions. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that GOPT not only achieves superior performance against the baselines, but also exhibits excellent generalization capabilities. Furthermore, the deployment with a robot showcases the practical applicability of our method in the real world. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Xiong5Heng/GOPT.

### mPLUG-DocOwl2: High-resolution Compressing for OCR-free Multi-page   Document Understanding
**Authors**: Anwen Hu, Haiyang Xu, Liang Zhang, Jiabo Ye, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Qin Jin, Fei Huang, Jingren Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T05:36:27Z

**Summary**: Multimodel Large Language Models(MLLMs) have achieved promising OCR-free Document Understanding performance by increasing the supported resolution of document images. However, this comes at the cost of generating thousands of visual tokens for a single document image, leading to excessive GPU memory and slower inference times, particularly in multi-page document comprehension. In this work, to address these challenges, we propose a High-resolution DocCompressor module to compress each high-resolution document image into 324 tokens, guided by low-resolution global visual features. With this compression module, to strengthen multi-page document comprehension ability and balance both token efficiency and question-answering performance, we develop the DocOwl2 under a three-stage training framework: Single-image Pretraining, Multi-image Continue-pretraining, and Multi-task Finetuning. DocOwl2 sets a new state-of-the-art across multi-page document understanding benchmarks and reduces first token latency by more than 50%, demonstrating advanced capabilities in multi-page questioning answering, explanation with evidence pages, and cross-page structure understanding. Additionally, compared to single-image MLLMs trained on similar data, our DocOwl2 achieves comparable single-page understanding performance with less than 20% of the visual tokens. Our codes, models, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/X-PLUG/mPLUG-DocOwl/tree/main/DocOwl2.

### Early-exit Convolutional Neural Networks
**Authors**: Edanur Demir, Emre Akbas

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T05:29:38Z

**Summary**: This paper is aimed at developing a method that reduces the computational cost of convolutional neural networks (CNN) during inference. Conventionally, the input data pass through a fixed neural network architecture. However, easy examples can be classified at early stages of processing and conventional networks do not take this into account. In this paper, we introduce 'Early-exit CNNs', EENets for short, which adapt their computational cost based on the input by stopping the inference process at certain exit locations. In EENets, there are a number of exit blocks each of which consists of a confidence branch and a softmax branch. The confidence branch computes the confidence score of exiting (i.e. stopping the inference process) at that location; while the softmax branch outputs a classification probability vector. Both branches are learnable and their parameters are separate. During training of EENets, in addition to the classical classification loss, the computational cost of inference is taken into account as well. As a result, the network adapts its many confidence branches to the inputs so that less computation is spent for easy examples. Inference works as in conventional feed-forward networks, however, when the output of a confidence branch is larger than a certain threshold, the inference stops for that specific example. The idea of EENets is applicable to available CNN architectures such as ResNets. Through comprehensive experiments on MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets, we show that early-exit (EE) ResNets achieve similar accuracy with their non-EE versions while reducing the computational cost to 20% of the original. Code is available at https://github.com/eksuas/eenets.pytorch

### SiamMo: Siamese Motion-Centric 3D Object Tracking
**Authors**: Yuxiang Yang, Yingqi Deng, Jing Zhang, Hongjie Gu, Zhekang Dong

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T05:24:27Z

**Summary**: Current 3D single object tracking methods primarily rely on the Siamese matching-based paradigm, which struggles with textureless and incomplete LiDAR point clouds. Conversely, the motion-centric paradigm avoids appearance matching, thus overcoming these issues. However, its complex multi-stage pipeline and the limited temporal modeling capability of a single-stream architecture constrain its potential. In this paper, we introduce SiamMo, a novel and simple Siamese motion-centric tracking approach. Unlike the traditional single-stream architecture, we employ Siamese feature extraction for motion-centric tracking. This decouples feature extraction from temporal fusion, significantly enhancing tracking performance. Additionally, we design a Spatio-Temporal Feature Aggregation module to integrate Siamese features at multiple scales, capturing motion information effectively. We also introduce a Box-aware Feature Encoding module to encode object size priors into motion estimation. SiamMo is a purely motion-centric tracker that eliminates the need for additional processes like segmentation and box refinement. Without whistles and bells, SiamMo not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks but also demonstrates exceptional robustness in challenging scenarios. SiamMo sets a new record on the KITTI tracking benchmark with 90.1\% precision while maintaining a high inference speed of 108 FPS. The code will be released at https://github.com/HDU-VRLab/SiamMo.

### TPA3D: Triplane Attention for Fast Text-to-3D Generation
**Authors**: Bin-Shih Wu, Hong-En Chen, Sheng-Yu Huang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T05:19:48Z

**Summary**: Due to the lack of large-scale text-3D correspondence data, recent text-to-3D generation works mainly rely on utilizing 2D diffusion models for synthesizing 3D data. Since diffusion-based methods typically require significant optimization time for both training and inference, the use of GAN-based models would still be desirable for fast 3D generation. In this work, we propose Triplane Attention for text-guided 3D generation (TPA3D), an end-to-end trainable GAN-based deep learning model for fast text-to-3D generation. With only 3D shape data and their rendered 2D images observed during training, our TPA3D is designed to retrieve detailed visual descriptions for synthesizing the corresponding 3D mesh data. This is achieved by the proposed attention mechanisms on the extracted sentence and word-level text features. In our experiments, we show that TPA3D generates high-quality 3D textured shapes aligned with fine-grained descriptions, while impressive computation efficiency can be observed.

### MQuAKE: Assessing Knowledge Editing in Language Models via Multi-Hop   Questions
**Authors**: Zexuan Zhong, Zhengxuan Wu, Christopher D. Manning, Christopher Potts, Danqi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T04:38:16Z

**Summary**: The information stored in large language models (LLMs) falls out of date quickly, and retraining from scratch is often not an option. This has recently given rise to a range of techniques for injecting new facts through updating model weights. Current evaluation paradigms are extremely limited, mainly validating the recall of edited facts, but changing one fact should cause rippling changes to the model's related beliefs. If we edit the UK Prime Minister to now be Rishi Sunak, then we should get a different answer to Who is married to the British Prime Minister? In this work, we present a benchmark, MQuAKE (Multi-hop Question Answering for Knowledge Editing), comprising multi-hop questions that assess whether edited models correctly answer questions where the answer should change as an entailed consequence of edited facts. While we find that current knowledge-editing approaches can recall edited facts accurately, they fail catastrophically on the constructed multi-hop questions. We thus propose a simple memory-based approach, MeLLo, which stores all edited facts externally while prompting the language model iteratively to generate answers that are consistent with the edited facts. While MQuAKE remains challenging, we show that MeLLo scales well with LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo) and outperforms previous model editors by a large margin.

### SCALE at Scale: Cosmological applications of small-scale CMB lensing
**Authors**: Victor C. Chan, Renée Hložek, Joel Meyers, Alexander van Engelen

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T04:36:07Z

**Summary**: The Small-Correlated-Against-Large Estimator (SCALE) for small-scale lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provides a novel method for measuring the amplitude of CMB lensing power without the need for reconstruction of the lensing field. In our previous study, we showed that the SCALE method can outperform existing reconstruction methods to detect the presence of lensing at small scales ($\ell \gg 3000$). Here we develop a procedure to include information from SCALE in cosmological parameter inference. We construct a precise neural network emulator to quickly map cosmological parameters to desired CMB observables such as temperature and lensing power spectra and SCALE cross spectra. We also outline a method to apply SCALE to full-sky maps of the CMB temperature field, and construct a likelihood for the application of SCALE in parameter estimation. SCALE supplements conventional observables such as the CMB power spectra and baryon acoustic oscillations in constraining parameters that are sensitive to the small-scale lensing amplitude such as the neutrino mass $m_\nu$. We show that including estimates of the small-scale lensing amplitude from SCALE in such an analysis provides enough constraining information to measure the minimum neutrino mass at $4\sigma$ significance in the scenario of minimal mass, and higher significance for higher mass. Finally, we show that SCALE will play a powerful role in constraining models of clustering that generate scale-dependent modulation to the distribution of matter and the lensing power spectrum, as predicted by models of warm or fuzzy dark matter.

### Sample-Efficient Bayesian Optimization with Transfer Learning for   Heterogeneous Search Spaces
**Authors**: Aryan Deshwal, Sait Cakmak, Yuhou Xia, David Eriksson

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T04:36:06Z

**Summary**: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful approach to sample-efficient optimization of black-box functions. However, in settings with very few function evaluations, a successful application of BO may require transferring information from historical experiments. These related experiments may not have exactly the same tunable parameters (search spaces), motivating the need for BO with transfer learning for heterogeneous search spaces. In this paper, we propose two methods for this setting. The first approach leverages a Gaussian process (GP) model with a conditional kernel to transfer information between different search spaces. Our second approach treats the missing parameters as hyperparameters of the GP model that can be inferred jointly with the other GP hyperparameters or set to fixed values. We show that these two methods perform well on several benchmark problems.

### Guarantees for Comprehensive Simulation Assessment of Statistical   Methods
**Authors**: James Yang, T. Ben Thompson, Michael Sklar

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T04:16:09Z

**Summary**: Simulation can evaluate a statistical method for properties such as Type I Error, FDR, or bias on a grid of hypothesized parameter values. But what about the gaps between the grid-points? Continuous Simulation Extension (CSE) is a proof-by-simulation framework which can supplement simulations with (1) confidence bands valid over regions of parameter space or (2) calibration of rejection thresholds to provide rigorous proof of strong Type I Error control. CSE extends simulation estimates at grid-points into bounds over nearby space using a model shift bound related to the Renyi divergence, which we analyze for models in exponential family or canonical GLM form. CSE can work with adaptive sampling, nuisance parameters, administrative censoring, multiple arms, multiple testing, Bayesian randomization, Bayesian decision-making, and inference algorithms of arbitrary complexity. As a case study, we calibrate for strong Type I Error control a Phase II/III Bayesian selection design with 4 unknown statistical parameters. Potential applications include calibration of new statistical procedures or streamlining regulatory review of adaptive trial designs.

**Authors**: Haritheja Etukuru, Norihito Naka, Zijin Hu, Seungjae Lee, Julian Mehu, Aaron Edsinger, Chris Paxton, Soumith Chintala, Lerrel Pinto, Nur Muhammad Mahi Shafiullah

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T17:59:50Z

**Summary**: Robot models, particularly those trained with large amounts of data, have recently shown a plethora of real-world manipulation and navigation capabilities. Several independent efforts have shown that given sufficient training data in an environment, robot policies can generalize to demonstrated variations in that environment. However, needing to finetune robot models to every new environment stands in stark contrast to models in language or vision that can be deployed zero-shot for open-world problems. In this work, we present Robot Utility Models (RUMs), a framework for training and deploying zero-shot robot policies that can directly generalize to new environments without any finetuning. To create RUMs efficiently, we develop new tools to quickly collect data for mobile manipulation tasks, integrate such data into a policy with multi-modal imitation learning, and deploy policies on-device on Hello Robot Stretch, a cheap commodity robot, with an external mLLM verifier for retrying. We train five such utility models for opening cabinet doors, opening drawers, picking up napkins, picking up paper bags, and reorienting fallen objects. Our system, on average, achieves 90% success rate in unseen, novel environments interacting with unseen objects. Moreover, the utility models can also succeed in different robot and camera set-ups with no further data, training, or fine-tuning. Primary among our lessons are the importance of training data over training algorithm and policy class, guidance about data scaling, necessity for diverse yet high-quality demonstrations, and a recipe for robot introspection and retrying to improve performance on individual environments. Our code, data, models, hardware designs, as well as our experiment and deployment videos are open sourced and can be found on our project website: https://robotutilitymodels.com

### Neural MP: A Generalist Neural Motion Planner
**Authors**: Murtaza Dalal, Jiahui Yang, Russell Mendonca, Youssef Khaky, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Deepak Pathak

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T17:59:45Z

**Summary**: The current paradigm for motion planning generates solutions from scratch for every new problem, which consumes significant amounts of time and computational resources. For complex, cluttered scenes, motion planning approaches can often take minutes to produce a solution, while humans are able to accurately and safely reach any goal in seconds by leveraging their prior experience. We seek to do the same by applying data-driven learning at scale to the problem of motion planning. Our approach builds a large number of complex scenes in simulation, collects expert data from a motion planner, then distills it into a reactive generalist policy. We then combine this with lightweight optimization to obtain a safe path for real world deployment. We perform a thorough evaluation of our method on 64 motion planning tasks across four diverse environments with randomized poses, scenes and obstacles, in the real world, demonstrating an improvement of 23%, 17% and 79% motion planning success rate over state of the art sampling, optimization and learning based planning methods.

### Using Natural Language Explanations to Rescale Human Judgments
**Authors**: Manya Wadhwa, Jifan Chen, Junyi Jessy Li, Greg Durrett

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T17:37:16Z

**Summary**: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has brought a critical need for high-quality human-labeled data, particularly for processes like human feedback and evaluation. A common practice is to label data via consensus annotation over human judgments. However, annotators' judgments for subjective tasks can differ in many ways: they may reflect different qualitative judgments about an example, and they may be mapped to a labeling scheme in different ways. We show that these nuances can be captured by natural language explanations, and propose a method to rescale ordinal annotations and explanations using LLMs. Specifically, we feed annotators' Likert ratings and corresponding explanations into an LLM and prompt it to produce a numeric score anchored in a scoring rubric. These scores should reflect the annotators' underlying assessments of the example. The rubric can be designed or modified after annotation, and include distinctions that may not have been known when the original error taxonomy was devised. We explore our technique in the context of rating system outputs for a document-grounded question answering task, where LLMs achieve near-human performance. Our method rescales the raw judgments without impacting agreement and brings the scores closer to human judgments grounded in the same scoring rubric.

### Are Large Language Models a Threat to Programming Platforms? An   Exploratory Study
**Authors**: Md Mustakim Billah, Palash Ranjan Roy, Zadia Codabux, Banani Roy

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T17:30:20Z

**Summary**: Competitive programming platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank evaluate programming skills, often used by recruiters for screening. With the rise of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Meta AI, their problem-solving ability on these platforms needs assessment. This study explores LLMs' ability to tackle diverse programming challenges across platforms with varying difficulty, offering insights into their real-time and offline performance and comparing them with human programmers.   We tested 98 problems from LeetCode, 126 from Codeforces, covering 15 categories. Nine online contests from Codeforces and LeetCode were conducted, along with two certification tests on HackerRank, to assess real-time performance. Prompts and feedback mechanisms were used to guide LLMs, and correlations were explored across different scenarios.   LLMs, like ChatGPT (71.43% success on LeetCode), excelled in LeetCode and HackerRank certifications but struggled in virtual contests, particularly on Codeforces. They performed better than users in LeetCode archives, excelling in time and memory efficiency but underperforming in harder Codeforces contests. While not immediately threatening, LLMs performance on these platforms is concerning, and future improvements will need addressing.

### Improving Pretraining Data Using Perplexity Correlations
**Authors**: Tristan Thrush, Christopher Potts, Tatsunori Hashimoto

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T17:23:29Z

**Summary**: Quality pretraining data is often seen as the key to high-performance language models. However, progress in understanding pretraining data has been slow due to the costly pretraining runs required for data selection experiments. We present a framework that avoids these costs and selects high-quality pretraining data without any LLM training of our own. Our work is based on a simple observation: LLM losses on many pretraining texts are correlated with downstream benchmark performance, and selecting high-correlation documents is an effective pretraining data selection method. We build a new statistical framework for data selection centered around estimates of perplexity-benchmark correlations and perform data selection using a sample of 90 LLMs taken from the Open LLM Leaderboard on texts from tens of thousands of web domains. In controlled pretraining experiments at the 160M parameter scale on 8 benchmarks, our approach outperforms DSIR on every benchmark, while matching the best data selector found in DataComp-LM, a hand-engineered bigram classifier.

### Benchmarking Chinese Knowledge Rectification in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Tianhe Lu, Jizhan Fang, Yunzhi Yao, Xin Xu, Ningyu Zhang, Huajun Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T17:11:51Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities, they are not without flaws, particularly in the form of hallucinations. This issue is even more pronounced when LLMs are applied to specific languages and domains. For example, LLMs may generate nonsense information when handling Chinese ancient poetry, proverbs, or idioms, owing to the lack of specific knowledge. To this end, this paper introduces a benchmark for rectifying Chinese knowledge in LLMs via knowledge editing. Specifically, we introduce a new Chinese dataset, CKnowEdit, by collecting seven type of knowledge from various sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, thereby accounting for the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical constructs inherent in the Chinese language. Through the analysis of this dataset, we uncover the challenges faced by current LLMs in mastering Chinese. Furthermore, our evaluation of state-of-the-art knowledge editing techniques on this dataset unveil the substantial scope for advancement in the rectification of Chinese knowledge. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.

### Unified Neural Network Scaling Laws and Scale-time Equivalence
**Authors**: Akhilan Boopathy, Ila Fiete

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T16:45:26Z

**Summary**: As neural networks continue to grow in size but datasets might not, it is vital to understand how much performance improvement can be expected: is it more important to scale network size or data volume? Thus, neural network scaling laws, which characterize how test error varies with network size and data volume, have become increasingly important. However, existing scaling laws are often applicable only in limited regimes and often do not incorporate or predict well-known phenomena such as double descent. Here, we present a novel theoretical characterization of how three factors -- model size, training time, and data volume -- interact to determine the performance of deep neural networks. We first establish a theoretical and empirical equivalence between scaling the size of a neural network and increasing its training time proportionally. Scale-time equivalence challenges the current practice, wherein large models are trained for small durations, and suggests that smaller models trained over extended periods could match their efficacy. It also leads to a novel method for predicting the performance of large-scale networks from small-scale networks trained for extended epochs, and vice versa. We next combine scale-time equivalence with a linear model analysis of double descent to obtain a unified theoretical scaling law, which we confirm with experiments across vision benchmarks and network architectures. These laws explain several previously unexplained phenomena: reduced data requirements for generalization in larger models, heightened sensitivity to label noise in overparameterized models, and instances where increasing model scale does not necessarily enhance performance. Our findings hold significant implications for the practical deployment of neural networks, offering a more accessible and efficient path to training and fine-tuning large models.

### Instruct-SkillMix: A Powerful Pipeline for LLM Instruction Tuning
**Authors**: Simran Kaur, Simon Park, Anirudh Goyal, Sanjeev Arora

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T16:41:36Z

**Summary**: We introduce Instruct-SkillMix, an automated approach for creating diverse, high quality SFT data. The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline involves two stages, each leveraging an existing powerful LLM: (1) Skill extraction: uses the LLM to extract core "skills" for instruction-following, either from existing datasets, or by directly prompting the model; (2) Data generation: uses the powerful LLM to generate (instruction, response) data that exhibit a randomly chosen pair of these skills. Here, the use of random skill combinations promotes diversity and difficulty.   Vanilla SFT (i.e., no PPO, DPO, or RL methods) on data generated from Instruct-SkillMix leads to strong gains on instruction following benchmarks such as AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and WildBench. With just $4$K examples, LLaMA-3-8B-Base achieves 42.76% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. To our knowledge, this achieves state-of-the-art performance among all models that have only undergone SFT (no RL methods) and competes with proprietary models such as Claude 3 Opus and LLaMA-3.1-405B-Instruct.   Ablation studies also suggest plausible reasons for why creating open instruction-tuning datasets via naive crowd-sourcing has proved difficult. Introducing low quality answers ("shirkers") in $20\%$ of Instruct-SkillMix examples causes performance to plummet, sometimes catastrophically.   The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline is flexible and is adaptable to other settings.

### Mixture of Experts with Mixture of Precisions for Tuning Quality of   Service
**Authors**: HamidReza Imani, Abdolah Amirany, Tarek El-Ghazawi

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T16:34:00Z

**Summary**: The increasing demand for deploying large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models in resource-constrained environments necessitates efficient approaches to address their high memory and computational requirements challenges. Moreover, given that tasks come in different user-defined constraints and the available resources change over time in multi-tenant environments, it is necessary to design an approach which provides a flexible configuration space. This paper presents an adaptive serving approach for the efficient deployment of MoE models, capitalizing on partial quantization of the experts. By dynamically determining the number of quantized experts and their distribution across CPU and GPU, our approach explores the Pareto frontier and offers a fine-grained range of configurations for tuning throughput and model quality. Our evaluation on an NVIDIA A100 GPU using a Mixtral 8x7B MoE model for three language modelling benchmarks demonstrates that the throughput of token generation can be adjusted from 0.63 to 13.00 token per second. This enhancement comes with a marginal perplexity increase of 3.81 to 4.00, 13.59 to 14.17, and 7.24 to 7.40 for WikiText2, PTB, and C4 datasets respectively under maximum quantization. These results highlight the practical applicability of our approach in dynamic and accuracy-sensitive applications where both memory usage and output quality are important.

### Evidence from fMRI Supports a Two-Phase Abstraction Process in Language   Models
**Authors**: Emily Cheng, Richard J. Antonello

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T16:33:16Z

**Summary**: Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.

### Model Input Verification of Large Scale Simulations
**Authors**: Rumyana Neykova, Derek Groen

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T16:32:14Z

**Summary**: Reliable simulations are critical for analyzing and understanding complex systems, but their accuracy depends on correct input data. Incorrect inputs such as invalid or out-of-range values, missing data, and format inconsistencies can cause simulation crashes or unnoticed result distortions, ultimately undermining the validity of the conclusions. This paper presents a methodology for verifying the validity of input data in simulations, a process we term model input verification (MIV). We implement this approach in FabGuard, a toolset that uses established data schema and validation tools for the specific needs of simulation modeling. We introduce a formalism for categorizing MIV patterns and offer a streamlined verification pipeline that integrates into existing simulation workflows. FabGuard's applicability is demonstrated across three diverse domains: conflict-driven migration, disaster evacuation, and disease spread models. We also explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating constraint generation and inference. In a case study with a migration simulation, LLMs not only correctly inferred 22 out of 23 developer-defined constraints, but also identified errors in existing constraints and proposed new, valid constraints. Our evaluation demonstrates that MIV is feasible on large datasets, with FabGuard efficiently processing 12,000 input files in 140 seconds and maintaining consistent performance across varying file sizes.

### Balancing Rigor and Utility: Mitigating Cognitive Biases in Large   Language Models for Multiple-Choice Questions
**Authors**: Liman Wang, Hanyang Zhong, Wenting Cao, Zeyuan Sun

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T16:28:09Z

**Summary**: This paper examines the role of cognitive biases in the decision-making processes of large language models (LLMs), challenging the conventional goal of eliminating all biases. We show that certain cognitive biases when properly balanced, can enhance decision-making efficiency through rational deviations and heuristic shortcuts. By introducing heuristic moderation and an abstention option, which allows LLMs to withhold responses when uncertain, we reduce error rates, improve decision accuracy, and optimize decision rates. Using the Balance Rigor and Utility (BRU) dataset, developed through expert collaboration, our findings demonstrate that targeted inspection of cognitive biases aligns LLM decisions more closely with human reasoning, enhancing reliability and suggesting strategies for future improvements. This approach offers a novel way to leverage cognitive biases to improve the practical utility of LLMs across various applications.

### A Novel Idea Generation Tool using a Structured Conversational AI (CAI)   System
**Authors**: B. Sankar, Dibakar Sen

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T16:02:27Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a novel conversational AI-enabled active ideation interface as a creative idea-generation tool to assist novice designers in mitigating the initial latency and ideation bottlenecks that are commonly observed. It is a dynamic, interactive, and contextually responsive approach, actively involving a large language model (LLM) from the domain of natural language processing (NLP) in artificial intelligence (AI) to produce multiple statements of potential ideas for different design problems. Integrating such AI models with ideation creates what we refer to as an Active Ideation scenario, which helps foster continuous dialogue-based interaction, context-sensitive conversation, and prolific idea generation. A pilot study was conducted with thirty novice designers to generate ideas for given problems using traditional methods and the new CAI-based interface. The key parameters of fluency, novelty, and variety were used to compare the outcomes qualitatively by a panel of experts. The findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed tool for generating prolific, diverse and novel ideas. The interface was enhanced by incorporating a prompt-engineered structured dialogue style for each ideation stage to make it uniform and more convenient for the designers. The resulting responses of such a structured CAI interface were found to be more succinct and aligned towards the subsequent design stage, namely conceptualization. The paper thus established the rich potential of using Generative AI (Gen-AI) for the early ill-structured phase of the creative product design process.

### LLMs Will Always Hallucinate, and We Need to Live With This
**Authors**: Sourav Banerjee, Ayushi Agarwal, Saloni Singla

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T16:01:58Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models become more ubiquitous across domains, it becomes important to examine their inherent limitations critically. This work argues that hallucinations in language models are not just occasional errors but an inevitable feature of these systems. We demonstrate that hallucinations stem from the fundamental mathematical and logical structure of LLMs. It is, therefore, impossible to eliminate them through architectural improvements, dataset enhancements, or fact-checking mechanisms. Our analysis draws on computational theory and Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem, which references the undecidability of problems like the Halting, Emptiness, and Acceptance Problems. We demonstrate that every stage of the LLM process-from training data compilation to fact retrieval, intent classification, and text generation-will have a non-zero probability of producing hallucinations. This work introduces the concept of Structural Hallucination as an intrinsic nature of these systems. By establishing the mathematical certainty of hallucinations, we challenge the prevailing notion that they can be fully mitigated.

### X-InstructBLIP: A Framework for aligning X-Modal instruction-aware   representations to LLMs and Emergent Cross-modal Reasoning
**Authors**: Artemis Panagopoulou, Le Xue, Ning Yu, Junnan Li, Dongxu Li, Shafiq Joty, Ran Xu, Silvio Savarese, Caiming Xiong, Juan Carlos Niebles

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T16:00:04Z

**Summary**: Recent research has achieved significant advancements in visual reasoning tasks through learning image-to-language projections and leveraging the impressive reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces an efficient and effective framework that integrates multiple modalities (images, 3D, audio and video) to a frozen LLM and demonstrates an emergent ability for cross-modal reasoning (2+ modality inputs). Our approach explores two distinct projection mechanisms: Q-Formers and Linear Projections (LPs). Through extensive experimentation across all four modalities on 16 benchmarks, we explore both methods and assess their adaptability in integrated and separate cross-modal reasoning. The Q-Former projection demonstrates superior performance in single modality scenarios and adaptability in joint versus discriminative reasoning involving two or more modalities. However, it exhibits lower generalization capabilities than linear projection in contexts where task-modality data are limited. To enable this framework, we devise a scalable pipeline that automatically generates high-quality, instruction-tuning datasets from readily available captioning data across different modalities, and contribute 24K QA data for audio and 250K QA data for 3D. To facilitate further research in cross-modal reasoning, we introduce the DisCRn (Discriminative Cross-modal Reasoning) benchmark comprising 9K audio-video QA samples and 28K image-3D QA samples that require the model to reason discriminatively across disparate input modalities.

**Summary**: In many industrial settings, users wish to ask questions whose answers may be found in structured data sources such as a spreadsheets, databases, APIs, or combinations thereof. Often, the user doesn't know how to identify or access the right data source. This problem is compounded even further if multiple (and potentially siloed) data sources must be assembled to derive the answer. Recently, various Text-to-SQL applications that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) have addressed some of these problems by enabling users to ask questions in natural language. However, these applications remain impractical in realistic industrial settings because they fail to cope with the data source heterogeneity that typifies such environments. In this paper, we address heterogeneity by introducing the siwarex platform, which enables seamless natural language access to both databases and APIs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of siwarex, we extend the popular Spider dataset and benchmark by replacing some of its tables by data retrieval APIs. We find that siwarex does a good job of coping with data source heterogeneity. Our modified Spider benchmark will soon be available to the research community

### Towards Democratizing Multilingual Large Language Models For Medicine   Through A Two-Stage Instruction Fine-tuning Approach
**Authors**: Meng Zhou, Surajsinh Parmar, Anubhav Bhatti

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T15:42:19Z

**Summary**: Open-source, multilingual medical large language models (LLMs) have the potential to serve linguistically diverse populations across different regions. Adapting generic LLMs for healthcare often requires continual pretraining, but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes impractical. Instruction fine-tuning on a specific task may not always guarantee optimal performance due to the lack of broader domain knowledge that the model needs to understand and reason effectively in diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce two multilingual instruction fine-tuning datasets, MMed-IFT and MMed-IFT-MC, containing over 200k high-quality medical samples in six languages. We propose a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage injects general medical knowledge using MMed-IFT, while the second stage fine-tunes task-specific multiple-choice questions with MMed-IFT-MC. Our method achieves competitive results on both English and multilingual benchmarks, striking a balance between computational efficiency and performance. We plan to make our dataset and model weights public at \url{https://github.com/SpassMed/Med-Llama3} in the future.

### What Did My Car Say? Autonomous Vehicle Explanation Errors, Context, and   Personal Traits Impact Comfort, Reliance, Satisfaction, and Driving   Confidence
**Authors**: Robert Kaufman, Aaron Broukhim, David Kirsh, Nadir Weibel

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T15:41:53Z

**Summary**: Explanations for autonomous vehicle (AV) decisions may build trust, however, explanations can contain errors. In a simulated driving study (n = 232), we tested how AV explanation errors, driving context characteristics (perceived harm and driving difficulty), and personal traits (prior trust and expertise) affected a passenger's comfort in relying on an AV, preference for control, confidence in the AV's ability, and explanation satisfaction. Errors negatively affected all outcomes. Surprisingly, despite identical driving, explanation errors reduced ratings of the AV's driving ability. Severity and potential harm amplified the negative impact of errors. Contextual harm and driving difficulty directly impacted outcome ratings and influenced the relationship between errors and outcomes. Prior trust and expertise were positively associated with outcome ratings. Results emphasize the need for accurate, contextually adaptive, and personalized AV explanations to foster trust, reliance, satisfaction, and confidence. We conclude with design, research, and deployment recommendations for trustworthy AV explanation systems.

### The Influence of Task and Group Disparities over Users' Attitudes Toward   Using Large Language Models for Psychotherapy
**Authors**: Qihang He, Jiyao Wang, Dengbo He

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T15:14:31Z

**Summary**: The population suffering from mental health disorders has kept increasing in recent years. With the advancements in large language models (LLMs) in diverse fields, LLM-based psychotherapy has also attracted increasingly more attention. However, the factors influencing users' attitudes to LLM-based psychotherapy have rarely been explored. As the first attempt, this paper investigated the influence of task and group disparities on user attitudes toward LLM-based psychotherapy tools. Utilizing the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Automation Acceptance Model (AAM), based on an online survey, we collected and analyzed responses from 222 LLM-based psychotherapy users in mainland China. The results revealed that group disparity (i.e., mental health conditions) can influence users' attitudes toward LLM tools. Further, one of the typical task disparities, i.e., the privacy concern, was not found to have a significant effect on trust and usage intention. These findings can guide the design of future LLM-based psychotherapy services.

### Large Language Models Synergize with Automated Machine Learning
**Authors**: Jinglue Xu, Jialong Li, Zhen Liu, Nagar Anthel Venkatesh Suryanarayanan, Guoyuan Zhou, Jia Guo, Hitoshi Iba, Kenji Tei

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T15:04:15Z

**Summary**: Recently, program synthesis driven by large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly popular. However, program synthesis for machine learning (ML) tasks still poses significant challenges. This paper explores a novel form of program synthesis, targeting ML programs, by combining LLMs and automated machine learning (autoML). Specifically, our goal is to fully automate the generation and optimization of the code of the entire ML workflow, from data preparation to modeling and post-processing, utilizing only textual descriptions of the ML tasks. To manage the length and diversity of ML programs, we propose to break each ML program into smaller, manageable parts. Each part is generated separately by the LLM, with careful consideration of their compatibilities. To ensure compatibilities, we design a testing technique for ML programs. Unlike traditional program synthesis, which typically relies on binary evaluations (i.e., correct or incorrect), evaluating ML programs necessitates more than just binary judgments. Our approach automates the numerical evaluation and optimization of these programs, selecting the best candidates through autoML techniques. In experiments across various ML tasks, our method outperforms existing methods in 10 out of 12 tasks for generating ML programs. In addition, autoML significantly improves the performance of the generated ML programs. In experiments, given the textual task description, our method, Text-to-ML, generates the complete and optimized ML program in a fully autonomous process. The implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/JLX0/llm-automl.

### Auto-ACD: A Large-scale Dataset for Audio-Language Representation   Learning
**Authors**: Luoyi Sun, Xuenan Xu, Mengyue Wu, Weidi Xie

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T14:52:15Z

**Summary**: Recently, the AI community has made significant strides in developing powerful foundation models, driven by large-scale multimodal datasets. However, for audio representation learning, existing datasets suffer from limitations in the following aspects: insufficient volume, simplistic content, and arduous collection procedures. To establish an audio dataset with high-quality captions, we propose an innovative, automatic approach leveraging multimodal inputs, such as video frames, audio streams. Specifically, we construct a large-scale, high-quality, audio-language dataset, named as Auto-ACD, comprising over 1.5M audio-text pairs. We exploit a series of pre-trained models or APIs, to determine audio-visual synchronisation, generate image captions, object detection, or audio tags for specific videos. Subsequently, we employ LLM to paraphrase a congruent caption for each audio, guided by the extracted multi-modality clues. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset, we train widely used models on our dataset and show performance improvement on various downstream tasks, for example, audio-language retrieval, audio captioning, zero-shot classification. In addition, we establish a novel benchmark with environmental information and provide a benchmark for audio-text tasks.

### LoQT: Low-Rank Adapters for Quantized Pre-Training
**Authors**: Sebastian Loeschcke, Mads Toftrup, Michael J. Kastoryano, Serge Belongie, Vésteinn Snæbjarnarson

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T14:31:26Z

**Summary**: Training of large neural networks requires significant computational resources. Despite advances using low-rank adapters and quantization, pretraining of models such as LLMs on consumer hardware has not been possible without model sharding, offloading during training, or per-layer gradient updates. To address these limitations, we propose LoQT, a method for efficiently training quantized models. LoQT uses gradient-based tensor factorization to initialize low-rank trainable weight matrices that are periodically merged into quantized full-rank weight matrices. Our approach is suitable for both pretraining and fine-tuning of models, which we demonstrate experimentally for language modeling and downstream task adaptation. We find that LoQT enables efficient training of models up to 7B parameters on a consumer-grade 24GB GPU. We also demonstrate the feasibility of training a 13B parameter model using per-layer gradient updates on the same hardware.

### ECG Biometric Authentication Using Self-Supervised Learning for IoT Edge   Sensors
**Authors**: Guoxin Wang, Shreejith Shanker, Avishek Nag, Yong Lian, Deepu John

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T13:59:22Z

**Summary**: Wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices are gaining ground for continuous physiological data acquisition and health monitoring. These physiological signals can be used for security applications to achieve continuous authentication and user convenience due to passive data acquisition. This paper investigates an electrocardiogram (ECG) based biometric user authentication system using features derived from the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and self-supervised contrastive learning. Contrastive learning enables us to use large unlabeled datasets to train the model and establish its generalizability. We propose approaches enabling the CNN encoder to extract appropriate features that distinguish the user from other subjects. When evaluated using the PTB ECG database with 290 subjects, the proposed technique achieved an authentication accuracy of 99.15%. To test its generalizability, we applied the model to two new datasets, the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the ECG-ID Database, achieving over 98.5% accuracy without any modifications. Furthermore, we show that repeating the authentication step three times can increase accuracy to nearly 100% for both PTBDB and ECGIDDB. This paper also presents model optimizations for embedded device deployment, which makes the system more relevant to real-world scenarios. To deploy our model in IoT edge sensors, we optimized the model complexity by applying quantization and pruning. The optimized model achieves 98.67% accuracy on PTBDB, with 0.48% accuracy loss and 62.6% CPU cycles compared to the unoptimized model. An accuracy-vs-time-complexity tradeoff analysis is performed, and results are presented for different optimization levels.

### An Empirical Study on Information Extraction using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ridong Han, Chaohao Yang, Tao Peng, Prayag Tiwari, Xiang Wan, Lu Liu, Benyou Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T13:50:30Z

**Summary**: Human-like large language models (LLMs), especially the most powerful and popular ones in OpenAI's GPT family, have proven to be very helpful for many natural language processing (NLP) related tasks. Therefore, various attempts have been made to apply LLMs to information extraction (IE), which is a fundamental NLP task that involves extracting information from unstructured plain text. To demonstrate the latest representative progress in LLMs' information extraction ability, we assess the information extraction ability of GPT-4 (the latest version of GPT at the time of writing this paper) from four perspectives: Performance, Evaluation Criteria, Robustness, and Error Types. Our results suggest a visible performance gap between GPT-4 and state-of-the-art (SOTA) IE methods. To alleviate this problem, considering the LLMs' human-like characteristics, we propose and analyze the effects of a series of simple prompt-based methods, which can be generalized to other LLMs and NLP tasks. Rich experiments show our methods' effectiveness and some of their remaining issues in improving GPT-4's information extraction ability.

### MemoRAG: Moving towards Next-Gen RAG Via Memory-Inspired Knowledge   Discovery
**Authors**: Hongjin Qian, Peitian Zhang, Zheng Liu, Kelong Mao, Zhicheng Dou

**Updated**: 2024-09-10T02:01:43Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages retrieval tools to access external databases, thereby enhancing the generation quality of large language models (LLMs) through optimized context. However, the existing retrieval methods are constrained inherently, as they can only perform relevance matching between explicitly stated queries and well-formed knowledge, but unable to handle tasks involving ambiguous information needs or unstructured knowledge. Consequently, existing RAG systems are primarily effective for straightforward question-answering tasks. In this work, we propose MemoRAG, a novel retrieval-augmented generation paradigm empowered by long-term memory. MemoRAG adopts a dual-system architecture. On the one hand, it employs a light but long-range LLM to form the global memory of database. Once a task is presented, it generates draft answers, cluing the retrieval tools to locate useful information within the database. On the other hand, it leverages an expensive but expressive LLM, which generates the ultimate answer based on the retrieved information. Building on this general framework, we further optimize MemoRAG's performance by enhancing its cluing mechanism and memorization capacity. In our experiment, MemoRAG achieves superior performance across a variety of evaluation tasks, including both complex ones where conventional RAG fails and straightforward ones where RAG is commonly applied.

### Improving Factuality in Large Language Models via Decoding-Time   Hallucinatory and Truthful Comparators
**Authors**: Dingkang Yang, Dongling Xiao, Jinjie Wei, Mingcheng Li, Zhaoyu Chen, Ke Li, Lihua Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T13:10:50Z

**Summary**: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generate responses that contradict verifiable facts, i.e., unfaithful hallucination content. Existing efforts generally focus on optimizing model parameters or editing semantic representations, which compromise the internal factual knowledge of target LLMs. In addition, hallucinations typically exhibit multifaceted patterns in downstream tasks, limiting the model's holistic performance across tasks. In this paper, we propose a Comparator-driven Decoding-Time (CDT) framework to alleviate the response hallucination. Firstly, we construct hallucinatory and truthful comparators with multi-task fine-tuning samples. In this case, we present an instruction prototype-guided mixture of experts strategy to enhance the ability of the corresponding comparators to capture different hallucination or truthfulness patterns in distinct task instructions. CDT constrains next-token predictions to factuality-robust distributions by contrasting the logit differences between the target LLMs and these comparators. Systematic experiments on multiple downstream tasks show that our framework can significantly improve the model performance and response factuality.

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T12:38:11Z

**Summary**: As the capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) continue to advance, evaluating the performance of LMMs emerges as an increasing need. Additionally, there is an even larger gap in evaluating the advanced knowledge and reasoning abilities of LMMs in non-English contexts such as Chinese. We introduce CMMMU, a new Chinese Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs on tasks demanding college-level subject knowledge and deliberate reasoning in a Chinese context. CMMMU is inspired by and strictly follows the annotation and analysis pattern of MMMU. CMMMU includes 12k manually collected multimodal questions from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks, covering six core disciplines: Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering, like its companion, MMMU. These questions span 30 subjects and comprise 39 highly heterogeneous image types, such as charts, diagrams, maps, tables, music sheets, and chemical structures. CMMMU focuses on complex perception and reasoning with domain-specific knowledge in the Chinese context. We evaluate 11 open-source LLMs and one proprietary GPT-4V(ision). Even GPT-4V only achieves accuracies of 42%, indicating a large space for improvement. CMMMU will boost the community to build the next-generation LMMs towards expert artificial intelligence and promote the democratization of LMMs by providing diverse language contexts.

### R-SFLLM: Jamming Resilient Framework for Split Federated Learning with   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Aladin Djuhera, Vlad C. Andrei, Xinyang Li, Ullrich J. Mönich, Holger Boche, Walid Saad

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T12:36:29Z

**Summary**: Split federated learning (SFL) is a compute-efficient paradigm in distributed machine learning (ML), where components of large ML models are outsourced to remote servers. A significant challenge in SFL, particularly when deployed over wireless channels, is the susceptibility of transmitted model parameters to adversarial jamming that could jeopardize the learning process. This is particularly pronounced for word embedding parameters in large language models (LLMs), which are crucial for language understanding. In this paper, rigorous insights are provided into the influence of jamming LLM word embeddings in SFL by deriving an expression for the ML training loss divergence and showing that it is upper-bounded by the mean squared error (MSE). Based on this analysis, a physical layer framework is developed for resilient SFL with LLMs (R-SFLLM) over wireless networks. R-SFLLM leverages wireless sensing data to gather information on the jamming directions-of-arrival (DoAs) for the purpose of devising a novel, sensing-assisted anti-jamming strategy while jointly optimizing beamforming, user scheduling, and resource allocation. Extensive experiments using BERT and RoBERTa models demonstrate R-SFLLM's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks and datasets. The proposed methodology further introduces an adversarial training component, where controlled noise exposure significantly enhances the LLM's resilience to perturbed parameters during training. The results show that more noise-sensitive models, such as RoBERTa, benefit from this feature, especially when resource allocation is unfair. It is also shown that worst-case jamming in particular translates into worst-case model outcomes, thereby necessitating the need for jamming-resilient SFL protocols.

### CauseJudger: Identifying the Cause with LLMs for Abductive Logical   Reasoning
**Authors**: Jinwei He, Feng Lu

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T12:30:43Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been utilized in solving diverse reasoning tasks, encompassing common sense, arithmetic and deduction tasks. However, with difficulties of reversing thinking patterns and irrelevant premises, how to determine the authenticity of the cause in abductive logical reasoning remains underexplored. Inspired by hypothesis and verification method and identification of irrelevant information in human thinking process, we propose a new framework for LLMs abductive logical reasoning called CauseJudger (CJ), which identifies the authenticity of possible cause by transforming thinking from reverse to forward and removing irrelevant information. In addition, we construct an abductive logical reasoning dataset for decision task called CauseLogics, which contains 200,000 tasks of varying reasoning lengths. Our experiments show the efficiency of CJ with overall experiments and ablation experiments as well as case studies on our dataset and reconstructed public dataset. Notably, CJ's implementation is efficient, requiring only two calls to LLM. Its impact is profound: when using gpt-3.5, CJ achieves a maximum correctness improvement of 41% compared to Zero-Shot-CoT. Moreover, with gpt-4, CJ attains an accuracy exceeding 90% across all datasets.

### SciAgents: Automating scientific discovery through multi-agent   intelligent graph reasoning
**Authors**: Alireza Ghafarollahi, Markus J. Buehler

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T12:25:10Z

**Summary**: A key challenge in artificial intelligence is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in vast scientific data. In this work, we present SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts: (1) the use of large-scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi-agent systems with in-situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses traditional human-driven research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the intelligent system yields material discoveries, critique and improve existing hypotheses, retrieve up-to-date data about existing research, and highlights their strengths and limitations. Our case studies demonstrate scalable capabilities to combine generative AI, ontological representations, and multi-agent modeling, harnessing a `swarm of intelligence' similar to biological systems. This provides new avenues for materials discovery and accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles.

### No Captions, No Problem: Captionless 3D-CLIP Alignment with Hard   Negatives via CLIP Knowledge and LLMs
**Authors**: Cristian Sbrolli, Matteo Matteucci

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T12:04:27Z

**Summary**: In this study, we explore an alternative approach to enhance contrastive text-image-3D alignment in the absence of textual descriptions for 3D objects. We introduce two unsupervised methods, $I2I$ and $(I2L)^2$, which leverage CLIP knowledge about textual and 2D data to compute the neural perceived similarity between two 3D samples. We employ the proposed methods to mine 3D hard negatives, establishing a multimodal contrastive pipeline with hard negative weighting via a custom loss function. We train on different configurations of the proposed hard negative mining approach, and we evaluate the accuracy of our models in 3D classification and on the cross-modal retrieval benchmark, testing image-to-shape and shape-to-image retrieval. Results demonstrate that our approach, even without explicit text alignment, achieves comparable or superior performance on zero-shot and standard 3D classification, while significantly improving both image-to-shape and shape-to-image retrieval compared to previous methods.

**Authors**: Xianfu Chen, Celimuge Wu, Yi Shen, Yusheng Ji, Tsutomu Yoshinaga, Qiang Ni, Charilaos C. Zarakovitis, Honggang Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T11:38:24Z

**Summary**: This article investigates a control system within the context of six-generation wireless networks. The control performance optimization confronts the technical challenges that arise from the intricate interactions between communication and control sub-systems, asking for a co-design. Accounting for the system dynamics, we formulate the sequential co-design decision-makings of communication and control over the discrete time horizon as a Markov decision process, for which a practical offline learning framework is proposed. Our proposed framework integrates large language models into the elements of reinforcement learning. We present a case study on the age of semantics-aware communication and control co-design to showcase the potentials from our proposed learning framework. Furthermore, we discuss the open issues remaining to make our proposed offline learning framework feasible for real-world implementations, and highlight the research directions for future explorations.

### AnyMatch -- Efficient Zero-Shot Entity Matching with a Small Language   Model
**Authors**: Zeyu Zhang, Paul Groth, Iacer Calixto, Sebastian Schelter

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T11:33:00Z

**Summary**: Entity matching (EM) is the problem of determining whether two records refer to same real-world entity, which is crucial in data integration, e.g., for product catalogs or address databases. A major drawback of many EM approaches is their dependence on labelled examples. We thus focus on the challenging setting of zero-shot entity matching where no labelled examples are available for an unseen target dataset. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results for zero-shot EM, but their low throughput and high deployment cost limit their applicability and scalability.   We revisit the zero-shot EM problem with AnyMatch, a small language model fine-tuned in a transfer learning setup. We propose several novel data selection techniques to generate fine-tuning data for our model, e.g., by selecting difficult pairs to match via an AutoML filter, by generating additional attribute-level examples, and by controlling label imbalance in the data.   We conduct an extensive evaluation of the prediction quality and deployment cost of our model, in a comparison to thirteen baselines on nine benchmark datasets. We find that AnyMatch provides competitive prediction quality despite its small parameter size: it achieves the second-highest F1 score overall, and outperforms several other approaches that employ models with hundreds of billions of parameters. Furthermore, our approach exhibits major cost benefits: the average prediction quality of AnyMatch is within 4.4% of the state-of-the-art method MatchGPT with the proprietary trillion-parameter model GPT-4, yet AnyMatch requires four orders of magnitude less parameters and incurs a 3,899 times lower inference cost (in dollars per 1,000 tokens).

### Harmonic Reasoning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Anna Kruspe

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T11:28:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming very popular and are used for many different purposes, including creative tasks in the arts. However, these models sometimes have trouble with specific reasoning tasks, especially those that involve logical thinking and counting. This paper looks at how well LLMs understand and reason when dealing with musical tasks like figuring out notes from intervals and identifying chords and scales. We tested GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o to see how they handle these tasks. Our results show that while LLMs do well with note intervals, they struggle with more complicated tasks like recognizing chords and scales. This points out clear limits in current LLM abilities and shows where we need to make them better, which could help improve how they think and work in both artistic and other complex areas. We also provide an automatically generated benchmark data set for the described tasks.

### G-Loc: Tightly-coupled Graph Localization with Prior Topo-metric   Information
**Authors**: Lorenzo Montano-Oliván, Julio A. Placed, Luis Montano, María T. Lázaro

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T11:19:26Z

**Summary**: Localization in already mapped environments is a critical component in many robotics and automotive applications, where previously acquired information can be exploited along with sensor fusion to provide robust and accurate localization estimates. In this work, we offer a new perspective on map-based localization by reusing prior topological and metric information. Thus, we reformulate this long-studied problem to go beyond the mere use of metric maps. Our framework seamlessly integrates LiDAR, inertial and GNSS measurements, and cloud-to-map registrations in a sliding window graph fashion, which allows to accommodate the uncertainty of each observation. The modularity of our framework allows it to work with different sensor configurations (e.g., LiDAR resolutions, GNSS denial) and environmental conditions (e.g., mapless regions, large environments). We have conducted several validation experiments, including the deployment in a real-world automotive application, demonstrating the accuracy, efficiency, and versatility of our system in online localization.

**Authors**: Xuanwang Zhang, Yunze Song, Yidong Wang, Shuyun Tang, Xinfeng Li, Zhengran Zeng, Zhen Wu, Wei Ye, Wenyuan Xu, Yue Zhang, Xinyu Dai, Shikun Zhang, Qingsong Wen

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T11:18:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level capabilities in dialogue, reasoning, and knowledge retention. However, even the most advanced LLMs face challenges such as hallucinations and real-time updating of their knowledge. Current research addresses this bottleneck by equipping LLMs with external knowledge, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, two key issues constrained the development of RAG. First, there is a growing lack of comprehensive and fair comparisons between novel RAG algorithms. Second, open-source tools such as LlamaIndex and LangChain employ high-level abstractions, which results in a lack of transparency and limits the ability to develop novel algorithms and evaluation metrics. To close this gap, we introduce RAGLAB, a modular and research-oriented open-source library. RAGLAB reproduces 6 existing algorithms and provides a comprehensive ecosystem for investigating RAG algorithms. Leveraging RAGLAB, we conduct a fair comparison of 6 RAG algorithms across 10 benchmarks. With RAGLAB, researchers can efficiently compare the performance of various algorithms and develop novel algorithms.

### Enhancing Critical Thinking in Education by means of a Socratic Chatbot
**Authors**: Lucile Favero, Juan Antonio Pérez-Ortiz, Tanja Käser, Nuria Oliver

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T11:09:28Z

**Summary**: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly playing a pivotal role in education by providing instantaneous, adaptive responses, their potential to promote critical thinking remains understudied. In this paper, we fill such a gap and present an innovative educational chatbot designed to foster critical thinking through Socratic questioning. Unlike traditional intelligent tutoring systems, including educational chatbots, that tend to offer direct answers, the proposed Socratic tutor encourages students to explore various perspectives and engage in self-reflection by posing structured, thought-provoking questions. Our Socratic questioning is implemented by fine and prompt-tuning the open-source pretrained LLM with a specialized dataset that stimulates critical thinking and offers multiple viewpoints. In an effort to democratize access and to protect the students' privacy, the proposed tutor is based on small LLMs (Llama2 7B and 13B-parameter models) that are able to run locally on off-the-shelf hardware. We validate our approach in a battery of experiments consisting of interactions between a simulated student and the chatbot to evaluate its effectiveness in enhancing critical thinking skills. Results indicate that the Socratic tutor supports the development of reflection and critical thinking significantly better than standard chatbots. Our approach opens the door for improving educational outcomes by cultivating active learning and encouraging intellectual autonomy.

### DexDiff: Towards Extrinsic Dexterity Manipulation of Ungraspable Objects   in Unrestricted Environments
**Authors**: Chengzhong Ma, Houxue Yang, Hanbo Zhang, Zeyang Liu, Chao Zhao, Jian Tang, Xuguang Lan, Nanning Zheng

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T10:43:18Z

**Summary**: Grasping large and flat objects (e.g. a book or a pan) is often regarded as an ungraspable task, which poses significant challenges due to the unreachable grasping poses. Previous works leverage Extrinsic Dexterity like walls or table edges to grasp such objects. However, they are limited to task-specific policies and lack task planning to find pre-grasp conditions. This makes it difficult to adapt to various environments and extrinsic dexterity constraints. Therefore, we present DexDiff, a robust robotic manipulation method for long-horizon planning with extrinsic dexterity. Specifically, we utilize a vision-language model (VLM) to perceive the environmental state and generate high-level task plans, followed by a goal-conditioned action diffusion (GCAD) model to predict the sequence of low-level actions. This model learns the low-level policy from offline data with the cumulative reward guided by high-level planning as the goal condition, which allows for improved prediction of robot actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only effectively performs ungraspable tasks but also generalizes to previously unseen objects. It outperforms baselines by a 47% higher success rate in simulation and facilitates efficient deployment and manipulation in real-world scenarios.

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T10:14:30Z

**Summary**: With the development of satellite communication technology, satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STIN), which integrate satellite networks and ground networks, can realize seamless global coverage of communication services. Confronting the intricacies of network dynamics, the diversity of resource heterogeneity, and the unpredictability of user mobility, dynamic resource allocation within networks faces formidable challenges. Digital twin (DT), as a new technique, can reflect a physical network to a virtual network to monitor, analyze, and optimize the physical network. Nevertheless, in the process of constructing the DT model, the deployment location and resource allocation of DTs may adversely affect its performance. Therefore, we propose a STIN model, which alleviates the problem of insufficient single-layer deployment flexibility of the traditional edge network by deploying DTs in multi-layer nodes in a STIN. To address the challenge of deploying DTs in the network, we propose multi-layer DT deployment in a STIN to reduce system delay. Then we adopt a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) scheme to explore the optimal strategy of the DT multi-layer deployment problem. The implemented scheme demonstrates a notable reduction in system delay, as evidenced by simulation outcomes.

**Authors**: Yu Bi, Mingshuo Yang, Yong Fang, Xianghang Mi, Shanqing Guo, Shujun Tang, Haixin Duan

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T09:49:29Z

**Summary**: Emerging in recent years, open edge computing platforms (OECPs) claim large-scale edge nodes, the extensive usage and adoption, as well as the openness to any third parties to join as edge nodes. For instance, OneThingCloud, a major OECP operated in China, advertises 5 million edge nodes, 70TB bandwidth, and 1,500PB storage. However, little information is publicly available for such OECPs with regards to their technical mechanisms and involvement in edge computing activities. Furthermore, different from known edge computing paradigms, OECPs feature an open ecosystem wherein any third party can participate as edge nodes and earn revenue for the contribution of computing and bandwidth resources, which, however, can introduce byzantine or even malicious edge nodes and thus break the traditional threat model for edge computing. In this study, we conduct the first empirical study on two representative OECPs, which is made possible through the deployment of edge nodes across locations, the efficient and semi-automatic analysis of edge traffic as well as the carefully designed security experiments. As the results, a set of novel findings and insights have been distilled with regards to their technical mechanisms, the landscape of edge nodes, the usage and adoption, and the practical security/privacy risks. Particularly, millions of daily active edge nodes have been observed, which feature a wide distribution in the network space and the extensive adoption in content delivery towards end users of 16 popular Internet services. Also, multiple practical and concerning security risks have been identified along with acknowledgements received from relevant parties, e.g., the exposure of long-term and cross-edge-node credentials, the co-location with malicious activities of diverse categories, the failures of TLS certificate verification, the extensive information leakage against end users, etc.

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T09:31:30Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkably powerful capabilities. One of the crucial factors to achieve success is aligning the LLM's output with human preferences. This alignment process often requires only a small amount of data to efficiently enhance the LLM's performance. While effective, research in this area spans multiple domains, and the methods involved are relatively complex to understand. The relationships between different methods have been under-explored, limiting the development of the preference alignment. In light of this, we break down the existing popular alignment strategies into different components and provide a unified framework to study the current alignment strategies, thereby establishing connections among them. In this survey, we decompose all the strategies in preference learning into four components: model, data, feedback, and algorithm. This unified view offers an in-depth understanding of existing alignment algorithms and also opens up possibilities to synergize the strengths of different strategies. Furthermore, we present detailed working examples of prevalent existing algorithms to facilitate a comprehensive understanding for the readers. Finally, based on our unified perspective, we explore the challenges and future research directions for aligning large language models with human preferences.

### Natural Language Processing RELIES on Linguistics
**Authors**: Juri Opitz, Shira Wein, Nathan Schneider

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T08:21:13Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become capable of generating highly fluent text in certain languages, without modules specially designed to capture grammar or semantic coherence. What does this mean for the future of linguistic expertise in NLP? We highlight several aspects in which NLP (still) relies on linguistics, or where linguistic thinking can illuminate new directions. We argue our case around the acronym RELIES that encapsulates six major facets where linguistics contributes to NLP: Resources, Evaluation, Low-resource settings, Interpretability, Explanation, and the Study of language. This list is not exhaustive, nor is linguistics the main point of reference for every effort under these themes; but at a macro level, these facets highlight the enduring importance of studying machine systems vis-\`a-vis systems of human language.

### Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Models with LLM-Based Agents
**Authors**: Yingkai Dong, Zheng Li, Xiangtao Meng, Ning Yu, Shanqing Guo

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T08:09:14Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements have significantly improved automated task-solving capabilities using autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). However, most LLM-based agents focus on dialogue, programming, or specialized domains, leaving their potential for addressing generative AI safety tasks largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose Atlas, an advanced LLM-based multi-agent framework targeting generative AI models, specifically focusing on jailbreak attacks against text-to-image (T2I) models with built-in safety filters. Atlas consists of two agents, namely the mutation agent and the selection agent, each comprising four key modules: a vision-language model (VLM) or LLM brain, planning, memory, and tool usage. The mutation agent uses its VLM brain to determine whether a prompt triggers the T2I model's safety filter. It then collaborates iteratively with the LLM brain of the selection agent to generate new candidate jailbreak prompts with the highest potential to bypass the filter. In addition to multi-agent communication, we leverage in-context learning (ICL) memory mechanisms and the chain-of-thought (COT) approach to learn from past successes and failures, thereby enhancing Atlas's performance. Our evaluation demonstrates that Atlas successfully jailbreaks several state-of-the-art T2I models equipped with multi-modal safety filters in a black-box setting. Additionally, Atlas outperforms existing methods in both query efficiency and the quality of generated images. This work convincingly demonstrates the successful application of LLM-based agents in studying the safety vulnerabilities of popular text-to-image generation models. We urge the community to consider advanced techniques like ours in response to the rapidly evolving text-to-image generation field.

### DFabric: Scaling Out Data Parallel Applications with CXL-Ethernet Hybrid   Interconnects
**Authors**: Xu Zhang, Ke Liu, Yisong Chang, Hui Yuan, Xiaolong Zheng, Ke Zhang, Mingyu Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T08:05:43Z

**Summary**: Emerging interconnects, such as CXL and NVLink, have been integrated into the intra-host topology to scale more accelerators and facilitate efficient communication between them, such as GPUs. To keep pace with the accelerator's growing computing throughput, the interconnect has seen substantial enhancement in link bandwidth, e.g., 256GBps for CXL 3.0 links, which surpasses Ethernet and InfiniBand network links by an order of magnitude or more. Consequently, when data-intensive jobs, such as LLM training, scale across multiple hosts beyond the reach limit of the interconnect, the performance is significantly hindered by the limiting bandwidth of the network infrastructure. We address the problem by proposing DFabric, a two-tier interconnect architecture. We address the problem by proposing DFabric, a two-tier interconnect architecture. First, DFabric disaggregates rack's computing units with an interconnect fabric, i.e., CXL fabric, which scales at rack-level, so that they can enjoy intra-rack efficient interconnecting. Second, DFabric disaggregates NICs from hosts, and consolidates them to form a NIC pool with CXL fabric. By providing sufficient aggregated capacity comparable to interconnect bandwidth, the NIC pool bridges efficient communication across racks or beyond the reach limit of interconnect fabric. However, the local memory accessing becomes the bottleneck when enabling each host to utilize the NIC pool efficiently. To the end, DFabric builds a memory pool with sufficient bandwidth by disaggregating host local memory and adding more memory devices. We have implemented a prototype of DFabric that can run applications transparently. We validated its performance gain by running various microbenchmarks and compute-intensive applications such as DNN and graph.

### Towards Building a Robust Knowledge Intensive Question Answering Model   with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Hong Xingyun Hong, Shao Yan Shao, Wang Zhilin Wang, Duan Manni Duan, Jin Xiongnan

**Updated**: 2024-09-10T06:11:28Z

**Summary**: The development of LLMs has greatly enhanced the intelligence and fluency of question answering, while the emergence of retrieval enhancement has enabled models to better utilize external information. However, the presence of noise and errors in retrieved information poses challenges to the robustness of LLMs. In this work, to evaluate the model's performance under multiple interferences, we first construct a dataset based on machine reading comprehension datasets simulating various scenarios, including critical information absence, noise, and conflicts. To address the issue of model accuracy decline caused by noisy external information, we propose a data augmentation-based fine-tuning method to enhance LLM's robustness against noise. Additionally, contrastive learning approach is utilized to preserve the model's discrimination capability of external information. We have conducted experiments on both existing LLMs and our approach, the results are evaluated by GPT-4, which indicates that our proposed methods improve model robustness while strengthening the model's discrimination capability.

### Seq1F1B: Efficient Sequence-Level Pipeline Parallelism for Large   Language Model Training
**Authors**: Ao Sun, Weilin Zhao, Xu Han, Cheng Yang, Xinrong Zhang, Zhiyuan Liu, Chuan Shi, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T07:31:36Z

**Summary**: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on distributed training strategies, among which pipeline parallelism plays a crucial role. As LLMs' training sequence length extends to 32k or even 128k, the current pipeline parallel methods face severe bottlenecks, including high memory footprints and substantial pipeline bubbles, greatly hindering model scalability and training throughput. To enhance memory efficiency and training throughput, in this work, we introduce an efficient sequence-level one-forward-one-backward (1F1B) pipeline scheduling method tailored for training LLMs on long sequences named Seq1F1B. Seq1F1B decomposes batch-level schedulable units into finer sequence-level units, reducing bubble size and memory footprint. Considering that Seq1F1B may produce slight extra bubbles if sequences are split evenly, we design a computation-wise strategy to partition input sequences and mitigate this side effect. Compared to competitive pipeline baseline methods such as Megatron 1F1B pipeline parallelism, our method achieves higher training throughput with less memory footprint. Notably, Seq1F1B efficiently trains a LLM with 30B parameters on sequences up to 64k using 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs without recomputation strategies, a feat unachievable with existing methods. Our source code is based on Megatron-LM, and now is avaiable at: https://github.com/MayDomine/Seq1F1B.git.

**Authors**: Petr Anokhin, Nikita Semenov, Artyom Sorokin, Dmitry Evseev, Mikhail Burtsev, Evgeny Burnaev

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T07:01:56Z

**Summary**: Advancements in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have created a promising foundation for developing autonomous agents. With the right tools, these agents could learn to solve tasks in new environments by accumulating and updating their knowledge. Current LLM-based agents process past experiences using a full history of observations, summarization, retrieval augmentation. However, these unstructured memory representations do not facilitate the reasoning and planning essential for complex decision-making. In our study, we introduce AriGraph, a novel method wherein the agent constructs and updates a memory graph that integrates semantic and episodic memories while exploring the environment. We demonstrate that our Ariadne LLM agent, consisting of the proposed memory architecture augmented with planning and decision-making, effectively handles complex tasks within interactive text game environments difficult even for human players. Results show that our approach markedly outperforms other established memory methods and strong RL baselines in a range of problems of varying complexity. Additionally, AriGraph demonstrates competitive performance compared to dedicated knowledge graph-based methods in static multi-hop question-answering.

### KARGEN: Knowledge-enhanced Automated Radiology Report Generation Using   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yingshu Li, Zhanyu Wang, Yunyi Liu, Lei Wang, Lingqiao Liu, Luping Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T06:57:22Z

**Summary**: Harnessing the robust capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for narrative generation, logical reasoning, and common-sense knowledge integration, this study delves into utilizing LLMs to enhance automated radiology report generation (R2Gen). Despite the wealth of knowledge within LLMs, efficiently triggering relevant knowledge within these large models for specific tasks like R2Gen poses a critical research challenge. This paper presents KARGEN, a Knowledge-enhanced Automated radiology Report GENeration framework based on LLMs. Utilizing a frozen LLM to generate reports, the framework integrates a knowledge graph to unlock chest disease-related knowledge within the LLM to enhance the clinical utility of generated reports. This is achieved by leveraging the knowledge graph to distill disease-related features in a designed way. Since a radiology report encompasses both normal and disease-related findings, the extracted graph-enhanced disease-related features are integrated with regional image features, attending to both aspects. We explore two fusion methods to automatically prioritize and select the most relevant features. The fused features are employed by LLM to generate reports that are more sensitive to diseases and of improved quality. Our approach demonstrates promising results on the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray datasets.

**Authors**: Nils Dycke, Matej Zečević, Ilia Kuznetsov, Beatrix Suess, Kristian Kersting, Iryna Gurevych

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T06:55:37Z

**Summary**: Diagnostic reasoning is a key component of expert work in many domains. It is a hard, time-consuming activity that requires expertise, and AI research has investigated the ways automated systems can support this process. Yet, due to the complexity of natural language, the applications of AI for diagnostic reasoning to language-related tasks are lacking. To close this gap, we investigate diagnostic abductive reasoning (DAR) in the context of language-grounded tasks (NL-DAR). We propose a novel modeling framework for NL-DAR based on Pearl's structural causal models and instantiate it in a comprehensive study of scientific paper assessment in the biomedical domain. We use the resulting dataset to investigate the human decision-making process in NL-DAR and determine the potential of LLMs to support structured decision-making over text. Our framework, open resources and tools lay the groundwork for the empirical study of collaborative diagnostic reasoning in the age of LLMs, in the scholarly domain and beyond.

### iBA: Backdoor Attack on 3D Point Cloud via Reconstructing Itself
**Authors**: Yuhao Bian, Shengjing Tian, Xiuping Liu

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T06:54:53Z

**Summary**: The widespread deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for 3D point cloud processing starkly contrasts with their susceptibility to security breaches, notably backdoor attacks. These attacks hijack DNNs during training, embedding triggers in the data that, once activated, cause the network to make predetermined errors while maintaining normal performance on unaltered data. This vulnerability poses significant risks, especially given the insufficient research on robust defense mechanisms for 3D point cloud networks against such sophisticated threats. Existing attacks either struggle to resist basic point cloud pre-processing methods, or rely on delicate manual design. Exploring simple, effective, imperceptible, and difficult-to-defend triggers in 3D point clouds is still challenging.To address these challenges, we introduce MirrorAttack, a novel effective 3D backdoor attack method, which implants the trigger by simply reconstructing a clean point cloud with an auto-encoder. The data-driven nature of the MirrorAttack obviates the need for complex manual design. Minimizing the reconstruction loss automatically improves imperceptibility. Simultaneously, the reconstruction network endows the trigger with pronounced nonlinearity and sample specificity, rendering traditional preprocessing techniques ineffective in eliminating it. A trigger smoothing module based on spherical harmonic transformation is also attached to regulate the intensity of the attack.Both quantitive and qualitative results verify the effectiveness of our method. We achieve state-of-the-art ASR on different types of victim models with the intervention of defensive techniques. Moreover, the minimal perturbation introduced by our trigger, as assessed by various metrics, attests to the method's stealth, ensuring its imperceptibility.

### Fine-Tuning, Quantization, and LLMs: Navigating Unintended Outcomes
**Authors**: Divyanshu Kumar, Anurakt Kumar, Sahil Agarwal, Prashanth Harshangi

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T06:25:33Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption across various domains, including chatbots and auto-task completion agents. However, these models are susceptible to safety vulnerabilities such as jailbreaking, prompt injection, and privacy leakage attacks. These vulnerabilities can lead to the generation of malicious content, unauthorized actions, or the disclosure of confidential information. While foundational LLMs undergo alignment training and incorporate safety measures, they are often subject to fine-tuning, or doing quantization resource-constrained environments. This study investigates the impact of these modifications on LLM safety, a critical consideration for building reliable and secure AI systems. We evaluate foundational models including Mistral, Llama series, Qwen, and MosaicML, along with their fine-tuned variants. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that fine-tuning generally increases the success rates of jailbreak attacks, while quantization has variable effects on attack success rates. Importantly, we find that properly implemented guardrails significantly enhance resistance to jailbreak attempts. These findings contribute to our understanding of LLM vulnerabilities and provide insights for developing more robust safety strategies in the deployment of language models.

### ChatQA 2: Bridging the Gap to Proprietary LLMs in Long Context and RAG   Capabilities
**Authors**: Peng Xu, Wei Ping, Xianchao Wu, Chejian Xu, Zihan Liu, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T06:19:07Z

**Summary**: In this work, we introduce ChatQA 2, an Llama 3.0-based model with a 128K context window, designed to bridge the gap between open-source LLMs and leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4-Turbo) in long-context understanding and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. These two capabilities are essential for LLMs to process large volumes of information that cannot fit into a single prompt and are complementary to each other, depending on the downstream tasks and computational budgets. We present a detailed continued training recipe to extend the context window of Llama3-70B-base from 8K to 128K tokens, along with a three-stage instruction tuning process to enhance the model's instruction-following, RAG performance, and long-context understanding capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B model outperforms most existing state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct, on ultra-long tasks beyond 100K tokens, as well as on the RAG benchmark using only a 4K context window, showing the strong long context capability across varying sequence lengths. We further provide extensive comparisons between direct long-context and RAG solutions using the same state-of-the-art long-context LLMs. Interestingly, we find that the performance of strong long-context LLMs using RAG improves when retrieving a larger number of chunks. With a large set of top-k chunks, RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context solution using the same state-of-the-art long-context models (e.g., Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B and Qwen2-72B-Instruct) on both 32K benchmarks and real-world 128K tasks. To advance research in this field, we open-sourced the model weights, training data, and the evaluation setup for the for the community: https://chatqa2-project.github.io/

### A Survey on Employing Large Language Models for Text-to-SQL Tasks
**Authors**: Liang Shi, Zhengju Tang, Nan Zhang, Xiaotong Zhang, Zhi Yang

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T06:17:21Z

**Summary**: The increasing volume of data stored in relational databases has led to the need for efficient querying and utilization of this data in various sectors. However, writing SQL queries requires specialized knowledge, which poses a challenge for non-professional users trying to access and query databases. Text-to-SQL parsing solves this issue by converting natural language queries into SQL queries, thus making database access more accessible for non-expert users. To take advantage of the recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs), a range of new methods have emerged, with a primary focus on prompt engineering and fine-tuning. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of LLMs in text-to-SQL tasks, discussing benchmark datasets, prompt engineering, fine-tuning methods, and future research directions. We hope this review will enable readers to gain a broader understanding of the recent advances in this field and offer some insights into its future trajectory.

### GOPT: Generalizable Online 3D Bin Packing via Transformer-based Deep   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Heng Xiong, Changrong Guo, Jian Peng, Kai Ding, Xuchong Qiu, Long Bai, Jianfeng Xu

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T06:02:17Z

**Summary**: Robotic object packing has broad practical applications in the logistics and automation industry, often formulated by researchers as the online 3D Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP). However, existing DRL-based methods primarily focus on enhancing performance in limited packing environments while neglecting the ability to generalize across multiple environments characterized by different bin dimensions. To this end, we propose GOPT, a generalizable online 3D Bin Packing approach via Transformer-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL). First, we design a Placement Generator module to yield finite subspaces as placement candidates and the representation of the bin. Second, we propose a Packing Transformer, which fuses the features of the items and bin, to identify the spatial correlation between the item to be packed and available sub-spaces within the bin. Coupling these two components enables GOPT's ability to perform inference on bins of varying dimensions. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that GOPT not only achieves superior performance against the baselines, but also exhibits excellent generalization capabilities. Furthermore, the deployment with a robot showcases the practical applicability of our method in the real world. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Xiong5Heng/GOPT.

### MQuAKE: Assessing Knowledge Editing in Language Models via Multi-Hop   Questions
**Authors**: Zexuan Zhong, Zhengxuan Wu, Christopher D. Manning, Christopher Potts, Danqi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T04:38:16Z

**Summary**: The information stored in large language models (LLMs) falls out of date quickly, and retraining from scratch is often not an option. This has recently given rise to a range of techniques for injecting new facts through updating model weights. Current evaluation paradigms are extremely limited, mainly validating the recall of edited facts, but changing one fact should cause rippling changes to the model's related beliefs. If we edit the UK Prime Minister to now be Rishi Sunak, then we should get a different answer to Who is married to the British Prime Minister? In this work, we present a benchmark, MQuAKE (Multi-hop Question Answering for Knowledge Editing), comprising multi-hop questions that assess whether edited models correctly answer questions where the answer should change as an entailed consequence of edited facts. While we find that current knowledge-editing approaches can recall edited facts accurately, they fail catastrophically on the constructed multi-hop questions. We thus propose a simple memory-based approach, MeLLo, which stores all edited facts externally while prompting the language model iteratively to generate answers that are consistent with the edited facts. While MQuAKE remains challenging, we show that MeLLo scales well with LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo) and outperforms previous model editors by a large margin.

### Tele-LLMs: A Series of Specialized Large Language Models for   Telecommunications
**Authors**: Ali Maatouk, Kenny Chirino Ampudia, Rex Ying, Leandros Tassiulas

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T03:58:51Z

**Summary**: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various fields, from natural language processing to sectors like medicine and finance. However, despite their rapid proliferation, the applications of LLMs in telecommunications remain limited, often relying on general-purpose models that lack domain-specific specialization. This lack of specialization results in underperformance, particularly when dealing with telecommunications-specific technical terminology and their associated mathematical representations. This paper addresses this gap by first creating and disseminating Tele-Data, a comprehensive dataset of telecommunications material curated from relevant sources, and Tele-Eval, a large-scale question-and-answer dataset tailored to the domain. Through extensive experiments, we explore the most effective training techniques for adapting LLMs to the telecommunications domain, ranging from examining the division of expertise across various telecommunications aspects to employing parameter-efficient techniques. We also investigate how models of different sizes behave during adaptation and analyze the impact of their training data on this behavior. Leveraging these findings, we develop and open-source Tele-LLMs, the first series of language models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, specifically tailored for telecommunications. Our evaluations demonstrate that these models outperform their general-purpose counterparts on Tele-Eval while retaining their previously acquired capabilities, thus avoiding the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon.

### Resource-Efficient Generative AI Model Deployment in Mobile Edge   Networks
**Authors**: Yuxin Liang, Peng Yang, Yuanyuan He, Feng Lyu

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T03:17:28Z

**Summary**: The surging development of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) marks a transformative era of the content creation and production. Edge servers promise attractive benefits, e.g., reduced service delay and backhaul traffic load, for hosting AIGC services compared to cloud-based solutions. However, the scarcity of available resources on the edge pose significant challenges in deploying generative AI models. In this paper, by characterizing the resource and delay demands of typical generative AI models, we find that the consumption of storage and GPU memory, as well as the model switching delay represented by I/O delay during the preloading phase, are significant and vary across models. These multidimensional coupling factors render it difficult to make efficient edge model deployment decisions. Hence, we present a collaborative edge-cloud framework aiming to properly manage generative AI model deployment on the edge. Specifically, we formulate edge model deployment problem considering heterogeneous features of models as an optimization problem, and propose a model-level decision selection algorithm to solve it. It enables pooled resource sharing and optimizes the trade-off between resource consumption and delay in edge generative AI model deployment. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm compared with baselines, demonstrating its potential to reduce overall costs by providing feature-aware model deployment decisions.

### Diagram Formalization Enhanced Multi-Modal Geometry Problem Solver
**Authors**: Zeren Zhang, Jo-Ku Cheng, Jingyang Deng, Lu Tian, Jinwen Ma, Ziran Qin, Xiaokai Zhang, Na Zhu, Tuo Leng

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T02:46:34Z

**Summary**: Mathematical reasoning remains an ongoing challenge for AI models, especially for geometry problems that require both linguistic and visual signals. As the vision encoders of most MLLMs are trained on natural scenes, they often struggle to understand geometric diagrams, performing no better in geometry problem solving than LLMs that only process text. This limitation is amplified by the lack of effective methods for representing geometric relationships. To address these issues, we introduce the Diagram Formalization Enhanced Geometry Problem Solver (DFE-GPS), a new framework that integrates visual features, geometric formal language, and natural language representations. We propose a novel synthetic data approach and create a large-scale geometric dataset, SynthGeo228K, annotated with both formal and natural language captions, designed to enhance the vision encoder for a better understanding of geometric structures. Our framework improves MLLMs' ability to process geometric diagrams and extends their application to open-ended tasks on the formalgeo7k dataset.

### Seek and Solve Reasoning for Table Question Answering
**Authors**: Ruya Jiang, Chun Wang, Weihong Deng

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T02:41:00Z

**Summary**: Table-based Question Answering (TQA) involves answering questions based on tabular data. The complexity of table structures and question logic makes this task difficult even for Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper improves TQA performance by leveraging LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Inspired by how humans solve TQA tasks, we propose a Seek-and-Solve pipeline that instructs the LLM to first seek relevant information and then answer questions. The two stages are integrated at the reasoning level, and their Chain of Thought (CoT) paths are integrated into a coherent Seek-and-Solve CoT (SS-CoT). Furthermore, we present a compact single-stage TQA-solving prompt distilled from the pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that under In-Context Learning settings, using samples with SS-CoT paths as demonstrations, the TQA-solving prompt can effectively guide the LLM to solve complex TQA tasks, resulting in improved performance and reliability. Our results highlight the importance of properly eliciting LLMs' reasoning capabilities in solving complex TQA tasks.

### A Study on Prompt Injection Attack Against LLM-Integrated Mobile Robotic   Systems
**Authors**: Wenxiao Zhang, Xiangrui Kong, Conan Dewitt, Thomas Braunl, Jin B. Hong

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T01:55:03Z

**Summary**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o into robotic systems represents a significant advancement in embodied artificial intelligence. These models can process multi-modal prompts, enabling them to generate more context-aware responses. However, this integration is not without challenges. One of the primary concerns is the potential security risks associated with using LLMs in robotic navigation tasks. These tasks require precise and reliable responses to ensure safe and effective operation. Multi-modal prompts, while enhancing the robot's understanding, also introduce complexities that can be exploited maliciously. For instance, adversarial inputs designed to mislead the model can lead to incorrect or dangerous navigational decisions. This study investigates the impact of prompt injections on mobile robot performance in LLM-integrated systems and explores secure prompt strategies to mitigate these risks. Our findings demonstrate a substantial overall improvement of approximately 30.8% in both attack detection and system performance with the implementation of robust defence mechanisms, highlighting their critical role in enhancing security and reliability in mission-oriented tasks.

### Towards Automated Machine Learning Research
**Authors**: Shervin Ardeshir

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T00:47:30Z

**Summary**: This paper explores a top-down approach to automating incremental advances in machine learning research through component-level innovation, facilitated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our framework systematically generates novel components, validates their feasibility, and evaluates their performance against existing baselines. A key distinction of this approach lies in how these novel components are generated. Unlike traditional AutoML and NAS methods, which often rely on a bottom-up combinatorial search over predefined, hardcoded base components, our method leverages the cross-domain knowledge embedded in LLMs to propose new components that may not be confined to any hard-coded predefined set. By incorporating a reward model to prioritize promising hypotheses, we aim to improve the efficiency of the hypothesis generation and evaluation process. We hope this approach offers a new avenue for exploration and contributes to the ongoing dialogue in the field.

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T23:51:04Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly increased in size and apparent capabilities in the last three years, but their training data is largely English text. There is growing interest in multilingual LLMs, and various efforts are striving for models to accommodate languages of communities outside of the Global North, which include many languages that have been historically underrepresented in digital realms. These languages have been coined as "low resource languages" or "long-tail languages", and LLMs performance on these languages is generally poor. While expanding the use of LLMs to more languages may bring many potential benefits, such as assisting cross-community communication and language preservation, great care must be taken to ensure that data collection on these languages is not extractive and that it does not reproduce exploitative practices of the past. Collecting data from languages spoken by previously colonized people, indigenous people, and non-Western languages raises many complex sociopolitical and ethical questions, e.g., around consent, cultural safety, and data sovereignty. Furthermore, linguistic complexity and cultural nuances are often lost in LLMs. This position paper builds on recent scholarship, and our own work, and outlines several relevant social, cultural, and ethical considerations and potential ways to mitigate them through qualitative research, community partnerships, and participatory design approaches. We provide twelve recommendations for consideration when collecting language data on underrepresented language communities outside of the Global North.

### Self-Reflection in LLM Agents: Effects on Problem-Solving Performance
**Authors**: Matthew Renze, Erhan Guven

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T20:33:03Z

**Summary**: In this study, we investigated the effects of self-reflection in large language models (LLMs) on problem-solving performance. We instructed nine popular LLMs to answer a series of multiple-choice questions to provide a performance baseline. For each incorrectly answered question, we instructed eight types of self-reflecting LLM agents to reflect on their mistakes and provide themselves with guidance to improve problem-solving. Then, using this guidance, each self-reflecting agent attempted to re-answer the same questions. Our results indicate that LLM agents are able to significantly improve their problem-solving performance through self-reflection ($p < 0.001$). In addition, we compared the various types of self-reflection to determine their individual contribution to performance. All code and data are available on GitHub at https://github.com/matthewrenze/self-reflection

### Keyword-driven Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models for Cold-start   User Recommendations
**Authors**: Hai-Dang Kieu, Minh Duc Nguyen, Thanh-Son Nguyen, Dung D. Le

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T20:32:47Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in enhancing recommender systems. However, addressing the cold-start recommendation problem, where users lack historical data, remains a considerable challenge. In this paper, we introduce KALM4Rec (Keyword-driven Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models for Cold-start User Recommendations), a novel framework specifically designed to tackle this problem by requiring only a few input keywords from users in a practical scenario of cold-start user restaurant recommendations. KALM4Rec operates in two main stages: candidates retrieval and LLM-based candidates re-ranking. In the first stage, keyword-driven retrieval models are used to identify potential candidates, addressing LLMs' limitations in processing extensive tokens and reducing the risk of generating misleading information. In the second stage, we employ LLMs with various prompting strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot techniques, to re-rank these candidates by integrating multiple examples directly into the LLM prompts. Our evaluation, using a Yelp restaurant dataset with user reviews from three English-speaking cities, shows that our proposed framework significantly improves recommendation quality. Specifically, the integration of in-context instructions with LLMs for re-ranking markedly enhances the performance of the cold-start user recommender system.

### ProGRes: Prompted Generative Rescoring on ASR n-Best
**Authors**: Ada Defne Tur, Adel Moumen, Mirco Ravanelli

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T20:08:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown their ability to improve the performance of speech recognizers by effectively rescoring the n-best hypotheses generated during the beam search process. However, the best way to exploit recent generative instruction-tuned LLMs for hypothesis rescoring is still unclear. This paper proposes a novel method that uses instruction-tuned LLMs to dynamically expand the n-best speech recognition hypotheses with new hypotheses generated through appropriately-prompted LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a new zero-shot method for ASR n-best rescoring, which combines confidence scores, LLM sequence scoring, and prompt-based hypothesis generation. We compare Llama-3-Instruct, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4 Turbo as prompt-based generators with Llama-3 as sequence scorer LLM. We evaluated our approach using different speech recognizers and observed significant relative improvement in the word error rate (WER) ranging from 5% to 25%.

### Using LLMs to Establish Implicit User Sentiment of Software Desirability
**Authors**: Sherri Weitl-Harms, John D. Hastings, Jonah Lum

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T19:59:06Z

**Summary**: This study explores the use of LLMs for providing quantitative zero-shot sentiment analysis of implicit software desirability, addressing a critical challenge in product evaluation where traditional review scores, though convenient, fail to capture the richness of qualitative user feedback. Innovations include establishing a method that 1) works with qualitative user experience data without the need for explicit review scores, 2) focuses on implicit user satisfaction, and 3) provides scaled numerical sentiment analysis, offering a more nuanced understanding of user sentiment, instead of simply classifying sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative.   Data is collected using the Microsoft Product Desirability Toolkit (PDT), a well-known qualitative user experience analysis tool. For initial exploration, the PDT metric was given to users of two software systems. PDT data was fed through several LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3 and 3.5, GPT4, and GPT4o) and through a leading transfer learning technique, Twitter-Roberta-Base-Sentiment, and Vader, a leading sentiment analysis tool. Each system was asked to evaluate the data in two ways, by looking at the sentiment expressed in the PDT word/explanation pairs; and by looking at the sentiment expressed by the users in their grouped selection of five words and explanations, as a whole. Each LLM provided a sentiment score, its confidence (low, medium, high) in the score, and an explanation of the score.   All LLMs tested were able to statistically detect user sentiment from the users' grouped data, whereas TRBS and Vader were not. The confidence and explanation of confidence provided by the LLMs assisted in understanding user sentiment. This study adds deeper understanding of evaluating user experiences, toward the goal of creating a universal tool that quantifies implicit sentiment.

### Seemingly Plausible Distractors in Multi-Hop Reasoning: Are Large   Language Models Attentive Readers?
**Authors**: Neeladri Bhuiya, Viktor Schlegel, Stefan Winkler

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T19:22:58Z

**Summary**: State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) are accredited with an increasing number of different capabilities, ranging from reading comprehension, over advanced mathematical and reasoning skills to possessing scientific knowledge. In this paper we focus on their multi-hop reasoning capability: the ability to identify and integrate information from multiple textual sources.   Given the concerns with the presence of simplifying cues in existing multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, which allow models to circumvent the reasoning requirement, we set out to investigate, whether LLMs are prone to exploiting such simplifying cues. We find evidence that they indeed circumvent the requirement to perform multi-hop reasoning, but they do so in more subtle ways than what was reported about their fine-tuned pre-trained language model (PLM) predecessors. Motivated by this finding, we propose a challenging multi-hop reasoning benchmark, by generating seemingly plausible multi-hop reasoning chains, which ultimately lead to incorrect answers. We evaluate multiple open and proprietary state-of-the-art LLMs, and find that their performance to perform multi-hop reasoning is affected, as indicated by up to 45% relative decrease in F1 score when presented with such seemingly plausible alternatives. We conduct a deeper analysis and find evidence that while LLMs tend to ignore misleading lexical cues, misleading reasoning paths indeed present a significant challenge.

### Fact-and-Reflection (FaR) Improves Confidence Calibration of Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Xinran Zhao, Hongming Zhang, Xiaoman Pan, Wenlin Yao, Dong Yu, Tongshuang Wu, Jianshu Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T19:17:32Z

**Summary**: For a LLM to be trustworthy, its confidence level should be well-calibrated with its actual performance. While it is now common sense that LLM performances are greatly impacted by prompts, the confidence calibration in prompting LLMs has yet to be thoroughly explored. In this paper, we explore how different prompting strategies influence LLM confidence calibration and how it could be improved. We conduct extensive experiments on six prompting methods in the question-answering context and we observe that, while these methods help improve the expected LLM calibration, they also trigger LLMs to be over-confident when responding to some instances. Inspired by human cognition, we propose Fact-and-Reflection (FaR) prompting, which improves the LLM calibration in two steps. First, FaR elicits the known "facts" that are relevant to the input prompt from the LLM. And then it asks the model to "reflect" over them to generate the final answer. Experiments show that FaR prompting achieves significantly better calibration; it lowers the Expected Calibration Error by 23.5% on our multi-purpose QA tasks. Notably, FaR prompting even elicits the capability of verbally expressing concerns in less confident scenarios, which helps trigger retrieval augmentation for solving these harder instances.

### SS-GEN: A Social Story Generation Framework with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yi Feng, Mingyang Song, Jiaqi Wang, Zhuang Chen, Guanqun Bi, Minlie Huang, Liping Jing, Jian Yu

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T19:06:37Z

**Summary**: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often misunderstand social situations and struggle to participate in daily routines. Social Stories are traditionally crafted by psychology experts under strict constraints to address these challenges but are costly and limited in diversity. As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance, there's an opportunity to develop more automated, affordable, and accessible methods to generate Social Stories in real-time with broad coverage. However, adapting LLMs to meet the unique and strict constraints of Social Stories is a challenging issue. To this end, we propose \textbf{SS-GEN}, a \textbf{S}ocial \textbf{S}tory \textbf{GEN}eration framework with LLMs. Firstly, we develop a constraint-driven sophisticated strategy named \textbf{\textsc{StarSow}} to hierarchically prompt LLMs to generate Social Stories at scale, followed by rigorous human filtering to build a high-quality dataset. Additionally, we introduce \textbf{quality assessment criteria} to evaluate the effectiveness of these generated stories. Considering that powerful closed-source large models require very complex instructions and expensive API fees, we finally fine-tune smaller language models with our curated high-quality dataset, achieving comparable results at lower costs and with simpler instruction and deployment. This work marks a significant step in leveraging AI to personalize Social Stories cost-effectively for autistic children at scale, which we hope can encourage future research. The prompt, code and data will release in the \texttt{Technical Appendix} and \texttt{Code \& Data Appendix} at \url{https://github.com/MIMIFY/SS-GEN}.

### Insights from Benchmarking Frontier Language Models on Web App Code   Generation
**Authors**: Yi Cui

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T18:24:26Z

**Summary**: This paper presents insights from evaluating 16 frontier large language models (LLMs) on the WebApp1K benchmark, a test suite designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web application code. The results reveal that while all models possess similar underlying knowledge, their performance is differentiated by the frequency of mistakes they make. By analyzing lines of code (LOC) and failure distributions, we find that writing correct code is more complex than generating incorrect code. Furthermore, prompt engineering shows limited efficacy in reducing errors beyond specific cases. These findings suggest that further advancements in coding LLM should emphasize on model reliability and mistake minimization.

### Data Alignment for Zero-Shot Concept Generation in Dermatology AI
**Authors**: Soham Gadgil, Mahtab Bigverdi

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T17:46:36Z

**Summary**: AI in dermatology is evolving at a rapid pace but the major limitation to training trustworthy classifiers is the scarcity of data with ground-truth concept level labels, which are meta-labels semantically meaningful to humans. Foundation models like CLIP providing zero-shot capabilities can help alleviate this challenge by leveraging vast amounts of image-caption pairs available on the internet. CLIP can be fine-tuned using domain specific image-caption pairs to improve classification performance. However, CLIP's pre-training data is not well-aligned with the medical jargon that clinicians use to perform diagnoses. The development of large language models (LLMs) in recent years has led to the possibility of leveraging the expressive nature of these models to generate rich text. Our goal is to use these models to generate caption text that aligns well with both the clinical lexicon and with the natural human language used in CLIP's pre-training data. Starting with captions used for images in PubMed articles, we extend them by passing the raw captions through an LLM fine-tuned on the field's several textbooks. We find that using captions generated by an expressive fine-tuned LLM like GPT-3.5 improves downstream zero-shot concept classification performance.

### Exploiting Code Symmetries for Learning Program Semantics
**Authors**: Kexin Pei, Weichen Li, Qirui Jin, Shuyang Liu, Scott Geng, Lorenzo Cavallaro, Junfeng Yang, Suman Jana

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T17:23:16Z

**Summary**: This paper tackles the challenge of teaching code semantics to Large Language Models (LLMs) for program analysis by incorporating code symmetries into the model architecture. We introduce a group-theoretic framework that defines code symmetries as semantics-preserving transformations, where forming a code symmetry group enables precise and efficient reasoning of code semantics. Our solution, SymC, develops a novel variant of self-attention that is provably equivariant to code symmetries from the permutation group defined over the program dependence graph. SymC obtains superior performance on five program analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art code models without any pre-training. Our results suggest that code LLMs that encode the code structural prior via the code symmetry group generalize better and faster.

### Distributed Speculative Inference of Large Language Models is Provably   Faster
**Authors**: Nadav Timor, Jonathan Mamou, Daniel Korat, Moshe Berchansky, Oren Pereg, Moshe Wasserblat, Tomer Galanti, Michal Gordon, David Harel

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T17:15:17Z

**Summary**: Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) is an important challenge in artificial intelligence. This paper introduces Distributed Speculative Inference (DSI), a novel distributed inference algorithm that is provably faster than speculative inference (SI) [leviathan2023fast,chen2023accelerating,miao2023specinfer] and traditional autoregressive inference (non-SI). Like other SI algorithms, DSI works on frozen LLMs, requiring no training or architectural modifications, and it preserves the target distribution. Prior studies on SI have demonstrated empirical speedups (compared to non-SI) but require fast and accurate drafters, which are often unavailable in practice. We identify a gap where SI can be slower than non-SI given slower or less accurate drafters. We close this gap by proving that DSI is faster than both SI and non-SI--given any drafters. DSI introduces a novel type of task parallelism called Speculation Parallelism (SP), which orchestrates target and drafter instances to overlap in time, creating a new foundational tradeoff between computational resources and latency. DSI is not only faster than SI but also supports LLMs that cannot be accelerated with SI. Our simulations show speedups of off-the-shelf LLMs in realistic single-node settings where DSI is 1.29-1.92x faster than SI.

### Jäger: Automated Telephone Call Traceback
**Authors**: David Adei, Varun Madathil, Sathvik Prasad, Bradley Reaves, Alessandra Scafuro

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T17:09:16Z

**Summary**: Unsolicited telephone calls that facilitate fraud or unlawful telemarketing continue to overwhelm network users and the regulators who prosecute them. The first step in prosecuting phone abuse is traceback -- identifying the call originator. This fundamental investigative task currently requires hours of manual effort per call. In this paper, we introduce J\"ager, a distributed secure call traceback system. J\"ager can trace a call in a few seconds, even with partial deployment, while cryptographically preserving the privacy of call parties, carrier trade secrets like peers and call volume, and limiting the threat of bulk analysis. We establish definitions and requirements of secure traceback, then develop a suite of protocols that meet these requirements using witness encryption, oblivious pseudorandom functions, and group signatures. We prove these protocols secure in the universal composibility framework. We then demonstrate that J\"ager has low compute and bandwidth costs per call, and these costs scale linearly with call volume. J\"ager provides an efficient, secure, privacy-preserving system to revolutionize telephone abuse investigation with minimal costs to operators.

### OneGen: Efficient One-Pass Unified Generation and Retrieval for LLMs
**Authors**: Jintian Zhang, Cheng Peng, Mengshu Sun, Xiang Chen, Lei Liang, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T16:35:19Z

**Summary**: Despite the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), which have significantly enhanced the generative capabilities for various NLP tasks, LLMs still face limitations in directly handling retrieval tasks. However, many practical applications demand the seamless integration of both retrieval and generation. This paper introduces a novel and efficient One-pass Generation and retrieval framework (OneGen), designed to improve LLMs' performance on tasks that require both generation and retrieval. The proposed framework bridges the traditionally separate training approaches for generation and retrieval by incorporating retrieval tokens generated autoregressively. This enables a single LLM to handle both tasks simultaneously in a unified forward pass. We conduct experiments on two distinct types of composite tasks, RAG and Entity Linking, to validate the pluggability, effectiveness, and efficiency of OneGen in training and inference. Furthermore, our results show that integrating generation and retrieval within the same context preserves the generative capabilities of LLMs while improving retrieval performance. To the best of our knowledge, OneGen is the first to enable LLMs to conduct vector retrieval during the generation.

### T2VSafetyBench: Evaluating the Safety of Text-to-Video Generative Models
**Authors**: Yibo Miao, Yifan Zhu, Yinpeng Dong, Lijia Yu, Jun Zhu, Xiao-Shan Gao

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T16:19:53Z

**Summary**: The recent development of Sora leads to a new era in text-to-video (T2V) generation. Along with this comes the rising concern about its security risks. The generated videos may contain illegal or unethical content, and there is a lack of comprehensive quantitative understanding of their safety, posing a challenge to their reliability and practical deployment. Previous evaluations primarily focus on the quality of video generation. While some evaluations of text-to-image models have considered safety, they cover fewer aspects and do not address the unique temporal risk inherent in video generation. To bridge this research gap, we introduce T2VSafetyBench, a new benchmark designed for conducting safety-critical assessments of text-to-video models. We define 12 critical aspects of video generation safety and construct a malicious prompt dataset including real-world prompts, LLM-generated prompts and jailbreak attack-based prompts. Based on our evaluation results, we draw several important findings, including: 1) no single model excels in all aspects, with different models showing various strengths; 2) the correlation between GPT-4 assessments and manual reviews is generally high; 3) there is a trade-off between the usability and safety of text-to-video generative models. This indicates that as the field of video generation rapidly advances, safety risks are set to surge, highlighting the urgency of prioritizing video safety. We hope that T2VSafetyBench can provide insights for better understanding the safety of video generation in the era of generative AI.

### DSLR: Document Refinement with Sentence-Level Re-ranking and   Reconstruction to Enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Taeho Hwang, Soyeong Jeong, Sukmin Cho, SeungYoon Han, Jong C. Park

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T15:01:56Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved their performance across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with generating non-factual responses due to limitations in their parametric memory. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address this issue by incorporating external knowledge with a retrieval module. Despite their successes, however, current RAG systems face challenges with retrieval failures and the limited ability of LLMs to filter out irrelevant information. Therefore, in this work, we propose DSLR (Document Refinement with Sentence-Level Re-ranking and Reconstruction), an unsupervised framework that decomposes retrieved documents into sentences, filters out irrelevant sentences, and reconstructs them again into coherent passages. We experimentally validate DSLR on multiple open-domain QA datasets and the results demonstrate that DSLR significantly enhances the RAG performance over conventional fixed-size passage. Furthermore, our DSLR enhances performance in specific, yet realistic scenarios without the need for additional training, providing an effective and efficient solution for refining retrieved documents in RAG systems.

### Leveraging Large Language Models for Wireless Symbol Detection via   In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Momin Abbas, Koushik Kar, Tianyi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T14:49:46Z

**Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant strides in tackling challenging tasks in wireless systems, especially when an accurate wireless model is not available. However, when available data is limited, traditional DNNs often yield subpar results due to underfitting. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) exemplified by GPT-3, have remarkably showcased their capabilities across a broad range of natural language processing tasks. But whether and how LLMs can benefit challenging non-language tasks in wireless systems is unexplored. In this work, we propose to leverage the in-context learning ability (a.k.a. prompting) of LLMs to solve wireless tasks in the low data regime without any training or fine-tuning, unlike DNNs which require training. We further demonstrate that the performance of LLMs varies significantly when employed with different prompt templates. To solve this issue, we employ the latest LLM calibration methods. Our results reveal that using LLMs via ICL methods generally outperforms traditional DNNs on the symbol demodulation task and yields highly confident predictions when coupled with calibration techniques.

**Authors**: Leyi Pan, Aiwei Liu, Yijian Lu, Zitian Gao, Yichen Di, Lijie Wen, Irwin King, Philip S. Yu

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T14:45:47Z

**Summary**: Watermarking algorithms for large language models (LLMs) have attained high accuracy in detecting LLM-generated text. However, existing methods primarily focus on distinguishing fully watermarked text from non-watermarked text, overlooking real-world scenarios where LLMs generate only small sections within large documents. In this scenario, balancing time complexity and detection performance poses significant challenges. This paper presents WaterSeeker, a novel approach to efficiently detect and locate watermarked segments amid extensive natural text. It first applies an efficient anomaly extraction method to preliminarily locate suspicious watermarked regions. Following this, it conducts a local traversal and performs full-text detection for more precise verification. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that WaterSeeker achieves a superior balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, WaterSeeker's localization ability supports the development of interpretable AI detection systems. This work pioneers a new direction in watermarked segment detection, facilitating more reliable AI-generated content identification.

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T14:29:38Z

**Summary**: Software Engineering (SE) is the systematic design, development, maintenance, and management of software applications underpinning the digital infrastructure of our modern world. Very recently, the SE community has seen a rapidly increasing number of techniques employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate a broad range of SE tasks. Nevertheless, existing information of the applications, effects, and possible limitations of LLMs within SE is still not well-studied.   In this paper, we provide a systematic survey to summarize the current state-of-the-art research in the LLM-based SE community. We summarize 62 representative LLMs of Code across three model architectures, 15 pre-training objectives across four categories, and 16 downstream tasks across five categories. We then present a detailed summarization of the recent SE studies for which LLMs are commonly utilized, including 947 studies for 112 specific code-related tasks across five crucial phases within the SE workflow. We also discuss several critical aspects during the integration of LLMs into SE, such as empirical evaluation, benchmarking, security and reliability, domain tuning, compressing and distillation. Finally, we highlight several challenges and potential opportunities on applying LLMs for future SE studies, such as exploring domain LLMs and constructing clean evaluation datasets. Overall, our work can help researchers gain a comprehensive understanding about the achievements of the existing LLM-based SE studies and promote the practical application of these techniques. Our artifacts are publicly available and will be continuously updated at the living repository: https://github.com/iSEngLab/AwesomeLLM4SE.

**Authors**: Víctor A. Braberman, Flavia Bonomo-Braberman, Yiannis Charalambous, Juan G. Colonna, Lucas C. Cordeiro, Rosiane de Freitas

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T13:59:39Z

**Summary**: Prompting has become one of the main approaches to leverage emergent capabilities of Large Language Models [Brown et al. NeurIPS 2020, Wei et al. TMLR 2022, Wei et al. NeurIPS 2022]. Recently, researchers and practitioners have been "playing" with prompts (e.g., In-Context Learning) to see how to make the most of pre-trained Language Models. By homogeneously dissecting more than a hundred articles, we investigate how software testing and verification research communities have leveraged LLMs capabilities. First, we validate that downstream tasks are adequate to convey a nontrivial modular blueprint of prompt-based proposals in scope. Moreover, we name and classify the concrete downstream tasks we recover in both validation research papers and solution proposals. In order to perform classification, mapping, and analysis, we also develop a novel downstream-task taxonomy. The main taxonomy requirement is to highlight commonalities while exhibiting variation points of task types that enable pinpointing emerging patterns in a varied spectrum of Software Engineering problems that encompasses testing, fuzzing, fault localization, vulnerability detection, static analysis, and program verification approaches. Avenues for future research are also discussed based on conceptual clusters induced by the taxonomy.

### CloudNativeSim: a toolkit for modeling and simulation of cloud-native   applications
**Authors**: Jingfeng Wu, Minxian Xu, Yiyuan He, Kejiang Ye, Chengzhong Xu

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T13:38:59Z

**Summary**: Cloud-native applications are increasingly becoming popular in modern software design. Employing a microservice-based architecture into these applications is a prevalent strategy that enhances system availability and flexibility. However, cloud-native applications also introduce new challenges, such as frequent inter-service communication and the complexity of managing heterogeneous codebases and hardware, resulting in unpredictable complexity and dynamism. Furthermore, as applications scale, only limited research teams or enterprises possess the resources for large-scale deployment and testing, which impedes progress in the cloud-native domain. To address these challenges, we propose CloudNativeSim, a simulator for cloud-native applications with a microservice-based architecture. CloudNativeSim offers several key benefits: (i) comprehensive and dynamic modeling for cloud-native applications, (ii) an extended simulation framework with new policy interfaces for scheduling cloud-native applications, and (iii) support for customized application scenarios and user feedback based on Quality of Service (QoS) metrics. CloudNativeSim can be easily deployed on standard computers to manage a high volume of requests and services. Its performance was validated through a case study, demonstrating higher than 94.5% accuracy in terms of response time. The study further highlights the feasibility of CloudNativeSim by illustrating the effects of various scaling policies.

### Towards an AI/ML-driven SMO Framework in O-RAN: Scenarios, Solutions,   and Challenges
**Authors**: Mohammad Asif Habibi, Bin Han, Merve Saimler, Ignacio Labrador Pavon, Hans D. Schotten

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T13:33:40Z

**Summary**: The emergence of the open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture offers a paradigm shift in cellular network management and service orchestration, leveraging data-driven, intent-based, autonomous, and intelligent solutions. Within O-RAN, the service management and orchestration (SMO) framework plays a pivotal role in managing network functions (NFs), resource allocation, service provisioning, and others. However, the increasing complexity and scale of O-RANs demand autonomous and intelligent models for optimizing SMO operations. To achieve this goal, it is essential to integrate intelligence and automation into the operations of SMO. In this manuscript, we propose three scenarios for integrating machine learning (ML) algorithms into SMO. We then focus on exploring one of the scenarios in which the non-real-time RAN intelligence controller (Non-RT RIC) plays a major role in data collection, as well as model training, deployment, and refinement, by proposing a centralized ML architecture. Finally, we identify potential challenges associated with implementing a centralized ML solution within SMO.

### High-Transmission Mid-Infrared Bandpass Filters Using Hybrid   Metal-Dielectric Metasurfaces for CO2 Sensing
**Authors**: Amr Soliman, C Williams, Richard Hopper, Florin Udrea, Haider Butt, Timothy D. Wilkinson

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T12:14:38Z

**Summary**: Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique employed for a variety of applications, including gas sensing, industrial inspection, astronomy, surveillance, and imaging. Thin-film narrowband interference filters, targeted to specific absorption bands of target molecules, are commonly deployed for cost-effective MIR sensing systems. These devices require complex and time-consuming fabrication processes. Also, their customization on the micro-scale for emerging miniaturized applications is challenging. Plasmonic nanostructure arrays operating in reflection and transmission modes have been developed for MIR. However, they experience undesirable characteristics, such as broad spectra and low reflection/transmission efficiencies. All-dielectric metasurfaces have low intrinsic losses and have emerged as a substitute for plasmonic metasurfaces in MIR spectroscopy. Nevertheless, they typically operate only in reflection mode. In this work, we present a hybrid metal-dielectric metasurface for MIR spectroscopy operating in transmission mode. The metasurface is composed of germanium (Ge) atop aluminum (Al) cylinders, and we show that the transmission response arises because of the hybridization of modes arising from the Ge and the Al structures. The presented metasurface has a high transmission efficiency of 80 % at $\lambda = 2.6\ \mu\text{m}$, and a narrow full-width-at-half-maximum of $0.4\ \mu\text{m}$. We show numerical simulations, successful fabrication using a straightforward fabrication method, and deployment as the in-line optical filter in a CO$_2$ gas detection with a limit of detection of ~0.04% (a few hundred ppm). Our work demonstrates the potential for hybrid metasurfaces as in-line gas sensing optical filters in MIR spectroscopy.

**Authors**: Ana Martins, Melissa Lopez, Quirijn Meijer, Gregory Baltus, Marc van der Sluys, Chris Van Den Broeck, Sarah Caudill

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T12:10:13Z

**Summary**: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) with possible telescope follow-ups opens a window to ground-breaking discoveries in the field of multi-messenger astronomy. With the improved sensitivity of current and future GW detectors, more BNS detections are expected in the future. Therefore, enhancing low-latency GW search algorithms to achieve rapid speed, high accuracy, and low computational cost is essential. One innovative solution to reduce latency is the use of machine learning (ML) methods embedded in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In this work, we present a novel \texttt{WaveNet}-based method, leveraging the state-of-the-art ML model, to produce early-warning alerts for BNS systems. Using simulated GW signals embedded in Gaussian noise from the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors' third observing run (O3) as a proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate significant performance improvements. Compared to the current leading ML-based early-warning system, our approach enhances detection accuracy from 66.81\% to 76.22\% at a 1\% false alarm probability. Furthermore, we evaluate the time, energy, and economical cost of our model across CPU, GPU, and FPGA platforms, showcasing its potential for deployment in real-time gravitational wave detection pipelines.

### Investigating the Role of Cultural Values in Adopting Large Language   Models for Software Engineering
**Authors**: Stefano Lambiase, Gemma Catolino, Fabio Palomba, Filomena Ferrucci, Daniel Russo

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T10:58:45Z

**Summary**: As a socio-technical activity, software development involves the close interconnection of people and technology. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into this process exemplifies the socio-technical nature of software development. Although LLMs influence the development process, software development remains fundamentally human-centric, necessitating an investigation of the human factors in this adoption. Thus, with this study we explore the factors influencing the adoption of LLMs in software development, focusing on the role of professionals' cultural values. Guided by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and Hofstede's cultural dimensions, we hypothesized that cultural values moderate the relationships within the UTAUT2 framework. Using Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling and data from 188 software engineers, we found that habit and performance expectancy are the primary drivers of LLM adoption, while cultural values do not significantly moderate this process. These findings suggest that, by highlighting how LLMs can boost performance and efficiency, organizations can encourage their use, no matter the cultural differences. Practical steps include offering training programs to demonstrate LLM benefits, creating a supportive environment for regular use, and continuously tracking and sharing performance improvements from using LLMs.

### Using Large Language Models for Template Detection from Security Event   Logs
**Authors**: Risto Vaarandi, Hayretdin Bahsi

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T10:06:54Z

**Summary**: In modern IT systems and computer networks, real-time and offline event log analysis is a crucial part of cyber security monitoring. In particular, event log analysis techniques are essential for the timely detection of cyber attacks and for assisting security experts with the analysis of past security incidents. The detection of line patterns or templates from unstructured textual event logs has been identified as an important task of event log analysis since detected templates represent event types in the event log and prepare the logs for downstream online or offline security monitoring tasks. During the last two decades, a number of template mining algorithms have been proposed. However, many proposed algorithms rely on traditional data mining techniques, and the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) has received less attention so far. Also, most approaches that harness LLMs are supervised, and unsupervised LLM-based template mining remains an understudied area. The current paper addresses this research gap and investigates the application of LLMs for unsupervised detection of templates from unstructured security event logs.

### Reuse and Blend: Energy-Efficient Optical Neural Network Enabled by   Weight Sharing
**Authors**: Bo Xu, Yuetong Fang, Shaoliang Yu, Renjing Xu

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T09:17:37Z

**Summary**: Optical neural networks (ONN) based on micro-ring resonators (MRR) have emerged as a promising alternative to significantly accelerating the massive matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) operations in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. However, the limited scale of MRR arrays presents a challenge for AI acceleration. The disparity between the small MRR arrays and the large weight matrices in AI necessitates extensive MRR writings, including reprogramming and calibration, resulting in considerable latency and energy overheads. To address this problem, we propose a novel design methodology to lessen the need for frequent weight reloading. Specifically, we propose a reuse and blend (R&B) architecture to support efficient layer-wise and block-wise weight sharing, which allows weights to be reused several times between layers/blocks. Experimental results demonstrate the R&B system can maintain comparable accuracy with 69% energy savings and 57% latency improvement. These results highlight the promise of the R&B to enable the efficient deployment of advanced deep learning models on photonic accelerators.

### CodeIP: A Grammar-Guided Multi-Bit Watermark for Large Language Models   of Code
**Authors**: Batu Guan, Yao Wan, Zhangqian Bi, Zheng Wang, Hongyu Zhang, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T08:50:38Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation. It now becomes crucial to identify whether the code is AI-generated and to determine the specific model used, particularly for purposes such as protecting Intellectual Property (IP) in industry and preventing cheating in programming exercises. To this end, several attempts have been made to insert watermarks into machine-generated code. However, existing approaches are limited to inserting only a single bit of information or overly depending on particular code patterns. In this paper, we introduce CodeIP, a novel multi-bit watermarking technique that embeds additional information to preserve crucial provenance details, such as the vendor ID of an LLM, thereby safeguarding the IPs of LLMs in code generation. Furthermore, to ensure the syntactical correctness of the generated code, we propose constraining the sampling process for predicting the next token by training a type predictor. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset across five programming languages demonstrate the effectiveness of CodeIP in watermarking LLMs for code generation while maintaining the syntactical correctness of code.

### LLM-based Abstraction and Concretization for GUI Test Migration
**Authors**: Yakun Zhang, Chen Liu, Xiaofei Xie, Yun Lin, Jin Song Dong, Dan Hao, Lu Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T08:46:05Z

**Summary**: GUI test migration aims to produce test cases with events and assertions to test specific functionalities of a target app. Existing migration approaches typically focus on the widget-mapping paradigm that maps widgets from source apps to target apps. However, since different apps may implement the same functionality in different ways, direct mapping may result in incomplete or buggy test cases, thus significantly impacting the effectiveness of testing target functionality and the practical applicability.   In this paper, we propose a new migration paradigm (i.e., abstraction-concretization paradigm) that first abstracts the test logic for the target functionality and then utilizes this logic to generate the concrete GUI test case. Furthermore, we introduce MACdroid, the first approach that migrates GUI test cases based on this paradigm. Specifically, we propose an abstraction technique that utilizes source test cases from source apps targeting the same functionality to extract a general test logic for that functionality. Then, we propose a concretization technique that utilizes the general test logic to guide an LLM in generating the corresponding GUI test case (including events and assertions) for the target app. We evaluate MACdroid on two widely-used datasets (including 31 apps, 34 functionalities, and 123 test cases). On the FrUITeR dataset, the test cases generated by MACdroid successfully test 64% of the target functionalities, improving the baselines by 191%. On the Lin dataset, MACdroid successfully tests 75% of the target functionalities, outperforming the baselines by 42%. These results underscore the effectiveness of MACdroid in GUI test migration.

### Vision-fused Attack: Advancing Aggressive and Stealthy Adversarial Text   against Neural Machine Translation
**Authors**: Yanni Xue, Haojie Hao, Jiakai Wang, Qiang Sheng, Renshuai Tao, Yu Liang, Pu Feng, Xianglong Liu

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T08:22:17Z

**Summary**: While neural machine translation (NMT) models achieve success in our daily lives, they show vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Despite being harmful, these attacks also offer benefits for interpreting and enhancing NMT models, thus drawing increased research attention. However, existing studies on adversarial attacks are insufficient in both attacking ability and human imperceptibility due to their sole focus on the scope of language. This paper proposes a novel vision-fused attack (VFA) framework to acquire powerful adversarial text, i.e., more aggressive and stealthy. Regarding the attacking ability, we design the vision-merged solution space enhancement strategy to enlarge the limited semantic solution space, which enables us to search for adversarial candidates with higher attacking ability. For human imperceptibility, we propose the perception-retained adversarial text selection strategy to align the human text-reading mechanism. Thus, the finally selected adversarial text could be more deceptive. Extensive experiments on various models, including large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA and GPT-3.5, strongly support that VFA outperforms the comparisons by large margins (up to 81%/14% improvements on ASR/SSIM).

### Using vs. Purchasing Industrial Robots: Adding an Organizational   Perspective to Industrial HRI
**Authors**: Damian Hostettler

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T08:10:44Z

**Summary**: Purpose: Industrial robots allow manufacturing companies to increase productivity and remain competitive. For robots to be used, they must be accepted by operators on the one hand and bought by decision-makers on the other. The roles involved in such organizational processes have very different perspectives. It is therefore essential for suppliers and robot customers to understand these motives so that robots can successfully be integrated on manufacturing shopfloors. Methodology: We present findings of a qualitative study with operators and decision-makers from two Swiss manufacturing SMEs. Using laddering interviews and means-end analysis, we compare operators' and deciders' relevant elements and how these elements are linked to each other on different abstraction levels. These findings represent drivers and barriers to the acquisition, integration and acceptance of robots in the industry. Findings: We present the differing foci of operators and deciders, and how they can be used by demanders as well as suppliers of robots to achieve robot acceptance and deployment. First, we present a list of relevant attributes, consequences and values that constitute robot acceptance and/or rejection. Second, we provide quantified relevancies for these elements, and how they differ between operators and deciders. And third, we demonstrate how the elements are linked with each other on different abstraction levels, and how these links differ between the two groups.

### TF-Attack: Transferable and Fast Adversarial Attacks on Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Zelin Li, Kehai Chen, Lemao Liu, Xuefeng Bai, Mingming Yang, Yang Xiang, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T07:44:45Z

**Summary**: With the great advancements in large language models (LLMs), adversarial attacks against LLMs have recently attracted increasing attention. We found that pre-existing adversarial attack methodologies exhibit limited transferability and are notably inefficient, particularly when applied to LLMs. In this paper, we analyze the core mechanisms of previous predominant adversarial attack methods, revealing that 1) the distributions of importance score differ markedly among victim models, restricting the transferability; 2) the sequential attack processes induces substantial time overheads. Based on the above two insights, we introduce a new scheme, named TF-Attack, for Transferable and Fast adversarial attacks on LLMs. TF-Attack employs an external LLM as a third-party overseer rather than the victim model to identify critical units within sentences. Moreover, TF-Attack introduces the concept of Importance Level, which allows for parallel substitutions of attacks. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 widely adopted benchmarks, evaluating the proposed method through both automatic and human metrics. Results show that our method consistently surpasses previous methods in transferability and delivers significant speed improvements, up to 20 times faster than earlier attack strategies.

### A Pair Programming Framework for Code Generation via Multi-Plan   Exploration and Feedback-Driven Refinement
**Authors**: Huan Zhang, Wei Cheng, Yuhan Wu, Wei Hu

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T07:22:19Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on code generation. Although prior studies enhanced LLMs with prompting techniques and code refinement, they still struggle with complex programming problems due to rigid solution plans. In this paper, we draw on pair programming practices to propose PairCoder, a novel LLM-based framework for code generation. PairCoder incorporates two collaborative LLM agents, namely a Navigator agent for high-level planning and a Driver agent for specific implementation. The Navigator is responsible for proposing promising solution plans, selecting the current optimal plan, and directing the next iteration round based on execution feedback. The Driver follows the guidance of Navigator to undertake initial code generation, code testing, and refinement. This interleaved and iterative workflow involves multi-plan exploration and feedback-based refinement, which mimics the collaboration of pair programmers. We evaluate PairCoder with both open-source and closed-source LLMs on various code generation benchmarks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior accuracy of PairCoder, achieving relative pass@1 improvements of 12.00%-162.43% compared to prompting LLMs directly.

### DistillSeq: A Framework for Safety Alignment Testing in Large Language   Models using Knowledge Distillation
**Authors**: Mingke Yang, Yuqi Chen, Yi Liu, Ling Shi

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T07:09:33Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities in diverse domains, encompassing natural language understanding, translation, and even code generation. The potential for LLMs to generate harmful content is a significant concern. This risk necessitates rigorous testing and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs to ensure safe and responsible use. However, extensive testing of LLMs requires substantial computational resources, making it an expensive endeavor. Therefore, exploring cost-saving strategies during the testing phase is crucial to balance the need for thorough evaluation with the constraints of resource availability. To address this, our approach begins by transferring the moderation knowledge from an LLM to a small model. Subsequently, we deploy two distinct strategies for generating malicious queries: one based on a syntax tree approach, and the other leveraging an LLM-based method. Finally, our approach incorporates a sequential filter-test process designed to identify test cases that are prone to eliciting toxic responses. Our research evaluated the efficacy of DistillSeq across four LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4.0, Vicuna-13B, and Llama-13B. In the absence of DistillSeq, the observed attack success rates on these LLMs stood at 31.5% for GPT-3.5, 21.4% for GPT-4.0, 28.3% for Vicuna-13B, and 30.9% for Llama-13B. However, upon the application of DistillSeq, these success rates notably increased to 58.5%, 50.7%, 52.5%, and 54.4%, respectively. This translated to an average escalation in attack success rate by a factor of 93.0% when compared to scenarios without the use of DistillSeq. Such findings highlight the significant enhancement DistillSeq offers in terms of reducing the time and resource investment required for effectively testing LLMs.

### Semantic-Enhanced Indirect Call Analysis with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Baijun Cheng, Cen Zhang, Kailong Wang, Ling Shi, Yang Liu, Haoyu Wang, Yao Guo, Xiangqun Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T06:56:47Z

**Summary**: In contemporary software development, the widespread use of indirect calls to achieve dynamic features poses challenges in constructing precise control flow graphs (CFGs), which further impacts the performance of downstream static analysis tasks. To tackle this issue, various types of indirect call analyzers have been proposed. However, they do not fully leverage the semantic information of the program, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, this paper proposes Semantic-Enhanced Analysis (SEA), a new approach to enhance the effectiveness of indirect call analysis. Our fundamental insight is that for common programming practices, indirect calls often exhibit semantic similarity with their invoked targets. This semantic alignment serves as a supportive mechanism for static analysis techniques in filtering out false targets. Notably, contemporary large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive code corpora, encompassing tasks such as code summarization, making them well-suited for semantic analysis. Specifically, SEA leverages LLMs to generate natural language summaries of both indirect calls and target functions from multiple perspectives. Through further analysis of these summaries, SEA can determine their suitability as caller-callee pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that SEA can significantly enhance existing static analysis methods by producing more precise target sets for indirect calls.

### Hint of Thought prompting: an explainable and zero-shot approach to   reasoning tasks with LLMs
**Authors**: Ioktong Lei, Zhidong Deng

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T06:41:12Z

**Summary**: Prompting becomes an increasingly important research topic for better utilization of LLMs. Although simple prompting performs well on single-step questions, it cannot permanently activate the correct knowledge path for multi-step reasoning tasks. The chain of thought (CoT), which often contains zero-shot CoT and few-shot CoT, is a recently developed prompting method that can explain the reasoning process to the LLM and outperforms simple prompting in three challenging reasoning tasks, including arithmetic, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning. Inspired by zero-shot CoT, and further extending the zero-shot ability, this paper proposes a novel hint of thought (HoT) prompting with explain-ability and zero-shot generalization. It is decomposed into three steps: explainable sub-questions, logical reasoning, and answering. Such three steps are sequentially ordered in step-by-step hints, which can be easily adjusted and explained to different tasks. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our HoT prompting has a significant advantage on the zero-shot reasoning task compared to existing zero-shot CoT. We did zero-shot experiments on math tasks like GSM8K, ADDSUB, AQUA, SVAMP, and commonsense tasks such as StrategyQA. In particular, the accuracy of the proposed HoT prompting is improved with GSM8K from 40.50% to 70.65%, with AQUA from 31.9% to 46.4%, with SVAMP from 63.7% to 76.9%, and with ADDSUB from 74.7% to 87.34%, respectively, which even defeats the competitive PoT approach on GSM8k, AQUA, and SVAMP.

**Summary**: The widespread of Large Language Models (LLMs) marks a significant milestone in generative AI. Nevertheless, the increasing context length and batch size in offline LLM inference escalate the memory requirement of the key-value (KV) cache, which imposes a huge burden on the GPU VRAM, especially for resource-constraint scenarios (e.g., edge computing and personal devices). Several cost-effective solutions leverage host memory or SSDs to reduce storage costs for offline inference scenarios and improve the throughput. Nevertheless, they suffer from significant performance penalties imposed by intensive KV cache accesses due to limited PCIe bandwidth. To address these issues, we propose InstInfer, a novel LLM inference system that offloads the most performance-critical computation (i.e., attention in decoding phase) and data (i.e., KV cache) parts to Computational Storage Drives (CSDs), which minimize the enormous KV transfer overheads. InstInfer designs a dedicated flash-aware in-storage attention engine with KV cache management mechanisms to exploit the high internal bandwidths of CSDs instead of being limited by the PCIe bandwidth. The optimized P2P transmission between GPU and CSDs further reduces data migration overheads. Experimental results demonstrate that for a 13B model using an NVIDIA A6000 GPU, InstInfer improves throughput for long-sequence inference by up to 11.1$\times$, compared to existing SSD-based solutions such as FlexGen.
