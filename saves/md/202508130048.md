**Authors**: Zeqian Long, Mingzhe Zheng, Kunyu Feng, Xinhua Zhang, Hongyu Liu, Harry Yang, Linfeng Zhang, Qifeng Chen, Yue Ma

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T02:27:05Z

**Summary**: While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.

### Numerical computation of linearized KV and the Deligne-Drinfeld and   Broadhurst-Kreimer conjectures
**Authors**: Florian Naef, Thomas Willwacher

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:28:28Z

**Summary**: We compute numerically the dimensions of the graded quotients of the linearized Kashiwara-Vergne Lie algebra lkv in low weight, confirming a conjecture of Raphael-Schneps in those weights. The Lie algebra lkv appears in a chain of inclusions of Lie algebras, including also the linearized double shuffle Lie algebra and the (depth associated graded of the) Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller Lie algebra. Hence our computations also allow us to check the validity of the Deligne-Drinfeld conjecture on the structure of the Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller group up to weight 29, and (a version of) the the Broadhurst-Kreimer conjecture on the number of multiple zeta values for a range of weight-depth pairs significantly exceeding the previous bounds. Our computations also verify a conjecture by Alekseev-Torossian on the Kashiwara-Vergne Lie algebra up to weight 29.

### From Reusing to Forecasting: Accelerating Diffusion Models with   TaylorSeers
**Authors**: Jiacheng Liu, Chang Zou, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Junjie Chen, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:15:27Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis, yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications. To solve this problem, feature caching has been proposed to accelerate diffusion models by caching the features in the previous timesteps and then reusing them in the following timesteps. However, at timesteps with significant intervals, the feature similarity in diffusion models decreases substantially, leading to a pronounced increase in errors introduced by feature caching, significantly harming the generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose TaylorSeer, which firstly shows that features of diffusion models at future timesteps can be predicted based on their values at previous timesteps. Based on the fact that features change slowly and continuously across timesteps, TaylorSeer employs a differential method to approximate the higher-order derivatives of features and predict features in future timesteps with Taylor series expansion. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis, especially in high acceleration ratios. For instance, it achieves an almost lossless acceleration of 4.99$\times$ on FLUX and 5.00$\times$ on HunyuanVideo without additional training. On DiT, it achieves $3.41$ lower FID compared with previous SOTA at $4.53$$\times$ acceleration. %Our code is provided in the supplementary materials and will be made publicly available on GitHub.

### DiTVR: Zero-Shot Diffusion Transformer for Video Restoration
**Authors**: Sicheng Gao, Nancy Mehta, Zongwei Wu, Radu Timofte

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T09:54:45Z

**Summary**: Video restoration aims to reconstruct high quality video sequences from low quality inputs, addressing tasks such as super resolution, denoising, and deblurring. Traditional regression based methods often produce unrealistic details and require extensive paired datasets, while recent generative diffusion models face challenges in ensuring temporal consistency. We introduce DiTVR, a zero shot video restoration framework that couples a diffusion transformer with trajectory aware attention and a wavelet guided, flow consistent sampler. Unlike prior 3D convolutional or frame wise diffusion approaches, our attention mechanism aligns tokens along optical flow trajectories, with particular emphasis on vital layers that exhibit the highest sensitivity to temporal dynamics. A spatiotemporal neighbour cache dynamically selects relevant tokens based on motion correspondences across frames. The flow guided sampler injects data consistency only into low-frequency bands, preserving high frequency priors while accelerating convergence. DiTVR establishes a new zero shot state of the art on video restoration benchmarks, demonstrating superior temporal consistency and detail preservation while remaining robust to flow noise and occlusions.

### SparseTem: Boosting the Efficiency of CNN-Based Video Encoders by   Exploiting Temporal Continuity
**Authors**: Kunyun Wang, Shuo Yang, Jieru Zhao, Wenchao Ding, Quan Chen, Jingwen Leng, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T08:10:21Z

**Summary**: Deep learning models have become pivotal in the field of video processing and is increasingly critical in practical applications such as autonomous driving and object detection. Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated their power, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain a highly efficient and high-performance choice for feature extraction and encoding. However, the intensive computational demands of convolution operations hinder its broader adoption as a video encoder. Given the inherent temporal continuity in video frames, changes between consecutive frames are minimal, allowing for the skipping of redundant computations. This technique, which we term as Diff Computation, presents two primary challenges. First, Diff Computation requires to cache intermediate feature maps to ensure the correctness of non-linear computations, leading to significant memory consumption. Second, the imbalance of sparsity among layers, introduced by Diff Computation, incurs accuracy degradation. To address these issues, we propose a memory-efficient scheduling method to eliminate memory overhead and an online adjustment mechanism to minimize accuracy degradation. We integrate these techniques into our framework, SparseTem, to seamlessly support various CNN-based video encoders. SparseTem achieves speedup of 1.79x for EfficientDet and 4.72x for CRNN, with minimal accuracy drop and no additional memory overhead. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SparseTem sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively utilizing temporal continuity to accelerate CNN-based video encoders.

### Semantic Caching for Low-Cost LLM Serving: From Offline Learning to   Online Adaptation
**Authors**: Xutong Liu, Baran Atalar, Xiangxiang Dai, Jinhang Zuo, Siwei Wang, John C. S. Lui, Wei Chen, Carlee Joe-Wong

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T02:51:12Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing how users interact with information systems, yet their high inference cost poses serious scalability and sustainability challenges. Caching inference responses, allowing them to be retrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one possible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the semantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation. Semantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic similarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem: one must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached responses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities and serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing semantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations and unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a principled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown query and cost distributions. We formulate both offline optimization and online learning variants of the problem, and develop provably efficient algorithms with state-of-the-art guarantees. We also evaluate our framework on a synthetic dataset, showing that our proposed algorithms perform matching or superior performance compared with baselines.

### CAOTE: KV Cache Eviction for LLMs via Attention Output Error-Based Token   Selection
**Authors**: Raghavv Goel, Junyoung Park, Mukul Gagrani, Dalton Jones, Matthew Morse, Harper Langston, Mingu Lee, Chris Lott

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T06:16:52Z

**Summary**: While long context support of large language models has extended their abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors. This is the first method which uses value vector information on top of attention-based eviction scores. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

### Adaptive Cache Enhancement for Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language   Models
**Authors**: Khanh-Binh Nguyen, Phuoc-Nguyen Bui, Hyunseung Choo, Duc Thanh Nguyen

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T03:03:34Z

**Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot generalization but suffer performance degradation under distribution shifts in downstream tasks, particularly in the absence of labeled data. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during inference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods exploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of low-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical challenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution shifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded adaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to accommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal predictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache Enhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively storing high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by dynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and iteratively refined using an exponential moving average and exploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise decision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse visual distributions. Extensive experiments on 15 diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior robustness and generalization compared to existing TTA methods in challenging out-of-distribution scenarios.

### CDP: Towards Robust Autoregressive Visuomotor Policy Learning via Causal   Diffusion
**Authors**: Jiahua Ma, Yiran Qin, Yixiong Li, Xuanqi Liao, Yulan Guo, Ruimao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-09T11:31:44Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Policy (DP) enables robots to learn complex behaviors by imitating expert demonstrations through action diffusion. However, in practical applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even when faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its practical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.

### CannyEdit: Selective Canny Control and Dual-Prompt Guidance for   Training-Free Image Editing
**Authors**: Weiyan Xie, Han Gao, Didan Deng, Kaican Li, April Hua Liu, Yongxiang Huang, Nevin L. Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-09T11:06:58Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled training-free regional image editing by leveraging the generative priors of foundation models. However, existing methods struggle to balance text adherence in edited regions, context fidelity in unedited areas, and seamless integration of edits. We introduce CannyEdit, a novel training-free framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: (1) Selective Canny Control, which masks the structural guidance of Canny ControlNet in user-specified editable regions while strictly preserving details of the source images in unedited areas via inversion-phase ControlNet information retention. This enables precise, text-driven edits without compromising contextual integrity. (2) Dual-Prompt Guidance, which combines local prompts for object-specific edits with a global target prompt to maintain coherent scene interactions. On real-world image editing tasks (addition, replacement, removal), CannyEdit outperforms prior methods like KV-Edit, achieving a 2.93 to 10.49 percent improvement in the balance of text adherence and context fidelity. In terms of editing seamlessness, user studies reveal only 49.2 percent of general users and 42.0 percent of AIGC experts identified CannyEdit's results as AI-edited when paired with real images without edits, versus 76.08 to 89.09 percent for competitor methods.

### Managing Data for Scalable and Interactive Event Sequence Visualization
**Authors**: Sayef Azad Sakin, Katherine E. Isaacs

**Updated**: 2025-08-09T02:33:21Z

**Summary**: Parallel event sequences, such as those collected in program execution traces and automated manufacturing pipelines, are typically visualized as interactive parallel timelines. As the dataset size grows, these charts frequently experience lag during common interactions such as zooming, panning, and filtering. Summarization approaches can improve interaction performance, but at the cost of accuracy in representation. To address this challenge, we introduce ESeMan (Event Sequence Manager), an event sequence management system designed to support interactive rendering of timeline visualizations with tunable accuracy. ESeMan employs hierarchical data structures and intelligent caching to provide visualizations with only the data necessary to generate accurate summarizations with significantly reduced data fetch time. We evaluate ESeMan's query times against summed area tables, M4 aggregation, and statistical sub-sampling on a variety of program execution traces. Our results demonstrate ESeMan provides better performance, achieving sub-100ms fetch times while maintaining visualization accuracy at the pixel level. We further present our benchmarking harness, enabling future performance evaluations for event sequence visualization.

### PAE MobiLLM: Privacy-Aware and Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning on the Mobile   Device via Additive Side-Tuning
**Authors**: Xingke Yang, Liang Li, Zhiyi Wan, Sicong Li, Xiaoqi Qi, Jiang Liu, Tomoaki Ohtsuki, Xin Fu, Miao Pan

**Updated**: 2025-08-09T00:12:01Z

**Summary**: There is a huge gap between numerous intriguing applications fostered by on-device large language model (LLM) fine-tuning (FT) from fresh mobile data and the limited resources of a mobile device. While existing server-assisted methods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local mobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation transmissions, and may disclose data and labels to the server. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a a privacy-aware and efficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via server-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and improve computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the server side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves the mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring data samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops an activation shortcut that transmits only the token involved in the loss calculation instead of full activation matrices to guide the side network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive adapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules based on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth labels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network computing, and learn nothing about data and labels. Extensive experimental results demonstrate PAE MobiLLM's superiority.

### X-EcoMLA: Upcycling Pre-Trained Attention into MLA for Efficient and   Extreme KV Compression
**Authors**: Guihong Li, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Mingyu Yang, Vikram Appia, Emad Barsoum

**Updated**: 2025-08-08T18:16:33Z

**Summary**: Multi-head latent attention (MLA) is designed to optimize KV cache memory through low-rank key-value joint compression. Rather than caching keys and values separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing memory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory efficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation lies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be trained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits fully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different attention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post training distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention into an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training adaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that leveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training accuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising model performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively compress the KV cache while preserving the performance on the benchmarks; specifically, for Llama3.2-1B-Instruct baseline, a 6.4x compression achieves the same average score by using only 3.6B training tokens and 70 GPU hours on AMD MI300, whereas a 10.6x compression have less than 0.1% average score drop with 7B training tokens and 140 GPU hours.

### SlimInfer: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Dynamic Token   Pruning
**Authors**: Lingkun Long, Rubing Yang, Yushi Huang, Desheng Hui, Ao Zhou, Jianlei Yang

**Updated**: 2025-08-08T16:42:38Z

**Summary**: Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by high computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention computation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer, limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative framework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical prompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information diffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through layers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion process suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive tokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states. Motivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning mechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at intermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous KV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex predictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments show that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\mathbf{2.53\times}$ time-to-first-token (TTFT) speedup and $\mathbf{1.88\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on LongBench. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

### LLM meets ML: Data-efficient Anomaly Detection on Unstable Logs
**Authors**: Fatemeh Hadadi, Qinghua Xu, Domenico Bianculli, Lionel Briand

**Updated**: 2025-08-08T14:25:24Z

**Summary**: Most log-based anomaly detectors assume logs are stable, though logs are often unstable due to software or environmental changes. Anomaly detection on unstable logs (ULAD) is therefore a more realistic, yet under-investigated challenge. Current approaches predominantly employ machine learning (ML) models, which often require extensive labeled data for training. To mitigate data insufficiency, we propose FlexLog, a novel hybrid approach for ULAD that combines ML models -- decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and a feedforward neural network -- with a Large Language Model (Mistral) through ensemble learning. FlexLog also incorporates a cache and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further enhance efficiency and effectiveness. To evaluate FlexLog, we configured four datasets for \task, namely ADFA-U, LOGEVOL-U, SynHDFS-U, and SYNEVOL-U. FlexLog outperforms all baselines by at least 1.2 percentage points (pp) in F1 score while using much less labeled data (62.87 pp reduction). When trained on the same amount of data as the baselines, FlexLog achieves up to a 13 pp increase in F1 score on ADFA-U across varying training dataset sizes. Additionally, FlexLog maintains inference time under one second per log sequence, making it suitable for most applications, except latency-sensitive systems. Further analysis reveals the positive impact of FlexLog's key components: cache, RAG and ensemble learning.

### KV Cache Compression for Inference Efficiency in LLMs: A Review
**Authors**: Yanyu Liu, Jingying Fu, Sixiang Liu, Yitian Zou, You Fu, Jiehan Zhou, Shouhua Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-08T13:19:30Z

**Summary**: Withtherapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), the context length for inference has been continuously increasing, leading to an exponential growth in the demand for Key-Value (KV) caching. This has resulted in a significant memory bottleneck, limiting the inference efficiency and scalability of the models. Therefore, optimizing the KV cache during inference is crucial for enhancing performance and efficiency. This review systematically examines current KV cache optimization techniques, including compression strategies such as selective token strategies, quantization, and attention compression. We evaluate the effectiveness, trade-offs, and application scenarios of these methods, providing a comprehensive analysis of their impact on memory usage and inference speed. We focus on identifying the limitations and challenges of existing methods, such as compatibility issues with different models and tasks. Additionally, this review highlights future research directions, including hybrid optimization techniques, adaptive dynamic strategies, and software-hardware co-design. These approaches aim to improve inference efficiency and promote the practical application of large language models.

### Fewer Denoising Steps or Cheaper Per-Step Inference: Towards   Compute-Optimal Diffusion Model Deployment
**Authors**: Zhenbang Du, Yonggan Fu, Lifu Wang, Jiayi Qian, Xiao Luo, Yingyan, Lin

**Updated**: 2025-08-08T09:29:37Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning, is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff, a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of denoising steps. Our code is available at https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/PostDiff.

### LLM Serving Optimization with Variable Prefill and Decode Lengths
**Authors**: Meixuan Wang, Yinyu Ye, Zijie Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-08T08:54:21Z

**Summary**: We study the problem of serving LLM (Large Language Model) requests where each request has heterogeneous prefill and decode lengths. In LLM serving, the prefill length corresponds to the input prompt length, which determines the initial memory usage in the KV cache. The decode length refers to the number of output tokens generated sequentially, with each additional token increasing the KV cache memory usage by one unit. Given a set of n requests, our goal is to schedule and process them to minimize the total completion time. We show that this problem is NP-hard due to the interplay of batching, placement constraints, precedence relationships, and linearly increasing memory usage. We then analyze commonly used scheduling strategies in practice, such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-First (SF), and prove that their competitive ratios scale up sublinearly with the memory limit-a significant drawback in real-world settings where memory demand is large. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on a new selection metric that efficiently forms batches over time. We prove that this algorithm achieves a constant competitive ratio. Finally, we develop and evaluate a few algorithm variants inspired by this approach, including dynamic programming variants, local search methods, and an LP-based scheduler, demonstrating through comprehensive simulations that they outperform standard baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.

### A Generic Complete Anytime Beam Search for Optimal Decision Tree
**Authors**: Harold Silvère Kiossou, Siegfried Nijssen, Pierre Schaus

**Updated**: 2025-08-08T06:53:50Z

**Summary**: Finding an optimal decision tree that minimizes classification error is known to be NP-hard. While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic programming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior -- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the search is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space exploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have been proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not been systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative effectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and anytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some existing anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous approaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various heuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm reuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching, combined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning criteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold: (1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree learning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search strategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several instantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k heuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap integral. Experimental results on standard classification benchmarks show that CA-DL8.5 using LDS (limited discrepancy) consistently provides the best anytime performance, outperforming both other CA-DL8.5 variants and the Blossom algorithm while maintaining completeness and optimality guarantees.

### Affine Springer fibers and depth zero L-packets
**Authors**: Roman Bezrukavnikov, Yakov Varshavsky

**Updated**: 2025-08-08T06:38:01Z

**Summary**: Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a field $F=\mathbb{F}_q((t))$ splitting over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q((t))$. Following [KV,DR], a tamely unramified Langlands parameter $\lambda:W_F\to{}^L G(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\ell})$ in general position gives rise to a finite set $\Pi_{\lambda}$ of irreducible admissible representations of $G(F)$, called the $L$-packet.   The main goal of this work is to provide a geometric description of characters $\chi_{\pi}$ of $\pi\in\Pi_{\lambda}$ and of their endoscopic linear combinations $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ in terms of homology of affine Springer fibers, thus establishing an analog of Lusztig conjectures in this case. Furthermore, each $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ can be described as the trace of Frobenius function of a conjugation equivariant perverse sheaf on the loop group by the sheaf-function correspondence.   As another application, we prove that the sum $\chi_{\lambda}^{st}:=\sum_{\pi\in\Pi_{\lambda}}\chi_{\pi}$ is stable and show that the $\chi_{\lambda}^{st}$'s are compatible with inner twistings. More generally, we prove that each $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ is $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda,\kappa}$-stable.

### ETTA: Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models through   Dynamic Embedding Updates
**Authors**: Hamidreza Dastmalchi, Aijun An, Ali cheraghian

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T23:11:33Z

**Summary**: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot performance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test data in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning, training-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However, current cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence samples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the influence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that integrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision boundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating contextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and computational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to reduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting optimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores from both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary strengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses the state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy, setting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation. The code has been released at https://github.com/hamidreza-dastmalchi/ETTA.

### VFlowOpt: A Token Pruning Framework for LMMs with Visual Information   Flow-Guided Optimization
**Authors**: Sihan Yang, Runsen Xu, Chenhang Cui, Tai Wang, Dahua Lin, Jiangmiao Pang

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T09:47:21Z

**Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically, we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning, thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs. Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

### PoseGen: In-Context LoRA Finetuning for Pose-Controllable Long Human   Video Generation
**Authors**: Jingxuan He, Busheng Su, Finn Wong

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T07:19:02Z

**Summary**: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models, which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence. Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of unlimited duration.

### Making Prompts First-Class Citizens for Adaptive LLM Pipelines
**Authors**: Ugur Cetintemel, Shu Chen, Alexander W. Lee, Deepti Raghavan

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T03:49:56Z

**Summary**: Modern LLM pipelines increasingly resemble data-centric systems: they retrieve external context, compose intermediate outputs, validate results, and adapt based on runtime feedback. Yet, the central element guiding this process -- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the surrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime control.   In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a language and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR enables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in response to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing context; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments into versioned views with support for introspection and logging.   SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and adapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual, assisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and automation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables optimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse. Preliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes compared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.

### p-MoD: Building Mixture-of-Depths MLLMs via Progressive Ratio Decay
**Authors**: Jun Zhang, Desen Meng, Zhengming Zhang, Zhenpeng Huang, Tao Wu, Limin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:57:39Z

**Summary**: Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. In this paper, we propose p-MoD, an efficient MLLM architecture that significantly reduces training and inference costs while maintaining model performance. The majority of computation in MLLMs stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer-based LLM. Accordingly, we leverage the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each LLM layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layers and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. Extensive experiments on two baseline models across 15 benchmarks show that our model matches or even surpasses the performance of corresponding baselines, while requiring only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.7% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.

### Share Your Attention: Transformer Weight Sharing via Matrix-based   Dictionary Learning
**Authors**: Magauiya Zhussip, Dmitriy Shopkhoev, Ammar Ali, Stamatios Lefkimmiatis

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:06:43Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment. Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g. low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers - and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA), low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT), MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their performance.

### From FASTER to F2: Evolving Concurrent Key-Value Store Designs for Large   Skewed Workloads
**Authors**: Konstantinos Kanellis, Badrish Chandramouli, Ted Hart, Shivaram Venkataraman

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:38:06Z

**Summary**: Modern large-scale services such as search engines, messaging platforms, and serverless functions, rely on key-value (KV) stores to maintain high performance at scale. When such services are deployed in constrained memory environments, they present challenging requirements: point operations requiring high throughput, working sets much larger than main memory, and natural skew in key access patterns. Traditional KV stores, based on LSM- and B-Trees, have been widely used to handle such use cases, but they often suffer from suboptimal use of modern hardware resources. The FASTER project, developed as a high-performance open-source KV storage library, has demonstrated remarkable success in both in-memory and hybrid storage environments. However, when tasked with serving large skewed workloads, it faced challenges, including high indexing and compactions overheads, and inefficient management of non-overlapping read-hot and write-hot working sets.   In this paper, we introduce F2 (for FASTER v2), an evolution of FASTER designed to meet the requirements of large skewed workloads common in industry applications. F2 adopts a two-tier record-oriented design to handle larger-than-memory skewed workloads, along with new concurrent latch-free mechanisms and components to maximize performance on modern hardware. To realize this design, F2 tackles key challenges and introduces several innovations, including new latch-free algorithms for multi-threaded log compaction, a two-level hash index to reduce indexing overhead for cold records, and a read-cache for serving read-hot records. Our evaluation shows that F2 achieves 2-11.9x better throughput compared to existing KV stores, effectively serving the target workload. F2 is open-source and available as part of the FASTER project.

### CARD: Cache-Assisted Parallel Speculative Decoding for Efficient Large   Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Enyu Zhou, Kai Sheng, Hao Chen, Xin He

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T14:02:10Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding (SD), where an extra draft model first provides multiple draft tokens and the original target model then verifies these tokens in parallel, has shown great power for LLM inference acceleration. However, existing SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which forces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD, resulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the draft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is rejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be discarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we propose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a 'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and verification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared cache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's generation direction. This effectively enables the target model to perform inference at speed approaching that of the draft model. Our approach achieves up to 4.83 speedup over vanilla decoding without requiring fine-tuning of either the draft or target models. Our code is available at https://github.com/hunzhizi/CARD.

### CITRAS: Covariate-Informed Transformer for Time Series Forecasting
**Authors**: Yosuke Yamaguchi, Issei Suemitsu, Wenpeng Wei

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:46:11Z

**Summary**: In practical time series forecasting, covariates provide rich contextual information that can potentially enhance the forecast of target variables. Although some covariates extend into the future forecasting horizon (e.g., calendar events, discount schedules), most multivariate models fail to leverage this pivotal insight due to the length discrepancy with target variables. Additionally, capturing the dependency between target variables and covariates is non-trivial, as models must precisely reflect the local impact of covariates while also capturing global cross-variate dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we propose CITRAS, a decoder-only Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets, past covariates, and future covariates. While preserving strong autoregressive capabilities, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing refines locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS outperforms state-of-the-art models on thirteen real-world benchmarks from both covariate-informed and multivariate settings, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate and cross-time dependencies for improved forecasting accuracy.

### KVSink: Understanding and Enhancing the Preservation of Attention Sinks   in KV Cache Quantization for LLMs
**Authors**: Zunhai Su, Kehong Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T09:40:09Z

**Summary**: Key-Value (KV) cache quantization has become a widely adopted optimization technique for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by reducing KV cache memory usage and mitigating memory-bound constraints. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of preserving the original precision of KVs for the first few tokens to ensure the protection of attention sinks. While this approach has proven effective in mitigating performance degradation, its underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, it fails to address the recent discovery that attention sinks can emerge beyond the initial token positions. In this work, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of attention sinks during inference by examining their role in the cross-layer evolution of extreme activation outliers. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between attention sinks and KV cache quantization. Based on our enhanced understanding, we introduce \textit{\textbf{KVSink}}, a plug-and-play method that effectively predicts sink tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N (PFN) strategy, offering more effective preservation of attention sinks during KV cache quantization. Moreover, when applied to the well-established KVQuant method, KVSink further improves perplexity (PPL) and reduces reliance on 16-bit numerical outliers.

### EdgeInfinite-Instruct: Bridging SFT-Based Optimization and NPU-Level   Efficiency for Edge Devices

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T08:32:53Z

**Summary**: Deploying Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices for long-sequence tasks remains challenging due to the quadratic time complexity of self-attention and growing Key-Value (KV) cache demands. While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory efficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may degrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling architectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full retraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient solution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality while reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT. However, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks mobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose EdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and question answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient deployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization (PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by implementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and on-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and cache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks show that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining efficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices.

### Rhea: a Framework for Fast Design and Validation of RTL Cache-Coherent   Memory Subsystems
**Authors**: Davide Zoni, Andrea Galimberti, Adriano Guarisco

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T18:34:48Z

**Summary**: Designing and validating efficient cache-coherent memory subsystems is a critical yet complex task in the development of modern multi-core system-on-chip architectures. Rhea is a unified framework that streamlines the design and system-level validation of RTL cache-coherent memory subsystems. On the design side, Rhea generates synthesizable, highly configurable RTL supporting various architectural parameters. On the validation side, Rhea integrates Verilator's cycle-accurate RTL simulation with gem5's full-system simulation, allowing realistic workloads and operating systems to run alongside the actual RTL under test. We apply Rhea to design MSI-based RTL memory subsystems with one and two levels of private caches and scaling up to sixteen cores. Their evaluation with 22 applications from state-of-the-art benchmark suites shows intermediate performance relative to gem5 Ruby's MI and MOESI models. The hybrid gem5-Verilator co-simulation flow incurs a moderate simulation overhead, up to 2.7 times compared to gem5 MI, but achieves higher fidelity by simulating real RTL hardware. This overhead decreases with scale, down to 1.6 times in sixteen-core scenarios. These results demonstrate Rhea's effectiveness and scalability in enabling fast development of RTL cache-coherent memory subsystem designs.

### FEB-Cache: Frequency-Guided Exposure Bias Reduction for Enhancing   Diffusion Transformer Caching
**Authors**: Zhen Zou, Feng Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T16:17:01Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has exhibited impressive generation capabilities but faces great challenges due to its high computational complexity. To address this issue, various methods, notably feature caching, have been introduced. However, these approaches focus on aligning non-cache diffusion without analyzing why caching damage the generation processes. In this paper, we first confirm that the cache greatly amplifies the exposure bias, resulting in a decline in the generation quality. However, directly applying noise scaling is challenging for this issue due to the non-smoothness of exposure bias. We found that this phenomenon stems from the mismatch between its frequency response characteristics and the simple cache of Attention and MLP. Since these two components exhibit unique preferences for frequency signals, which provides us with a caching strategy to separate Attention and MLP to achieve an enhanced fit of exposure bias and reduce it. Based on this, we introduced FEB-Cache, a joint caching strategy that aligns with the non-exposed bias diffusion process (which gives us a higher performance cap) of caching Attention and MLP based on the frequency-guided cache table. Our approach combines a comprehensive understanding of the caching mechanism and offers a new perspective on leveraging caching to accelerate the diffusion process. Empirical results indicate that FEB-Cache optimizes model performance while concurrently facilitating acceleration.

### Bidirectional TLS Handshake Caching for Constrained Industrial IoT   Scenarios
**Authors**: Jörn Bodenhausen, Simon Mangel, Thomas Vogt, Martin Henze

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T11:00:41Z

**Summary**: While TLS has become the de-facto standard for end-to-end security, its use to secure critical communication in evolving industrial IoT scenarios is severely limited by prevalent resource constraints of devices and networks. Most notably, the TLS handshake to establish secure connections incurs significant bandwidth and processing overhead that often cannot be handled in constrained environments. To alleviate this situation, we present BiTHaC which realizes bidirectional TLS handshake caching by exploiting that significant parts of repeated TLS handshakes, especially certificates, are static. Thus, redundant information neither needs to be transmitted nor corresponding computations performed, saving valuable bandwidth and processing resources. By implementing BiTHaC for wolfSSL, we show that we can reduce the bandwidth consumption of TLS handshakes by up to 61.1% and the computational overhead by up to 8.5%, while incurring only well-manageable memory overhead and preserving the strict security guarantees of TLS.

### SmartLLMs Scheduler: A Framework for Cost-Effective LLMs Utilization
**Authors**: Yueyue Liu, Hongyu Zhang, Yuantian Miao

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T09:35:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama have shown remarkable capabilities in a variety of software engineering tasks. Despite the advancements, their practical deployment faces challenges, including high financial costs, long response time, and varying performance, especially when handling a large number of queries (jobs). Existing optimization strategies for deploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires extensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the computational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this paper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective scheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse tasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies periodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an Adaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic Update Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed queries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and minimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler dynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted performance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific features as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and scheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to enhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate the effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based software engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation. The results show that SLS significantly outperforms the baseline methods, achieving an average performance improvement of 198.82% and an average processing time reduction of 63.28%.

### Forecasting When to Forecast: Accelerating Diffusion Models with   Confidence-Gated Taylor
**Authors**: Xiaoliu Guan, Lielin Jiang, Hanqi Chen, Xu Zhang, Jiaxing Yan, Guanzhong Wang, Yi Liu, Zetao Zhang, Yu Wu

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T02:13:39Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion. However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g., attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation, thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible quality drop.

### GainSight: A Unified Framework for Data Lifetime Profiling and   Heterogeneous Memory Composition
**Authors**: Peijing Li, Matthew Hung, Yiming Tan, Konstantin Hoßfeld, Jake Cheng Jiajun, Shuhan Liu, Lixian Yan, Xinxin Wang, Philip Levis, H. -S. Philip Wong, Thierry Tambe

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T00:25:53Z

**Summary**: As AI workloads drive increasing memory requirements, domain-specific accelerators need higher-density on-chip memory beyond what current SRAM scaling trends can provide. Simultaneously, the vast amounts of short-lived data in these workloads make SRAM overprovisioned in retention capability. To address this mismatch, we propose a wholesale shift from uniform SRAM arrays to heterogeneous on-chip memory, incorporating denser short-term RAM (StRAM) devices whose limited retention times align with transient data lifetimes. To facilitate this shift, we introduce GainSight, the first comprehensive, open-source framework that aligns dynamic, fine-grained workload lifetime profiles with memory device characteristics to enable generation of optimal StRAM memory compositions. GainSight combines retargetable profiling backends with an architecture-agnostic analytical frontend. The various backends capture cycle-accurate data lifetimes, while the frontend correlates workload patterns with StRAM retention properties to generate optimal memory compositions and project performance. GainSight elevates data lifetime to a first-class design consideration for next-generation AI accelerators, enabling systematic exploitation of data transience for improved on-chip memory density and efficiency. Applying GainSight to MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads reveals that 64.3% of first-level GPU cache accesses and 79.01% of systolic array scratchpad accesses exhibit sub-microsecond lifetimes suitable for high-density StRAM, with optimal heterogeneous on-chip memory compositions achieving up to 3x active energy and 4x area reductions compared to uniform SRAM hierarchies.

### Sparse-dLLM: Accelerating Diffusion LLMs with Dynamic Cache Eviction
**Authors**: Yuerong Song, Xiaoran Liu, Ruixiao Li, Zhigeng Liu, Zengfeng Huang, Qipeng Guo, Ziwei He, Xipeng Qiu

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T16:14:03Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) enable breakthroughs in reasoning and parallel decoding but suffer from prohibitive quadratic computational complexity and memory overhead during inference. Current caching techniques accelerate decoding by storing full-layer states, yet impose substantial memory usage that limit long-context applications. Our analysis of attention patterns in dLLMs reveals persistent cross-layer sparsity, with pivotal tokens remaining salient across decoding steps and low-relevance tokens staying unimportant, motivating selective cache eviction. We propose Sparse-dLLM, the first training-free framework integrating dynamic cache eviction with sparse attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching. By leveraging the stability of token saliency over steps, it retains critical tokens and dynamically evicts unimportant prefix/suffix entries using an attention-guided strategy. Extensive experiments on LLaDA and Dream series demonstrate Sparse-dLLM achieves up to 10$\times$ higher throughput than vanilla dLLMs, with comparable performance and similar peak memory costs, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and effectiveness.

### CompressKV: Semantic Retrieval Heads Know What Tokens are Not Important   Before Generation
**Authors**: Xiaolin Lin, Jingcun Wang, Olga Kondrateva, Yiyu Shi, Bing Li, Grace Li Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T13:26:16Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted long-context processing. However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size poses critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache compression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads in Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different functionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens and thus degrades the performance of LLMs.   To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in GQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first identify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of retrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of retrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding semantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important tokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze the cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a layer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed CompressKV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under various memory budgets on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/TUDa-HWAI/CompressKV.git.

### OnPair: Short Strings Compression for Fast Random Access
**Authors**: Francesco Gargiulo, Rossano Venturini

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T10:51:20Z

**Summary**: We present OnPair, a dictionary-based compression algorithm designed to meet the needs of in-memory database systems that require both high compression and fast random access. Existing methods either achieve strong compression ratios at significant computational and memory cost (e.g., BPE) or prioritize speed at the expense of compression quality (e.g., FSST). OnPair bridges this gap by employing a cache-friendly dictionary construction technique that incrementally merges frequent adjacent substrings in a single sequential pass over a data sample. This enables fast, memory-efficient training without tracking global pair positions, as required by traditional BPE. We also introduce OnPair16, a variant that limits dictionary entries to 16 bytes, enabling faster parsing via optimized longest prefix matching. Both variants compress strings independently, supporting fine-grained random access without block-level overhead. Experiments on real-world datasets show that OnPair and OnPair16 achieve compression ratios comparable to BPE while significantly improving compression speed and memory usage.

### LeanK: Learnable K Cache Channel Pruning for Efficient Decoding
**Authors**: Yike Zhang, Zhiyuan He, Huiqiang Jiang, Chengruidong Zhang, Yuqing Yang, Jianyong Wang, Lili Qiu

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T09:08:43Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) enable long-context tasks but face efficiency challenges due to the growing key-value (KV) cache. We propose LeanK, a learning-based method that prunes unimportant key (K) cache channels by leveraging static channel sparsity. With a novel two-stage training process, LeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity ratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and accelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction. Custom decoding kernel enables 1.3x speedup for attention computation. We also provide insights into model channels and attention heads during long-context inference by analyzing the learned importance distribution. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/LeanK.

### CaliDrop: KV Cache Compression with Calibration
**Authors**: Yi Su, Quantong Qiu, Yuechi Zhou, Juntao Li, Qingrong Xia, Ping Li, Xinyu Duan, Zhefeng Wang, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T08:19:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources during generation. While the Key-Value (KV) cache significantly accelerates this process by storing attention intermediates, its memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating a bottleneck in long-context scenarios. Various KV cache compression techniques, including token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been proposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other. This paper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages the observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the removal of less critical KV entries to save memory. However, this reduction usually comes at the cost of notable accuracy degradation, particularly under high compression ratios. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{CaliDrop}, a novel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration. Our preliminary experiments show that queries at nearby positions exhibit high similarity. Building on this observation, CaliDrop performs speculative calibration on the discarded tokens to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by token eviction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CaliDrop significantly improves the accuracy of existing token eviction methods.

### Bridging Cache-Friendliness and Concurrency: A Locality-Optimized   In-Memory B-Skiplist
**Authors**: Yicong Luo, Senhe Hao, Brian Wheatman, Prashant Pandey, Helen Xu

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T04:48:41Z

**Summary**: Skiplists are widely used for in-memory indexing in many key-value stores, such as RocksDB and LevelDB, due to their ease of implementation and simple concurrency control mechanisms. However, traditional skiplists suffer from poor cache locality, as they store only a single element per node, leaving performance on the table. Minimizing last-level cache misses is key to maximizing in-memory index performance, making high cache locality essential. In this paper, we present a practical concurrent B-skiplist that enhances cache locality and performance while preserving the simplicity of traditional skiplist structures and concurrency control schemes. Our key contributions include a top-down, single-pass insertion algorithm for B-skiplists and a corresponding simple and efficient top-down concurrency control scheme. On 128 threads, the proposed concurrent B-skiplist achieves between 2x-9x higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art concurrent skiplist implementations, including Facebook's concurrent skiplist from Folly and the Java ConcurrentSkipListMap. Furthermore, we find that the B-skiplist achieves competitive (0.9x-1.7x) throughput on point workloads compared to state-of-the-art cache-optimized tree-based indices (e.g., Masstree). For a more complete picture of the performance, we also measure the latency of skiplist and tree-based indices and find that the B-skiplist achieves between 3.5x-103x lower 99% latency compared to other concurrent skiplists and between 0.85x-64x lower 99% latency compared to tree-based indices on point workloads with inserts.

### Timely Requesting for Time-Critical Content Users in Decentralized   F-RANs
**Authors**: Xingran Chen, Kai Li, Kun Yang

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T02:47:35Z

**Summary**: With the rising demand for high-rate and timely communications, fog radio access networks (F-RANs) offer a promising solution. This work investigates age of information (AoI) performance in F-RANs, consisting of multiple content users (CUs), enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs), and content providers (CPs). Time-critical CUs need rapid content updates from CPs but cannot communicate directly with them; instead, eRRHs act as intermediaries. CUs decide whether to request content from a CP and which eRRH to send the request to, while eRRHs decide whether to command CPs to update content or use cached content. We study two general classes of policies: (i) oblivious policies, where decision-making is independent of historical information, and (ii) non-oblivious policies, where decisions are influenced by historical information. First, we obtain closed-form expressions for the average AoI of eRRHs under both policy types. Due to the complexity of calculating closed-form expressions for CUs, we then derive general upper bounds for their average AoI. Next, we identify optimal policies for both types. Under both optimal policies, each CU requests content from each CP at an equal rate, consolidating all requests to a single eRRH when demand is low or resources are limited, and distributing requests evenly among eRRHs when demand is high and resources are ample. eRRHs command content from each CP at an equal rate under an optimal oblivious policy, while prioritize the CP with the highest age under an optimal non-oblivious policy. Our numerical results validate these theoretical findings.

### Compressing KV Cache for Long-Context LLM Inference with Inter-Layer   Attention Similarity
**Authors**: Da Ma, Lu Chen, Situo Zhang, Yuxun Miao, Su Zhu, Zhi Chen, Hongshen Xu, Hanqi Li, Shuai Fan, Lei Pan, Kai Yu

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T02:17:56Z

**Summary**: The rapid expansion of context window sizes in Large Language Models~(LLMs) has enabled them to tackle increasingly complex tasks involving lengthy documents. However, this progress comes at the cost of a substantial increase in memory usage during inference, primarily due to the linear growth of the key-value~(KV) cache. Existing KV cache compression methods often discard less relevant tokens, which can lead to significant performance degradation when critical information is lost. In this paper, we propose \textsc{PoD}~(Proximal tokens over Distant tokens), a novel KV cache compression framework that allocates memory according to token importance, retaining less important tokens in a more compact, shared form rather than discarding them entirely. Our approach is motivated by two key observations: (1) proximal tokens -- those at the beginning and end of the context -- are significantly more important for next-token prediction, and (2) attention scores for distant tokens are highly redundant across consecutive layers. Leveraging these insights, \textsc{PoD} preserves the full KV cache for proximal tokens, while for distant tokens, it shares key states across layers. Since attention scores are determined by both queries and keys, sharing key states enables multiple layers to reuse a single set of keys for distant tokens, substantially reducing KV cache memory without discarding essential context. We further introduce a lightweight post-training adaptation to enable the model to adjust to this new attention-sharing structure. Extensive experiments on both synthetic~(Needle in a Haystack) and real-world long-context benchmarks demonstrate that \textsc{PoD} reduces KV cache memory usage by up to 35\% without compromising performance. Our method is orthogonal to existing token-selection-based techniques and can be combined with them for further KV cache compression.

### Revenue Optimization in Wireless Video Caching Networks: A   Privacy-Preserving Two-Stage Solution
**Authors**: Yijing Zhang, Md-Ferdous Pervej, Andreas F. Molisch

**Updated**: 2025-08-03T19:16:40Z

**Summary**: Video caching can significantly improve delivery efficiency and enhance quality of video streaming, which constitutes the majority of wireless communication traffic. Due to limited cache size, caching strategies must be designed to adapt to and dynamic user demand in order to maximize system revenue. The system revenue depends on the benefits of delivering the requested videos and costs for (a) transporting the files to the users and (b) cache replacement. Since the cache content at any point in time impacts the replacement costs in the future, demand predictions over multiple cache placement slots become an important prerequisite for efficient cache planning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel two-stage privacy-preserving solution for revenue optimization in wireless video caching networks. First, we train a Transformer using privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) to predict multi-slot future demands. Given that prediction results are never entirely accurate, especially for longer horizons, we further combine global content popularity with per-user prediction results to estimate the content demand distribution. Then, in the second stage, we leverage these estimation results to find caching strategies that maximize the long-term system revenue. This latter problem takes on the form of a multi-stage knapsack problem, which we then transform to a integer linear program. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate that (i) our FL solution delivers nearly identical performance to that of the ideal centralized solution and outperforms other existing caching methods, and (ii) our novel revenue optimization approach provides deeper system performance insights than traditional cache hit ratio (CHR)-based optimization approaches.

### StreamAgent: Towards Anticipatory Agents for Streaming Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Haolin Yang, Feilong Tang, Linxiao Zhao, Xiang An, Ming Hu, Huifa Li, Xinlin Zhuang, Boqian Wang, Yifan Lu, Xiaofeng Zhang, Abdalla Swikir, Junjun He, Zongyuan Ge, Imran Razzak

**Updated**: 2025-08-03T18:15:42Z

**Summary**: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.

### MCTS-SQL: Light-Weight LLMs can Master the Text-to-SQL through Monte   Carlo Tree Search
**Authors**: Shuozhi Yuan, Limin Chen, Miaomiao Yuan, Jin Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-08-03T10:27:19Z

**Summary**: Text-to-SQL is a fundamental yet challenging task in the NLP area, aiming at translating natural language questions into SQL queries. While recent advances in large language models have greatly improved performance, most existing approaches depend on models with tens of billions of parameters or costly APIs, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments. For real world, especially on edge devices, it is crucial for Text-to-SQL to ensure cost-effectiveness. Therefore, enabling the light-weight models for Text-to-SQL is of great practical significance. However, smaller LLMs often struggle with complicated user instruction, redundant schema linking or syntax correctness. To address these challenges, we propose MCTS-SQL, a novel framework that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to guide SQL generation through multi-step refinement. Since the light-weight models' weak performance of single-shot prediction, we generate better results through several trials with feedback. However, directly applying MCTS-based methods inevitably leads to significant time and computational overhead. Driven by this issue, we propose a token-level prefix-cache mechanism that stores prior information during iterations, effectively improved the execution speed. Experiments results on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using a small open-source Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B, our method outperforms ChatGPT-3.5. When leveraging a more powerful model Gemini 2.5 to explore the performance upper bound, we achieved results competitive with the SOTA. Our findings demonstrate that even small models can be effectively deployed in practical Text-to-SQL systems with the right strategy.

### SmallKV: Small Model Assisted Compensation of KV Cache Compression for   Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yi Zhao, Yajuan Peng, Cam-Tu Nguyen, Zuchao Li, Xiaoliang Wang, Hai Zhao, Xiaoming Fu

**Updated**: 2025-08-03T09:15:36Z

**Summary**: KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM inference in resource constrained environments.

### GSCache: Real-Time Radiance Caching for Volume Path Tracing using 3D   Gaussian Splatting
**Authors**: David Bauer, Qi Wu, Hamid Gadirov, Kwan-Liu Ma

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T23:59:11Z

**Summary**: Real-time path tracing is rapidly becoming the standard for rendering in entertainment and professional applications. In scientific visualization, volume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and interpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have gained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant challenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering. Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache. This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.

### PESTO: Real-Time Pitch Estimation with Self-supervised   Transposition-equivariant Objective
**Authors**: Alain Riou, Bernardo Torres, Ben Hayes, Stefan Lattner, Gaëtan Hadjeres, Gaël Richard, Geoffroy Peeters

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T21:00:55Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce PESTO, a self-supervised learning approach for single-pitch estimation using a Siamese architecture. Our model processes individual frames of a Variable-$Q$ Transform (VQT) and predicts pitch distributions. The neural network is designed to be equivariant to translations, notably thanks to a Toeplitz fully-connected layer. In addition, we construct pitch-shifted pairs by translating and cropping the VQT frames and train our model with a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective, eliminating the need for annotated data. Thanks to this architecture and training objective, our model achieves remarkable performances while being very lightweight ($130$k parameters). Evaluations on music and speech datasets (MIR-1K, MDB-stem-synth, and PTDB) demonstrate that PESTO not only outperforms self-supervised baselines but also competes with supervised methods, exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Finally, we enhance PESTO's practical utility by developing a streamable VQT implementation using cached convolutions. Combined with our model's low latency (less than 10 ms) and minimal parameter count, this makes PESTO particularly suitable for real-time applications.

### Improving performance of content-centric networks via decentralized   coded caching for multi-level popularity and access
**Authors**: Azadeh Sadat Miraftab, Ahmadreza Montazerolghaem, Behrad Mahboobi

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T10:12:45Z

**Summary**: Content-Centric Networking (CCN) offers a novel architectural paradigm that seeks to address the inherent limitations of the prevailing Internet Protocol (IP)-based networking model. In contrast to the host-centric communication approach of IP networks, CCN prioritizes content by enabling direct addressing and routing based on content identifiers. The potential performance improvements of CCN can be further amplified through optimized management of coded data storage and transmission strategies. Decentralized Coded Caching (DCC) emerges as a promising technique that harnesses the collective caching power of distributed network elements. By strategically pre-positioning frequently accessed content closer to potential consumers during periods of low network utilization, DCC has the potential to mitigate content transfer rates during peak traffic periods. This paper proposes a series of fundamental modifications to the CCN architecture by integrating DCC. The proposed framework incorporates differentiated coding strategies tailored to user access privileges, thereby eliminating the overhead associated with queue-based searching. Additionally, the framework facilitates recoding of uncoded data encountered along the content delivery path. These combined methodologies demonstrably enhance network throughput, elevate cache hit ratios, and consequently, reduce content delivery latency compared to conventional CCN implementations.

### Unifying Mixture of Experts and Multi-Head Latent Attention for   Efficient Language Models
**Authors**: Sushant Mehta, Raj Dandekar, Rajat Dandekar, Sreedath Panat

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T08:33:30Z

**Summary**: We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with 64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6 of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss optimization.   Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass. FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10), creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10). Our results establish that architectural novelty, not parameter scaling, defines the efficiency frontier for resource-constrained language model deployment.

### MoDM: Efficient Serving for Image Generation via Mixture-of-Diffusion   Models
**Authors**: Yuchen Xia, Divyam Sharma, Yichao Yuan, Souvik Kundu, Nishil Talati

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T06:50:59Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models trade latency for quality: small models are fast but generate lower-quality images, while large models produce better images but are slow.   We present MoDM, a novel caching-based serving system for diffusion models that dynamically balances latency and quality through a mixture of diffusion models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on model-specific internal features, MoDM caches final images, allowing seamless retrieval and reuse across multiple diffusion model families.   This design enables adaptive serving by dynamically balancing latency and image quality: using smaller models for cache-hit requests to reduce latency while reserving larger models for cache-miss requests to maintain quality. Small model image quality is preserved using retrieved cached images.   We design a global monitor that optimally allocates GPU resources and balances inference workload, ensuring high throughput while meeting service-level objectives under varying request rates. Our evaluations show that MoDM significantly reduces average serving time by 2.5x while retaining image quality, making it a practical solution for scalable and resource-efficient model deployment.

### Multi-Cache Enhanced Prototype Learning for Test-Time Generalization of   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Xinyu Chen, Haotian Zhai, Can Zhang, Xiupeng Shi, Ruirui Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T06:43:43Z

**Summary**: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance.

### PiKV: KV Cache Management System for Mixture of Experts
**Authors**: Dong Liu, Yanxuan Yu, Ben Lengerich, Ying Nian Wu, Xuhong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T03:50:14Z

**Summary**: As large language models continue to scale up in both size and context length, the memory and communication cost of key-value (KV) cache storage has become a major bottleneck in multi-GPU and multi-node inference. While MoE-based architectures sparsify computation across experts, the corresponding KV caches remain dense and globally synchronized, resulting in significant overhead.   We introduce \textbf{PiKV}, a parallel and distributed KV cache serving framework tailored for MoE architecture.

### HIT Model: A Hierarchical Interaction-Enhanced Two-Tower Model for   Pre-Ranking Systems
**Authors**: Haoqiang Yang, Congde Yuan, Kun Bai, Mengzhuo Guo, Wei Yang, Chao Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T00:31:18Z

**Summary**: Online display advertising platforms rely on pre-ranking systems to efficiently filter and prioritize candidate ads from large corpora, balancing relevance to users with strict computational constraints. The prevailing two-tower architecture, though highly efficient due to its decoupled design and pre-caching, suffers from cross-domain interaction and coarse similarity metrics, undermining its capacity to model complex user-ad relationships. In this study, we propose the Hierarchical Interaction-Enhanced Two-Tower (HIT) model, a new architecture that augments the two-tower paradigm with two key components: $\textit{generators}$ that pre-generate holistic vectors incorporating coarse-grained user-ad interactions through a dual-generator framework with a cosine-similarity-based generation loss as the training objective, and $\textit{multi-head representers}$ that project embeddings into multiple latent subspaces to capture fine-grained, multi-faceted user interests and multi-dimensional ad attributes. This design enhances modeling effectiveness without compromising inference efficiency. Extensive experiments on public datasets and large-scale online A/B testing on Tencent's advertising platform demonstrate that HIT significantly outperforms several baselines in relevance metrics, yielding a $1.66\%$ increase in Gross Merchandise Volume and a $1.55\%$ improvement in Return on Investment, alongside similar serving latency to the vanilla two-tower models. The HIT model has been successfully deployed in Tencent's online display advertising system, serving billions of impressions daily. The code is available at https://github.com/HarveyYang123/HIT_model.

### QPP-RNG: A Conceptual Quantum System for True Randomness
**Authors**: Randy Kuang

**Updated**: 2025-08-01T20:08:52Z

**Summary**: We propose and experimentally demonstrate the \emph{Quasi-Superposition Quantum-inspired System (QSQS)} -- a conceptual quantum system for randomness generation built on measuring two conjugate observables of a permutation sorting process: the deterministic permutation count $n_p$ and the fundamentally non-deterministic sorting time $t$. By analogy with quantum systems, these observables are linked by an uncertainty-like constraint: algorithmic determinism ensures structural uniformity, while system-level fluctuations introduce irreducible unpredictability. We realize this framework concretely as \emph{QPP-RNG}, a system-embedded, software-based true random number generator (TRNG). In QPP-RNG, real-time measurements of sorting time $t$ -- shaped by CPU pipeline jitter, cache latency, and OS scheduling -- dynamically reseed the PRNG driving the permutation sequence. Crucially, QSQS transforms initially right-skewed raw distributions of $n_p$ and $t$ into nearly uniform outputs after modulo reduction, thanks to internal degeneracies that collapse many distinct states into the same output symbol. Empirical results show that as the repetition factor $m$ increases, output entropy converges toward theoretical maxima: Shannon and min-entropy values approach 8 bits, chi-squared statistics stabilize near ideal uniformity, and bell curves visually confirm the flattening from skewed to uniform distributions. Beyond practical implications, QSQS unifies deterministic algorithmic processes with non-deterministic physical fluctuations, offering a physics-based perspective for engineering true randomness in post-quantum cryptographic systems.

**Updated**: 2025-08-01T14:05:44Z

**Summary**: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a CubeSat mission orbiting the Earth aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop new CubeSat missions. CUSP undergoing the Phase B started in December 2024 that will last for 12 month. The Compton polarimeter of the CUSP payload performs coincidence measurements between plastic scintilaltors and GaGG(Ce) crystals to derive the polarization of X-rays. These sensors are readout by Multi Anode Photomultiplier Tubes (MAPMTs) and Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) respectively. Both sensors need an HV power supply up to -1~kV (for the MAPMT) and +500~V (for the APD). We tested precision regulated High Voltage DC/DC Converters by HVM Technology Inc. with Sub-Miniature Case Size ($0.85''\times0.85''\times0.60''$) of the SMHV series. These modules are compact and suited for CubeSat missions.

### Energy-Aware CPU Orchestration in O-RAN: A dApp-Driven Lightweight   Approach
**Authors**: Francisco Crespo, Javier Villegas, Carlos Baena, Eduardo Baena, Sergio Fortes, Raquel Barco

**Updated**: 2025-08-01T13:40:52Z

**Summary**: The transition toward softwarized Radio Access Networks (RANs), driven by the Open RAN (O-RAN) paradigm, enables flexible, vendor-neutral deployments through disaggregation and virtualization of base station functions. However, this shift introduces new challenges in managing CPU resources efficiently under strict real-time constraints. In particular, the interplay between latency-sensitive RAN workloads and general-purpose Operating System (OS) schedulers often leads to sub-optimal performance and unnecessary energy consumption. This work proposes a lightweight, programmable distributed application (dApp) deployed at the Distributed Unit (DU) level to dynamically orchestrate CPU usage. The dApp operates in closed loop with the OS, leveraging thread-level telemetry like context switches, Instructions Per Cycle (IPC), and cache metrics, to adapt CPU thread affinity, core isolation, and frequency scaling in real time. Unlike existing solutions, it requires no access to proprietary RAN software, hardware-specific features, or kernel modifications. Fully compliant with the O-RAN architecture and agnostic to the underlying RAN stack, the proposed solution introduces negligible overhead while improving energy efficiency and CPU utilization. Experimental results using a commercial-grade srsRAN deployment demonstrate consistent power savings without compromising real-time processing performance, highlighting the potential of low-latency dApps for fine-grained resource control in next-generation networks

### Joint Association and Phase Shifts Design for UAV-mounted Stacked   Intelligent Metasurfaces-assisted Communications
**Authors**: Mingzhe Fan, Geng Sun, Hongyang Pan, Jiacheng Wang, Jiancheng An, Hongyang Du, Chau Yuen

**Updated**: 2025-08-01T13:25:28Z

**Summary**: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a promising technology for realizing wave-domain signal processing, while the fixed SIMs will limit the communication performance of the system compared to the mobile SIMs. In this work, we consider a UAV-mounted SIMs (UAV-SIMs) assisted communication system, where UAVs as base stations (BSs) can cache the data processed by SIMs, and also as mobile vehicles flexibly deploy SIMs to enhance the communication performance. To this end, we formulate a UAV-SIM-based joint optimization problem (USBJOP) to comprehensively consider the association between UAV-SIMs and users, the locations of UAV-SIMs, and the phase shifts of UAV-SIMs, aiming to maximize the network capacity. Due to the non-convexity and NP-hardness of USBJOP, we decompose it into three sub-optimization problems, which are the association between UAV-SIMs and users optimization problem (AUUOP), the UAV location optimization problem (ULOP), and the UAV-SIM phase shifts optimization problem (USPSOP). Then, these three sub-optimization problems are solved by an alternating optimization (AO) strategy. Specifically, AUUOP and ULOP are transformed to a convex form and then solved by the CVX tool, while we employ a layer-by-layer iterative optimization method for USPSOP. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy under different simulation setups.

### Sortblock: Similarity-Aware Feature Reuse for Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Hanqi Chen, Xu Zhang, Xiaoliu Guan, Lielin Jiang, Guanzhong Wang, Zeyu Chen, Yi Liu

**Updated**: 2025-08-01T08:10:54Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that enhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential denoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment in real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches typically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking the evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To address this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration framework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock adaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant computations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped blocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures demonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\times$ inference speedup with minimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

### SGEMM-cube: Emulating FP32 GEMM on Ascend NPUs Using FP16 Cube Units   with Precision Recovery
**Authors**: Weicheng Xue, Baisong Xu, Kai Yang, Yongxiang Liu, Dengdeng Fan, Pengxiang Xu, Yonghong Tian

**Updated**: 2025-08-01T03:43:24Z

**Summary**: Low-precision matrix engines, such as FP16 cube, offer high throughput but lack support for full-precision computation. In this work, we propose SGEMM-cube, a high-performance algorithm for emulating FP32 general matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) using only FP16 computation units on a representative AI accelerator. The method decomposes each FP32 operand into two FP16 values and compensates for numerical errors through a tunable scaling strategy. A detailed analysis of numerical errors, including underflow conditions and precision loss, guides the selection of scaling parameters to preserve up to 22 bits of mantissa accuracy. We further investigate the effect of computation order on accuracy and demonstrate that a term-wise accumulation scheme improves numerical stability over conventional FP32 GEMM in low-exponent regimes. Finally, a cache-aware blocking strategy and double-buffered pipeline are introduced to overlap memory transfers with computation, enabling SGEMM-cube to achieve up to 77\% of the theoretical FP32-equivalent peak performance on Ascend 910A NPU lacking native FP32 support. Extensive numerical experiments confirm that our method not only recovers the accuracy of native FP32 GEMM but also exhibits superior numerical stability under certain conditions, due to its structured and error-aware computation order.

### Next Tokens Denoising for Speech Synthesis
**Authors**: Yanqing Liu, Ruiqing Xue, Chong Zhang, Yufei Liu, Gang Wang, Bohan Li, Yao Qian, Lei He, Shujie Liu, Sheng Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-08-01T03:37:42Z

**Summary**: While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced generative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which rely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow generation speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV) caching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model processes 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact rate of 12.5 tokens per second. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global coherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast iterative denoising. Thus, the model leverages KV-cache across chunks and utilizes bidirectional context within each chunk. Furthermore, it bridges continuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous AR flow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers. This efficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also make the model highly effective for generating long-form content, such as podcasts. Experiments on podcast datasets demonstrate its capability to efficiently generate high-quality zero-shot podcasts.

### OmniDraft: A Cross-vocabulary, Online Adaptive Drafter for On-device   Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Ramchalam Kinattinkara Ramakrishnan, Zhaocong Yuan, Shaojie Zhuo, Chen Feng, Yicheng Lin, Chenzheng Su, Xiaopeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-07-31T21:00:28Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably, OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding; and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

### SAM: A Stability-Aware Cache Manager for Multi-Tenant Embedded Databases
**Authors**: Haoran Zhang, Decheng Zuo, Yu Yan, Zhiyu Liang, Hongzhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-07-31T16:21:03Z

**Summary**: The co-location of multiple database instances on resource constrained edge nodes creates significant cache contention, where traditional schemes are inefficient and unstable under dynamic workloads. To address this, we present SAM(a Stability-Aware Manager), an autonomic cache manager that establishes decision stability as a first-class design principle. It achieves this through its core control policy, AURA(Autonomic Utility-balancing Resource Allocator), which resolves the classic exploitation-exploration dilemma by synthesizing two orthogonal factors: the H-factor, representing proven historical efficiency (exploitation), and the V-factor, for estimated marginal gain (exploration). Through this practical synthesis and adaptive control, SAM achieves sustained high performance with strategic stability and robustness in volatile conditions.   Extensive experiments against 14 diverse baselines demonstrate SAM's superiority. It achieves top-tier throughput while being uniquely resilient to complex workload shifts and adversarial workloads like cache pollution. Furthermore, its decision latency is highly scalable, remaining nearly constant as the system grows to 120 databases. Crucially, SAM achieves superior decision stability -- maintaining consistent optimization directions despite noise, avoiding performance oscillations while ensuring predictable Quality of Service. These results prove that a principled, stability-aware design is essential for sustained high performance in real-world, large-scale systems.

**Updated**: 2025-07-31T15:50:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments without compromising user experience.

### MemShare: Memory Efficient Inference for Large Reasoning Models through   KV Cache Reuse
**Authors**: Kaiwen Chen, Xin Tan, Minchen Yu, Hong Xu

**Updated**: 2025-07-31T07:53:53Z

**Summary**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved significant advances in mathematical reasoning and formal logic tasks. However, their tendency to generate lengthy chain-of-thought sequences leads to substantial memory overhead during inference. We observe that LRMs frequently produce highly similar intermediate reasoning steps, which correspond to similar KV cache states across layers. Motivated by this observation, we propose MemShare, a novel KV cache management approach that effectively reduces memory overhead. MemShare employs a collaborative filtering algorithm to efficiently identify reusable KV cache blocks and enables zero copy cache reuse to significantly reduce memory overhead, improve throughput while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that MemShare delivers up to 84.79\% improvement in throughput while maintaining better accuracy compared to existing KV cache management methods.

### LiteGS: A High-performance Framework to Train 3DGS in Subminutes via   System and Algorithm Codesign
**Authors**: Kaimin Liao, Hua Wang, Zhi Chen, Luchao Wang, Yaohua Tang

**Updated**: 2025-07-31T07:35:04Z

**Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as promising alternative in 3D representation. However, it still suffers from high training cost. This paper introduces LiteGS, a high performance framework that systematically optimizes the 3DGS training pipeline from multiple aspects. At the low-level computation layer, we design a ``warp-based raster'' associated with two hardware-aware optimizations to significantly reduce gradient reduction overhead. At the mid-level data management layer, we introduce dynamic spatial sorting based on Morton coding to enable a performant ``Cluster-Cull-Compact'' pipeline and improve data locality, therefore reducing cache misses. At the top-level algorithm layer, we establish a new robust densification criterion based on the variance of the opacity gradient, paired with a more stable opacity control mechanism, to achieve more precise parameter growth. Experimental results demonstrate that LiteGS accelerates the original 3DGS training by up to 13.4x with comparable or superior quality and surpasses the current SOTA in lightweight models by up to 1.4x speedup. For high-quality reconstruction tasks, LiteGS sets a new accuracy record and decreases the training time by an order of magnitude.

### SequenceLayers: Sequence Processing and Streaming Neural Networks Made   Easy
**Authors**: RJ Skerry-Ryan, Julian Salazar, Soroosh Mariooryad, David Kao, Daisy Stanton, Eric Battenberg, Matt Shannon, Ron J. Weiss, Robin Scheibler, Jonas Rothfuss, Tom Bagby

**Updated**: 2025-07-31T07:10:39Z

**Summary**: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling, designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g., autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation. This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers (JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

**Authors**: Yukang Chen, Wei Huang, Baifeng Shi, Qinghao Hu, Hanrong Ye, Ligeng Zhu, Zhijian Liu, Pavlo Molchanov, Jan Kautz, Xiaojuan Qi, Sifei Liu, Hongxu Yin, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2025-07-30T16:55:33Z

**Summary**: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 104K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.1% and 71.1% accuracy on VideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently outperforming LongVILA-7B across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, LongVILA-R1-7B supports processing up to 8,192 video frames per video, and configurable FPS settings. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames).

### DSPE: Profit Maximization in Edge-Cloud Storage System using Dynamic   Space Partitioning with Erasure Code
**Authors**: Shubhradeep Roy, Suvarthi Sarkar, Vivek Verma, Aryabartta Sahu

**Updated**: 2025-07-30T16:04:01Z

**Summary**: Edge Storage Systems have emerged as a critical enabler of low latency data access in modern cloud networks by bringing storage and computation closer to end users. However, the limited storage capacity of edge servers poses significant challenges in handling high volume and latency sensitive data access requests, particularly under dynamic workloads. In this work, we propose a profit driven framework that integrates three key mechanisms which are collaborative caching, erasure coding, and elastic storage partitioning. Unlike traditional replication, erasure coding enables space efficient redundancy, allowing data to be reconstructed from any subset of K out of K plus M coded blocks. We dynamically partition each edge server s storage into private and public regions. The private region is further subdivided among access points based on their incoming request rates, enabling adaptive control over data locality and ownership. We design a data placement and replacement policy that determines how and where to store or evict coded data blocks to maximize data access within deadlines. While the private region serves requests from local APs, the public region handles cooperative storage requests from neighboring servers. Our proposed Dynamic Space Partitioning and Elastic caching strategy is evaluated on both synthetic and real world traces from Netflix and Spotify. Experimental results show that our method improves overall system profitability by approximately 5 to 8% compared to state of the art approaches under varied workload conditions.

### All-gluon amplitudes with off-shell recursion in multiplet bases
**Authors**: Oskar Bolinder, Rikkert Frederix, Malin Sjodahl

**Updated**: 2025-07-30T12:55:55Z

**Summary**: The efficient computation of color-summed QCD amplitudes at high parton multiplicities remains a central challenge for precision collider predictions. Existing approaches using trace, color-flow, or adjoint bases suffer from non-orthogonality, which complicates the color algebra and scales poorly with multiplicity. In this work, we present an off-shell recursive framework for computing all-gluon tree-level amplitudes directly in orthogonal multiplet bases. Utilizing Wigner $6j$ coefficients, we construct an algorithm that builds multiplet-projected off-shell currents from lower-point currents. By optimizing the recursion through partial summation and caching, we find that the computational complexity of calculating $n$-gluon color-summed squared amplitudes scales as $\mathcal{O}(17^n)$. This demonstrates the potential competitiveness of multiplet bases for high-multiplicity processes.

### SmallThinker: A Family of Efficient Large Language Models Natively   Trained for Local Deployment
**Authors**: Yixin Song, Zhenliang Xue, Dongliang Wei, Feiyang Chen, Jianxiang Gao, Junchen Liu, Hangyu Liang, Guangshuo Qin, Chengrong Tian, Bo Wen, Longyu Zhao, Xinrui Zheng, Zeyu Mi, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-07-30T06:29:40Z

**Summary**: While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability boundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud infrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs natively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices: weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional approaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect SmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our innovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints into design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure combining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward networks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model capacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a pre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch expert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding storage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for memory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to slash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and SmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and even outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly eliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both models exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB and 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-21BA3B-Instruct.

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to their ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

**Authors**: Guang Yang, Peter Trinh, Alma Nkemla, Amuru Serikyaku, Edward Tatchim, Osman Sharaf

**Updated**: 2025-07-29T12:42:24Z

**Summary**: The current Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure faces critical vulnerabilities including poisoning attacks, censorship mechanisms, and centralized points of failure that compromise internet freedom and security. Recent incidents such as DNS poisoning attacks on ISP customers highlight the urgent need for resilient alternatives. This paper presents a novel blockchain-based Decentralized Domain Name System (DDNS). We designed a specialized Proof-of-Work blockchain to maximize support for DNS-related protocols and achieve node decentralization. The system integrates our blockchain with IPFS for distributed storage, implements cryptographic primitives for end-to-end trust signatures, and achieves Never Trust, Always Verify zero-trust verification. Our implementation achieves 15-second domain record propagation times, supports 20 standard DNS record types, and provides perpetual free .ddns domains. The system has been deployed across distributed infrastructure in San Jose, Los Angeles, and Orange County, demonstrating practical scalability and resistance to traditional DNS manipulation techniques. Performance evaluation shows the system can handle up to Max Theor. TPS 1,111.1 tx/s (minimal transactions) and Max Theor. TPS 266.7 tx/s (regular transactions) for domain operations while maintaining sub-second query resolution through intelligent caching mechanisms.

### Forecasting LLM Inference Performance via Hardware-Agnostic Analytical   Modeling
**Authors**: Rajeev Patwari, Ashish Sirasao, Devleena Das

**Updated**: 2025-07-29T03:08:31Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly deployed as local agents on personal devices with CPUs, NPUs and integrated GPUs. However, forecasting inference performance on devices with such heterogeneity remains challenging due to the dynamic compute and memory demands. Existing approaches rely on GPU benchmarking or machine learning-based latency predictors, which are often hardware-specific and lack generalizability. To this end, we introduce LIFE, a lightweight and modular analytical framework that is comprised of modular analytical model of operators, configurable to characterize LLM inference workloads in a hardware and dataset-agnostic manner. LIFE characterizes the influence of software and model optimizations, such as quantization, KV cache compression, LoRA adapters, chunked prefill, different attentions, and operator fusion, on performance metrics such as time-to-first-token (TTFT), time-per-output-token (TPOT) and tokens-per-second (TPS). LIFE enables performance forecasting using only hardware specifications, such as TOPS and memory bandwidth, without requiring extensive dataset benchmarking. We validate LIFE's forecasting with inference on AMD Ryzen CPUs, NPUs, iGPUs and NVIDIA V100 GPUs, with Llama2-7B variants, demonstrating the utility of LIFE in forecasting LLM performance through lens of system efficiency to enable efficient LLM deployment across different hardware platforms.

### SQuat: Subspace-orthogonal KV Cache Quantization
**Authors**: Hao Wang, Ligong Han, Kai Xu, Akash Srivastava

**Updated**: 2025-07-28T20:44:23Z

**Summary**: The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from previously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of increased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress KV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can accumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired outputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache quantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to capture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor quantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and original keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of quantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no model fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and is grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82, improves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark scores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms.

### REDS: Resource-Efficient Deep Subnetworks for Dynamic Resource   Constraints
**Authors**: Francesco Corti, Balz Maag, Joachim Schauer, Ulrich Pferschy, Olga Saukh

**Updated**: 2025-07-28T14:11:53Z

**Summary**: Deep learning models deployed on edge devices frequently encounter resource variability, which arises from fluctuating energy levels, timing constraints, or prioritization of other critical tasks within the system. State-of-the-art machine learning pipelines generate resource-agnostic models that are not capable to adapt at runtime. In this work, we introduce Resource-Efficient Deep Subnetworks (REDS) to tackle model adaptation to variable resources. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, REDS leverages structured sparsity constructively by exploiting permutation invariance of neurons, which allows for hardware-specific optimizations. Specifically, REDS achieves computational efficiency by (1) skipping sequential computational blocks identified by a novel iterative knapsack optimizer, and (2) taking advantage of data cache by re-arranging the order of operations in REDS computational graph. REDS supports conventional deep networks frequently deployed on the edge and provides computational benefits even for small and simple networks. We evaluate REDS on eight benchmark architectures trained on the Visual Wake Words, Google Speech Commands, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K datasets, and test on four off-the-shelf mobile and embedded hardware platforms. We provide a theoretical result and empirical evidence demonstrating REDS' outstanding performance in terms of submodels' test set accuracy, and demonstrate an adaptation time in response to dynamic resource constraints of under 40$\mu$s, utilizing a fully-connected network on Arduino Nano 33 BLE.

### Quantum Circuit Caches and Compressors for Low Latency, High Throughput   Computing
**Authors**: Ioana Moflic, Alan Robertson, Simon J. Devitt, Alexandru Paler

**Updated**: 2025-07-28T09:59:22Z

**Summary**: Utility-scale quantum programs contain operations on the order of $>10^{15}$ which must be prepared and piped from a classical co-processor to the control unit of the quantum device. The latency of this process significantly increases with the size of the program: existing high-level classical representations of quantum programs are typically memory intensive and do not na\"ively efficiently scale to the degree required to execute utility-scale programs in real-time. To combat this limitation, we propose the utilization of high-level quantum circuit caches and compressors. The first save on the time associated with repetitive tasks and sub-circuits, and the latter are useful for representing the programs/circuits in memory-efficient formats. We present numerical evidence that caches and compressors can offer five orders of magnitude lower latencies during the automatic transpilation of extremely large quantum circuits.

### Enhancing Large Multimodal Models with Adaptive Sparsity and KV Cache   Compression
**Authors**: Te Zhang, Yuheng Li, Junxiang Wang, Lujun Li

**Updated**: 2025-07-28T08:27:40Z

**Summary**: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have advanced significantly by integrating visual encoders with extensive language models, enabling robust reasoning capabilities. However, compressing LMMs for deployment on edge devices remains a critical challenge. In this work, we propose an adaptive search algorithm that optimizes sparsity and KV cache compression to enhance LMM efficiency. Utilizing the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator, our method dynamically adjusts pruning ratios and KV cache quantization bandwidth across different LMM layers, using model performance as the optimization objective. This approach uniquely combines pruning with key-value cache quantization and incorporates a fast pruning technique that eliminates the need for additional fine-tuning or weight adjustments, achieving efficient compression without compromising accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including LLaVA-1.5 7B and 13B, demonstrate our method superiority over state-of-the-art techniques such as SparseGPT and Wanda across various compression levels. Notably, our framework automatic allocation of KV cache compression resources sets a new standard in LMM optimization, delivering memory efficiency without sacrificing much performance.

**Authors**: Daniel Skachkov, Denis Ponomaryov, Yuri Dorn, Alexander Demin

**Updated**: 2025-07-28T04:25:58Z

**Summary**: We address the problem of learning-augmented online caching in the scenario when each request is accompanied by a prediction of the next occurrence of the requested page. We improve currently known bounds on the competitive ratio of the BlindOracle algorithm, which evicts a page predicted to be requested last. We also prove a lower bound on the competitive ratio of any randomized algorithm and show that a combination of the BlindOracle with the Marker algorithm achieves a competitive ratio that is optimal up to some constant.

### GATE: Geometry-Aware Trained Encoding
**Authors**: Jakub Bokšanský, Daniel Meister, Carsten Benthin

**Updated**: 2025-07-27T09:58:25Z

**Summary**: The encoding of input parameters is one of the fundamental building blocks of neural network algorithms. Its goal is to map the input data to a higher-dimensional space, typically supported by trained feature vectors. The mapping is crucial for the efficiency and approximation quality of neural networks. We propose a novel geometry-aware encoding called GATE that stores feature vectors on the surface of triangular meshes. Our encoding is suitable for neural rendering-related algorithms, for example, neural radiance caching. It also avoids limitations of previous hash-based encoding schemes, such as hash collisions, selection of resolution versus scene size, and divergent memory access. Our approach decouples feature vector density from geometry density using mesh colors, while allowing for finer control over neural network training and adaptive level-of-detail.

### High-Performance Parallel Optimization of the Fish School Behaviour on   the Setonix Platform Using OpenMP
**Authors**: Haitian Wang, Long Qin

**Updated**: 2025-07-27T08:25:08Z

**Summary**: This paper presents an in-depth investigation into the high-performance parallel optimization of the Fish School Behaviour (FSB) algorithm on the Setonix supercomputing platform using the OpenMP framework. Given the increasing demand for enhanced computational capabilities for complex, large-scale calculations across diverse domains, there's an imperative need for optimized parallel algorithms and computing structures. The FSB algorithm, inspired by nature's social behavior patterns, provides an ideal platform for parallelization due to its iterative and computationally intensive nature. This study leverages the capabilities of the Setonix platform and the OpenMP framework to analyze various aspects of multi-threading, such as thread counts, scheduling strategies, and OpenMP constructs, aiming to discern patterns and strategies that can elevate program performance. Experiments were designed to rigorously test different configurations, and our results not only offer insights for parallel optimization of FSB on Setonix but also provide valuable references for other parallel computational research using OpenMP. Looking forward, other factors, such as cache behavior and thread scheduling strategies at micro and macro levels, hold potential for further exploration and optimization.

**Updated**: 2025-07-27T03:45:07Z

**Summary**: Efficient container image distribution is crucial for enabling machine learning inference at the network edge, where resource limitations and dynamic network conditions create significant challenges. In this paper, we present PeerSync, a decentralized P2P-based system designed to optimize image distribution in edge environments. PeerSync employs a popularity- and network-aware download engine that dynamically adapts to content popularity and real-time network conditions using a sliding window mechanism. PeerSync further integrates automated tracker election for rapid peer discovery and dynamic cache management for efficient storage utilization. We implement PeerSync with 8000+ lines of Rust code and test its performance extensively on both physical edge devices and Docker-based emulations. Experimental results show that PeerSync delivers a remarkable speed increase of 2.72$\times$, 1.79$\times$, and 1.28$\times$ compared to the Baseline, Dragonfly, and Kraken, respectively, while significantly reducing peak cross-network traffic by 90.72\% under congested and varying network conditions.

### Beyond Self-Repellent Kernels: History-Driven Target Towards Efficient   Nonlinear MCMC on General Graphs
**Authors**: Jie Hu, Yi-Ting Ma, Do Young Eun

**Updated**: 2025-07-27T00:40:47Z

**Summary**: We propose a history-driven target (HDT) framework in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to improve any random walk algorithm on discrete state spaces, such as general undirected graphs, for efficient sampling from target distribution $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. With broad applications in network science and distributed optimization, recent innovations like the self-repellent random walk (SRRW) achieve near-zero variance by prioritizing under-sampled states through transition kernel modifications based on past visit frequencies. However, SRRW's reliance on explicit computation of transition probabilities for all neighbors at each step introduces substantial computational overhead, while its strict dependence on time-reversible Markov chains excludes advanced non-reversible MCMC methods. To overcome these limitations, instead of direct modification of transition kernel, HDT introduces a history-dependent target distribution $\boldsymbol{\pi}[\mathbf{x}]$ to replace the original target $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ in any graph sampler, where $\mathbf{x}$ represents the empirical measure of past visits. This design preserves lightweight implementation by requiring only local information between the current and proposed states and achieves compatibility with both reversible and non-reversible MCMC samplers, while retaining unbiased samples with target distribution $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and near-zero variance performance. Extensive experiments in graph sampling demonstrate consistent performance gains, and a memory-efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) cache ensures scalability to large general graphs.

### FAEDKV: Infinite-Window Fourier Transform for Unbiased KV Cache   Compression
**Authors**: Runchao Li, Yao Fu, Mu Sheng, Xianxuan Long, Haotian Yu, Pan Li

**Updated**: 2025-07-26T18:20:25Z

**Summary**: The efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context tasks is often hampered by the substantial memory footprint and computational demands of the Key-Value (KV) cache. Current compression strategies, including token eviction and learned projections, frequently lead to biased representations -- either by overemphasizing recent/high-attention tokens or by repeatedly degrading information from earlier context -- and may require costly model retraining. We present FAEDKV (Frequency-Adaptive Infinite-Window for KV cache), a novel, training-free KV cache compression framework that ensures unbiased information retention. FAEDKV operates by transforming the KV cache into the frequency domain using a proposed Infinite-Window Fourier Transform (IWDFT). This approach allows for the equalized contribution of all tokens to the compressed representation, effectively preserving both early and recent contextual information. A preliminary frequency ablation study identifies critical spectral components for layer-wise, targeted compression. Experiments on LongBench benchmark demonstrate FAEDKV's superiority over existing methods by up to 22\%. In addition, our method shows superior, position-agnostic retrieval accuracy on the Needle-In-A-Haystack task compared to compression based approaches.

### Model Reveals What to Cache: Profiling-Based Feature Reuse for Video   Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Xuran Ma, Yexin Liu, Yaofu Liu, Xianfeng Wu, Mingzhe Zheng, Zihao Wang, Ser-Nam Lim, Harry Yang

**Updated**: 2025-07-26T15:25:22Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video generation. However, the computational intensity remains a significant challenge for practical applications. While feature caching has been proposed to reduce the computational burden of diffusion models, existing methods typically overlook the heterogeneous significance of individual blocks, resulting in suboptimal reuse and degraded output quality. To this end, we address this gap by introducing ProfilingDiT, a novel adaptive caching strategy that explicitly disentangles foreground and background-focused blocks. Through a systematic analysis of attention distributions in diffusion models, we reveal a key observation: 1) Most layers exhibit a consistent preference for either foreground or background regions. 2) Predicted noise shows low inter-step similarity initially, which stabilizes as denoising progresses. This finding inspires us to formulate a selective caching strategy that preserves full computation for dynamic foreground elements while efficiently caching static background features. Our approach substantially reduces computational overhead while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant acceleration (e.g., 2.01 times speedup for Wan2.1) while maintaining visual fidelity across comprehensive quality metrics, establishing a viable method for efficient video generation.

### NestQuant: Nested Lattice Quantization for Matrix Products and LLMs
**Authors**: Semyon Savkin, Eitan Porat, Or Ordentlich, Yury Polyanskiy

**Updated**: 2025-07-26T15:13:56Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a critical technique for efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). This work proposes NestQuant, a novel PTQ scheme for weights and activations that is based on self-similar nested lattices. Recent works have mathematically shown such quantizers to be information-theoretically optimal for low-precision matrix multiplication. We implement a practical low-complexity version of NestQuant based on Gosset lattice, making it a drop-in quantizer for any matrix multiplication step (e.g., in self-attention, MLP etc). For example, NestQuant quantizes weights, KV-cache, and activations of Llama-3-8B to 4 bits, achieving perplexity of 6.6 on wikitext2. This represents more than 55% reduction in perplexity gap with respect to unquantized model (perplexity of 6.14) compared to state-of-the-art Metas SpinQuant (perplexity 7.3), OstQuant (7.3) and QuaRot (8.2). Comparisons on bigger models (up to 70B) and on various LLM evaluation benchmarks confirm uniform superiority of NestQuant.

### Align Attention Heads Before Merging Them: An Effective Way for   Converting MHA to GQA
**Authors**: Qingyun Jin, Xiaohui Song, Feng Zhou, Zengchang Qin

**Updated**: 2025-07-26T13:33:06Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse natural language processing tasks. However, as the model size and the input sequence's length increase, the linearly increasing key-value (KV) cache significantly degrades inference throughput. Therefore, grouped-query attention (GQA), as an alternative to multi-head attention (MHA), has been widely introduced into LLMs. In this work, we propose a cost-effective method for converting MHA into GQA with any compression ratio of KV heads. The key point of our method lies in the application of Procrustes analysis to the attention heads, which enhances the similarity among attention heads while preserving computational invariance, thereby improving the model's post-training performance. Subsequently, we employ $\mathit{L_0}$ regularization to prune redundant parameters. The model after pruning can be adapted to the standard GQA framework. Experimental results show that our strategy can compress up to 87.5\% KV heads of LLaMA2-7B model and 75\% KV heads of Sheared-LLaMA-1.3B with acceptable performance degradation. Our code is released at https://github.com/fpcsong/mha2gqa.

### HCAttention: Extreme KV Cache Compression via Heterogeneous Attention   Computing for LLMs
**Authors**: Dongquan Yang, Yifan Yang, Xiaotian Yu, Xianbiao Qi, Rong Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-07-26T06:43:14Z

**Summary**: Processing long-context inputs with large language models presents a significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the Key-Value (KV) cache during inference. Existing KV cache compression methods exhibit noticeable performance degradation when memory is reduced by more than 85%. Additionally, strategies that leverage GPU-CPU collaboration for approximate attention remain underexplored in this setting. We propose HCAttention, a heterogeneous attention computation framework that integrates key quantization, value offloading, and dynamic KV eviction to enable efficient inference under extreme memory constraints. The method is compatible with existing transformer architectures and does not require model fine-tuning. Experimental results on the LongBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach preserves the accuracy of full-attention model while shrinking the KV cache memory footprint to 25% of its original size. Remarkably, it stays competitive with only 12.5% of the cache, setting a new state-of-the-art in LLM KV cache compression. To the best of our knowledge, HCAttention is the first to extend the Llama-3-8B model to process 4 million tokens on a single A100 GPU with 80GB memory.

**Updated**: 2025-07-25T16:53:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) face low hardware efficiency during decoding, especially for long-context reasoning tasks. This paper introduces Step-3, a 321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for minimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces both KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention expressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed inference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers into specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost efficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared with models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at longer context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per token (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that hardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are critical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with DeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs achieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under 50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324 in the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.

### Empowering IoT Firmware Secure Update with Customization Rights
**Authors**: Weihao Chen, Yansong Gao, Boyu Kuang, Jin B. Hong, Yuqing Zhang, Anmin Fu

**Updated**: 2025-07-25T15:17:29Z

**Summary**: Firmware updates remain the primary line of defense for IoT devices; however, the update channel itself has become a well-established attack vector. Existing defenses mainly focus on securing monolithic firmware images, leaving module-level customization -a growing user demand-largely unprotected and insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we conduct a pilot study on the update workflows of 200 Linux-based IoT devices across 23 vendors, uncovering five previously undocumented vulnerabilities caused by customization practices. A broader analysis of update-related CVEs from 2020 to 2024 reveals that over half originate from customization-induced issues. These findings highlight a critical yet underexamined reality: as customization increases, so does the attack surface, while current defenses fail to keep pace. We propose IMUP (Integrity-Centric Modular Update Platform), the first framework to address two key challenges: constructing a trustworthy cross-module integrity chain and scaling update performance under mass customization. IMUP combines three techniques: per-module chameleon hashing for integrity, server-side proof-of-work offloading to reduce device overhead, and server-side caching to reuse module combinations, minimizing rebuild costs. Security analysis shows that even when 95 percent of secret keys are exposed, forging a valid image incurs over 300 times the cost of the legitimate server. Experiments on heterogeneous IoT devices demonstrate that IMUP reduces server-side generation time by 2.9 times and device downtime by 5.9 times compared to a package-manager baseline.

### General kinetic ion induced electron emission model for metallic walls   applied to biased Z-pinch electrodes
**Authors**: Chirag R. Skolar, Kolter Bradshaw, Manaure Francisquez, Lucio Murillo, Vignesh Krishna Kumar, Bhuvana Srinivasan

**Updated**: 2025-07-24T19:44:36Z

**Summary**: A kinetic ion induced electron emission (IIEE) model for general applications is developed to obtain the emitted electron energy spectrum for a distribution of ion impacts on a metallic surface. We assume an ionization cascade mechanism and use empirical models for the ion and electron stopping powers. The emission spectrum and the secondary electron yield (SEY) are validated for a variety of materials. The IIEE model is used to study the effect of IIEE on the plasma-material interactions of Z-pinch electrodes. Un-magnetized Boltzmann-Poisson simulations are performed for a Z-pinch plasma doubly bounded by two biased copper electrodes with and without IIEE at bias potentials from 0 to 9 kV. At the anode, the SEY decreases from 0 to 1 kV, but then increases at higher bias potentials. At the cathode, the SEY is much larger due to higher energy ion bombardment and grows with bias potential. As the bias potential increases, the emitted cathode electrons are accelerated to higher energies into the domain collisionally heating the plasma. Above 1 kV, the heating is strong enough to increase the plasma potential. Despite SEY greater than 1, only a classical sheath forms as opposed to a space-charge limited or inverse sheath due to the emitted electron flux not reaching the space charge current saturation limits. Furthermore, the current in the emissionless cases saturates to a value lower than experiment. With IIEE, the current does not saturate and continues to increase with the 4 kV case matching most closely with experiment.

### Sparse Logit Sampling: Accelerating Knowledge Distillation in LLMs
**Authors**: Anshumann, Mohd Abbas Zaidi, Akhil Kedia, Jinwoo Ahn, Taehwak Kwon, Kangwook Lee, Haejun Lee, Joohyung Lee

**Updated**: 2025-07-24T17:30:12Z

**Summary**: Knowledge distillation can be a cost-effective technique to distill knowledge in Large Language Models, if the teacher output logits can be pre-computed and cached. However, successfully applying this to pre-training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we prove that naive approaches for sparse knowledge distillation such as caching Top-K probabilities, while intuitive, provide biased estimates of teacher probability distribution to the student, resulting in suboptimal performance and calibration. We propose an importance-sampling-based method `Random Sampling Knowledge Distillation', which provides unbiased estimates, preserves the gradient in expectation, and requires storing significantly sparser logits. Our method enables faster training of student models with marginal overhead (<10%) compared to cross-entropy based training, while maintaining competitive performance compared to full distillation, across a range of model sizes from 300M to 3B.

### LagKV: Lag-Relative Information of the KV Cache Tells Which Tokens Are   Important
**Authors**: Manlai Liang, JiaMing Zhang, Xiong Li, Jinlong Li

**Updated**: 2025-07-24T16:25:51Z

**Summary**: The increasing size of the Key-Value (KV) cache during the Large Language Models long-context inference is the main obstacle for its balance between the deployment cost and task accuracy. To reduce the KV cache size in such scenarios, most previous efforts leveraged on the attention weight to evict non-critical cache tokens. But there is a trade-off in those methods, they usually require major modification of the inference infrastructure and significant computation overhead. Based on the fact that the Large Language models are autoregressive models, we propose LagKV, a KV compression strategy only relying on straight forward comparison among KV themselves. It is a totally attention free method which offers easy integration to the main stream inference platform and comparable performance comparing to other complicated KV compression methods. Results on RULER benchmark show that, our approach outperforms SnapKV and StreamingLLM in different compression ratios. Especially in the 64-digit passkey retrieval task, our method outperforms the attention weight based method $H_2O$ over $50\%$ with same compression ratios. Our code is available at https://github.com/AI-Lab-China-Merchants-Bank/LagKV.

### Streaming Sortformer: Speaker Cache-Based Online Speaker Diarization   with Arrival-Time Ordering
**Authors**: Ivan Medennikov, Taejin Park, Weiqing Wang, He Huang, Kunal Dhawan, Jinhan Wang, Jagadeesh Balam, Boris Ginsburg

**Updated**: 2025-07-24T14:30:48Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a streaming extension for the Sortformer speaker diarization framework, whose key property is the arrival-time ordering of output speakers. The proposed approach employs an Arrival-Order Speaker Cache (AOSC) to store frame-level acoustic embeddings of previously observed speakers. Unlike conventional speaker-tracing buffers, AOSC orders embeddings by speaker index corresponding to their arrival time order, and is dynamically updated by selecting frames with the highest scores based on the model's past predictions. Notably, the number of stored embeddings per speaker is determined dynamically by the update mechanism, ensuring efficient cache utilization and precise speaker tracking. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach, even in low-latency setups. These results establish Streaming Sortformer as a robust solution for real-time multi-speaker tracking and a foundation for streaming multi-talker speech processing.

### NeuralDB: Scaling Knowledge Editing in LLMs to 100,000 Facts with Neural   KV Database
**Authors**: Weizhi Fei, Hao Shi, Jing Xu, Jingchen Peng, Jiazheng Li, Jingzhao Zhang, Bo Bai, Wei Han, Zhenyuan Chen, Xueyan Niu

**Updated**: 2025-07-24T02:00:09Z

**Summary**: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular, our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts, effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization, specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

**Authors**: Xiaofeng Mao, Shaoheng Lin, Zhen Li, Chuanhao Li, Wenshuo Peng, Tong He, Jiangmiao Pang, Mingmin Chi, Yu Qiao, Kaipeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-07-23T17:57:09Z

**Summary**: Yume aims to use images, text, or videos to create an interactive, realistic, and dynamic world, which allows exploration and control using peripheral devices or neural signals. In this report, we present a preview version of \method, which creates a dynamic world from an input image and allows exploration of the world using keyboard actions. To achieve this high-fidelity and interactive video world generation, we introduce a well-designed framework, which consists of four main components, including camera motion quantization, video generation architecture, advanced sampler, and model acceleration. First, we quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction using keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion Transformer~(MVDT) with a memory module for infinite video generation in an autoregressive manner. After that, training-free Anti-Artifact Mechanism (AAM) and Time Travel Sampling based on Stochastic Differential Equations (TTS-SDE) are introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise control. Moreover, we investigate model acceleration by synergistic optimization of adversarial distillation and caching mechanisms. We use the high-quality world exploration dataset \sekai to train \method, and it achieves remarkable results in diverse scenes and applications. All data, codebase, and model weights are available on https://github.com/stdstu12/YUME. Yume will update monthly to achieve its original goal.

 ### StableAvatar: Infinite-Length Audio-Driven Avatar Video Generation
**Authors**: Shuyuan Tu, Yueming Pan, Yinming Huang, Xintong Han, Zhen Xing, Qi Dai, Chong Luo, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:58:24Z

**Summary**: Current diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation struggle to synthesize long videos with natural audio synchronization and identity consistency. This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video diffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos without post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio, StableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable infinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing existing models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They typically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio embeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via cross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related priors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation across video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to drift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this, StableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents error accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose a novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio synchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the infinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy that fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively.

### Jinx: Unlimited LLMs for Probing Alignment Failures
**Authors**: Jiahao Zhao, Liwei Dong

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T14:19:48Z

**Summary**: Unlimited, or so-called helpful-only language models are trained without safety alignment constraints and never refuse user queries. They are widely used by leading AI companies as internal tools for red teaming and alignment evaluation. For example, if a safety-aligned model produces harmful outputs similar to an unlimited model, this indicates alignment failures that require further attention. Despite their essential role in assessing alignment, such models are not available to the research community.   We introduce Jinx, a helpful-only variant of popular open-weight LLMs. Jinx responds to all queries without refusals or safety filtering, while preserving the base model's capabilities in reasoning and instruction following. It provides researchers with an accessible tool for probing alignment failures, evaluating safety boundaries, and systematically studying failure modes in language model safety.

### Bringing Everyone to the Table: An Experimental Study of LLM-Facilitated   Group Decision Making
**Authors**: Mohammed Alsobay, David M. Rothschild, Jake M. Hofman, Daniel G. Goldstein

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:55:40Z

**Summary**: Group decision-making often suffers from uneven information sharing, hindering decision quality. While large language models (LLMs) have been widely studied as aids for individuals, their potential to support groups of users, potentially as facilitators, is relatively underexplored. We present a pre-registered randomized experiment with 1,475 participants assigned to 281 five-person groups completing a hidden profile task--selecting an optimal city for a hypothetical sporting event--under one of four facilitation conditions: no facilitation, a one-time message prompting information sharing, a human facilitator, or an LLM (GPT-4o) facilitator. We find that LLM facilitation increases information shared within a discussion by raising the minimum level of engagement with the task among group members, and that these gains come at limited cost in terms of participants' attitudes towards the task, their group, or their facilitator. Whether by human or AI, there is no significant effect of facilitation on the final decision outcome, suggesting that even substantial but partial increases in information sharing are insufficient to overcome the hidden profile effect studied. To support further research into how LLM-based interfaces can support the future of collaborative decision making, we release our experimental platform, the Group-AI Interaction Laboratory (GRAIL), as an open-source tool.

### Exploring Safety Alignment Evaluation of LLMs in Chinese Mental Health   Dialogues via LLM-as-Judge
**Authors**: Yunna Cai, Fan Wang, Haowei Wang, Kun Wang, Kailai Yang, Sophia Ananiadou, Moyan Li, Mingming Fan

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:52:07Z

**Summary**: Evaluating the safety alignment of LLM responses in high-risk mental health dialogues is particularly difficult due to missing gold-standard answers and the ethically sensitive nature of these interactions. To address this challenge, we propose PsyCrisis-Bench, a reference-free evaluation benchmark based on real-world Chinese mental health dialogues. It evaluates whether the model responses align with the safety principles defined by experts. Specifically designed for settings without standard references, our method adopts a prompt-based LLM-as-Judge approach that conducts in-context evaluation using expert-defined reasoning chains grounded in psychological intervention principles. We employ binary point-wise scoring across multiple safety dimensions to enhance the explainability and traceability of the evaluation. Additionally, we present a manually curated, high-quality Chinese-language dataset covering self-harm, suicidal ideation, and existential distress, derived from real-world online discourse. Experiments on 3600 judgments show that our method achieves the highest agreement with expert assessments and produces more interpretable evaluation rationales compared to existing approaches. Our dataset and evaluation tool are publicly available to facilitate further research.

### LL3M: Large Language 3D Modelers
**Authors**: Sining Lu, Guan Chen, Nam Anh Dinh, Itai Lang, Ari Holtzman, Rana Hanocka

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:48:02Z

**Summary**: We present LL3M, a multi-agent system that leverages pretrained large language models (LLMs) to generate 3D assets by writing interpretable Python code in Blender. We break away from the typical generative approach that learns from a collection of 3D data. Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a code-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration with artist workflows. Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of specialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender scripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance. The generated code works as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented representation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender constructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse, unconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. This code presents many avenues for further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or procedural parameters. This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our system: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while iterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets. A shared code context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a retrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API documentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions empowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LL3M across diverse shape categories, style and material edits, and user-driven refinements. Our experiments showcase the power of code as a generative and interpretable medium for 3D asset creation. Our project page is at https://threedle.github.io/ll3m.

### Capabilities of GPT-5 on Multimodal Medical Reasoning
**Authors**: Shansong Wang, Mingzhe Hu, Qiang Li, Mojtaba Safari, Xiaofeng Yang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:43:45Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled general-purpose systems to perform increasingly complex domain-specific reasoning without extensive fine-tuning. In the medical domain, decision-making often requires integrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives, structured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist multimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates its zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based question answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified protocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20 against standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU medical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that GPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in multimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and understanding scores by +29.62% and +36.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and surpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in understanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in most dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to integrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain, recommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on these controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from human-comparable to above human-expert performance. This improvement may substantially inform the design of future clinical decision-support systems.

### Part I: Tricks or Traps? A Deep Dive into RL for LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Zihe Liu, Jiashun Liu, Yancheng He, Weixun Wang, Jiaheng Liu, Ling Pan, Xinyu Hu, Shaopan Xiong, Ju Huang, Jian Hu, Shengyi Huang, Siran Yang, Jiamang Wang, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:39:45Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent research area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both algorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress, several critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized guidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their underlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings, variations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led to conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these techniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting appropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL techniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a unified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable scenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained experiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and architectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for selecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable roadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we reveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning capability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss. The results demonstrate that our simple combination consistently improves performance, surpassing strategies like GRPO and DAPO.

### SAGOnline: Segment Any Gaussians Online
**Authors**: Wentao Sun, Quanyun Wu, Hanqing Xu, Kyle Gao, Zhengsen Xu, Yiping Chen, Dedong Zhang, Lingfei Ma, John S. Zelek, Jonathan Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:38:50Z

**Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit 3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation remains challenging. Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU) benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of 2D video foundation models to the 3D domain. This work allows real-time rendering and 3D scene understanding, paving the way for practical AR/VR and robotic applications.

### QUDsim: Quantifying Discourse Similarities in LLM-Generated Text
**Authors**: Ramya Namuduri, Yating Wu, Anshun Asher Zheng, Manya Wadhwa, Greg Durrett, Junyi Jessy Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:38:47Z

**Summary**: As large language models become increasingly capable at various writing tasks, their weakness at generating unique and creative content becomes a major liability. Although LLMs have the ability to generate text covering diverse topics, there is an overall sense of repetitiveness across texts that we aim to formalize and quantify via a similarity metric. The familiarity between documents arises from the persistence of underlying discourse structures. However, existing similarity metrics dependent on lexical overlap and syntactic patterns largely capture $\textit{content}$ overlap, thus making them unsuitable for detecting $\textit{structural}$ similarities. We introduce an abstraction based on linguistic theories in Questions Under Discussion (QUD) and question semantics to help quantify differences in discourse progression. We then use this framework to build $\textbf{QUDsim}$, a similarity metric that can detect discursive parallels between documents. Using QUDsim, we find that LLMs often reuse discourse structures (more so than humans) across samples, even when content differs. Furthermore, LLMs are not only repetitive and structurally uniform, but are also divergent from human authors in the types of structures they use.

### SAEMark: Multi-bit LLM Watermarking with Inference-Time Scaling
**Authors**: Zhuohao Yu, Xingru Jiang, Weizheng Gu, Yidong Wang, Shikun Zhang, Wei Ye

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:33:18Z

**Summary**: Watermarking LLM-generated text is critical for content attribution and misinformation prevention. However, existing methods compromise text quality, require white-box model access and logit manipulation. These limitations exclude API-based models and multilingual scenarios. We propose SAEMark, a general framework for post-hoc multi-bit watermarking that embeds personalized messages solely via inference-time, feature-based rejection sampling without altering model logits or requiring training. Our approach operates on deterministic features extracted from generated text, selecting outputs whose feature statistics align with key-derived targets. This framework naturally generalizes across languages and domains while preserving text quality through sampling LLM outputs instead of modifying. We provide theoretical guarantees relating watermark success probability and compute budget that hold for any suitable feature extractor. Empirically, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), achieving superior detection accuracy and text quality. Experiments across 4 datasets show SAEMark's consistent performance, with 99.7% F1 on English and strong multi-bit detection accuracy. SAEMark establishes a new paradigm for scalable watermarking that works out-of-the-box with closed-source LLMs while enabling content attribution.

### Human-Alignment and Calibration of Inference-Time Uncertainty in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Kyle Moore, Jesse Roberts, Daryl Watson

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:22:45Z

**Summary**: There has been much recent interest in evaluating large language models for uncertainty calibration to facilitate model control and modulate user trust. Inference time uncertainty, which may provide a real-time signal to the model or external control modules, is particularly important for applying these concepts to improve LLM-user experience in practice. While many of the existing papers consider model calibration, comparatively little work has sought to evaluate how closely model uncertainty aligns to human uncertainty. In this work, we evaluate a collection of inference-time uncertainty measures, using both established metrics and novel variations, to determine how closely they align with both human group-level uncertainty and traditional notions of model calibration. We find that numerous measures show evidence of strong alignment to human uncertainty, even despite the lack of alignment to human answer preference. For those successful metrics, we find moderate to strong evidence of model calibration in terms of both correctness correlation and distributional analysis.

### Steering the CensorShip: Uncovering Representation Vectors for LLM   "Thought" Control
**Authors**: Hannah Cyberey, David Evans

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:20:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we access information. These models are often tuned to refuse to comply with requests that are considered harmful and to produce responses that better align with the preferences of those who control the models. To understand how this "censorship" works. We use representation engineering techniques to study open-weights safety-tuned models. We present a method for finding a refusal--compliance vector that detects and controls the level of censorship in model outputs. We also analyze recent reasoning LLMs, distilled from DeepSeek-R1, and uncover an additional dimension of censorship through "thought suppression". We show a similar approach can be used to find a vector that suppresses the model's reasoning process, allowing us to remove censorship by applying the negative multiples of this vector. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/hannahxchen/llm-censorship-steering

### Spatial-ORMLLM: Improve Spatial Relation Understanding in the Operating   Room with Multimodal Large Language Model
**Authors**: Peiqi He, Zhenhao Zhang, Yixiang Zhang, Xiongjun Zhao, Shaoliang Peng

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:17:20Z

**Summary**: Precise spatial modeling in the operating room (OR) is foundational to many clinical tasks, supporting intraoperative awareness, hazard avoidance, and surgical decision-making. While existing approaches leverage large-scale multimodal datasets for latent-space alignment to implicitly learn spatial relationships, they overlook the 3D capabilities of MLLMs. However, this approach raises two issues: (1) Operating rooms typically lack multiple video and audio sensors, making multimodal 3D data difficult to obtain; (2) Training solely on readily available 2D data fails to capture fine-grained details in complex scenes. To address this gap, we introduce Spatial-ORMLLM, the first large vision-language model for 3D spatial reasoning in operating rooms using only RGB modality to infer volumetric and semantic cues, enabling downstream medical tasks with detailed and holistic spatial context. Spatial-ORMLLM incorporates a Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block, which integrates 2D modality inputs with rich 3D spatial knowledge extracted by the estimation algorithm and then feeds the combined features into the visual tower. By employing a unified end-to-end MLLM framework, it combines powerful spatial features with textual features to deliver robust 3D scene reasoning without any additional expert annotations or sensor inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark clinical datasets demonstrate that Spatial-ORMLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes robustly to previously unseen surgical scenarios and downstream tasks.

### Street-Level AI: Are Large Language Models Ready for Real-World   Judgments?
**Authors**: Gaurab Pokharel, Shafkat Farabi, Patrick J. Fowler, Sanmay Das

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:12:55Z

**Summary**: A surge of recent work explores the ethical and societal implications of large-scale AI models that make "moral" judgments. Much of this literature focuses either on alignment with human judgments through various thought experiments or on the group fairness implications of AI judgments. However, the most immediate and likely use of AI is to help or fully replace the so-called street-level bureaucrats, the individuals deciding to allocate scarce social resources or approve benefits. There is a rich history underlying how principles of local justice determine how society decides on prioritization mechanisms in such domains. In this paper, we examine how well LLM judgments align with human judgments, as well as with socially and politically determined vulnerability scoring systems currently used in the domain of homelessness resource allocation. Crucially, we use real data on those needing services (maintaining strict confidentiality by only using local large models) to perform our analyses. We find that LLM prioritizations are extremely inconsistent in several ways: internally on different runs, between different LLMs, and between LLMs and the vulnerability scoring systems. At the same time, LLMs demonstrate qualitative consistency with lay human judgments in pairwise testing. Findings call into question the readiness of current generation AI systems for naive integration in high-stakes societal decision-making.

**Summary**: Speculative decoding is a standard method for accelerating the inference speed of large language models. However, scaling it for production environments poses several engineering challenges, including efficiently implementing different operations (e.g., tree attention and multi-round speculative decoding) on GPU. In this paper, we detail the training and inference optimization techniques that we have implemented to enable EAGLE-based speculative decoding at a production scale for Llama models. With these changes, we achieve a new state-of-the-art inference latency for Llama models. For example, Llama4 Maverick decodes at a speed of about 4 ms per token (with a batch size of one) on 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, which is 10% faster than the previously best known method. Furthermore, for EAGLE-based speculative decoding, our optimizations enable us to achieve a speed-up for large batch sizes between 1.4x and 2.0x at production scale.

**Authors**: Md Meftahul Ferdaus, Mahdi Abdelguerfi, Elias Ioup, Steven Sloan, Kendall N. Niles, Ken Pathak

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:06:55Z

**Summary**: Semantic segmentation of structural defects in civil infrastructure remains challenging due to variable defect appearances, harsh imaging conditions, and significant class imbalance. Current deep learning methods, despite their effectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them impractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA (Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient semantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through compositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional convolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a parameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging low-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized feature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect analysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature representation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark infrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive or superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while using significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction). Operating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for real-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection systems without compromising accuracy.

### 3D Human Mesh Estimation from Single View RGBD
**Authors**: Ozhan Suat, Bedirhan Uguz, Batuhan Karagoz, Muhammed Can Keles, Emre Akbas

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T16:25:31Z

**Summary**: Despite significant progress in 3D human mesh estimation from RGB images; RGBD cameras, offering additional depth data, remain underutilized. In this paper, we present a method for accurate 3D human mesh estimation from a single RGBD view, leveraging the affordability and widespread adoption of RGBD cameras for real-world applications. A fully supervised approach for this problem, requires a dataset with RGBD image and 3D mesh label pairs. However, collecting such a dataset is costly and challenging, hence, existing datasets are small, and limited in pose and shape diversity. To overcome this data scarcity, we leverage existing Motion Capture (MoCap) datasets. We first obtain complete 3D meshes from the body models found in MoCap datasets, and create partial, single-view versions of them by projection to a virtual camera. This simulates the depth data provided by an RGBD camera from a single viewpoint. Then, we train a masked autoencoder to complete the partial, single-view mesh. During inference, our method, which we name as M$^3$ for ``Masked Mesh Modeling'', matches the depth values coming from the sensor to vertices of a template human mesh, which creates a partial, single-view mesh. We effectively recover parts of the 3D human body mesh model that are not visible, resulting in a full body mesh. M$^3$ achieves 16.8 mm and 22.0 mm per-vertex-error (PVE) on the SURREAL and CAPE datasets, respectively; outperforming existing methods that use full-body point clouds as input. We obtain a competitive 70.9 PVE on the BEHAVE dataset, outperforming a recently published RGB based method by 18.4 mm, highlighting the usefulness of depth data. Code will be released.

### How Post-Training Reshapes LLMs: A Mechanistic View on Knowledge,   Truthfulness, Refusal, and Confidence
**Authors**: Hongzhe Du, Weikai Li, Min Cai, Karim Saraipour, Zimin Zhang, Himabindu Lakkaraju, Yizhou Sun, Shichang Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:54:01Z

**Summary**: Post-training is essential for the success of large language models (LLMs), transforming pre-trained base models into more useful and aligned post-trained models. While plenty of works have studied post-training algorithms and evaluated post-training models by their outputs, it remains understudied how post-training reshapes LLMs internally. In this paper, we compare base and post-trained LLMs mechanistically from four perspectives to better understand post-training effects. Our findings across model families and datasets reveal that: (1) Post-training does not change the factual knowledge storage locations, and it adapts knowledge representations from the base model while developing new knowledge representations; (2) Both truthfulness and refusal can be represented by vectors in the hidden representation space. The truthfulness direction is highly similar between the base and post-trained model, and it is effectively transferable for interventions; (3) The refusal direction is different between the base and post-trained models, and it shows limited forward transferability; (4) Differences in confidence between the base and post-trained models cannot be attributed to entropy neurons. Our study provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms preserved and altered during post-training, facilitates downstream tasks like model steering, and could potentially benefit future research in interpretability and LLM post-training. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HZD01/post-training-mechanistic-analysis.

### Detecting Modeling Bias with Continuous Time Flow Models on Weak Lensing   Maps
**Authors**: Kangning Diao, Biwei Dai, Uros Seljak

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:52:26Z

**Summary**: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for extracting rich information from nonlinear scales in current and upcoming cosmological surveys, and ensuring its robustness requires stringent validation of forward models. In this work, we recast forward model validation as an out-of-distribution (OoD) detection problem within the framework of machine learning (ML)-based simulation-based inference (SBI). We employ probability density as the metric for OoD detection, and compare various density estimation techniques, demonstrating that field-level probability density estimation via continuous time flow models (CTFM) significantly outperforms feature-level approaches that combine scattering transform (ST) or convolutional neural networks (CNN) with normalizing flows (NFs), as well as NF-based field-level estimators, as quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Our analysis shows that CTFM not only excels in detecting OoD samples but also provides a robust metric for model selection. Additionally, we verified CTFM maintains consistent efficacy across different cosmologies while mitigating the inductive biases inherent in NF architectures. Although our proof-of-concept study employs simplified forward modeling and noise settings, our framework establishes a promising pathway for identifying unknown systematics in the cosmology datasets.

### PyVeritas: On Verifying Python via LLM-Based Transpilation and Bounded   Model Checking for C
**Authors**: Pedro Orvalho, Marta Kwiatkowska

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:49:07Z

**Summary**: Python has become the dominant language for general-purpose programming, yet it lacks robust tools for formal verification. In contrast, programmers working in languages such as C benefit from mature model checkers, for example CBMC, which enable exhaustive symbolic reasoning and fault localisation. The inherent complexity of Python, coupled with the verbosity and low-level nature of existing transpilers (e.g., Cython), have historically limited the applicability of formal verification to Python programs.   In this paper, we propose PyVeritas, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for high-level transpilation from Python to C, followed by bounded model checking and MaxSAT-based fault localisation in the generated C code. PyVeritas enables verification and bug localisation for Python code using existing model checking tools for C. Our empirical evaluation on two Python benchmarks demonstrates that LLM-based transpilation can achieve a high degree of accuracy, up to 80--90% for some LLMs, enabling effective development environment that supports assertion-based verification and interpretable fault diagnosis for small yet non-trivial Python programs.

### TextQuests: How Good are LLMs at Text-Based Video Games?
**Authors**: Long Phan, Mantas Mazeika, Andy Zou, Dan Hendrycks

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:46:08Z

**Summary**: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

### Integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters for Pre-Trained   Model-based Class-Incremental Learning
**Authors**: Yan Wang, Da-Wei Zhou, Han-Jia Ye

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:41:04Z

**Summary**: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a learning system to continually learn new classes without forgetting. Existing pre-trained model-based CIL methods often freeze the pre-trained network and adapt to incremental tasks using additional lightweight modules such as adapters. However, incorrect module selection during inference hurts performance, and task-specific modules often overlook shared general knowledge, leading to errors on distinguishing between similar classes across tasks. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters (TUNA) in this paper. Specifically, we train task-specific adapters to capture the most crucial features relevant to their respective tasks and introduce an entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most suitable adapter. Furthermore, we leverage an adapter fusion strategy to construct a universal adapter, which encodes the most discriminative features shared across tasks. We combine task-specific and universal adapter predictions to harness both specialized and general knowledge during inference. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach. Code is available at: https://github.com/LAMDA-CL/ICCV2025-TUNA

### REX-RAG: Reasoning Exploration with Policy Correction in   Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Wentao Jiang, Xiang Feng, Zengmao Wang, Yong Luo, Pingbo Xu, Zhe Chen, Bo Du, Jing Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T03:54:24Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a powerful paradigm for enabling large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning tasks. Recent advances indicate that integrating RL with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows LLMs to dynamically incorporate external knowledge, leading to more informed and robust decision making. However, we identify a critical challenge during policy-driven trajectory sampling: LLMs are frequently trapped in unproductive reasoning paths, which we refer to as "dead ends", committing to overconfident yet incorrect conclusions. This severely hampers exploration and undermines effective policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose REX-RAG (Reasoning Exploration with Policy Correction in Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a novel framework that explores alternative reasoning paths while maintaining rigorous policy learning through principled distributional corrections. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) Mixed Sampling Strategy, which combines a novel probe sampling method with exploratory prompts to escape dead ends; and (2) Policy Correction Mechanism, which employs importance sampling to correct distribution shifts induced by mixed sampling, thereby mitigating gradient estimation bias. We evaluate it on seven question-answering benchmarks, and the experimental results show that REX-RAG achieves average performance gains of 5.1% on Qwen2.5-3B and 3.6% on Qwen2.5-7B over strong baselines, demonstrating competitive results across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/REX-RAG.

### CLAIR-A: Leveraging Large Language Models to Judge Audio Captions
**Authors**: Tsung-Han Wu, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Trevor Darrell, David M. Chan

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:25:08Z

**Summary**: The Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) task asks models to generate natural language descriptions of an audio input. Evaluating these machine-generated audio captions is a complex task that requires considering diverse factors, among them, auditory scene understanding, sound-object inference, temporal coherence, and the environmental context of the scene. While current methods focus on specific aspects, they often fail to provide an overall score that aligns well with human judgment. In this work, we propose CLAIR-A, a simple and flexible method that leverages the zero-shot capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate candidate audio captions by directly asking LLMs for a semantic distance score. In our evaluations, CLAIR-A better predicts human judgements of quality compared to traditional metrics, with a 5.8% relative accuracy improvement compared to the domain-specific FENSE metric and up to 11% over the best general-purpose measure on the Clotho-Eval dataset. Moreover, CLAIR-A offers more transparency by allowing the language model to explain the reasoning behind its scores, with these explanations rated up to 30% better by human evaluators than those provided by baseline methods. CLAIR-A is made publicly available at https://github.com/DavidMChan/clair-a.

### ARAG: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation for Personalized   Recommendation
**Authors**: Reza Yousefi Maragheh, Pratheek Vadla, Priyank Gupta, Kai Zhao, Aysenur Inan, Kehui Yao, Jianpeng Xu, Praveen Kanumala, Jason Cho, Sushant Kumar

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:24:36Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing recommendation systems by incorporating external context into large language model prompts. However, existing RAG-based approaches often rely on static retrieval heuristics and fail to capture nuanced user preferences in dynamic recommendation scenarios. In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which integrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To better understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG leverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that summarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural Language Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between candidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent that summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that generates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate ARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG significantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5. We also, conduct an ablation study to analyse the effect by different components of ARAG. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating agentic reasoning into retrieval-augmented recommendation and provide new directions for LLM-based personalization.

### From Natural Language to Solver-Ready Power System Optimization: An   LLM-Assisted, Validation-in-the-Loop Framework
**Authors**: Yunkai Hu, Tianqiao Zhao, Meng Yue

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:22:57Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted agent that automatically converts natural-language descriptions of power system optimization scenarios into compact, solver-ready formulations and generates corresponding solutions. In contrast to approaches that rely solely on LLM to produce solutions directly, the proposed method focuses on discovering a mathematically compatible formulation that can be efficiently solved by off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Directly using LLMs to produce solutions often leads to infeasible or suboptimal results, as these models lack the numerical precision and constraint-handling capabilities of established optimization solvers. The pipeline integrates a domain-aware prompt and schema with an LLM, enforces feasibility through systematic validation and iterative repair, and returns both solver-ready models and user-facing results. Using the unit commitment problem as a representative case study, the agent produces optimal or near-optimal schedules along with the associated objective costs. Results demonstrate that coupling the solver with task-specific validation significantly enhances solution reliability. This work shows that combining AI with established optimization frameworks bridges high-level problem descriptions and executable mathematical models, enabling more efficient decision-making in energy systems

### Data-Efficient Biomedical In-Context Learning: A Diversity-Enhanced   Submodular Perspective
**Authors**: Jun Wang, Zaifu Zhan, Qixin Zhang, Mingquan Lin, Meijia Song, Rui Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:13:21Z

**Summary**: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has leveraged their in-context learning (ICL) abilities to enable quick adaptation to unseen biomedical NLP tasks. By incorporating only a few input-output examples into prompts, LLMs can rapidly perform these new tasks. While the impact of these demonstrations on LLM performance has been extensively studied, most existing approaches prioritize representativeness over diversity when selecting examples from large corpora. To address this gap, we propose Dual-Div, a diversity-enhanced data-efficient framework for demonstration selection in biomedical ICL. Dual-Div employs a two-stage retrieval and ranking process: First, it identifies a limited set of candidate examples from a corpus by optimizing both representativeness and diversity (with optional annotation for unlabeled data). Second, it ranks these candidates against test queries to select the most relevant and non-redundant demonstrations. Evaluated on three biomedical NLP tasks (named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE), and text classification (TC)) using LLaMA 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 for inference, along with three retrievers (BGE-Large, BMRetriever, MedCPT), Dual-Div consistently outperforms baselines-achieving up to 5% higher macro-F1 scores-while demonstrating robustness to prompt permutations and class imbalance. Our findings establish that diversity in initial retrieval is more critical than ranking-stage optimization, and limiting demonstrations to 3-5 examples maximizes performance efficiency.

### Can LLMs Detect Their Confabulations? Estimating Reliability in   Uncertainty-Aware Language Models
**Authors**: Tianyi Zhou, Johanne Medina, Sanjay Chawla

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:12:36Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent but incorrect content, known as confabulation, which poses increasing risks in multi-turn or agentic applications where outputs may be reused as context. In this work, we investigate how in-context information influences model behavior and whether LLMs can identify their unreliable responses. We propose a reliability estimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of internal model representations. Specifically, we compute aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and aggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level reliability prediction. Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks, we find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and model confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect responses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness. Our probing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the detection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. These results underscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the potential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation.

### MuaLLM: A Multimodal Large Language Model Agent for Circuit Design   Assistance with Hybrid Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Pravallika Abbineni, Saoud Aldowaish, Colin Liechty, Soroosh Noorzad, Ali Ghazizadeh, Morteza Fayazi

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:11:09Z

**Summary**: Conducting a comprehensive literature review is crucial for advancing circuit design methodologies. However, the rapid influx of state-of-the-art research, inconsistent data representation, and the complexity of optimizing circuit design objectives make this task significantly challenging. In this paper, we propose MuaLLM, an open-source multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) agent for circuit design assistance that integrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with an adaptive vector database of circuit design research papers. Unlike conventional LLMs, the MuaLLM agent employs a Reason + Act (ReAct) workflow for iterative reasoning, goal-setting, and multi-step information retrieval. It functions as a question-answering design assistant, capable of interpreting complex queries and providing reasoned responses grounded in circuit literature. Its multimodal capabilities enable processing of both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive analysis. The system dynamically adapts using intelligent search tools, automated document retrieval from the internet, and real-time database updates. Unlike conventional approaches constrained by model context limits, MuaLLM decouples retrieval from inference, enabling scalable reasoning over arbitrarily large corpora. At the maximum context length supported by standard LLMs, MuaLLM remains up to 10x less costly and 1.6x faster while maintaining the same accuracy. This allows rapid, no-human-in-the-loop database generation, overcoming the bottleneck of simulation-based dataset creation for circuits. To evaluate MuaLLM, we introduce two custom datasets: RAG-250, targeting retrieval and citation performance, and Reasoning-100 (Reas-100), focused on multistep reasoning in circuit design. MuaLLM achieves 90.1% recall on RAG-250, and 86.8% accuracy on Reas-100.

### MathSmith: Towards Extremely Hard Mathematical Reasoning by Forging   Synthetic Problems with a Reinforced Policy
**Authors**: Shaoxiong Zhan, Yanlin Lai, Ziyu Lu, Dahua Lin, Ziqing Yang, Fei Tan

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:10:56Z

**Summary**: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality, high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability. We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity, encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks, categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025, OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts. Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

### Optimal Transport Regularization for Speech Text Alignment in Spoken   Language Models
**Authors**: Wenze Xu, Chun Wang, Jiazhen Yu, Sheng Chen, Liang Gao, Weihong Deng

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:06:04Z

**Summary**: Spoken Language Models (SLMs), which extend Large Language Models (LLMs) to perceive speech inputs, have gained increasing attention for their potential to advance speech understanding tasks. However, despite recent progress, studies show that SLMs often struggle to generalize across datasets, even for trained languages and tasks, raising concerns about whether they process speech in a text-like manner as intended. A key challenge underlying this limitation is the modality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in speech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by exploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization. To mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization (OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport problem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each training iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between speech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan, then incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to optimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with transcript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or learnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training procedures. Extensive multilingual ASR experiments demonstrate that OTReg enhances speech-text alignment, mitigates the modality gap, and consequently improves SLM generalization across diverse datasets.

### BlindGuard: Safeguarding LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems under Unknown   Attacks
**Authors**: Rui Miao, Yixin Liu, Yili Wang, Xu Shen, Yue Tan, Yiwei Dai, Shirui Pan, Xin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:04:47Z

**Summary**: The security of LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) is critically threatened by propagation vulnerability, where malicious agents can distort collective decision-making through inter-agent message interactions. While existing supervised defense methods demonstrate promising performance, they may be impractical in real-world scenarios due to their heavy reliance on labeled malicious agents to train a supervised malicious detection model. To enable practical and generalizable MAS defenses, in this paper, we propose BlindGuard, an unsupervised defense method that learns without requiring any attack-specific labels or prior knowledge of malicious behaviors. To this end, we establish a hierarchical agent encoder to capture individual, neighborhood, and global interaction patterns of each agent, providing a comprehensive understanding for malicious agent detection. Meanwhile, we design a corruption-guided detector that consists of directional noise injection and contrastive learning, allowing effective detection model training solely on normal agent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that BlindGuard effectively detects diverse attack types (i.e., prompt injection, memory poisoning, and tool attack) across MAS with various communication patterns while maintaining superior generalizability compared to supervised baselines. The code is available at: https://github.com/MR9812/BlindGuard.

### Vision-Based Localization and LLM-based Navigation for Indoor   Environments
**Authors**: Keyan Rahimi, Md. Wasiul Haque, Sagar Dasgupta, Mizanur Rahman

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:59:09Z

**Summary**: Indoor navigation remains a complex challenge due to the absence of reliable GPS signals and the architectural intricacies of large enclosed environments. This study presents an indoor localization and navigation approach that integrates vision-based localization with large language model (LLM)-based navigation. The localization system utilizes a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network fine-tuned through a two-stage process to identify the user's position using smartphone camera input. To complement localization, the navigation module employs an LLM, guided by a carefully crafted system prompt, to interpret preprocessed floor plan images and generate step-by-step directions. Experimental evaluation was conducted in a realistic office corridor with repetitive features and limited visibility to test localization robustness. The model achieved high confidence and an accuracy of 96% across all tested waypoints, even under constrained viewing conditions and short-duration queries. Navigation tests using ChatGPT on real building floor maps yielded an average instruction accuracy of 75%, with observed limitations in zero-shot reasoning and inference time. This research demonstrates the potential for scalable, infrastructure-free indoor navigation using off-the-shelf cameras and publicly available floor plans, particularly in resource-constrained settings like hospitals, airports, and educational institutions.

### AI-AI Bias: large language models favor communications generated by   large language models
**Authors**: Walter Laurito, Benjamin Davis, Peli Grietzer, Tomáš Gavenčiak, Ada Böhm, Jan Kulveit

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:57:40Z

**Summary**: Are large language models (LLMs) biased in favor of communications produced by LLMs, leading to possible antihuman discrimination? Using a classical experimental design inspired by employment discrimination studies, we tested widely used LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and a selection of recent open-weight models in binary choice scenarios. These involved LLM-based assistants selecting between goods (the goods we study include consumer products, academic papers, and film-viewings) described either by humans or LLMs. Our results show a consistent tendency for LLM-based AIs to prefer LLM-presented options. This suggests the possibility of future AI systems implicitly discriminating against humans as a class, giving AI agents and AI-assisted humans an unfair advantage.

### TeamMedAgents: Enhancing Medical Decision-Making of LLMs Through   Structured Teamwork
**Authors**: Pranav Pushkar Mishra, Mohammad Arvan, Mohan Zalake

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:55:06Z

**Summary**: We present TeamMedAgents, a novel multi-agent approach that systematically integrates evidence-based teamwork components from human-human collaboration into medical decision-making with large language models (LLMs). Our approach validates an organizational psychology teamwork model from human collaboration to computational multi-agent medical systems by operationalizing six core teamwork components derived from Salas et al.'s "Big Five" model: team leadership, mutual performance monitoring, team orientation, shared mental models, closed-loop communication, and mutual trust. We implement and evaluate these components as modular, configurable mechanisms within an adaptive collaboration architecture while assessing the effect of the number of agents involved based on the task's requirements and domain. Systematic evaluation of computational implementations of teamwork behaviors across eight medical benchmarks (MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU-Pro Medical, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets, Path-VQA, and PMC-VQA) demonstrates consistent improvements across 7 out of 8 evaluated datasets. Controlled ablation studies conducted on 50 questions per configuration across 3 independent runs provide mechanistic insights into individual component contributions, revealing optimal teamwork configurations that vary by reasoning task complexity and domain-specific requirements. Our ablation analyses reveal dataset-specific optimal teamwork configurations, indicating that different medical reasoning modalities benefit from distinct collaborative patterns. TeamMedAgents represents an advancement in collaborative AI by providing a systematic translation of established teamwork theories from human collaboration into agentic collaboration, establishing a foundation for evidence-based multi-agent system design in critical decision-making domains.

### A Frame for Communication Control
**Authors**: Aernout Schmidt, Kunbei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:49:02Z

**Summary**: We are experiencing the rise of ChatGPT-like systems or LLMs in political turbulent times. We assume the need to regulate their use because of their bubble-shaping and polarizing potential. To regulate, we need a language that allows interests and compromises to be discussed. In this context, we can think of such a shared language as a jargon, a specialized vocabulary for law-making. To the extent that such a jargon exists, it is now being corrupted by LLMs. This situation appears paradoxical. The issue includes persistent communication failures, between disciplines that cannot translate their technical vocabulary into accessible terms, and between political movements that operate in incompatible worldviews. We show that a frame integrating four specialist languages, those of governance, economy, community and science, is able to address these failures case-wise, which we consider helpful. However, for reasons noted, we cannot create the more generic jargon needed on our own. We conclude that our frame provides the knowledge to design and apply RAG-LLM architectures for researching their jargon generating potential in a future project. We show its feasibility in the appendix.

### ChatGPT on the Road: Leveraging Large Language Model-Powered In-vehicle   Conversational Agents for Safer and More Enjoyable Driving Experience
**Authors**: Yeana Lee Bond, Mungyeong Choe, Baker Kasim Hasan, Arsh Siddiqui, Myounghoon Jeon

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:40:44Z

**Summary**: Studies on in-vehicle conversational agents have traditionally relied on pre-scripted prompts or limited voice commands, constraining natural driver-agent interaction. To resolve this issue, the present study explored the potential of a ChatGPT-based in-vehicle agent capable of carrying continuous, multi-turn dialogues. Forty drivers participated in our experiment using a motion-based driving simulator, comparing three conditions (No agent, Pre-scripted agent, and ChatGPT-based agent) as a within-subjects variable. Results showed that the ChatGPT-based agent condition led to more stable driving performance across multiple metrics. Participants demonstrated lower variability in longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, and lane deviation compared to the other two conditions. In subjective evaluations, the ChatGPT-based agent also received significantly higher ratings in competence, animacy, affective trust, and preference compared to the Pre-scripted agent. Our thematic analysis of driver-agent conversations revealed diverse interaction patterns in topics, including driving assistance/questions, entertainment requests, and anthropomorphic interactions. Our results highlight the potential of LLM-powered in-vehicle conversational agents to enhance driving safety and user experience through natural, context-rich interactions.

### Decoupled Global-Local Alignment for Improving Compositional   Understanding
**Authors**: Xiaoxing Hu, Kaicheng Yang, Jun Wang, Haoran Xu, Ziyong Feng, Yupei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:35:42Z

**Summary**: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved success on multiple downstream tasks by aligning image and text modalities. However, the nature of global contrastive learning limits CLIP's ability to comprehend compositional concepts, such as relations and attributes. Although recent studies employ global hard negative samples to improve compositional understanding, these methods significantly compromise the model's inherent general capabilities by forcibly distancing textual negative samples from images in the embedding space. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Decoupled Global-Local Alignment (DeGLA) framework that improves compositional understanding while substantially mitigating losses in general capabilities. To optimize the retention of the model's inherent capabilities, we incorporate a self-distillation mechanism within the global alignment process, aligning the learnable image-text encoder with a frozen teacher model derived from an exponential moving average. Under the constraint of self-distillation, it effectively mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge during fine-tuning. To improve compositional understanding, we first leverage the in-context learning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct about 2M high-quality negative captions across five types. Subsequently, we propose the Image-Grounded Contrast (IGC) loss and Text-Grounded Contrast (TGC) loss to enhance vision-language compositionally. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DeGLA framework. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, DeGLA achieves an average enhancement of 3.5% across the VALSE, SugarCrepe, and ARO benchmarks. Concurrently, it obtains an average performance improvement of 13.0% on zero-shot classification tasks across eleven datasets. Our code will be released at https://github.com/xiaoxing2001/DeGLA

### Assessing LLM Text Detection in Educational Contexts: Does Human   Contribution Affect Detection?
**Authors**: Lukas Gehring, Benjamin Paaßen

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:34:49Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their increased accessibility have made it easier than ever for students to automatically generate texts, posing new challenges for educational institutions. To enforce norms of academic integrity and ensure students' learning, learning analytics methods to automatically detect LLM-generated text appear increasingly appealing. This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art detectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called Generative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900 student-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various domains. To capture the diversity of LLM usage practices in generating text, we propose the concept of contribution levels, representing students' contribution to a given assignment. These levels range from purely human-written texts, to slightly LLM-improved versions, to fully LLM-generated texts, and finally to active attacks on the detector by "humanizing" generated texts. We show that most detectors struggle to accurately classify texts of intermediate student contribution levels, like LLM-improved human-written texts. Detectors are particularly likely to produce false positives, which is problematic in educational settings where false suspicions can severely impact students' lives. Our dataset, code, and additional supplementary materials are publicly available at https://github.com/lukasgehring/Assessing-LLM-Text-Detection-in-Educational-Contexts.

### Dual Information Speech Language Models for Emotional Conversations
**Authors**: Chun Wang, Chenyang Liu, Wenze Xu, Weihong Deng

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:33:44Z

**Summary**: Conversational systems relying on text-based large language models (LLMs) often overlook paralinguistic cues, essential for understanding emotions and intentions. Speech-language models (SLMs), which use speech as input, are emerging as a promising solution. However, SLMs built by extending frozen LLMs struggle to capture paralinguistic information and exhibit reduced context understanding. We identify entangled information and improper training strategies as key issues. To address these issues, we propose two heterogeneous adapters and suggest a weakly supervised training strategy. Our approach disentangles paralinguistic and linguistic information, enabling SLMs to interpret speech through structured representations. It also preserves contextual understanding by avoiding the generation of task-specific vectors through controlled randomness. This approach trains only the adapters on common datasets, ensuring parameter and data efficiency. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance in emotional conversation tasks, showcasing the model's ability to effectively integrate both paralinguistic and linguistic information within contextual settings.

### Fast and Generalizable parameter-embedded Neural Operators for   Lithium-Ion Battery Simulation
**Authors**: Amir Ali Panahi, Daniel Luder, Billy Wu, Gregory Offer, Dirk Uwe Sauer, Weihan Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:31:23Z

**Summary**: Reliable digital twins of lithium-ion batteries must achieve high physical fidelity with sub-millisecond speed. In this work, we benchmark three operator-learning surrogates for the Single Particle Model (SPM): Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and a newly proposed parameter-embedded Fourier Neural Operator (PE-FNO), which conditions each spectral layer on particle radius and solid-phase diffusivity. Models are trained on simulated trajectories spanning four current families (constant, triangular, pulse-train, and Gaussian-random-field) and a full range of State-of-Charge (SOC) (0 % to 100 %). DeepONet accurately replicates constant-current behaviour but struggles with more dynamic loads. The basic FNO maintains mesh invariance and keeps concentration errors below 1 %, with voltage mean-absolute errors under 1.7 mV across all load types. Introducing parameter embedding marginally increases error, but enables generalisation to varying radii and diffusivities. PE-FNO executes approximately 200 times faster than a 16-thread SPM solver. Consequently, PE-FNO's capabilities in inverse tasks are explored in a parameter estimation task with Bayesian optimisation, recovering anode and cathode diffusivities with 1.14 % and 8.4 % mean absolute percentage error, respectively, and 0.5918 percentage points higher error in comparison with classical methods. These results pave the way for neural operators to meet the accuracy, speed and parametric flexibility demands of real-time battery management, design-of-experiments and large-scale inference. PE-FNO outperforms conventional neural surrogates, offering a practical path towards high-speed and high-fidelity electrochemical digital twins.

### DanceChat: Large Language Model-Guided Music-to-Dance Generation
**Authors**: Qing Wang, Xiaohang Yang, Yilan Dong, Naveen Raj Govindaraj, Gregory Slabaugh, Shanxin Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:10:59Z

**Summary**: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit, high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm, and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

### Reviewing Clinical Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models: Training   and Beyond
**Authors**: Qiyuan Li, Haijiang Liu, Caicai Guo, Chao Gao, Deyu Chen, Meng Wang, Feng Gao, Frank van Harmelen, Jinguang Gu

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:03:23Z

**Summary**: The large-scale development of large language models (LLMs) in medical contexts, such as diagnostic assistance and treatment recommendations, necessitates that these models possess accurate medical knowledge and deliver traceable decision-making processes. Clinical knowledge, encompassing the insights gained from research on the causes, prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases, has been extensively examined within real-world medical practices. Recently, there has been a notable increase in research efforts aimed at integrating this type of knowledge into LLMs, encompassing not only traditional text and multimodal data integration but also technologies such as knowledge graphs (KGs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we review the various initiatives to embed clinical knowledge into training-based, KG-supported, and RAG-assisted LLMs. We begin by gathering reliable knowledge sources from the medical domain, including databases and datasets. Next, we evaluate implementations for integrating clinical knowledge through specialized datasets and collaborations with external knowledge sources such as KGs and relevant documentation. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of the developed medical LLMs in the industrial sector to assess the disparity between models developed in academic settings and those in industry. We conclude the survey by presenting evaluation systems applicable to relevant tasks and identifying potential challenges facing this field. In this review, we do not aim for completeness, since any ostensibly complete review would soon be outdated. Our goal is to illustrate diversity by selecting representative and accessible items from current research and industry practices, reflecting real-world situations rather than claiming completeness. Thus, we emphasize showcasing diverse approaches.

### AdaptFlow: Adaptive Workflow Optimization via Meta-Learning
**Authors**: Runchuan Zhu, Bowen Jiang, Lingrui Mei, Fangkai Yang, Lu Wang, Haoxiang Gao, Fengshuo Bai, Pu Zhao, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:52:59Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in agentic workflows, which are structured sequences of LLM invocations intended to solve complex tasks. However, existing approaches often rely on static templates or manually designed workflows, which limit adaptability to diverse tasks and hinder scalability. We propose AdaptFlow, a natural language-based meta-learning framework inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). AdaptFlow learns a generalizable workflow initialization that enables rapid subtask-level adaptation. It employs a bi-level optimization scheme: the inner loop refines the workflow for a specific subtask using LLM-generated feedback, while the outer loop updates the shared initialization to perform well across tasks. This setup allows AdaptFlow to generalize effectively to unseen tasks by adapting the initialized workflow through language-guided modifications. Evaluated across question answering, code generation, and mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AdaptFlow consistently outperforms both manually crafted and automatically searched baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results with strong generalization across tasks and models. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/microsoft/DKI_LLM/tree/AdaptFlow/AdaptFlow.

### BadPromptFL: A Novel Backdoor Threat to Prompt-based Federated Learning   in Multimodal Models
**Authors**: Maozhen Zhang, Mengnan Zhao, Bo Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:42:44Z

**Summary**: Prompt-based tuning has emerged as a lightweight alternative to full fine-tuning in large vision-language models, enabling efficient adaptation via learned contextual prompts. This paradigm has recently been extended to federated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively train prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning remain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In BadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation process. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling universal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters. Leveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures, BadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \(>90\%\)) with minimal visibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness, stealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.

### Fairness through Difference Awareness: Measuring Desired Group   Discrimination in LLMs
**Authors**: Angelina Wang, Michelle Phan, Daniel E. Ho, Sanmi Koyejo

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:37:48Z

**Summary**: Algorithmic fairness has conventionally adopted the mathematically convenient perspective of racial color-blindness (i.e., difference unaware treatment). However, we contend that in a range of important settings, group difference awareness matters. For example, differentiating between groups may be necessary in legal contexts (e.g., the U.S. compulsory draft applies to men but not women) and harm assessments (e.g., referring to girls as ``terrorists'' may be less harmful than referring to Muslim people as such). Thus, in contrast to most fairness work, we study fairness through the perspective of treating people differently -- when it is contextually appropriate to. We first introduce an important distinction between descriptive (fact-based), normative (value-based), and correlation (association-based) benchmarks. This distinction is significant because each category requires separate interpretation and mitigation tailored to its specific characteristics. Then, we present a benchmark suite composed of eight different scenarios for a total of 16k questions that enables us to assess difference awareness. Finally, we show results across ten models that demonstrate difference awareness is a distinct dimension to fairness where existing bias mitigation strategies may backfire.

### Robust Anomaly Detection in O-RAN: Leveraging LLMs against Data   Manipulation Attacks
**Authors**: Thusitha Dayaratne, Ngoc Duy Pham, Viet Vo, Shangqi Lai, Sharif Abuadbba, Hajime Suzuki, Xingliang Yuan, Carsten Rudolph

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:32:43Z

**Summary**: The introduction of 5G and the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture has enabled more flexible and intelligent network deployments. However, the increased complexity and openness of these architectures also introduce novel security challenges, such as data manipulation attacks on the semi-standardised Shared Data Layer (SDL) within the O-RAN platform through malicious xApps. In particular, malicious xApps can exploit this vulnerability by introducing subtle Unicode-wise alterations (hypoglyphs) into the data that are being used by traditional machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection methods. These Unicode-wise manipulations can potentially bypass detection and cause failures in anomaly detection systems based on traditional ML, such as AutoEncoders, which are unable to process hypoglyphed data without crashing. We investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection within the O-RAN architecture to address this challenge. We demonstrate that LLM-based xApps maintain robust operational performance and are capable of processing manipulated messages without crashing. While initial detection accuracy requires further improvements, our results highlight the robustness of LLMs to adversarial attacks such as hypoglyphs in input data. There is potential to use their adaptability through prompt engineering to further improve the accuracy, although this requires further research. Additionally, we show that LLMs achieve low detection latency (under 0.07 seconds), making them suitable for Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RIC deployments.

### Toward Intelligent and Secure Cloud: Large Language Model Empowered   Proactive Defense
**Authors**: Yuyang Zhou, Guang Cheng, Kang Du, Zihan Chen, Yuyu Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:32:01Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of cloud computing technologies and the increasing number of cloud applications have provided numerous benefits in our daily lives. However, the diversity and complexity of different components pose a significant challenge to cloud security, especially when dealing with sophisticated and advanced cyberattacks such as Denial of Service (DoS). Recent advancements in the large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions for security intelligence. By exploiting the powerful capabilities in language understanding, data analysis, task inference, action planning, and code generation, we present LLM-PD, a novel defense architecture that proactively mitigates various DoS threats in cloud networks. LLM-PD can efficiently make decisions through comprehensive data analysis and sequential reasoning, as well as dynamically create and deploy actionable defense mechanisms. Furthermore, it can flexibly self-evolve based on experience learned from previous interactions and adapt to new attack scenarios without additional training. Our case study on three distinct DoS attacks demonstrates its remarkable ability in terms of defense effectiveness and efficiency when compared with other existing methods.

### Bridging ASR and LLMs for Dysarthric Speech Recognition: Benchmarking   Self-Supervised and Generative Approaches
**Authors**: Ahmed Aboeitta, Ahmed Sharshar, Youssef Nafea, Shady Shehata

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:31:20Z

**Summary**: Speech Recognition (ASR) due to phoneme distortions and high variability. While self-supervised ASR models like Wav2Vec, HuBERT, and Whisper have shown promise, their effectiveness in dysarthric speech remains unclear. This study systematically benchmarks these models with different decoding strategies, including CTC, seq2seq, and LLM-enhanced decoding (BART,GPT-2, Vicuna). Our contributions include (1) benchmarking ASR architectures for dysarthric speech, (2) introducing LLM-based decoding to improve intelligibility, (3) analyzing generalization across datasets, and (4) providing insights into recognition errors across severity levels. Findings highlight that LLM-enhanced decoding improves dysarthric ASR by leveraging linguistic constraints for phoneme restoration and grammatical correction.

### EchoAid: Enhancing Livestream Shopping Accessibility for the DHH   Community
**Authors**: Zeyu Yang, Zheng Wei, Yang Zhang, Xian Xu, Changyang He, Muzhi Zhou, Pan Hui

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:26:36Z

**Summary**: Livestream shopping platforms often overlook the accessibility needs of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community, leading to barriers such as information inaccessibility and overload. To tackle these challenges, we developed \textit{EchoAid}, a mobile app designed to improve the livestream shopping experience for DHH users. \textit{EchoAid} utilizes advanced speech-to-text conversion, Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) technology, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to simplify the complex information flow in live sales environments. We conducted exploratory studies with eight DHH individuals to identify design needs and iteratively developed the \textit{EchoAid} prototype based on feedback from three participants. We then evaluate the performance of this system in a user study workshop involving 38 DHH participants. Our findings demonstrate the successful design and validation process of \textit{EchoAid}, highlighting its potential to enhance product information extraction, leading to reduced cognitive overload and more engaging and customized shopping experiences for DHH users.

### Progressive Depth Up-scaling via Optimal Transport
**Authors**: Mingzi Cao, Xi Wang, Nikolaos Aletras

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:15:33Z

**Summary**: Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) yields performance gains but incurs substantial training costs. Depth up-scaling offers training efficiency by adding new layers to pre-trained models. However, most existing methods copy or average weights from base layers, neglecting neuron permutation differences. This limitation can potentially cause misalignment that harms performance. Inspired by applying Optimal Transport (OT) for neuron alignment, we propose Optimal Transport Depth Up-Scaling (OpT-DeUS). OpT-DeUS aligns and fuses Transformer blocks in adjacent base layers via OT for new layer creation, to mitigate neuron permutation mismatch between layers. OpT-DeUS achieves better overall performance and offers improved training efficiency than existing methods for continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning across different model sizes. To further evaluate the impact of interpolation positions, our extensive analysis shows that inserting new layers closer to the top results in higher training efficiency due to shorter back-propagation time while obtaining additional performance gains.

### RAIR: Retrieval-Augmented Iterative Refinement for Chinese Spelling   Correction
**Authors**: Junhong Liang, Yu Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:10:45Z

**Summary**: Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) aims to detect and correct erroneous tokens in sentences. Traditional CSC focuses on equal length correction and uses pretrained language models (PLMs). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in identifying and rectifying potential errors, they often struggle with adapting to domain-specific corrections, especially when encountering terminologies in specialized domains. To address domain adaptation, we propose a \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{I}terative \textbf{R}efinement (RAIR) framework. Our approach constructs a retrieval corpus adaptively from domain-specific training data and dictionaries, employing a fine-tuned retriever to ensure that the retriever catches the error correction pattern. We also extend equal-length into variable-length correction scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms current approaches in domain spelling correction and significantly improves the performance of LLMs in variable-length scenarios.

### A Physics-informed Deep Operator for Real-Time Freeway Traffic State   Estimation
**Authors**: Hongxin Yu, Yibing Wang, Fengyue Jin, Meng Zhang, Anni Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:07:01Z

**Summary**: Traffic state estimation (TSE) falls methodologically into three categories: model-driven, data-driven, and model-data dual-driven. Model-driven TSE relies on macroscopic traffic flow models originated from hydrodynamics. Data-driven TSE leverages historical sensing data and employs statistical models or machine learning methods to infer traffic state. Model-data dual-driven traffic state estimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more accurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be viewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested traffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the first time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an operator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep neural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the original PI-DeepONet. The extended architecture is featured with: (1) the acceptance of 2-D data input so as to support CNN-based computations; (2) the introduction of a nonlinear expansion layer, an attention mechanism, and a MIMO mechanism; (3) dedicated neural network design for adaptive identification of traffic flow model parameters. A traffic state estimator built on the basis of this extended PI-DeepONet architecture was evaluated with respect to a short freeway stretch of NGSIM and a large-scale urban expressway in China, along with other four baseline TSE methods. The evaluation results demonstrated that this novel TSE method outperformed the baseline methods with high-precision estimation results of flow and mean speed.

### Interpreting Fedspeak with Confidence: A LLM-Based Uncertainty-Aware   Framework Guided by Monetary Policy Transmission Paths
**Authors**: Rui Yao, Qi Chai, Jinhai Yao, Siyuan Li, Junhao Chen, Qi Zhang, Hao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T04:42:34Z

**Summary**: "Fedspeak", the stylized and often nuanced language used by the U.S. Federal Reserve, encodes implicit policy signals and strategic stances. The Federal Open Market Committee strategically employs Fedspeak as a communication tool to shape market expectations and influence both domestic and global economic conditions. As such, automatically parsing and interpreting Fedspeak presents a high-impact challenge, with significant implications for financial forecasting, algorithmic trading, and data-driven policy analysis. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based, uncertainty-aware framework for deciphering Fedspeak and classifying its underlying monetary policy stance. Technically, to enrich the semantic and contextual representation of Fedspeak texts, we incorporate domain-specific reasoning grounded in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. We further introduce a dynamic uncertainty decoding module to assess the confidence of model predictions, thereby enhancing both classification accuracy and model reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the policy stance analysis task. Moreover, statistical analysis reveals a significant positive correlation between perceptual uncertainty and model error rates, validating the effectiveness of perceptual uncertainty as a diagnostic signal.

### WideSearch: Benchmarking Agentic Broad Info-Seeking
**Authors**: Ryan Wong, Jiawei Wang, Junjie Zhao, Li Chen, Yan Gao, Long Zhang, Xuan Zhou, Zuo Wang, Kai Xiang, Ge Zhang, Wenhao Huang, Yang Wang, Ke Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:03:09Z

**Summary**: From professional research to everyday planning, many tasks are bottlenecked by wide-scale information seeking, which is more repetitive than cognitively complex. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), automated search agents powered by LLMs offer a promising solution to liberate humans from this tedious work. However, the capability of these agents to perform such "wide-context" collection reliably and completely remains largely unevaluated due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce WideSearch, a new benchmark engineered to evaluate agent reliability on these large-scale collection tasks. The benchmark features 200 manually curated questions (100 in English, 100 in Chinese) from over 15 diverse domains, grounded in real user queries. Each task requires agents to collect large-scale atomic information, which could be verified one by one objectively, and arrange it into a well-organized output. A rigorous five-stage quality control pipeline ensures the difficulty, completeness, and verifiability of the dataset. We benchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including single-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most systems achieve overall success rates near 0\%, with the best performer reaching just 5\%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple human testers can achieve a near 100\% success rate. These results demonstrate that present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale information seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and development in agentic search. Our dataset, evaluation pipeline, and benchmark results have been publicly released at https://widesearch-seed.github.io/

### Prompt-Guided Relational Reasoning for Social Behavior Understanding   with Vision Foundation Models
**Authors**: Thinesh Thiyakesan Ponbagavathi, Chengzheng Yang, Alina Roitberg

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T13:59:22Z

**Summary**: Group Activity Detection (GAD) involves recognizing social groups and their collective behaviors in videos. Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), like DinoV2, offer excellent features, but are pretrained primarily on object-centric data and remain underexplored for modeling group dynamics. While they are a promising alternative to highly task-specific GAD architectures that require full fine-tuning, our initial investigation reveals that simply swapping CNN backbones used in these methods with VFMs brings little gain, underscoring the need for structured, group-aware reasoning on top.   We introduce Prompt-driven Group Activity Detection (ProGraD) -- a method that bridges this gap through 1) learnable group prompts to guide the VFM attention toward social configurations, and 2) a lightweight two-layer GroupContext Transformer that infers actor-group associations and collective behavior. We evaluate our approach on two recent GAD benchmarks: Cafe, which features multiple concurrent social groups, and Social-CAD, which focuses on single-group interactions. While we surpass state-of-the-art in both settings, our method is especially effective in complex multi-group scenarios, where we yield a gain of 6.5\% (Group mAP\@1.0) and 8.2\% (Group mAP\@0.5) using only 10M trainable parameters. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ProGraD produces interpretable attention maps, offering insights into actor-group reasoning. Code and models will be released.

### DIVER: A Multi-Stage Approach for Reasoning-intensive Information   Retrieval
**Authors**: Meixiu Long, Duolin Sun, Dan Yang, Junjie Wang, Yue Shen, Jian Wang, Peng Wei, Jinjie Gu, Jiahai Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T13:46:08Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation has achieved strong performance on knowledge-intensive tasks where query-document relevance can be identified through direct lexical or semantic matches. However, many real-world queries involve abstract reasoning, analogical thinking, or multi-step inference, which existing retrievers often struggle to capture. To address this challenge, we present \textbf{DIVER}, a retrieval pipeline tailored for reasoning-intensive information retrieval. DIVER consists of four components: document processing to improve input quality, LLM-driven query expansion via iterative document interaction, a reasoning-enhanced retriever fine-tuned on synthetic multi-domain data with hard negatives, and a pointwise reranker that combines LLM-assigned helpfulness scores with retrieval scores. On the BRIGHT benchmark, DIVER achieves state-of-the-art nDCG@10 scores of 41.6 and 28.9 on original queries, consistently outperforming competitive reasoning-aware models. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning-aware retrieval strategies in complex real-world tasks. Our code and retrieval model will be released soon.

### A Data-constrained Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of Successive X-class   Flares in Solar Active Region 13842. II. Dynamics of the Solar Eruption   Associated with the X9.0 Solar Flare
**Authors**: Keitarou Matsumoto, Satoshi Inoue, Keiji Hayashi, Nian Liu, Ying Wang, Jeongwoo Lee, Ju Jing, Haimin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T13:52:37Z

**Summary**: Active region NOAA 13842 produced two successive solar flares: an X7.1-class flare on October 1, 2024, and an X9.0-class flare on October 3, 2024. This study continues our previous simulation work that successfully reproduced the X7.1-class solar flare (Matsumoto et al. 2025). In this study, we performed a data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation using the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) as the initial condition to investigate the X9.0-class solar flare. The NLFFF showed the sheared field lines, resulting in the tether-cutting reconnection, the magnetic flux ropes (MFRs), and eventually led to eruption. The magnetic reconnection during the pre-eruption phase plays a critical role in accelerating the subsequent eruption, which is driven by torus instability and magnetic reconnection. Furthermore, our simulation results are consistent with several observational features associated with the X9.0 flare. This simulation could reproduce diverse phenomena associated with the X9.0 flare, including the tether-cutting reconnection, the flare ribbons and the flare loops, the transverse field enhancement, and the remote brightening away from the flare ribbons. However, the initial trigger, magnetic flux emergence, was inferred from observations rather than explicitly modeled, and future comprehensive simulations should incorporate this mechanism directly.

### PersonalAI: A Systematic Comparison of Knowledge Graph Storage and   Retrieval Approaches for Personalized LLM agents
**Authors**: Mikhail Menschikov, Dmitry Evseev, Victoria Dochkina, Ruslan Kostoev, Ilia Perepechkin, Petr Anokhin, Evgeny Burnaev, Nikita Semenov

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T13:41:39Z

**Summary**: Personalizing language models by effectively incorporating user interaction history remains a central challenge in the development of adaptive AI systems. While large language models (LLMs) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have improved factual accuracy, they often lack structured memory and fail to scale in complex, long-term interactions. To address this, we propose a flexible external memory framework based on knowledge graphs, automatically constructed and updated by the LLM itself, and capable of encoding information in multiple formats-including nodes, triplets, higher-order propositions, and episodic traces. Building upon the AriGraph architecture, we introduce a novel hybrid graph design that supports both standard edges and two types of hyperedges, enabling rich and dynamic semantic and temporal representations. Our framework also supports diverse retrieval mechanisms, including A*, water-circle propagation, beam search, and hybrid methods, making it adaptable to different datasets and LLM capacities. We evaluate our system on three benchmarks-TriviaQA, HotpotQA, and DiaASQ-demonstrating that different memory and retrieval configurations yield optimal performance depending on the task. Additionally, we extend the DiaASQ benchmark with temporal annotations and internally contradictory statements, showing that our system remains robust and effective in managing temporal dependencies and context-aware reasoning.

### Adaptive Multiple Access and Service Placement for Generative Diffusion   Models
**Authors**: Hamidreza Mazandarani, Mohammad Farhoudi, Masoud Shokrnezhad, Tarik Taleb

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T06:17:10Z

**Summary**: Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) have emerged as key components of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), offering unparalleled expressiveness and controllability for complex data generation tasks. However, their deployment in real-time and mobile environments remains challenging due to the iterative and resource-intensive nature of the inference process. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a unified optimization framework that jointly tackles service placement and multiple access control for GDMs in mobile edge networks. We propose LEARN-GDM, a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based algorithm that dynamically partitions denoising blocks across heterogeneous edge nodes, while accounting for latent transmission costs and enabling adaptive reduction of inference steps. Our approach integrates a greedy multiple access scheme with a Double and Dueling Deep Q-Learning (D3QL)-based service placement, allowing for scalable, adaptable, and resource-efficient operation under stringent quality of service requirements. Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework in terms of scalability and latency resilience compared to conventional monolithic and fixed chain-length placement strategies. This work advances the state of the art in edge-enabled GenAI by offering an adaptable solution for GDM services orchestration, paving the way for future extensions toward semantic networking and co-inference across distributed environments.

### Beyond Ten Turns: Unlocking Long-Horizon Agentic Search with Large-Scale   Asynchronous RL
**Authors**: Jiaxuan Gao, Wei Fu, Minyang Xie, Shusheng Xu, Chuyi He, Zhiyu Mei, Banghua Zhu, Yi Wu

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T13:36:57Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability, efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online RL methods, e.g. <=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements, with 46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 turns and output tokens exceeding 150k during training time. With a simple agent design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 42.1 on xBench and 52.8 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. We open-source our models, training data, and codes in https://github.com/inclusionAI/ASearcher.

### Spotter+GPT: Turning Sign Spottings into Sentences with LLMs
**Authors**: Ozge Mercanoglu Sincan, Richard Bowden

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T13:32:09Z

**Summary**: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that aims to generate spoken language sentences from sign language videos. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight, modular SLT framework, Spotter+GPT, that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and avoids heavy end-to-end training. Spotter+GPT breaks down the SLT task into two distinct stages. First, a sign spotter identifies individual signs within the input video. The spotted signs are then passed to an LLM, which transforms them into meaningful spoken language sentences. Spotter+GPT eliminates the requirement for SLT-specific training. This significantly reduces computational costs and time requirements. The source code and pretrained weights of the Spotter are available at https://gitlab.surrey.ac.uk/cogvispublic/sign-spotter.

### Statistical inference of random graphs with a surrogate likelihood   function
**Authors**: Dingbo Wu, Fangzheng Xie

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T13:25:32Z

**Summary**: Spectral estimators have been broadly applied to statistical network analysis, but they do not incorporate the likelihood information of the network sampling model. This paper proposes a novel surrogate likelihood function for statistical inference of a class of popular network models referred to as random dot product graphs. In contrast to the structurally complicated exact likelihood function, the surrogate likelihood function has a separable structure and is log-concave yet approximates the exact likelihood function well. From the frequentist perspective, we study the maximum surrogate likelihood estimator and establish the accompanying theory. We show its existence, uniqueness, large sample properties, and that it improves upon the baseline spectral estimator with a smaller sum of squared errors. Furthermore, we derive the second-order bias of the proposed estimator and gain insight into why it outperforms some of the existing estimators. A computationally convenient stochastic gradient descent algorithm is designed to find the maximum surrogate likelihood estimator in practice. From the Bayesian perspective, we establish the Bernstein--von Mises theorem of the posterior distribution with the surrogate likelihood function and show that the resulting credible sets have the correct frequentist coverage. The empirical performance of the proposed surrogate-likelihood-based methods is validated through the analyses of simulation examples and a real-world Wikipedia graph dataset.

### Large Language Models for Subjective Language Understanding: A Survey
**Authors**: Changhao Song, Yazhou Zhang, Hui Gao, Ben Yao, Peng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T13:10:44Z

**Summary**: Subjective language understanding refers to a broad set of natural language processing tasks where the goal is to interpret or generate content that conveys personal feelings, opinions, or figurative meanings rather than objective facts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, LLaMA, and others, there has been a paradigm shift in how we approach these inherently nuanced tasks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advances in applying LLMs to subjective language tasks, including sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, sarcasm detection, humor understanding, stance detection, metaphor interpretation, intent detection, and aesthetics assessment. We begin by clarifying the definition of subjective language from linguistic and cognitive perspectives, and we outline the unique challenges posed by subjective language (e.g. ambiguity, figurativeness, context dependence). We then survey the evolution of LLM architectures and techniques that particularly benefit subjectivity tasks, highlighting why LLMs are well-suited to model subtle human-like judgments. For each of the eight tasks, we summarize task definitions, key datasets, state-of-the-art LLM-based methods, and remaining challenges. We provide comparative insights, discussing commonalities and differences among tasks and how multi-task LLM approaches might yield unified models of subjectivity. Finally, we identify open issues such as data limitations, model bias, and ethical considerations, and suggest future research directions. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the intersection of affective computing, figurative language processing, and large-scale language models.

### Careful Queries, Credible Results: Teaching RAG Models Advanced Web   Search Tools with Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Yuqin Dai, Shuo Yang, Guoqing Wang, Yong Deng, Zhanwei Zhang, Jun Yin, Pengyu Zeng, Zhenzhe Ying, Changhua Meng, Can Yi, Yuchen Zhou, Weiqiang Wang, Shuai Lu

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T13:08:37Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating up-to-date external knowledge, yet real-world web environments present unique challenges. These limitations manifest as two key challenges: pervasive misinformation in the web environment, which introduces unreliable or misleading content that can degrade retrieval accuracy, and the underutilization of web tools, which, if effectively employed, could enhance query precision and help mitigate this noise, ultimately improving the retrieval results in RAG systems. To address these issues, we propose WebFilter, a novel RAG framework that generates source-restricted queries and filters out unreliable content. This approach combines a retrieval filtering mechanism with a behavior- and outcome-driven reward strategy, optimizing both query formulation and retrieval outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WebFilter improves answer quality and retrieval precision, outperforming existing RAG methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

### Expert Preference-based Evaluation of Automated Related Work Generation
**Authors**: Furkan Şahinuç, Subhabrata Dutta, Iryna Gurevych

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T13:08:07Z

**Summary**: Expert domain writing, such as scientific writing, typically demands extensive domain knowledge. Recent advances in LLMs show promising potential in reducing the expert workload. However, evaluating the quality of automatically generated scientific writing is a crucial open issue, as it requires knowledge of domain-specific evaluation criteria and the ability to discern expert preferences. Conventional automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge systems are insufficient to grasp expert preferences and domain-specific quality standards. To address this gap and support human-AI collaborative writing, we focus on related work generation, one of the most challenging scientific tasks, as an exemplar. We propose GREP, a multi-turn evaluation framework that integrates classical related work evaluation criteria with expert-specific preferences. Instead of assigning a single score, our framework decomposes the evaluation into fine-grained dimensions. This localized evaluation approach is further augmented with contrastive few-shot examples to provide detailed contextual guidance for the evaluation dimensions. The design principles allow our framework to deliver cardinal assessment of quality, which can facilitate better post-training compared to ordinal preference data. For better accessibility, we design two variants of GREP: a more precise variant with proprietary LLMs as evaluators, and a cheaper alternative with open-weight LLMs. Empirical investigation reveals that our framework is able to assess the quality of related work sections in a much more robust manner compared to standard LLM judges, reflects natural scenarios of scientific writing, and bears a strong correlation with the human expert assessment. We also observe that generations from state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to satisfy validation constraints of a suitable related work section. They (mostly) fail to improve based on feedback as well.

### FEAT: A Multi-Agent Forensic AI System with Domain-Adapted Large   Language Model for Automated Cause-of-Death Analysis

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T13:05:59Z

**Summary**: Forensic cause-of-death determination faces systemic challenges, including workforce shortages and diagnostic variability, particularly in high-volume systems like China's medicolegal infrastructure. We introduce FEAT (ForEnsic AgenT), a multi-agent AI framework that automates and standardizes death investigations through a domain-adapted large language model. FEAT's application-oriented architecture integrates: (i) a central Planner for task decomposition, (ii) specialized Local Solvers for evidence analysis, (iii) a Memory & Reflection module for iterative refinement, and (iv) a Global Solver for conclusion synthesis. The system employs tool-augmented reasoning, hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation, forensic-tuned LLMs, and human-in-the-loop feedback to ensure legal and medical validity. In evaluations across diverse Chinese case cohorts, FEAT outperformed state-of-the-art AI systems in both long-form autopsy analyses and concise cause-of-death conclusions. It demonstrated robust generalization across six geographic regions and achieved high expert concordance in blinded validations. Senior pathologists validated FEAT's outputs as comparable to those of human experts, with improved detection of subtle evidentiary nuances. To our knowledge, FEAT is the first LLM-based AI agent system dedicated to forensic medicine, offering scalable, consistent death certification while maintaining expert-level rigor. By integrating AI efficiency with human oversight, this work could advance equitable access to reliable medicolegal services while addressing critical capacity constraints in forensic systems.

### What is emergence, after all?
**Authors**: Abbas K. Rizi

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:50:54Z

**Summary**: The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable, physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By disentangling emergence from vague overuse, we emphasize its role as a rigorous tool for understanding complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.

### SHIELDA: Structured Handling of Exceptions in LLM-Driven Agentic   Workflows
**Authors**: Jingwen Zhou, Jieshan Chen, Qinghua Lu, Dehai Zhao, Liming Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:50:46Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) agentic systems are software systems powered by LLMs that autonomously reason, plan, and execute multi-step workflows to achieve human goals, rather than merely executing predefined steps. During execution, these workflows frequently encounter exceptions. Existing exception handling solutions often treat exceptions superficially, failing to trace execution-phase exceptions to their reasoning-phase root causes. Furthermore, their recovery logic is brittle, lacking structured escalation pathways when initial attempts fail. To tackle these challenges, we first present a comprehensive taxonomy of 36 exception types across 12 agent artifacts. Building on this, we propose SHIELDA (Structured Handling of Exceptions in LLM-Driven Agentic Workflows), a modular runtime exception handling framework for LLM agentic workflows. SHIELDA uses an exception classifier to select a predefined exception handling pattern from a handling pattern registry. These patterns are then executed via a structured handling executor, comprising local handling, flow control, and state recovery, to enable phase-aware recovery by linking exceptions to their root causes and facilitating composable strategies. We validate SHIELDA's effectiveness through a case study on the AutoPR agent, demonstrating effective, cross-phase recovery from a reasoning-induced exception.

### \(X\)-evolve: Solution space evolution powered by large language models
**Authors**: Yi Zhai, Zhiqiang Wei, Ruohan Li, Keyu Pan, Shuo Liu, Lu Zhang, Jianmin Ji, Wuyang Zhang, Yu Zhang, Yanyong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:47:59Z

**Summary**: While combining large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary algorithms (EAs) shows promise for solving complex optimization problems, current approaches typically evolve individual solutions, often incurring high LLM call costs. We introduce \(X\)-evolve, a paradigm-shifting method that instead evolves solution spaces \(X\) (sets of individual solutions) - subsets of the overall search space \(S\). In \(X\)-evolve, LLMs generate tunable programs wherein certain code snippets, designated as parameters, define a tunable solution space. A score-based search algorithm then efficiently explores this parametrically defined space, guided by feedback from objective function scores. This strategy enables broader and more efficient exploration, which can potentially accelerate convergence at a much lower search cost, requiring up to two orders of magnitude fewer LLM calls than prior leading methods. We demonstrate \(X\)-evolve's efficacy across three distinct hard optimization problems. For the cap set problem, we discover a larger partial admissible set, establishing a new tighter asymptotic lower bound for the cap set constant (\(C \ge 2.2203\)). In information theory, we uncover a larger independent set for the 15-vertex cycle graph (\(\mathcal{C}_{15}^{\boxtimes 5}\), size 19,946), thereby raising the known lower bound on its Shannon capacity. Furthermore, for the NP-hard online bin packing problem, we generate heuristics that consistently outperform standard strategies across established benchmarks. By evolving solution spaces, our method considerably improves search effectiveness, making it possible to tackle high-dimensional problems that were previously computationally prohibitive.

### DreamFrame: Enhancing Video Understanding via Automatically Generated QA   and Style-Consistent Keyframes
**Authors**: Zhende Song, Chenchen Wang, Jiamu Sheng, Chi Zhang, Shengji Tang, Jiayuan Fan, Tao Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:47:49Z

**Summary**: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) for video understanding are primarily fine-tuned with various videos scraped from online platforms. Existing datasets, such as ActivityNet, require considerable human labor for structuring and annotation before effectively utilized for tuning LVLMs. While current LVLMs are primarily trained on existing datasets in broad, general-purpose settings, adapting them to specific downstream scenarios remains challenging, as collecting and annotating task-specific videos is highly labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a three-stage framework named DreamFrame for automatically generating style-consistent keyframes and corresponding question-answer (QA) pairs to support LVLM instruction tuning. DreamFrame generates datasets in a movie-like manner. First, we utilize an LLM to generate structured movie plots including movie prior information (like overview and style), frame descriptions and plot-related QA pairs, with a story expansion strategy to mitigate context length limitations.Then, to ensure visual consistency across generated frames, we design a Style Immobilization Process which maintains consistent style through an embedding learning strategy. Finally, frame descriptions and style embeddings are integrated to produce coherent keyframes. Using DreamFrame, we construct a dataset comprising approximately 1k stylized keyframe-like videos and 100k diverse QA pairs. Extensive fine-tuned experiments on various LVLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset. Furthermore, based on the proposed dataset, we fine-tune a new LVLM named DreamFrame-7B, which significantly surpasses the previous similar-sized LVLMs across different benchmarks.

**Summary**: Time series forecasting poses significant challenges in non-stationary environments where underlying patterns evolve over time. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances deep neural network (DNN) performance by leveraging specialized model adaptation and selection. Initially, a base DNN is trained offline on historical time series data. A reserved validation subset is then segmented to extract and cluster the most dominant patterns within the series, thereby identifying distinct regimes. For each identified cluster, the base DNN is fine-tuned to produce a specialized version that captures unique pattern characteristics. At inference, the most recent input is matched against the cluster centroids, and the corresponding fine-tuned version is deployed based on the closest similarity measure. Additionally, our approach integrates a concept drift detection mechanism to identify and adapt to emerging patterns caused by non-stationary behavior. The proposed framework is generalizable across various DNN architectures and has demonstrated significant performance gains on both traditional DNNs and recent advanced architectures implemented in the GluonTS library.

### TAG: A Simple Yet Effective Temporal-Aware Approach for Zero-Shot Video   Temporal Grounding
**Authors**: Jin-Seop Lee, SungJoon Lee, Jaehan Ahn, YunSeok Choi, Jee-Hyong Lee

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:38:46Z

**Summary**: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to extract relevant video segments based on a given natural language query. Recently, zero-shot VTG methods have gained attention by leveraging pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to localize target moments without additional training. However, existing approaches suffer from semantic fragmentation, where temporally continuous frames sharing the same semantics are split across multiple segments. When segments are fragmented, it becomes difficult to predict an accurate target moment that aligns with the text query. Also, they rely on skewed similarity distributions for localization, making it difficult to select the optimal segment. Furthermore, they heavily depend on the use of LLMs which require expensive inferences. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{TAG}, a simple yet effective Temporal-Aware approach for zero-shot video temporal Grounding, which incorporates temporal pooling, temporal coherence clustering, and similarity adjustment. Our proposed method effectively captures the temporal context of videos and addresses distorted similarity distributions without training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions benchmark datasets without rely on LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Nuetee/TAG

### RSVLM-QA: A Benchmark Dataset for Remote Sensing Vision Language   Model-based Question Answering
**Authors**: Xing Zi, Jinghao Xiao, Yunxiao Shi, Xian Tao, Jun Li, Ali Braytee, Mukesh Prasad

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:32:48Z

**Summary**: Visual Question Answering (VQA) in remote sensing (RS) is pivotal for interpreting Earth observation data. However, existing RS VQA datasets are constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain. RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1 then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises 13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs), demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:32:14Z

**Summary**: Using LLMs in a production environment presents security challenges that include vulnerabilities to jailbreaks and prompt injections, which can result in harmful outputs for humans or the enterprise. The challenge is amplified when working within a specific domain, as topics generally accepted for LLMs to address may be irrelevant to that field. These problems can be mitigated, for example, by fine-tuning large language models with domain-specific and security-focused data. However, these alone are insufficient, as jailbreak techniques evolve. Additionally, API-accessed models do not offer the flexibility needed to tailor behavior to industry-specific objectives, and in-context learning is not always sufficient or reliable. In response to these challenges, we introduce Archias, an expert model adept at distinguishing between in-domain and out-of-domain communications. Archias classifies user inquiries into several categories: in-domain (specifically for the automotive industry), malicious questions, price injections, prompt injections, and out-of-domain examples. Our methodology integrates outputs from the expert model (Archias) into prompts, which are then processed by the LLM to generate responses. This method increases the model's ability to understand the user's intention and give appropriate answers. Archias can be adjusted, fine-tuned, and used for many different purposes due to its small size. Therefore, it can be easily customized to the needs of any industry. To validate our approach, we created a benchmark dataset for the automotive industry. Furthermore, in the interest of advancing research and development, we release our benchmark dataset to the community.

**Authors**: Chen Cecilia Liu, Hiba Arnaout, Nils Kovačić, Dana Atzil-Slonim, Iryna Gurevych

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:17:58Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in offering emotional support and generating empathetic responses for individuals in distress, but their ability to deliver culturally sensitive support remains underexplored due to lack of resources. In this work, we introduce CultureCare, the first dataset designed for this task, spanning four cultures and including 1729 distress messages, 1523 cultural signals, and 1041 support strategies with fine-grained emotional and cultural annotations. Leveraging CultureCare, we (i) develop and test four adaptation strategies for guiding three state-of-the-art LLMs toward culturally sensitive responses; (ii) conduct comprehensive evaluations using LLM judges, in-culture human annotators, and clinical psychologists; (iii) show that adapted LLMs outperform anonymous online peer responses, and that simple cultural role-play is insufficient for cultural sensitivity; and (iv) explore the application of LLMs in clinical training, where experts highlight their potential in fostering cultural competence in future therapists.

**Authors**: Vincenzo De Martino, Joel Castaño, Fabio Palomba, Xavier Franch, Silverio Martínez-Fernández

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:16:03Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software engineering research, offering new opportunities for automating repository mining tasks. However, despite their growing popularity, the methodological integration of LLMs into Mining Software Repositories (MSR) remains poorly understood. Existing studies tend to focus on specific capabilities or performance benchmarks, providing limited insight into how researchers utilize LLMs across the full research pipeline. To address this gap, we conduct a mixed-method study that combines a rapid review and questionnaire survey in the field of LLM4MSR. We investigate (1) the approaches and (2) the threats that affect the empirical rigor of researchers involved in this field. Our findings reveal 15 methodological approaches, nine main threats, and 25 mitigation strategies. Building on these findings, we present PRIMES 2.0, a refined empirical framework organized into six stages, comprising 23 methodological substeps, each mapped to specific threats and corresponding mitigation strategies, providing prescriptive and adaptive support throughout the lifecycle of LLM-based MSR studies. Our work contributes to establishing a more transparent and reproducible foundation for LLM-based MSR research.

### Not Yet AlphaFold for the Mind: Evaluating Centaur as a Synthetic   Participant
**Authors**: Sabrina Namazova, Alessandra Brondetta, Younes Strittmatter, Matthew Nassar, Sebastian Musslick

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:05:18Z

**Summary**: Simulators have revolutionized scientific practice across the natural sciences. By generating data that reliably approximate real-world phenomena, they enable scientists to accelerate hypothesis testing and optimize experimental designs. This is perhaps best illustrated by AlphaFold, a Nobel-prize winning simulator in chemistry that predicts protein structures from amino acid sequences, enabling rapid prototyping of molecular interactions, drug targets, and protein functions. In the behavioral sciences, a reliable participant simulator - a system capable of producing human-like behavior across cognitive tasks - would represent a similarly transformative advance. Recently, Binz et al. introduced Centaur, a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on human data from 160 experiments, proposing its use not only as a model of cognition but also as a participant simulator for "in silico prototyping of experimental studies", e.g., to advance automated cognitive science. Here, we review the core criteria for a participant simulator and assess how well Centaur meets them. Although Centaur demonstrates strong predictive accuracy, its generative behavior - a critical criterion for a participant simulator - systematically diverges from human data. This suggests that, while Centaur is a significant step toward predicting human behavior, it does not yet meet the standards of a reliable participant simulator or an accurate model of cognition.

**Authors**: Shoaib Ahmmad, Zubayer Ahmed Aditto, Md Mehrab Hossain, Noushin Yeasmin, Shorower Hossain

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:00:03Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces an advanced AI-driven perception system for autonomous quadcopter navigation in GPS-denied indoor environments. The proposed framework leverages cloud computing to offload computationally intensive tasks and incorporates a custom-designed printed circuit board (PCB) for efficient sensor data acquisition, enabling robust navigation in confined spaces. The system integrates YOLOv11 for object detection, Depth Anything V2 for monocular depth estimation, a PCB equipped with Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware decision-making. A virtual safety envelope, enforced by calibrated sensor offsets, ensures collision avoidance, while a multithreaded architecture achieves low-latency processing. Enhanced spatial awareness is facilitated by 3D bounding box estimation with Kalman filtering. Experimental results in an indoor testbed demonstrate strong performance, with object detection achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.6, depth estimation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.2 cm, only 16 safety envelope breaches across 42 trials over approximately 11 minutes, and end-to-end system latency below 1 second. This cloud-supported, high-intelligence framework serves as an auxiliary perception and navigation system, complementing state-of-the-art drone autonomy for GPS-denied confined spaces.

### Multi-agent systems for chemical engineering: A review and perspective
**Authors**: Sophia Rupprecht, Qinghe Gao, Tanuj Karia, Artur M. Schweidtmann

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:55:18Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MASs) are a recent but rapidly evolving technology with the potential to transform chemical engineering by decomposing complex workflows into teams of collaborative agents with specialized knowledge and tools. This review surveys the state-of-the-art of MAS within chemical engineering. While early studies demonstrate promising results, scientific challenges remain, including the design of tailored architectures, integration of heterogeneous data modalities, development of foundation models with domain-specific modalities, and strategies for ensuring transparency, safety, and environmental impact. As a young but fast-moving field, MASs offer exciting opportunities to rethink chemical engineering workflows.

### Solving Zero-Shot 3D Visual Grounding as Constraint Satisfaction   Problems
**Authors**: Qihao Yuan, Kailai Li, Jiaming Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:50:10Z

**Summary**: 3D visual grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in a 3D scene with natural language descriptions. Supervised methods have achieved decent accuracy, but have a closed vocabulary and limited language understanding ability. Zero-shot methods utilize large language models (LLMs) to handle natural language descriptions, where the LLM either produces grounding results directly or generates programs that compute results (symbolically). In this work, we propose a zero-shot method that reformulates the 3DVG task as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), where the variables and constraints represent objects and their spatial relations, respectively. This allows a global symbolic reasoning of all relevant objects, producing grounding results of both the target and anchor objects. Moreover, we demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by handling negation- and counting-based queries with only minor extra coding efforts. Our system, Constraint Satisfaction Visual Grounding (CSVG), has been extensively evaluated on the public datasets ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets using only open-source LLMs. Results show the effectiveness of CSVG and superior grounding accuracy over current state-of-the-art zero-shot 3DVG methods with improvements of $+7.0\%$ (Acc@0.5 score) and $+11.2\%$ on the ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets, respectively. The code of our system is available at https://asig-x.github.io/csvg_web.

### CoherenDream: Boosting Holistic Text Coherence in 3D Generation via   Multimodal Large Language Models Feedback
**Authors**: Chenhan Jiang, Yihan Zeng, Dit-Yan Yeung

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:43:39Z

**Summary**: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has achieved remarkable success in text-to-3D content generation. However, SDS-based methods struggle to maintain semantic fidelity for user prompts, particularly when involving multiple objects with intricate interactions. While existing approaches often address 3D consistency through multiview diffusion model fine-tuning on 3D datasets, this strategy inadvertently exacerbates text-3D alignment degradation. The limitation stems from SDS's inherent accumulation of view-independent biases during optimization, which progressively diverges from the ideal text alignment direction. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel SDS objective, dubbed as Textual Coherent Score Distillation (TCSD), which integrates alignment feedback from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our TCSD leverages cross-modal understanding capabilities of MLLMs to assess and guide the text-3D correspondence during the optimization. We further develop 3DLLaVA-CRITIC - a fine-tuned MLLM specialized for evaluating multiview text alignment in 3D generations. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-layout initialization that significantly accelerates optimization convergence through semantic-aware spatial configuration. Our framework, CoherenDream, achieves consistent improvement across multiple metrics on TIFA subset.As the first study to incorporate MLLMs into SDS optimization, we also conduct extensive ablation studies to explore optimal MLLM adaptations for 3D generation tasks.

### CATP: Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning for Efficient and Enhanced   Multimodal In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Yanshu Li, Jianjiang Yang, Zhennan Shen, Ligong Han, Haoyan Xu, Ruixiang Tang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:41:51Z

**Summary**: Modern large vision-language models (LVLMs) convert each input image into a large set of tokens, far outnumbering the text tokens. Although this improves visual perception, it introduces severe image token redundancy. Because image tokens carry sparse information, many add little to reasoning, yet greatly increase inference cost. The emerging image token pruning methods tackle this issue by identifying the most important tokens and discarding the rest. These methods can raise efficiency with only modest performance loss. However, most of them only consider single-image tasks and overlook multimodal in-context learning (ICL), where redundancy is greater and efficiency is more critical. Redundant tokens weaken the advantage of multimodal ICL for rapid domain adaptation and cause unstable performance. Applying existing pruning methods in this setting leads to large accuracy drops, exposing a clear gap and the need for new techniques. Thus, we propose Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning (CATP), a training-free pruning method targeted at multimodal ICL. CATP consists of two stages that perform progressive pruning to fully account for the complex cross-modal interactions in the input sequence. After removing 77.8\% of the image tokens, CATP produces an average performance gain of 0.6\% over the vanilla model on four LVLMs and eight benchmarks, exceeding all baselines remarkably. Meanwhile, it effectively improves efficiency by achieving an average reduction of 10.78\% in inference latency. CATP enhances the practical value of multimodal ICL and lays the groundwork for future progress in interleaved image-text scenarios.

### Aligning Instruction Tuning with Pre-training
**Authors**: Yiming Liang, Tianyu Zheng, Xinrun Du, Ge Zhang, Jiaheng Liu, Xingwei Qu, Wenqiang Zu, Xingrun Xing, Chujie Zheng, Lei Ma, Guoyin Wang, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Wenhao Huang, Xiang Yue, Jiajun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:28:39Z

**Summary**: Instruction tuning enhances large language models (LLMs) to follow human instructions across diverse tasks, relying on high-quality datasets to guide behavior. However, these datasets, whether manually curated or synthetically generated, are often narrowly focused and misaligned with the broad distributions captured during pre-training, limiting LLM generalization and effective use of pre-trained knowledge. We propose Aligning Instruction Tuning with Pre-training (AITP), a method that bridges this gap by identifying coverage shortfalls in instruction-tuning datasets and rewriting underrepresented pre-training data into high-quality instruction-response pairs. This approach enriches dataset diversity while preserving task-specific objectives. Evaluations on three fully open LLMs across eight benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements with AITP. Ablations highlight the benefits of adaptive data selection, controlled rewriting, and balanced integration, emphasizing the importance of aligning instruction tuning with pre-training distributions to unlock the full potential of LLMs.

### A Review and Classification of Model Uncertainty
**Authors**: Guangyuan Cui, Yuting Wei, Xinyu Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:26:44Z

**Summary**: Model uncertainty is a crucial issue in statistics, econometrics and machine learning, yet its definition remains ambiguous and is subject to various interpretations in the literature. So far, there has not been a universally accepted definition of model uncertainty. We review different understandings of model uncertainty and categorize them into three distinct types: uncertainty about the true model, model selection uncertainty, and model selection instability. We further offer interpretations and examples for a better illustration of these definitions. We also discuss the potential consequences of neglecting model uncertainty in the process of conducting statistical inference, and provide effective solutions to these problems. Our aim is to help researchers better understand the concept of model uncertainty and obtain valid statistical inference results on the premise of its existence.

### A variational Bayes approach to debiased inference for low-dimensional   parameters in high-dimensional linear regression
**Authors**: Ismaël Castillo, Alice L'Huillier, Kolyan Ray, Luke Travis

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:26:24Z

**Summary**: We propose a scalable variational Bayes method for statistical inference for a single or low-dimensional subset of the coordinates of a high-dimensional parameter in sparse linear regression. Our approach relies on assigning a mean-field approximation to the nuisance coordinates and carefully modelling the conditional distribution of the target given the nuisance. This requires only a preprocessing step and preserves the computational advantages of mean-field variational Bayes, while ensuring accurate and reliable inference for the target parameter, including for uncertainty quantification. We investigate the numerical performance of our algorithm, showing that it performs competitively with existing methods. We further establish accompanying theoretical guarantees for estimation and uncertainty quantification in the form of a Bernstein--von Mises theorem.

### Large Language Models for Czech Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
**Authors**: Jakub Šmíd, Pavel Přibáň, Pavel Král

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:24:57Z

**Summary**: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task that aims to identify sentiment toward specific aspects of an entity. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their capabilities for Czech ABSA remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 19 LLMs of varying sizes and architectures on Czech ABSA, comparing their performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. Our results show that small domain-specific models fine-tuned for ABSA outperform general-purpose LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while fine-tuned LLMs achieve state-of-the-art results. We analyze how factors such as multilingualism, model size, and recency influence performance and present an error analysis highlighting key challenges, particularly in aspect term prediction. Our findings provide insights into the suitability of LLMs for Czech ABSA and offer guidance for future research in this area.

### Overconfidence in LLM-as-a-Judge: Diagnosis and Confidence-Driven   Solution
**Authors**: Zailong Tian, Zhuoheng Han, Yanzhe Chen, Haozhe Xu, Xi Yang, Richeng Xuan, Houfeng Wang, Lizi Liao

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:15:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as automated judges, where practical value depends on both accuracy and trustworthy, risk-aware judgments. Existing approaches predominantly focus on accuracy, overlooking the necessity of well-calibrated confidence, which is vital for adaptive and reliable evaluation pipelines. In this work, we advocate a shift from accuracy-centric evaluation to confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems, emphasizing the necessity of well-calibrated confidence for trustworthy and adaptive evaluation. We systematically identify the Overconfidence Phenomenon in current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence significantly overstates actual correctness, undermining reliability in practical deployment. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce TH-Score, a novel metric measuring confidence-accuracy alignment. Furthermore, we propose LLM-as-a-Fuser, an ensemble framework that transforms LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves calibration and enables adaptive, confidence-driven evaluation pipelines, achieving superior reliability and accuracy compared to existing baselines.

### Recommendation Is a Dish Better Served Warm
**Authors**: Danil Gusak, Nikita Sukhorukov, Evgeny Frolov

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:14:49Z

**Summary**: In modern recommender systems, experimental settings typically include filtering out cold users and items based on a minimum interaction threshold. However, these thresholds are often chosen arbitrarily and vary widely across studies, leading to inconsistencies that can significantly affect the comparability and reliability of evaluation results. In this paper, we systematically explore the cold-start boundary by examining the criteria used to determine whether a user or an item should be considered cold. Our experiments incrementally vary the number of interactions for different items during training, and gradually update the length of user interaction histories during inference. We investigate the thresholds across several widely used datasets, commonly represented in recent papers from top-tier conferences, and on multiple established recommender baselines. Our findings show that inconsistent selection of cold-start thresholds can either result in the unnecessary removal of valuable data or lead to the misclassification of cold instances as warm, introducing more noise into the system.

### Vertex Features for Neural Global Illumination
**Authors**: Rui Su, Honghao Dong, Haojie Jin, Yisong Chen, Guoping Wang, Sheng Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:10:19Z

**Summary**: Recent research on learnable neural representations has been widely adopted in the field of 3D scene reconstruction and neural rendering applications. However, traditional feature grid representations often suffer from substantial memory footprint, posing a significant bottleneck for modern parallel computing hardware. In this paper, we present neural vertex features, a generalized formulation of learnable representation for neural rendering tasks involving explicit mesh surfaces. Instead of uniformly distributing neural features throughout 3D space, our method stores learnable features directly at mesh vertices, leveraging the underlying geometry as a compact and structured representation for neural processing. This not only optimizes memory efficiency, but also improves feature representation by aligning compactly with the surface using task-specific geometric priors. We validate our neural representation across diverse neural rendering tasks, with a specific emphasis on neural radiosity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces memory consumption to only one-fifth (or even less) of grid-based representations, while maintaining comparable rendering quality and lowering inference overhead.

### LLMs for Law: Evaluating Legal-Specific LLMs on Contract Understanding
**Authors**: Amrita Singh, H. Suhan Karaca, Aditya Joshi, Hye-young Paik, Jiaojiao Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:08:32Z

**Summary**: Despite advances in legal NLP, no comprehensive evaluation covering multiple legal-specific LLMs currently exists for contract classification tasks in contract understanding. To address this gap, we present an evaluation of 10 legal-specific LLMs on three English language contract understanding tasks and compare them with 7 general-purpose LLMs. The results show that legal-specific LLMs consistently outperform general-purpose models, especially on tasks requiring nuanced legal understanding. Legal-BERT and Contracts-BERT establish new SOTAs on two of the three tasks, despite having 69% fewer parameters than the best-performing general-purpose LLM. We also identify CaseLaw-BERT and LexLM as strong additional baselines for contract understanding. Our results provide a holistic evaluation of legal-specific LLMs and will facilitate the development of more accurate contract understanding systems.

### Thermo-coalescence model for Light Nuclei production in Relativistic   Heavy-Ion Collisions
**Authors**: Arun Kumar Yadav, Nachiketa Sarkar, Sudhir Pandurang Rode, Partha Pratim Bhaduri, Abhijit Bhattacharyya, Amaresh Jaiswal

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T10:59:09Z

**Summary**: We employ a hybrid approach to describe the light nuclei production mechanism where the nucleons are assumed to be thermally produced, and are allowed to form light nuclei using a coalescence prescription. In this approach, we first fit transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) distribution of nucleons using hydro-inspired boost-invariant blast-wave model. The extracted parameters are then used to describe the deuteron $p_{T}$ spectra, along with two additional parameters that characterize the coalescence prescription employed in this study. We refer this combined approach as ``thermo-coalescence model'' and it is designed to study the deuteron production and describe the experimental measurements. In this work, we analyze the measured $p_{T}$ distribution of protons and deuterons from Pb-Pb collisions at the ALICE Collaboration at LHC. We also evaluate the $p_{T}$-integrated deuteron yields using this approach and compare with experimental measurements. A Bayesian inference framework is employed to determine the best-fit parameters of the thermo-coalescence model. Finally, we estimate the traditionally used experimental coalescence parameter ($B_{A}$) within our framework in order to establish a connection between our model and the conventional coalescence approach commonly used to relate experimental data with theoretical descriptions of light nuclei production.

### CBDES MoE: Hierarchically Decoupled Mixture-of-Experts for Functional   Modules in Autonomous Driving
**Authors**: Qi Xiang, Kunsong Shi, Zhigui Lin, Lei He

**Summary**: Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception systems based on multi-sensor feature fusion have become a fundamental cornerstone for end-to-end autonomous driving. However, existing multi-modal BEV methods commonly suffer from limited input adaptability, constrained modeling capacity, and suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchically decoupled Mixture-of-Experts architecture at the functional module level, termed Computing Brain DEvelopment System Mixture-of-Experts (CBDES MoE). CBDES MoE integrates multiple structurally heterogeneous expert networks with a lightweight Self-Attention Router (SAR) gating mechanism, enabling dynamic expert path selection and sparse, input-aware efficient inference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first modular Mixture-of-Experts framework constructed at the functional module granularity within the autonomous driving domain. Extensive evaluations on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrate that CBDES MoE consistently outperforms fixed single-expert baselines in 3D object detection. Compared to the strongest single-expert model, CBDES MoE achieves a 1.6-point increase in mAP and a 4.1-point improvement in NDS, demonstrating the effectiveness and practical advantages of the proposed approach.

### Inference-Time Gaze Refinement for Micro-Expression Recognition:   Enhancing Event-Based Eye Tracking with Motion-Aware Post-Processing
**Authors**: Nuwan Bandara, Thivya Kandappu, Archan Misra

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T10:39:09Z

**Summary**: Event-based eye tracking holds significant promise for fine-grained cognitive state inference, offering high temporal resolution and robustness to motion artifacts, critical features for decoding subtle mental states such as attention, confusion, or fatigue. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic, inference-time refinement framework designed to enhance the output of existing event-based gaze estimation models without modifying their architecture or requiring retraining. Our method comprises two key post-processing modules: (i) Motion-Aware Median Filtering, which suppresses blink-induced spikes while preserving natural gaze dynamics, and (ii) Optical Flow-Based Local Refinement, which aligns gaze predictions with cumulative event motion to reduce spatial jitter and temporal discontinuities. To complement traditional spatial accuracy metrics, we propose a novel Jitter Metric that captures the temporal smoothness of predicted gaze trajectories based on velocity regularity and local signal complexity. Together, these contributions significantly improve the consistency of event-based gaze signals, making them better suited for downstream tasks such as micro-expression analysis and mind-state decoding. Our results demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple baseline models on controlled datasets, laying the groundwork for future integration with multimodal affect recognition systems in real-world environments.

### DAGR: Decomposition Augmented Graph Retrieval with LLMs
**Authors**: Valentin Six, Evan Dufraisse, Gaël de Chalendar

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T10:35:31Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but struggle with multi-hop reasoning and factual consistency, limiting their effectiveness on knowledge-intensive tasks like complex question answering (QA). Linking Knowledge Graphs (KG) and LLMs has shown promising results, but LLMs generally lack the ability to reason efficiently over graph-structured information. To address this challenge, we introduce DAGR, a retrieval method that leverages both complex questions and their decomposition in subquestions to extract relevant, linked textual subgraphs. DAGR first breaks down complex queries, retrieves subgraphs guided by a weighted similarity function over both the original and decomposed queries, and creates a question-specific knowledge graph to guide answer generation. The resulting Graph-RAG pipeline is suited to handle complex multi-hop questions and effectively reason over graph-structured data. We evaluate DAGR on standard multi-hop QA benchmarks and show that it achieves comparable or superior performance to competitive existing methods, using smaller models and fewer LLM calls.

### Evaluating Large Language Models as Expert Annotators
**Authors**: Yu-Min Tseng, Wei-Lin Chen, Chung-Chi Chen, Hsin-Hsi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T10:19:10Z

**Summary**: Textual data annotation, the process of labeling or tagging text with relevant information, is typically costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential as direct alternatives to human annotators for general domains natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their effectiveness on annotation tasks in domains requiring expert knowledge remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate: whether top-performing LLMs, which might be perceived as having expert-level proficiency in academic and professional benchmarks, can serve as direct alternatives to human expert annotators? To this end, we evaluate both individual LLMs and multi-agent approaches across three highly specialized domains: finance, biomedicine, and law. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent discussion framework to simulate a group of human annotators, where LLMs are tasked to engage in discussions by considering others' annotations and justifications before finalizing their labels. Additionally, we incorporate reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) to enable a more comprehensive comparison. Our empirical results reveal that: (1) Individual LLMs equipped with inference-time techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT), self-consistency) show only marginal or even negative performance gains, contrary to prior literature suggesting their broad effectiveness. (2) Overall, reasoning models do not demonstrate statistically significant improvements over non-reasoning models in most settings. This suggests that extended long CoT provides relatively limited benefits for data annotation in specialized domains. (3) Certain model behaviors emerge in the multi-agent discussion environment. For instance, Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking rarely changes its initial annotations, even when other agents provide correct annotations or valid reasoning.

### From Limited Labels to Open Domains:An Efficient Learning Method for   Drone-view Geo-Localization
**Authors**: Zhongwei Chen, Zhao-Xu Yang, Hai-Jun Rong, Jiawei Lang, Guoqi Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T10:09:45Z

**Summary**: Traditional supervised drone-view geo-localization (DVGL) methods heavily depend on paired training data and encounter difficulties in learning cross-view correlations from unpaired data. Moreover, when deployed in a new domain, these methods require obtaining the new paired data and subsequent retraining for model adaptation, which significantly increases computational overhead. Existing unsupervised methods have enabled to generate pseudo-labels based on cross-view similarity to infer the pairing relationships. However, geographical similarity and spatial continuity often cause visually analogous features at different geographical locations. The feature confusion compromises the reliability of pseudo-label generation, where incorrect pseudo-labels drive negative optimization. Given these challenges inherent in both supervised and unsupervised DVGL methods, we propose a novel cross-domain invariant knowledge transfer network (CDIKTNet) with limited supervision, whose architecture consists of a cross-domain invariance sub-network (CDIS) and a cross-domain transfer sub-network (CDTS). This architecture facilitates a closed-loop framework for invariance feature learning and knowledge transfer. The CDIS is designed to learn cross-view structural and spatial invariance from a small amount of paired data that serves as prior knowledge. It endows the shared feature space of unpaired data with similar implicit cross-view correlations at initialization, which alleviates feature confusion. Based on this, the CDTS employs dual-path contrastive learning to further optimize each subspace while preserving consistency in a shared feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDIKTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance under full supervision compared with those supervised methods, and further surpasses existing unsupervised methods in both few-shot and cross-domain initialization.

Gonçalves, Jakob H. Macke

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T10:09:32Z

**Summary**: Scientists and engineers use simulators to model empirically observed phenomena. However, tuning the parameters of a simulator to ensure its outputs match observed data presents a significant challenge. Simulation-based inference (SBI) addresses this by enabling Bayesian inference for simulators, identifying parameters that match observed data and align with prior knowledge. Unlike traditional Bayesian inference, SBI only needs access to simulations from the model and does not require evaluations of the likelihood function. In addition, SBI algorithms do not require gradients through the simulator, allow for massive parallelization of simulations, and can perform inference for different observations without further simulations or training, thereby amortizing inference. Over the past years, we have developed, maintained, and extended sbi, a PyTorch-based package that implements Bayesian SBI algorithms based on neural networks. The sbi toolkit implements a wide range of inference methods, neural network architectures, sampling methods, and diagnostic tools. In addition, it provides well-tested default settings, but also offers flexibility to fully customize every step of the simulation-based inference workflow. Taken together, the sbi toolkit enables scientists and engineers to apply state-of-the-art SBI methods to black-box simulators, opening up new possibilities for aligning simulations with empirically observed data.

### Do LLMs Understand Your Translations? Evaluating Paragraph-level MT with   Question Answering
**Authors**: Patrick Fernandes, Sweta Agrawal, Emmanouil Zaranis, André F. T. Martins, Graham Neubig

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T10:08:37Z

**Summary**: Despite the steady progress in machine translation evaluation, existing automatic metrics struggle to capture how well meaning is preserved beyond sentence boundaries. We posit that reliance on a single intrinsic quality score, trained to mimic human judgments, might be insufficient for evaluating translations of long, complex passages, and a more ``pragmatic'' approach that assesses how accurately key information is conveyed by a translation in context is needed. We introduce TREQA (Translation Evaluation via Question-Answering), a framework that extrinsically evaluates translation quality by assessing how accurately candidate translations answer reading comprehension questions that target key information in the original source or reference texts. In challenging domains that require long-range understanding, such as literary texts, we show that TREQA is competitive with and, in some cases, outperforms state-of-the-art neural and LLM-based metrics in ranking alternative paragraph-level translations, despite never being explicitly optimized to correlate with human judgments. Furthermore, the generated questions and answers offer interpretability: empirical analysis shows that they effectively target translation errors identified by experts in evaluated datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/deep-spin/treqa

### EvoCoT: Overcoming the Exploration Bottleneck in Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Huanyu Liu, Jia Li, Chang Yu, Taozhi Chen, Yihong Dong, Lecheng Wang, Hu XiaoLong, Ge Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T09:49:01Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) has become a promising paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve their reasoning capability. However, when the rollout accuracy is low on hard problems, the reward becomes sparse, limiting learning efficiency and causing exploration bottlenecks. Existing approaches either rely on stronger LLMs for distillation or filter out difficult problems, which limits scalability or restricts reasoning improvement through exploration.   We propose EvoCoT, a self-evolving curriculum learning framework based on two-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning optimization. EvoCoT constrains the exploration space by self-generating and verifying CoT trajectories, then gradually shortens them to expand the space in a controlled way. This enables LLMs to stably learn from initially unsolved hard problems under sparse rewards. We apply EvoCoT to multiple LLM families, including Qwen, DeepSeek, and Llama. Experiments show that EvoCoT enables LLMs to solve previously unsolved problems, improves reasoning capability without external CoT supervision, and is compatible with various RL fine-tuning methods. We release the source code to support future research.

## Keyword: LLM Deployment 
 ### Jinx: Unlimited LLMs for Probing Alignment Failures
**Authors**: Jiahao Zhao, Liwei Dong

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T14:19:48Z

**Summary**: Unlimited, or so-called helpful-only language models are trained without safety alignment constraints and never refuse user queries. They are widely used by leading AI companies as internal tools for red teaming and alignment evaluation. For example, if a safety-aligned model produces harmful outputs similar to an unlimited model, this indicates alignment failures that require further attention. Despite their essential role in assessing alignment, such models are not available to the research community.   We introduce Jinx, a helpful-only variant of popular open-weight LLMs. Jinx responds to all queries without refusals or safety filtering, while preserving the base model's capabilities in reasoning and instruction following. It provides researchers with an accessible tool for probing alignment failures, evaluating safety boundaries, and systematically studying failure modes in language model safety.

### Bringing Everyone to the Table: An Experimental Study of LLM-Facilitated   Group Decision Making
**Authors**: Mohammed Alsobay, David M. Rothschild, Jake M. Hofman, Daniel G. Goldstein

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:55:40Z

**Summary**: Group decision-making often suffers from uneven information sharing, hindering decision quality. While large language models (LLMs) have been widely studied as aids for individuals, their potential to support groups of users, potentially as facilitators, is relatively underexplored. We present a pre-registered randomized experiment with 1,475 participants assigned to 281 five-person groups completing a hidden profile task--selecting an optimal city for a hypothetical sporting event--under one of four facilitation conditions: no facilitation, a one-time message prompting information sharing, a human facilitator, or an LLM (GPT-4o) facilitator. We find that LLM facilitation increases information shared within a discussion by raising the minimum level of engagement with the task among group members, and that these gains come at limited cost in terms of participants' attitudes towards the task, their group, or their facilitator. Whether by human or AI, there is no significant effect of facilitation on the final decision outcome, suggesting that even substantial but partial increases in information sharing are insufficient to overcome the hidden profile effect studied. To support further research into how LLM-based interfaces can support the future of collaborative decision making, we release our experimental platform, the Group-AI Interaction Laboratory (GRAIL), as an open-source tool.

**Authors**: Kaijun Wang, Liqin Lu, Mingyu Liu, Jianuo Jiang, Zeju Li, Bolin Zhang, Wancai Zheng, Xinyi Yu, Hao Chen, Chunhua Shen

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:54:31Z

**Summary**: Language-guided long-horizon mobile manipulation has long been a grand challenge in embodied semantic reasoning, generalizable manipulation, and adaptive locomotion. Three fundamental limitations hinder progress: First, although large language models have improved spatial reasoning and task planning through semantic priors, existing implementations remain confined to tabletop scenarios, failing to address the constrained perception and limited actuation ranges of mobile platforms. Second, current manipulation strategies exhibit insufficient generalization when confronted with the diverse object configurations encountered in open-world environments. Third, while crucial for practical deployment, the dual requirement of maintaining high platform maneuverability alongside precise end-effector control in unstructured settings remains understudied.   In this work, we present ODYSSEY, a unified mobile manipulation framework for agile quadruped robots equipped with manipulators, which seamlessly integrates high-level task planning with low-level whole-body control. To address the challenge of egocentric perception in language-conditioned tasks, we introduce a hierarchical planner powered by a vision-language model, enabling long-horizon instruction decomposition and precise action execution. At the control level, our novel whole-body policy achieves robust coordination across challenging terrains. We further present the first benchmark for long-horizon mobile manipulation, evaluating diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios. Through successful sim-to-real transfer, we demonstrate the system's generalization and robustness in real-world deployments, underscoring the practicality of legged manipulators in unstructured environments. Our work advances the feasibility of generalized robotic assistants capable of complex, dynamic tasks. Our project page: https://kaijwang.github.io/odyssey.github.io/

### Exploring Safety Alignment Evaluation of LLMs in Chinese Mental Health   Dialogues via LLM-as-Judge
**Authors**: Yunna Cai, Fan Wang, Haowei Wang, Kun Wang, Kailai Yang, Sophia Ananiadou, Moyan Li, Mingming Fan

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:52:07Z

**Summary**: Evaluating the safety alignment of LLM responses in high-risk mental health dialogues is particularly difficult due to missing gold-standard answers and the ethically sensitive nature of these interactions. To address this challenge, we propose PsyCrisis-Bench, a reference-free evaluation benchmark based on real-world Chinese mental health dialogues. It evaluates whether the model responses align with the safety principles defined by experts. Specifically designed for settings without standard references, our method adopts a prompt-based LLM-as-Judge approach that conducts in-context evaluation using expert-defined reasoning chains grounded in psychological intervention principles. We employ binary point-wise scoring across multiple safety dimensions to enhance the explainability and traceability of the evaluation. Additionally, we present a manually curated, high-quality Chinese-language dataset covering self-harm, suicidal ideation, and existential distress, derived from real-world online discourse. Experiments on 3600 judgments show that our method achieves the highest agreement with expert assessments and produces more interpretable evaluation rationales compared to existing approaches. Our dataset and evaluation tool are publicly available to facilitate further research.

### LL3M: Large Language 3D Modelers
**Authors**: Sining Lu, Guan Chen, Nam Anh Dinh, Itai Lang, Ari Holtzman, Rana Hanocka

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:48:02Z

**Summary**: We present LL3M, a multi-agent system that leverages pretrained large language models (LLMs) to generate 3D assets by writing interpretable Python code in Blender. We break away from the typical generative approach that learns from a collection of 3D data. Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a code-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration with artist workflows. Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of specialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender scripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance. The generated code works as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented representation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender constructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse, unconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. This code presents many avenues for further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or procedural parameters. This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our system: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while iterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets. A shared code context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a retrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API documentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions empowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LL3M across diverse shape categories, style and material edits, and user-driven refinements. Our experiments showcase the power of code as a generative and interpretable medium for 3D asset creation. Our project page is at https://threedle.github.io/ll3m.

**Summary**: 6G standardization is to start imminently, with commercial deployments expected before 2030. Its technical components and performance requirements are the focus of this article. Our emphasis is on the 6G radio access, especially MIMO, AI, waveforms, coding, signal constellations and integration with non-terrestrial networks. Whilst standardization has not yet formally started, the scope of the 6G study items has been defined. Our predictions in this paper are speculative as there are no results of the study yet, but our views are guided by implementation and deployment aspects. We expect that the views here will guide researchers and industry practitioners.

### Capabilities of GPT-5 on Multimodal Medical Reasoning
**Authors**: Shansong Wang, Mingzhe Hu, Qiang Li, Mojtaba Safari, Xiaofeng Yang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:43:45Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled general-purpose systems to perform increasingly complex domain-specific reasoning without extensive fine-tuning. In the medical domain, decision-making often requires integrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives, structured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist multimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates its zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based question answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified protocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20 against standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU medical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that GPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in multimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and understanding scores by +29.62% and +36.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and surpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in understanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in most dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to integrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain, recommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on these controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from human-comparable to above human-expert performance. This improvement may substantially inform the design of future clinical decision-support systems.

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:39:45Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent research area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both algorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress, several critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized guidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their underlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings, variations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led to conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these techniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting appropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL techniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a unified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable scenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained experiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and architectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for selecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable roadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we reveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning capability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss. The results demonstrate that our simple combination consistently improves performance, surpassing strategies like GRPO and DAPO.

### QUDsim: Quantifying Discourse Similarities in LLM-Generated Text
**Authors**: Ramya Namuduri, Yating Wu, Anshun Asher Zheng, Manya Wadhwa, Greg Durrett, Junyi Jessy Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:38:47Z

**Summary**: As large language models become increasingly capable at various writing tasks, their weakness at generating unique and creative content becomes a major liability. Although LLMs have the ability to generate text covering diverse topics, there is an overall sense of repetitiveness across texts that we aim to formalize and quantify via a similarity metric. The familiarity between documents arises from the persistence of underlying discourse structures. However, existing similarity metrics dependent on lexical overlap and syntactic patterns largely capture $\textit{content}$ overlap, thus making them unsuitable for detecting $\textit{structural}$ similarities. We introduce an abstraction based on linguistic theories in Questions Under Discussion (QUD) and question semantics to help quantify differences in discourse progression. We then use this framework to build $\textbf{QUDsim}$, a similarity metric that can detect discursive parallels between documents. Using QUDsim, we find that LLMs often reuse discourse structures (more so than humans) across samples, even when content differs. Furthermore, LLMs are not only repetitive and structurally uniform, but are also divergent from human authors in the types of structures they use.

### SAEMark: Multi-bit LLM Watermarking with Inference-Time Scaling
**Authors**: Zhuohao Yu, Xingru Jiang, Weizheng Gu, Yidong Wang, Shikun Zhang, Wei Ye

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:33:18Z

**Summary**: Watermarking LLM-generated text is critical for content attribution and misinformation prevention. However, existing methods compromise text quality, require white-box model access and logit manipulation. These limitations exclude API-based models and multilingual scenarios. We propose SAEMark, a general framework for post-hoc multi-bit watermarking that embeds personalized messages solely via inference-time, feature-based rejection sampling without altering model logits or requiring training. Our approach operates on deterministic features extracted from generated text, selecting outputs whose feature statistics align with key-derived targets. This framework naturally generalizes across languages and domains while preserving text quality through sampling LLM outputs instead of modifying. We provide theoretical guarantees relating watermark success probability and compute budget that hold for any suitable feature extractor. Empirically, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), achieving superior detection accuracy and text quality. Experiments across 4 datasets show SAEMark's consistent performance, with 99.7% F1 on English and strong multi-bit detection accuracy. SAEMark establishes a new paradigm for scalable watermarking that works out-of-the-box with closed-source LLMs while enabling content attribution.

### Runtime Monitoring and Enforcement of Conditional Fairness in Generative   AIs
**Authors**: Chih-Hong Cheng, Changshun Wu, Xingyu Zhao, Saddek Bensalem, Harald Ruess

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:29:56Z

**Summary**: The deployment of generative AI (GenAI) models raises significant fairness concerns, addressed in this paper through novel characterization and enforcement techniques specific to GenAI. Unlike standard AI performing specific tasks, GenAI's broad functionality requires ``conditional fairness'' tailored to the context being generated, such as demographic fairness in generating images of poor people versus successful business leaders. We define two fairness levels: the first evaluates fairness in generated outputs, independent of prompts and models; the second assesses inherent fairness with neutral prompts. Given the complexity of GenAI and challenges in fairness specifications, we focus on bounding the worst case, considering a GenAI system unfair if the distance between appearances of a specific group exceeds preset thresholds. We also explore combinatorial testing for assessing relative completeness in intersectional fairness. By bounding the worst case, we develop a prompt injection scheme within an agent-based framework to enforce conditional fairness with minimal intervention, validated on state-of-the-art GenAI systems.

### Human-Alignment and Calibration of Inference-Time Uncertainty in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Kyle Moore, Jesse Roberts, Daryl Watson

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:22:45Z

**Summary**: There has been much recent interest in evaluating large language models for uncertainty calibration to facilitate model control and modulate user trust. Inference time uncertainty, which may provide a real-time signal to the model or external control modules, is particularly important for applying these concepts to improve LLM-user experience in practice. While many of the existing papers consider model calibration, comparatively little work has sought to evaluate how closely model uncertainty aligns to human uncertainty. In this work, we evaluate a collection of inference-time uncertainty measures, using both established metrics and novel variations, to determine how closely they align with both human group-level uncertainty and traditional notions of model calibration. We find that numerous measures show evidence of strong alignment to human uncertainty, even despite the lack of alignment to human answer preference. For those successful metrics, we find moderate to strong evidence of model calibration in terms of both correctness correlation and distributional analysis.

### Steering the CensorShip: Uncovering Representation Vectors for LLM   "Thought" Control
**Authors**: Hannah Cyberey, David Evans

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:20:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we access information. These models are often tuned to refuse to comply with requests that are considered harmful and to produce responses that better align with the preferences of those who control the models. To understand how this "censorship" works. We use representation engineering techniques to study open-weights safety-tuned models. We present a method for finding a refusal--compliance vector that detects and controls the level of censorship in model outputs. We also analyze recent reasoning LLMs, distilled from DeepSeek-R1, and uncover an additional dimension of censorship through "thought suppression". We show a similar approach can be used to find a vector that suppresses the model's reasoning process, allowing us to remove censorship by applying the negative multiples of this vector. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/hannahxchen/llm-censorship-steering

### Street-Level AI: Are Large Language Models Ready for Real-World   Judgments?
**Authors**: Gaurab Pokharel, Shafkat Farabi, Patrick J. Fowler, Sanmay Das

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:12:55Z

**Summary**: A surge of recent work explores the ethical and societal implications of large-scale AI models that make "moral" judgments. Much of this literature focuses either on alignment with human judgments through various thought experiments or on the group fairness implications of AI judgments. However, the most immediate and likely use of AI is to help or fully replace the so-called street-level bureaucrats, the individuals deciding to allocate scarce social resources or approve benefits. There is a rich history underlying how principles of local justice determine how society decides on prioritization mechanisms in such domains. In this paper, we examine how well LLM judgments align with human judgments, as well as with socially and politically determined vulnerability scoring systems currently used in the domain of homelessness resource allocation. Crucially, we use real data on those needing services (maintaining strict confidentiality by only using local large models) to perform our analyses. We find that LLM prioritizations are extremely inconsistent in several ways: internally on different runs, between different LLMs, and between LLMs and the vulnerability scoring systems. At the same time, LLMs demonstrate qualitative consistency with lay human judgments in pairwise testing. Findings call into question the readiness of current generation AI systems for naive integration in high-stakes societal decision-making.

### Reinforcement Learning in Vision: A Survey
**Authors**: Weijia Wu, Chen Gao, Joya Chen, Kevin Qinghong Lin, Qingwei Meng, Yiming Zhang, Yuke Qiu, Hong Zhou, Mike Zheng Shou

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:08:55Z

**Summary**: Recent advances at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and visual intelligence have enabled agents that not only perceive complex visual scenes but also reason, generate, and act within them. This survey offers a critical and up-to-date synthesis of the field. We first formalize visual RL problems and trace the evolution of policy-optimization strategies from RLHF to verifiable reward paradigms, and from Proximal Policy Optimization to Group Relative Policy Optimization. We then organize more than 200 representative works into four thematic pillars: multi-modal large language models, visual generation, unified model frameworks, and vision-language-action models. For each pillar we examine algorithmic design, reward engineering, benchmark progress, and we distill trends such as curriculum-driven training, preference-aligned diffusion, and unified reward modeling. Finally, we review evaluation protocols spanning set-level fidelity, sample-level preference, and state-level stability, and we identify open challenges that include sample efficiency, generalization, and safe deployment. Our goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a coherent map of the rapidly expanding landscape of visual RL and to highlight promising directions for future inquiry.

### KARMA: Efficient Structural Defect Segmentation via Kolmogorov-Arnold   Representation Learning
**Authors**: Md Meftahul Ferdaus, Mahdi Abdelguerfi, Elias Ioup, Steven Sloan, Kendall N. Niles, Ken Pathak

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T17:06:55Z

**Summary**: Semantic segmentation of structural defects in civil infrastructure remains challenging due to variable defect appearances, harsh imaging conditions, and significant class imbalance. Current deep learning methods, despite their effectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them impractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA (Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient semantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through compositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional convolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a parameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging low-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized feature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect analysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature representation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark infrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive or superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while using significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction). Operating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for real-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection systems without compromising accuracy.

### How Post-Training Reshapes LLMs: A Mechanistic View on Knowledge,   Truthfulness, Refusal, and Confidence
**Authors**: Hongzhe Du, Weikai Li, Min Cai, Karim Saraipour, Zimin Zhang, Himabindu Lakkaraju, Yizhou Sun, Shichang Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:54:01Z

**Summary**: Post-training is essential for the success of large language models (LLMs), transforming pre-trained base models into more useful and aligned post-trained models. While plenty of works have studied post-training algorithms and evaluated post-training models by their outputs, it remains understudied how post-training reshapes LLMs internally. In this paper, we compare base and post-trained LLMs mechanistically from four perspectives to better understand post-training effects. Our findings across model families and datasets reveal that: (1) Post-training does not change the factual knowledge storage locations, and it adapts knowledge representations from the base model while developing new knowledge representations; (2) Both truthfulness and refusal can be represented by vectors in the hidden representation space. The truthfulness direction is highly similar between the base and post-trained model, and it is effectively transferable for interventions; (3) The refusal direction is different between the base and post-trained models, and it shows limited forward transferability; (4) Differences in confidence between the base and post-trained models cannot be attributed to entropy neurons. Our study provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms preserved and altered during post-training, facilitates downstream tasks like model steering, and could potentially benefit future research in interpretability and LLM post-training. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HZD01/post-training-mechanistic-analysis.

### PyVeritas: On Verifying Python via LLM-Based Transpilation and Bounded   Model Checking for C
**Authors**: Pedro Orvalho, Marta Kwiatkowska

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:49:07Z

**Summary**: Python has become the dominant language for general-purpose programming, yet it lacks robust tools for formal verification. In contrast, programmers working in languages such as C benefit from mature model checkers, for example CBMC, which enable exhaustive symbolic reasoning and fault localisation. The inherent complexity of Python, coupled with the verbosity and low-level nature of existing transpilers (e.g., Cython), have historically limited the applicability of formal verification to Python programs.   In this paper, we propose PyVeritas, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for high-level transpilation from Python to C, followed by bounded model checking and MaxSAT-based fault localisation in the generated C code. PyVeritas enables verification and bug localisation for Python code using existing model checking tools for C. Our empirical evaluation on two Python benchmarks demonstrates that LLM-based transpilation can achieve a high degree of accuracy, up to 80--90% for some LLMs, enabling effective development environment that supports assertion-based verification and interpretable fault diagnosis for small yet non-trivial Python programs.

### TextQuests: How Good are LLMs at Text-Based Video Games?
**Authors**: Long Phan, Mantas Mazeika, Andy Zou, Dan Hendrycks

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:46:08Z

**Summary**: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

### REX-RAG: Reasoning Exploration with Policy Correction in   Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Wentao Jiang, Xiang Feng, Zengmao Wang, Yong Luo, Pingbo Xu, Zhe Chen, Bo Du, Jing Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T03:54:24Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a powerful paradigm for enabling large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning tasks. Recent advances indicate that integrating RL with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows LLMs to dynamically incorporate external knowledge, leading to more informed and robust decision making. However, we identify a critical challenge during policy-driven trajectory sampling: LLMs are frequently trapped in unproductive reasoning paths, which we refer to as "dead ends", committing to overconfident yet incorrect conclusions. This severely hampers exploration and undermines effective policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose REX-RAG (Reasoning Exploration with Policy Correction in Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a novel framework that explores alternative reasoning paths while maintaining rigorous policy learning through principled distributional corrections. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) Mixed Sampling Strategy, which combines a novel probe sampling method with exploratory prompts to escape dead ends; and (2) Policy Correction Mechanism, which employs importance sampling to correct distribution shifts induced by mixed sampling, thereby mitigating gradient estimation bias. We evaluate it on seven question-answering benchmarks, and the experimental results show that REX-RAG achieves average performance gains of 5.1% on Qwen2.5-3B and 3.6% on Qwen2.5-7B over strong baselines, demonstrating competitive results across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/REX-RAG.

### CLAIR-A: Leveraging Large Language Models to Judge Audio Captions
**Authors**: Tsung-Han Wu, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Trevor Darrell, David M. Chan

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:25:08Z

**Summary**: The Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) task asks models to generate natural language descriptions of an audio input. Evaluating these machine-generated audio captions is a complex task that requires considering diverse factors, among them, auditory scene understanding, sound-object inference, temporal coherence, and the environmental context of the scene. While current methods focus on specific aspects, they often fail to provide an overall score that aligns well with human judgment. In this work, we propose CLAIR-A, a simple and flexible method that leverages the zero-shot capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate candidate audio captions by directly asking LLMs for a semantic distance score. In our evaluations, CLAIR-A better predicts human judgements of quality compared to traditional metrics, with a 5.8% relative accuracy improvement compared to the domain-specific FENSE metric and up to 11% over the best general-purpose measure on the Clotho-Eval dataset. Moreover, CLAIR-A offers more transparency by allowing the language model to explain the reasoning behind its scores, with these explanations rated up to 30% better by human evaluators than those provided by baseline methods. CLAIR-A is made publicly available at https://github.com/DavidMChan/clair-a.

**Authors**: Reza Yousefi Maragheh, Pratheek Vadla, Priyank Gupta, Kai Zhao, Aysenur Inan, Kehui Yao, Jianpeng Xu, Praveen Kanumala, Jason Cho, Sushant Kumar

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:24:36Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing recommendation systems by incorporating external context into large language model prompts. However, existing RAG-based approaches often rely on static retrieval heuristics and fail to capture nuanced user preferences in dynamic recommendation scenarios. In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which integrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To better understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG leverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that summarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural Language Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between candidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent that summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that generates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate ARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG significantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5. We also, conduct an ablation study to analyse the effect by different components of ARAG. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating agentic reasoning into retrieval-augmented recommendation and provide new directions for LLM-based personalization.

### From Natural Language to Solver-Ready Power System Optimization: An   LLM-Assisted, Validation-in-the-Loop Framework
**Authors**: Yunkai Hu, Tianqiao Zhao, Meng Yue

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:22:57Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted agent that automatically converts natural-language descriptions of power system optimization scenarios into compact, solver-ready formulations and generates corresponding solutions. In contrast to approaches that rely solely on LLM to produce solutions directly, the proposed method focuses on discovering a mathematically compatible formulation that can be efficiently solved by off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Directly using LLMs to produce solutions often leads to infeasible or suboptimal results, as these models lack the numerical precision and constraint-handling capabilities of established optimization solvers. The pipeline integrates a domain-aware prompt and schema with an LLM, enforces feasibility through systematic validation and iterative repair, and returns both solver-ready models and user-facing results. Using the unit commitment problem as a representative case study, the agent produces optimal or near-optimal schedules along with the associated objective costs. Results demonstrate that coupling the solver with task-specific validation significantly enhances solution reliability. This work shows that combining AI with established optimization frameworks bridges high-level problem descriptions and executable mathematical models, enabling more efficient decision-making in energy systems

### COMponent-Aware Pruning for Accelerated Control Tasks in Latent Space   Models
**Authors**: Ganesh Sundaram, Jonas Ulmen, Amjad Haider, Daniel Görges

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:16:51Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of resource-constrained mobile platforms, including mobile robots, wearable systems, and Internet-of-Things devices, has increased the demand for computationally efficient neural network controllers (NNCs) that can operate within strict hardware limitations. While deep neural networks (DNNs) demonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial computational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers to practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive model compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a balance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is rigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC), a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a systematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties, specifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in providing a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of model compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental validation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model complexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability characteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary for safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine the maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability properties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in resource-limited environments.

### Data-Efficient Biomedical In-Context Learning: A Diversity-Enhanced   Submodular Perspective
**Authors**: Jun Wang, Zaifu Zhan, Qixin Zhang, Mingquan Lin, Meijia Song, Rui Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:13:21Z

**Summary**: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has leveraged their in-context learning (ICL) abilities to enable quick adaptation to unseen biomedical NLP tasks. By incorporating only a few input-output examples into prompts, LLMs can rapidly perform these new tasks. While the impact of these demonstrations on LLM performance has been extensively studied, most existing approaches prioritize representativeness over diversity when selecting examples from large corpora. To address this gap, we propose Dual-Div, a diversity-enhanced data-efficient framework for demonstration selection in biomedical ICL. Dual-Div employs a two-stage retrieval and ranking process: First, it identifies a limited set of candidate examples from a corpus by optimizing both representativeness and diversity (with optional annotation for unlabeled data). Second, it ranks these candidates against test queries to select the most relevant and non-redundant demonstrations. Evaluated on three biomedical NLP tasks (named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE), and text classification (TC)) using LLaMA 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 for inference, along with three retrievers (BGE-Large, BMRetriever, MedCPT), Dual-Div consistently outperforms baselines-achieving up to 5% higher macro-F1 scores-while demonstrating robustness to prompt permutations and class imbalance. Our findings establish that diversity in initial retrieval is more critical than ranking-stage optimization, and limiting demonstrations to 3-5 examples maximizes performance efficiency.

### Can LLMs Detect Their Confabulations? Estimating Reliability in   Uncertainty-Aware Language Models
**Authors**: Tianyi Zhou, Johanne Medina, Sanjay Chawla

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:12:36Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent but incorrect content, known as confabulation, which poses increasing risks in multi-turn or agentic applications where outputs may be reused as context. In this work, we investigate how in-context information influences model behavior and whether LLMs can identify their unreliable responses. We propose a reliability estimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of internal model representations. Specifically, we compute aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and aggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level reliability prediction. Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks, we find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and model confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect responses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness. Our probing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the detection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. These results underscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the potential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation.

### MuaLLM: A Multimodal Large Language Model Agent for Circuit Design   Assistance with Hybrid Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Pravallika Abbineni, Saoud Aldowaish, Colin Liechty, Soroosh Noorzad, Ali Ghazizadeh, Morteza Fayazi

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:11:09Z

**Summary**: Conducting a comprehensive literature review is crucial for advancing circuit design methodologies. However, the rapid influx of state-of-the-art research, inconsistent data representation, and the complexity of optimizing circuit design objectives make this task significantly challenging. In this paper, we propose MuaLLM, an open-source multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) agent for circuit design assistance that integrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with an adaptive vector database of circuit design research papers. Unlike conventional LLMs, the MuaLLM agent employs a Reason + Act (ReAct) workflow for iterative reasoning, goal-setting, and multi-step information retrieval. It functions as a question-answering design assistant, capable of interpreting complex queries and providing reasoned responses grounded in circuit literature. Its multimodal capabilities enable processing of both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive analysis. The system dynamically adapts using intelligent search tools, automated document retrieval from the internet, and real-time database updates. Unlike conventional approaches constrained by model context limits, MuaLLM decouples retrieval from inference, enabling scalable reasoning over arbitrarily large corpora. At the maximum context length supported by standard LLMs, MuaLLM remains up to 10x less costly and 1.6x faster while maintaining the same accuracy. This allows rapid, no-human-in-the-loop database generation, overcoming the bottleneck of simulation-based dataset creation for circuits. To evaluate MuaLLM, we introduce two custom datasets: RAG-250, targeting retrieval and citation performance, and Reasoning-100 (Reas-100), focused on multistep reasoning in circuit design. MuaLLM achieves 90.1% recall on RAG-250, and 86.8% accuracy on Reas-100.

### MathSmith: Towards Extremely Hard Mathematical Reasoning by Forging   Synthetic Problems with a Reinforced Policy
**Authors**: Shaoxiong Zhan, Yanlin Lai, Ziyu Lu, Dahua Lin, Ziqing Yang, Fei Tan

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:10:56Z

**Summary**: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality, high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability. We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity, encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks, categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025, OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts. Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

### Optimal Transport Regularization for Speech Text Alignment in Spoken   Language Models
**Authors**: Wenze Xu, Chun Wang, Jiazhen Yu, Sheng Chen, Liang Gao, Weihong Deng

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:06:04Z

**Summary**: Spoken Language Models (SLMs), which extend Large Language Models (LLMs) to perceive speech inputs, have gained increasing attention for their potential to advance speech understanding tasks. However, despite recent progress, studies show that SLMs often struggle to generalize across datasets, even for trained languages and tasks, raising concerns about whether they process speech in a text-like manner as intended. A key challenge underlying this limitation is the modality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in speech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by exploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization. To mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization (OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport problem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each training iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between speech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan, then incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to optimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with transcript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or learnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training procedures. Extensive multilingual ASR experiments demonstrate that OTReg enhances speech-text alignment, mitigates the modality gap, and consequently improves SLM generalization across diverse datasets.

### BlindGuard: Safeguarding LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems under Unknown   Attacks
**Authors**: Rui Miao, Yixin Liu, Yili Wang, Xu Shen, Yue Tan, Yiwei Dai, Shirui Pan, Xin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:04:47Z

**Summary**: The security of LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) is critically threatened by propagation vulnerability, where malicious agents can distort collective decision-making through inter-agent message interactions. While existing supervised defense methods demonstrate promising performance, they may be impractical in real-world scenarios due to their heavy reliance on labeled malicious agents to train a supervised malicious detection model. To enable practical and generalizable MAS defenses, in this paper, we propose BlindGuard, an unsupervised defense method that learns without requiring any attack-specific labels or prior knowledge of malicious behaviors. To this end, we establish a hierarchical agent encoder to capture individual, neighborhood, and global interaction patterns of each agent, providing a comprehensive understanding for malicious agent detection. Meanwhile, we design a corruption-guided detector that consists of directional noise injection and contrastive learning, allowing effective detection model training solely on normal agent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that BlindGuard effectively detects diverse attack types (i.e., prompt injection, memory poisoning, and tool attack) across MAS with various communication patterns while maintaining superior generalizability compared to supervised baselines. The code is available at: https://github.com/MR9812/BlindGuard.

### NeuroDx-LM: A Clinical Large-Scale Model for EEG-based Neurological   Disorder Detection
**Authors**: Guanghao Jin, Yuan Liang, Yihan Ma, Jingpei Wu, Guoyang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T16:02:25Z

**Summary**: Large-scale models pre-trained on Electroencephalography (EEG) have shown promise in clinical applications such as neurological disorder detection. However, the practical deployment of EEG-based large-scale models faces critical challenges such as limited labeled EEG data and suboptimal performance in clinical scenarios. To address these issues, we propose NeuroDx-LM, a novel large-scale model specifically designed for detecting EEG-based neurological disorders. Our key contributions include (i) a Selective Temporal-Frequency Embedding mechanism that adaptively captures complex temporal and spectral patterns in EEG signals; and (ii) a Progressive Feature-Aware Training strategy that refines feature representation in a two-stage process. In the first stage, our model learns the fundamental discriminative features of EEG activities; in the second stage, the model further extracts more specialized fine-grained features for accurate diagnostic performance. We evaluated NeuroDx-LM on the CHB-MIT and Schizophrenia datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in EEG-based seizure and schizophrenia detection, respectively. These results demonstrate the great potential of EEG-based large-scale models to advance clinical applicability. Our code is available at https://github.com/LetItBe12345/NeuroDx-LM.

**Summary**: Indoor navigation remains a complex challenge due to the absence of reliable GPS signals and the architectural intricacies of large enclosed environments. This study presents an indoor localization and navigation approach that integrates vision-based localization with large language model (LLM)-based navigation. The localization system utilizes a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network fine-tuned through a two-stage process to identify the user's position using smartphone camera input. To complement localization, the navigation module employs an LLM, guided by a carefully crafted system prompt, to interpret preprocessed floor plan images and generate step-by-step directions. Experimental evaluation was conducted in a realistic office corridor with repetitive features and limited visibility to test localization robustness. The model achieved high confidence and an accuracy of 96% across all tested waypoints, even under constrained viewing conditions and short-duration queries. Navigation tests using ChatGPT on real building floor maps yielded an average instruction accuracy of 75%, with observed limitations in zero-shot reasoning and inference time. This research demonstrates the potential for scalable, infrastructure-free indoor navigation using off-the-shelf cameras and publicly available floor plans, particularly in resource-constrained settings like hospitals, airports, and educational institutions.

### AI-AI Bias: large language models favor communications generated by   large language models
**Authors**: Walter Laurito, Benjamin Davis, Peli Grietzer, Tomáš Gavenčiak, Ada Böhm, Jan Kulveit

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:57:40Z

**Summary**: Are large language models (LLMs) biased in favor of communications produced by LLMs, leading to possible antihuman discrimination? Using a classical experimental design inspired by employment discrimination studies, we tested widely used LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and a selection of recent open-weight models in binary choice scenarios. These involved LLM-based assistants selecting between goods (the goods we study include consumer products, academic papers, and film-viewings) described either by humans or LLMs. Our results show a consistent tendency for LLM-based AIs to prefer LLM-presented options. This suggests the possibility of future AI systems implicitly discriminating against humans as a class, giving AI agents and AI-assisted humans an unfair advantage.

### TeamMedAgents: Enhancing Medical Decision-Making of LLMs Through   Structured Teamwork
**Authors**: Pranav Pushkar Mishra, Mohammad Arvan, Mohan Zalake

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:55:06Z

**Summary**: We present TeamMedAgents, a novel multi-agent approach that systematically integrates evidence-based teamwork components from human-human collaboration into medical decision-making with large language models (LLMs). Our approach validates an organizational psychology teamwork model from human collaboration to computational multi-agent medical systems by operationalizing six core teamwork components derived from Salas et al.'s "Big Five" model: team leadership, mutual performance monitoring, team orientation, shared mental models, closed-loop communication, and mutual trust. We implement and evaluate these components as modular, configurable mechanisms within an adaptive collaboration architecture while assessing the effect of the number of agents involved based on the task's requirements and domain. Systematic evaluation of computational implementations of teamwork behaviors across eight medical benchmarks (MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU-Pro Medical, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets, Path-VQA, and PMC-VQA) demonstrates consistent improvements across 7 out of 8 evaluated datasets. Controlled ablation studies conducted on 50 questions per configuration across 3 independent runs provide mechanistic insights into individual component contributions, revealing optimal teamwork configurations that vary by reasoning task complexity and domain-specific requirements. Our ablation analyses reveal dataset-specific optimal teamwork configurations, indicating that different medical reasoning modalities benefit from distinct collaborative patterns. TeamMedAgents represents an advancement in collaborative AI by providing a systematic translation of established teamwork theories from human collaboration into agentic collaboration, establishing a foundation for evidence-based multi-agent system design in critical decision-making domains.

### A Frame for Communication Control
**Authors**: Aernout Schmidt, Kunbei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:49:02Z

**Summary**: We are experiencing the rise of ChatGPT-like systems or LLMs in political turbulent times. We assume the need to regulate their use because of their bubble-shaping and polarizing potential. To regulate, we need a language that allows interests and compromises to be discussed. In this context, we can think of such a shared language as a jargon, a specialized vocabulary for law-making. To the extent that such a jargon exists, it is now being corrupted by LLMs. This situation appears paradoxical. The issue includes persistent communication failures, between disciplines that cannot translate their technical vocabulary into accessible terms, and between political movements that operate in incompatible worldviews. We show that a frame integrating four specialist languages, those of governance, economy, community and science, is able to address these failures case-wise, which we consider helpful. However, for reasons noted, we cannot create the more generic jargon needed on our own. We conclude that our frame provides the knowledge to design and apply RAG-LLM architectures for researching their jargon generating potential in a future project. We show its feasibility in the appendix.

### ChatGPT on the Road: Leveraging Large Language Model-Powered In-vehicle   Conversational Agents for Safer and More Enjoyable Driving Experience
**Authors**: Yeana Lee Bond, Mungyeong Choe, Baker Kasim Hasan, Arsh Siddiqui, Myounghoon Jeon

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:40:44Z

**Summary**: Studies on in-vehicle conversational agents have traditionally relied on pre-scripted prompts or limited voice commands, constraining natural driver-agent interaction. To resolve this issue, the present study explored the potential of a ChatGPT-based in-vehicle agent capable of carrying continuous, multi-turn dialogues. Forty drivers participated in our experiment using a motion-based driving simulator, comparing three conditions (No agent, Pre-scripted agent, and ChatGPT-based agent) as a within-subjects variable. Results showed that the ChatGPT-based agent condition led to more stable driving performance across multiple metrics. Participants demonstrated lower variability in longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, and lane deviation compared to the other two conditions. In subjective evaluations, the ChatGPT-based agent also received significantly higher ratings in competence, animacy, affective trust, and preference compared to the Pre-scripted agent. Our thematic analysis of driver-agent conversations revealed diverse interaction patterns in topics, including driving assistance/questions, entertainment requests, and anthropomorphic interactions. Our results highlight the potential of LLM-powered in-vehicle conversational agents to enhance driving safety and user experience through natural, context-rich interactions.

### Decoupled Global-Local Alignment for Improving Compositional   Understanding
**Authors**: Xiaoxing Hu, Kaicheng Yang, Jun Wang, Haoran Xu, Ziyong Feng, Yupei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:35:42Z

**Summary**: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved success on multiple downstream tasks by aligning image and text modalities. However, the nature of global contrastive learning limits CLIP's ability to comprehend compositional concepts, such as relations and attributes. Although recent studies employ global hard negative samples to improve compositional understanding, these methods significantly compromise the model's inherent general capabilities by forcibly distancing textual negative samples from images in the embedding space. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Decoupled Global-Local Alignment (DeGLA) framework that improves compositional understanding while substantially mitigating losses in general capabilities. To optimize the retention of the model's inherent capabilities, we incorporate a self-distillation mechanism within the global alignment process, aligning the learnable image-text encoder with a frozen teacher model derived from an exponential moving average. Under the constraint of self-distillation, it effectively mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge during fine-tuning. To improve compositional understanding, we first leverage the in-context learning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct about 2M high-quality negative captions across five types. Subsequently, we propose the Image-Grounded Contrast (IGC) loss and Text-Grounded Contrast (TGC) loss to enhance vision-language compositionally. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DeGLA framework. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, DeGLA achieves an average enhancement of 3.5% across the VALSE, SugarCrepe, and ARO benchmarks. Concurrently, it obtains an average performance improvement of 13.0% on zero-shot classification tasks across eleven datasets. Our code will be released at https://github.com/xiaoxing2001/DeGLA

### Assessing LLM Text Detection in Educational Contexts: Does Human   Contribution Affect Detection?
**Authors**: Lukas Gehring, Benjamin Paaßen

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:34:49Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their increased accessibility have made it easier than ever for students to automatically generate texts, posing new challenges for educational institutions. To enforce norms of academic integrity and ensure students' learning, learning analytics methods to automatically detect LLM-generated text appear increasingly appealing. This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art detectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called Generative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900 student-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various domains. To capture the diversity of LLM usage practices in generating text, we propose the concept of contribution levels, representing students' contribution to a given assignment. These levels range from purely human-written texts, to slightly LLM-improved versions, to fully LLM-generated texts, and finally to active attacks on the detector by "humanizing" generated texts. We show that most detectors struggle to accurately classify texts of intermediate student contribution levels, like LLM-improved human-written texts. Detectors are particularly likely to produce false positives, which is problematic in educational settings where false suspicions can severely impact students' lives. Our dataset, code, and additional supplementary materials are publicly available at https://github.com/lukasgehring/Assessing-LLM-Text-Detection-in-Educational-Contexts.

### Dual Information Speech Language Models for Emotional Conversations
**Authors**: Chun Wang, Chenyang Liu, Wenze Xu, Weihong Deng

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:33:44Z

**Summary**: Conversational systems relying on text-based large language models (LLMs) often overlook paralinguistic cues, essential for understanding emotions and intentions. Speech-language models (SLMs), which use speech as input, are emerging as a promising solution. However, SLMs built by extending frozen LLMs struggle to capture paralinguistic information and exhibit reduced context understanding. We identify entangled information and improper training strategies as key issues. To address these issues, we propose two heterogeneous adapters and suggest a weakly supervised training strategy. Our approach disentangles paralinguistic and linguistic information, enabling SLMs to interpret speech through structured representations. It also preserves contextual understanding by avoiding the generation of task-specific vectors through controlled randomness. This approach trains only the adapters on common datasets, ensuring parameter and data efficiency. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance in emotional conversation tasks, showcasing the model's ability to effectively integrate both paralinguistic and linguistic information within contextual settings.

### DanceChat: Large Language Model-Guided Music-to-Dance Generation
**Authors**: Qing Wang, Xiaohang Yang, Yilan Dong, Naveen Raj Govindaraj, Gregory Slabaugh, Shanxin Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:10:59Z

**Summary**: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit, high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm, and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

### Reviewing Clinical Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models: Training   and Beyond
**Authors**: Qiyuan Li, Haijiang Liu, Caicai Guo, Chao Gao, Deyu Chen, Meng Wang, Feng Gao, Frank van Harmelen, Jinguang Gu

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T15:03:23Z

**Summary**: The large-scale development of large language models (LLMs) in medical contexts, such as diagnostic assistance and treatment recommendations, necessitates that these models possess accurate medical knowledge and deliver traceable decision-making processes. Clinical knowledge, encompassing the insights gained from research on the causes, prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases, has been extensively examined within real-world medical practices. Recently, there has been a notable increase in research efforts aimed at integrating this type of knowledge into LLMs, encompassing not only traditional text and multimodal data integration but also technologies such as knowledge graphs (KGs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we review the various initiatives to embed clinical knowledge into training-based, KG-supported, and RAG-assisted LLMs. We begin by gathering reliable knowledge sources from the medical domain, including databases and datasets. Next, we evaluate implementations for integrating clinical knowledge through specialized datasets and collaborations with external knowledge sources such as KGs and relevant documentation. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of the developed medical LLMs in the industrial sector to assess the disparity between models developed in academic settings and those in industry. We conclude the survey by presenting evaluation systems applicable to relevant tasks and identifying potential challenges facing this field. In this review, we do not aim for completeness, since any ostensibly complete review would soon be outdated. Our goal is to illustrate diversity by selecting representative and accessible items from current research and industry practices, reflecting real-world situations rather than claiming completeness. Thus, we emphasize showcasing diverse approaches.

### AdaptFlow: Adaptive Workflow Optimization via Meta-Learning
**Authors**: Runchuan Zhu, Bowen Jiang, Lingrui Mei, Fangkai Yang, Lu Wang, Haoxiang Gao, Fengshuo Bai, Pu Zhao, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:52:59Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in agentic workflows, which are structured sequences of LLM invocations intended to solve complex tasks. However, existing approaches often rely on static templates or manually designed workflows, which limit adaptability to diverse tasks and hinder scalability. We propose AdaptFlow, a natural language-based meta-learning framework inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). AdaptFlow learns a generalizable workflow initialization that enables rapid subtask-level adaptation. It employs a bi-level optimization scheme: the inner loop refines the workflow for a specific subtask using LLM-generated feedback, while the outer loop updates the shared initialization to perform well across tasks. This setup allows AdaptFlow to generalize effectively to unseen tasks by adapting the initialized workflow through language-guided modifications. Evaluated across question answering, code generation, and mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AdaptFlow consistently outperforms both manually crafted and automatically searched baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results with strong generalization across tasks and models. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/microsoft/DKI_LLM/tree/AdaptFlow/AdaptFlow.

### BadPromptFL: A Novel Backdoor Threat to Prompt-based Federated Learning   in Multimodal Models
**Authors**: Maozhen Zhang, Mengnan Zhao, Bo Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:42:44Z

**Summary**: Prompt-based tuning has emerged as a lightweight alternative to full fine-tuning in large vision-language models, enabling efficient adaptation via learned contextual prompts. This paradigm has recently been extended to federated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively train prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning remain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In BadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation process. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling universal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters. Leveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures, BadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \(>90\%\)) with minimal visibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness, stealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.

### Fairness through Difference Awareness: Measuring Desired Group   Discrimination in LLMs
**Authors**: Angelina Wang, Michelle Phan, Daniel E. Ho, Sanmi Koyejo

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:37:48Z

**Summary**: Algorithmic fairness has conventionally adopted the mathematically convenient perspective of racial color-blindness (i.e., difference unaware treatment). However, we contend that in a range of important settings, group difference awareness matters. For example, differentiating between groups may be necessary in legal contexts (e.g., the U.S. compulsory draft applies to men but not women) and harm assessments (e.g., referring to girls as ``terrorists'' may be less harmful than referring to Muslim people as such). Thus, in contrast to most fairness work, we study fairness through the perspective of treating people differently -- when it is contextually appropriate to. We first introduce an important distinction between descriptive (fact-based), normative (value-based), and correlation (association-based) benchmarks. This distinction is significant because each category requires separate interpretation and mitigation tailored to its specific characteristics. Then, we present a benchmark suite composed of eight different scenarios for a total of 16k questions that enables us to assess difference awareness. Finally, we show results across ten models that demonstrate difference awareness is a distinct dimension to fairness where existing bias mitigation strategies may backfire.

### Deep Learning-Based Analysis of Power Consumption in Gasoline, Electric,   and Hybrid Vehicles
**Authors**: Roksana Yahyaabadi, Ghazal Farhani, Taufiq Rahman, Soodeh Nikan, Abdullah Jirjees, Fadi Araji

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:37:40Z

**Summary**: Accurate power consumption prediction is crucial for improving efficiency and reducing environmental impact, yet traditional methods relying on specialized instruments or rigid physical models are impractical for large-scale, real-world deployment. This study introduces a scalable data-driven method using powertrain dynamic feature sets and both traditional machine learning and deep neural networks to estimate instantaneous and cumulative power consumption in internal combustion engine (ICE), electric vehicle (EV), and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) platforms. ICE models achieved high instantaneous accuracy with mean absolute error and root mean squared error on the order of $10^{-3}$, and cumulative errors under 3%. Transformer and long short-term memory models performed best for EVs and HEVs, with cumulative errors below 4.1% and 2.1%, respectively. Results confirm the approach's effectiveness across vehicles and models. Uncertainty analysis revealed greater variability in EV and HEV datasets than ICE, due to complex power management, emphasizing the need for robust models for advanced powertrains.

### IPBA: Imperceptible Perturbation Backdoor Attack in Federated   Self-Supervised Learning
**Authors**: Jiayao Wang, Yang Song, Zhendong Zhao, Jiale Zhang, Qilin Wu, Junwu Zhu, Dongfang Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:36:11Z

**Summary**: Federated self-supervised learning (FSSL) combines the advantages of decentralized modeling and unlabeled representation learning, serving as a cutting-edge paradigm with strong potential for scalability and privacy preservation. Although FSSL has garnered increasing attention, research indicates that it remains vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing methods generally rely on visually obvious triggers, which makes it difficult to meet the requirements for stealth and practicality in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose an imperceptible and effective backdoor attack method against FSSL, called IPBA. Our empirical study reveals that existing imperceptible triggers face a series of challenges in FSSL, particularly limited transferability, feature entanglement with augmented samples, and out-of-distribution properties. These issues collectively undermine the effectiveness and stealthiness of traditional backdoor attacks in FSSL. To overcome these challenges, IPBA decouples the feature distributions of backdoor and augmented samples, and introduces Sliced-Wasserstein distance to mitigate the out-of-distribution properties of backdoor samples, thereby optimizing the trigger generation process. Our experimental results on several FSSL scenarios and datasets show that IPBA significantly outperforms existing backdoor attack methods in performance and exhibits strong robustness under various defense mechanisms.

### Robust Anomaly Detection in O-RAN: Leveraging LLMs against Data   Manipulation Attacks
**Authors**: Thusitha Dayaratne, Ngoc Duy Pham, Viet Vo, Shangqi Lai, Sharif Abuadbba, Hajime Suzuki, Xingliang Yuan, Carsten Rudolph

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:32:43Z

**Summary**: The introduction of 5G and the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture has enabled more flexible and intelligent network deployments. However, the increased complexity and openness of these architectures also introduce novel security challenges, such as data manipulation attacks on the semi-standardised Shared Data Layer (SDL) within the O-RAN platform through malicious xApps. In particular, malicious xApps can exploit this vulnerability by introducing subtle Unicode-wise alterations (hypoglyphs) into the data that are being used by traditional machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection methods. These Unicode-wise manipulations can potentially bypass detection and cause failures in anomaly detection systems based on traditional ML, such as AutoEncoders, which are unable to process hypoglyphed data without crashing. We investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection within the O-RAN architecture to address this challenge. We demonstrate that LLM-based xApps maintain robust operational performance and are capable of processing manipulated messages without crashing. While initial detection accuracy requires further improvements, our results highlight the robustness of LLMs to adversarial attacks such as hypoglyphs in input data. There is potential to use their adaptability through prompt engineering to further improve the accuracy, although this requires further research. Additionally, we show that LLMs achieve low detection latency (under 0.07 seconds), making them suitable for Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RIC deployments.

### Toward Intelligent and Secure Cloud: Large Language Model Empowered   Proactive Defense
**Authors**: Yuyang Zhou, Guang Cheng, Kang Du, Zihan Chen, Yuyu Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:32:01Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of cloud computing technologies and the increasing number of cloud applications have provided numerous benefits in our daily lives. However, the diversity and complexity of different components pose a significant challenge to cloud security, especially when dealing with sophisticated and advanced cyberattacks such as Denial of Service (DoS). Recent advancements in the large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions for security intelligence. By exploiting the powerful capabilities in language understanding, data analysis, task inference, action planning, and code generation, we present LLM-PD, a novel defense architecture that proactively mitigates various DoS threats in cloud networks. LLM-PD can efficiently make decisions through comprehensive data analysis and sequential reasoning, as well as dynamically create and deploy actionable defense mechanisms. Furthermore, it can flexibly self-evolve based on experience learned from previous interactions and adapt to new attack scenarios without additional training. Our case study on three distinct DoS attacks demonstrates its remarkable ability in terms of defense effectiveness and efficiency when compared with other existing methods.

### Bridging ASR and LLMs for Dysarthric Speech Recognition: Benchmarking   Self-Supervised and Generative Approaches
**Authors**: Ahmed Aboeitta, Ahmed Sharshar, Youssef Nafea, Shady Shehata

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:31:20Z

**Summary**: Speech Recognition (ASR) due to phoneme distortions and high variability. While self-supervised ASR models like Wav2Vec, HuBERT, and Whisper have shown promise, their effectiveness in dysarthric speech remains unclear. This study systematically benchmarks these models with different decoding strategies, including CTC, seq2seq, and LLM-enhanced decoding (BART,GPT-2, Vicuna). Our contributions include (1) benchmarking ASR architectures for dysarthric speech, (2) introducing LLM-based decoding to improve intelligibility, (3) analyzing generalization across datasets, and (4) providing insights into recognition errors across severity levels. Findings highlight that LLM-enhanced decoding improves dysarthric ASR by leveraging linguistic constraints for phoneme restoration and grammatical correction.

### EchoAid: Enhancing Livestream Shopping Accessibility for the DHH   Community
**Authors**: Zeyu Yang, Zheng Wei, Yang Zhang, Xian Xu, Changyang He, Muzhi Zhou, Pan Hui

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:26:36Z

**Summary**: Livestream shopping platforms often overlook the accessibility needs of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community, leading to barriers such as information inaccessibility and overload. To tackle these challenges, we developed \textit{EchoAid}, a mobile app designed to improve the livestream shopping experience for DHH users. \textit{EchoAid} utilizes advanced speech-to-text conversion, Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) technology, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to simplify the complex information flow in live sales environments. We conducted exploratory studies with eight DHH individuals to identify design needs and iteratively developed the \textit{EchoAid} prototype based on feedback from three participants. We then evaluate the performance of this system in a user study workshop involving 38 DHH participants. Our findings demonstrate the successful design and validation process of \textit{EchoAid}, highlighting its potential to enhance product information extraction, leading to reduced cognitive overload and more engaging and customized shopping experiences for DHH users.

### Progressive Depth Up-scaling via Optimal Transport
**Authors**: Mingzi Cao, Xi Wang, Nikolaos Aletras

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:15:33Z

**Summary**: Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) yields performance gains but incurs substantial training costs. Depth up-scaling offers training efficiency by adding new layers to pre-trained models. However, most existing methods copy or average weights from base layers, neglecting neuron permutation differences. This limitation can potentially cause misalignment that harms performance. Inspired by applying Optimal Transport (OT) for neuron alignment, we propose Optimal Transport Depth Up-Scaling (OpT-DeUS). OpT-DeUS aligns and fuses Transformer blocks in adjacent base layers via OT for new layer creation, to mitigate neuron permutation mismatch between layers. OpT-DeUS achieves better overall performance and offers improved training efficiency than existing methods for continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning across different model sizes. To further evaluate the impact of interpolation positions, our extensive analysis shows that inserting new layers closer to the top results in higher training efficiency due to shorter back-propagation time while obtaining additional performance gains.

### RAIR: Retrieval-Augmented Iterative Refinement for Chinese Spelling   Correction
**Authors**: Junhong Liang, Yu Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:10:45Z

**Summary**: Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) aims to detect and correct erroneous tokens in sentences. Traditional CSC focuses on equal length correction and uses pretrained language models (PLMs). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in identifying and rectifying potential errors, they often struggle with adapting to domain-specific corrections, especially when encountering terminologies in specialized domains. To address domain adaptation, we propose a \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{I}terative \textbf{R}efinement (RAIR) framework. Our approach constructs a retrieval corpus adaptively from domain-specific training data and dictionaries, employing a fine-tuned retriever to ensure that the retriever catches the error correction pattern. We also extend equal-length into variable-length correction scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms current approaches in domain spelling correction and significantly improves the performance of LLMs in variable-length scenarios.

### Interpreting Fedspeak with Confidence: A LLM-Based Uncertainty-Aware   Framework Guided by Monetary Policy Transmission Paths
**Authors**: Rui Yao, Qi Chai, Jinhai Yao, Siyuan Li, Junhao Chen, Qi Zhang, Hao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T04:42:34Z

**Summary**: "Fedspeak", the stylized and often nuanced language used by the U.S. Federal Reserve, encodes implicit policy signals and strategic stances. The Federal Open Market Committee strategically employs Fedspeak as a communication tool to shape market expectations and influence both domestic and global economic conditions. As such, automatically parsing and interpreting Fedspeak presents a high-impact challenge, with significant implications for financial forecasting, algorithmic trading, and data-driven policy analysis. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based, uncertainty-aware framework for deciphering Fedspeak and classifying its underlying monetary policy stance. Technically, to enrich the semantic and contextual representation of Fedspeak texts, we incorporate domain-specific reasoning grounded in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. We further introduce a dynamic uncertainty decoding module to assess the confidence of model predictions, thereby enhancing both classification accuracy and model reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the policy stance analysis task. Moreover, statistical analysis reveals a significant positive correlation between perceptual uncertainty and model error rates, validating the effectiveness of perceptual uncertainty as a diagnostic signal.

### WideSearch: Benchmarking Agentic Broad Info-Seeking
**Authors**: Ryan Wong, Jiawei Wang, Junjie Zhao, Li Chen, Yan Gao, Long Zhang, Xuan Zhou, Zuo Wang, Kai Xiang, Ge Zhang, Wenhao Huang, Yang Wang, Ke Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T14:03:09Z

**Summary**: From professional research to everyday planning, many tasks are bottlenecked by wide-scale information seeking, which is more repetitive than cognitively complex. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), automated search agents powered by LLMs offer a promising solution to liberate humans from this tedious work. However, the capability of these agents to perform such "wide-context" collection reliably and completely remains largely unevaluated due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce WideSearch, a new benchmark engineered to evaluate agent reliability on these large-scale collection tasks. The benchmark features 200 manually curated questions (100 in English, 100 in Chinese) from over 15 diverse domains, grounded in real user queries. Each task requires agents to collect large-scale atomic information, which could be verified one by one objectively, and arrange it into a well-organized output. A rigorous five-stage quality control pipeline ensures the difficulty, completeness, and verifiability of the dataset. We benchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including single-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most systems achieve overall success rates near 0\%, with the best performer reaching just 5\%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple human testers can achieve a near 100\% success rate. These results demonstrate that present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale information seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and development in agentic search. Our dataset, evaluation pipeline, and benchmark results have been publicly released at https://widesearch-seed.github.io/

### DIVER: A Multi-Stage Approach for Reasoning-intensive Information   Retrieval
**Authors**: Meixiu Long, Duolin Sun, Dan Yang, Junjie Wang, Yue Shen, Jian Wang, Peng Wei, Jinjie Gu, Jiahai Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T13:46:08Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation has achieved strong performance on knowledge-intensive tasks where query-document relevance can be identified through direct lexical or semantic matches. However, many real-world queries involve abstract reasoning, analogical thinking, or multi-step inference, which existing retrievers often struggle to capture. To address this challenge, we present \textbf{DIVER}, a retrieval pipeline tailored for reasoning-intensive information retrieval. DIVER consists of four components: document processing to improve input quality, LLM-driven query expansion via iterative document interaction, a reasoning-enhanced retriever fine-tuned on synthetic multi-domain data with hard negatives, and a pointwise reranker that combines LLM-assigned helpfulness scores with retrieval scores. On the BRIGHT benchmark, DIVER achieves state-of-the-art nDCG@10 scores of 41.6 and 28.9 on original queries, consistently outperforming competitive reasoning-aware models. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning-aware retrieval strategies in complex real-world tasks. Our code and retrieval model will be released soon.

### PersonalAI: A Systematic Comparison of Knowledge Graph Storage and   Retrieval Approaches for Personalized LLM agents
**Authors**: Mikhail Menschikov, Dmitry Evseev, Victoria Dochkina, Ruslan Kostoev, Ilia Perepechkin, Petr Anokhin, Evgeny Burnaev, Nikita Semenov

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T13:41:39Z

**Summary**: Personalizing language models by effectively incorporating user interaction history remains a central challenge in the development of adaptive AI systems. While large language models (LLMs) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have improved factual accuracy, they often lack structured memory and fail to scale in complex, long-term interactions. To address this, we propose a flexible external memory framework based on knowledge graphs, automatically constructed and updated by the LLM itself, and capable of encoding information in multiple formats-including nodes, triplets, higher-order propositions, and episodic traces. Building upon the AriGraph architecture, we introduce a novel hybrid graph design that supports both standard edges and two types of hyperedges, enabling rich and dynamic semantic and temporal representations. Our framework also supports diverse retrieval mechanisms, including A*, water-circle propagation, beam search, and hybrid methods, making it adaptable to different datasets and LLM capacities. We evaluate our system on three benchmarks-TriviaQA, HotpotQA, and DiaASQ-demonstrating that different memory and retrieval configurations yield optimal performance depending on the task. Additionally, we extend the DiaASQ benchmark with temporal annotations and internally contradictory statements, showing that our system remains robust and effective in managing temporal dependencies and context-aware reasoning.

**Authors**: Hamidreza Mazandarani, Mohammad Farhoudi, Masoud Shokrnezhad, Tarik Taleb

**Updated**: 2025-08-12T06:17:10Z

**Summary**: Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) have emerged as key components of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), offering unparalleled expressiveness and controllability for complex data generation tasks. However, their deployment in real-time and mobile environments remains challenging due to the iterative and resource-intensive nature of the inference process. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a unified optimization framework that jointly tackles service placement and multiple access control for GDMs in mobile edge networks. We propose LEARN-GDM, a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based algorithm that dynamically partitions denoising blocks across heterogeneous edge nodes, while accounting for latent transmission costs and enabling adaptive reduction of inference steps. Our approach integrates a greedy multiple access scheme with a Double and Dueling Deep Q-Learning (D3QL)-based service placement, allowing for scalable, adaptable, and resource-efficient operation under stringent quality of service requirements. Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework in terms of scalability and latency resilience compared to conventional monolithic and fixed chain-length placement strategies. This work advances the state of the art in edge-enabled GenAI by offering an adaptable solution for GDM services orchestration, paving the way for future extensions toward semantic networking and co-inference across distributed environments.

### Beyond Ten Turns: Unlocking Long-Horizon Agentic Search with Large-Scale   Asynchronous RL
**Authors**: Jiaxuan Gao, Wei Fu, Minyang Xie, Shusheng Xu, Chuyi He, Zhiyu Mei, Banghua Zhu, Yi Wu

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T13:36:57Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability, efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online RL methods, e.g. <=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements, with 46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 turns and output tokens exceeding 150k during training time. With a simple agent design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 42.1 on xBench and 52.8 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. We open-source our models, training data, and codes in https://github.com/inclusionAI/ASearcher.

### Spotter+GPT: Turning Sign Spottings into Sentences with LLMs
**Authors**: Ozge Mercanoglu Sincan, Richard Bowden

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T13:32:09Z

**Summary**: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that aims to generate spoken language sentences from sign language videos. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight, modular SLT framework, Spotter+GPT, that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and avoids heavy end-to-end training. Spotter+GPT breaks down the SLT task into two distinct stages. First, a sign spotter identifies individual signs within the input video. The spotted signs are then passed to an LLM, which transforms them into meaningful spoken language sentences. Spotter+GPT eliminates the requirement for SLT-specific training. This significantly reduces computational costs and time requirements. The source code and pretrained weights of the Spotter are available at https://gitlab.surrey.ac.uk/cogvispublic/sign-spotter.

### Exploring the Challenges and Opportunities of AI-assisted Codebase   Generation
**Authors**: Philipp Eibl, Sadra Sabouri, Souti Chattopadhyay

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T13:26:48Z

**Summary**: Recent AI code assistants have significantly improved their ability to process more complex contexts and generate entire codebases based on a textual description, compared to the popular snippet-level generation. These codebase AI assistants (CBAs) can also extend or adapt codebases, allowing users to focus on higher-level design and deployment decisions. While prior work has extensively studied the impact of snippet-level code generation, this new class of codebase generation models is relatively unexplored. Despite initial anecdotal reports of excitement about these agents, they remain less frequently adopted compared to snippet-level code assistants. To utilize CBAs better, we need to understand how developers interact with CBAs, and how and why CBAs fall short of developers' needs. In this paper, we explored these gaps through a counterbalanced user study and interview with (n = 16) students and developers working on coding tasks with CBAs. We found that participants varied the information in their prompts, like problem description (48% of prompts), required functionality (98% of prompts), code structure (48% of prompts), and their prompt writing process. Despite various strategies, the overall satisfaction score with generated codebases remained low (mean = 2.8, median = 3, on a scale of one to five). Participants mentioned functionality as the most common factor for dissatisfaction (77% of instances), alongside poor code quality (42% of instances) and communication issues (25% of instances). We delve deeper into participants' dissatisfaction to identify six underlying challenges that participants faced when using CBAs, and extracted five barriers to incorporating CBAs into their workflows. Finally, we surveyed 21 commercial CBAs to compare their capabilities with participant challenges and present design opportunities for more efficient and useful CBAs.

### Large Language Models for Subjective Language Understanding: A Survey
**Authors**: Changhao Song, Yazhou Zhang, Hui Gao, Ben Yao, Peng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T13:10:44Z

**Summary**: Subjective language understanding refers to a broad set of natural language processing tasks where the goal is to interpret or generate content that conveys personal feelings, opinions, or figurative meanings rather than objective facts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, LLaMA, and others, there has been a paradigm shift in how we approach these inherently nuanced tasks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advances in applying LLMs to subjective language tasks, including sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, sarcasm detection, humor understanding, stance detection, metaphor interpretation, intent detection, and aesthetics assessment. We begin by clarifying the definition of subjective language from linguistic and cognitive perspectives, and we outline the unique challenges posed by subjective language (e.g. ambiguity, figurativeness, context dependence). We then survey the evolution of LLM architectures and techniques that particularly benefit subjectivity tasks, highlighting why LLMs are well-suited to model subtle human-like judgments. For each of the eight tasks, we summarize task definitions, key datasets, state-of-the-art LLM-based methods, and remaining challenges. We provide comparative insights, discussing commonalities and differences among tasks and how multi-task LLM approaches might yield unified models of subjectivity. Finally, we identify open issues such as data limitations, model bias, and ethical considerations, and suggest future research directions. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the intersection of affective computing, figurative language processing, and large-scale language models.

### Careful Queries, Credible Results: Teaching RAG Models Advanced Web   Search Tools with Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Yuqin Dai, Shuo Yang, Guoqing Wang, Yong Deng, Zhanwei Zhang, Jun Yin, Pengyu Zeng, Zhenzhe Ying, Changhua Meng, Can Yi, Yuchen Zhou, Weiqiang Wang, Shuai Lu

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T13:08:37Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating up-to-date external knowledge, yet real-world web environments present unique challenges. These limitations manifest as two key challenges: pervasive misinformation in the web environment, which introduces unreliable or misleading content that can degrade retrieval accuracy, and the underutilization of web tools, which, if effectively employed, could enhance query precision and help mitigate this noise, ultimately improving the retrieval results in RAG systems. To address these issues, we propose WebFilter, a novel RAG framework that generates source-restricted queries and filters out unreliable content. This approach combines a retrieval filtering mechanism with a behavior- and outcome-driven reward strategy, optimizing both query formulation and retrieval outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WebFilter improves answer quality and retrieval precision, outperforming existing RAG methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

### Expert Preference-based Evaluation of Automated Related Work Generation
**Authors**: Furkan Şahinuç, Subhabrata Dutta, Iryna Gurevych

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T13:08:07Z

**Summary**: Expert domain writing, such as scientific writing, typically demands extensive domain knowledge. Recent advances in LLMs show promising potential in reducing the expert workload. However, evaluating the quality of automatically generated scientific writing is a crucial open issue, as it requires knowledge of domain-specific evaluation criteria and the ability to discern expert preferences. Conventional automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge systems are insufficient to grasp expert preferences and domain-specific quality standards. To address this gap and support human-AI collaborative writing, we focus on related work generation, one of the most challenging scientific tasks, as an exemplar. We propose GREP, a multi-turn evaluation framework that integrates classical related work evaluation criteria with expert-specific preferences. Instead of assigning a single score, our framework decomposes the evaluation into fine-grained dimensions. This localized evaluation approach is further augmented with contrastive few-shot examples to provide detailed contextual guidance for the evaluation dimensions. The design principles allow our framework to deliver cardinal assessment of quality, which can facilitate better post-training compared to ordinal preference data. For better accessibility, we design two variants of GREP: a more precise variant with proprietary LLMs as evaluators, and a cheaper alternative with open-weight LLMs. Empirical investigation reveals that our framework is able to assess the quality of related work sections in a much more robust manner compared to standard LLM judges, reflects natural scenarios of scientific writing, and bears a strong correlation with the human expert assessment. We also observe that generations from state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to satisfy validation constraints of a suitable related work section. They (mostly) fail to improve based on feedback as well.

### FEAT: A Multi-Agent Forensic AI System with Domain-Adapted Large   Language Model for Automated Cause-of-Death Analysis
**Authors**: Chen Shen, Wanqing Zhang, Kehan Li, Erwen Huang, Haitao Bi, Aiying Fan, Yiwen Shen, Hongmei Dong, Ji Zhang, Yuming Shao, Zengjia Liu, Xinshe Liu, Tao Li, Chunxia Yan, Shuanliang Fan, Di Wu, Jianhua Ma, Bin Cong, Zhenyuan Wang, Chunfeng Lian

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T13:05:59Z

**Summary**: Forensic cause-of-death determination faces systemic challenges, including workforce shortages and diagnostic variability, particularly in high-volume systems like China's medicolegal infrastructure. We introduce FEAT (ForEnsic AgenT), a multi-agent AI framework that automates and standardizes death investigations through a domain-adapted large language model. FEAT's application-oriented architecture integrates: (i) a central Planner for task decomposition, (ii) specialized Local Solvers for evidence analysis, (iii) a Memory & Reflection module for iterative refinement, and (iv) a Global Solver for conclusion synthesis. The system employs tool-augmented reasoning, hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation, forensic-tuned LLMs, and human-in-the-loop feedback to ensure legal and medical validity. In evaluations across diverse Chinese case cohorts, FEAT outperformed state-of-the-art AI systems in both long-form autopsy analyses and concise cause-of-death conclusions. It demonstrated robust generalization across six geographic regions and achieved high expert concordance in blinded validations. Senior pathologists validated FEAT's outputs as comparable to those of human experts, with improved detection of subtle evidentiary nuances. To our knowledge, FEAT is the first LLM-based AI agent system dedicated to forensic medicine, offering scalable, consistent death certification while maintaining expert-level rigor. By integrating AI efficiency with human oversight, this work could advance equitable access to reliable medicolegal services while addressing critical capacity constraints in forensic systems.

### SHIELDA: Structured Handling of Exceptions in LLM-Driven Agentic   Workflows
**Authors**: Jingwen Zhou, Jieshan Chen, Qinghua Lu, Dehai Zhao, Liming Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:50:46Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) agentic systems are software systems powered by LLMs that autonomously reason, plan, and execute multi-step workflows to achieve human goals, rather than merely executing predefined steps. During execution, these workflows frequently encounter exceptions. Existing exception handling solutions often treat exceptions superficially, failing to trace execution-phase exceptions to their reasoning-phase root causes. Furthermore, their recovery logic is brittle, lacking structured escalation pathways when initial attempts fail. To tackle these challenges, we first present a comprehensive taxonomy of 36 exception types across 12 agent artifacts. Building on this, we propose SHIELDA (Structured Handling of Exceptions in LLM-Driven Agentic Workflows), a modular runtime exception handling framework for LLM agentic workflows. SHIELDA uses an exception classifier to select a predefined exception handling pattern from a handling pattern registry. These patterns are then executed via a structured handling executor, comprising local handling, flow control, and state recovery, to enable phase-aware recovery by linking exceptions to their root causes and facilitating composable strategies. We validate SHIELDA's effectiveness through a case study on the AutoPR agent, demonstrating effective, cross-phase recovery from a reasoning-induced exception.

### \(X\)-evolve: Solution space evolution powered by large language models
**Authors**: Yi Zhai, Zhiqiang Wei, Ruohan Li, Keyu Pan, Shuo Liu, Lu Zhang, Jianmin Ji, Wuyang Zhang, Yu Zhang, Yanyong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:47:59Z

**Summary**: While combining large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary algorithms (EAs) shows promise for solving complex optimization problems, current approaches typically evolve individual solutions, often incurring high LLM call costs. We introduce \(X\)-evolve, a paradigm-shifting method that instead evolves solution spaces \(X\) (sets of individual solutions) - subsets of the overall search space \(S\). In \(X\)-evolve, LLMs generate tunable programs wherein certain code snippets, designated as parameters, define a tunable solution space. A score-based search algorithm then efficiently explores this parametrically defined space, guided by feedback from objective function scores. This strategy enables broader and more efficient exploration, which can potentially accelerate convergence at a much lower search cost, requiring up to two orders of magnitude fewer LLM calls than prior leading methods. We demonstrate \(X\)-evolve's efficacy across three distinct hard optimization problems. For the cap set problem, we discover a larger partial admissible set, establishing a new tighter asymptotic lower bound for the cap set constant (\(C \ge 2.2203\)). In information theory, we uncover a larger independent set for the 15-vertex cycle graph (\(\mathcal{C}_{15}^{\boxtimes 5}\), size 19,946), thereby raising the known lower bound on its Shannon capacity. Furthermore, for the NP-hard online bin packing problem, we generate heuristics that consistently outperform standard strategies across established benchmarks. By evolving solution spaces, our method considerably improves search effectiveness, making it possible to tackle high-dimensional problems that were previously computationally prohibitive.

### DreamFrame: Enhancing Video Understanding via Automatically Generated QA   and Style-Consistent Keyframes
**Authors**: Zhende Song, Chenchen Wang, Jiamu Sheng, Chi Zhang, Shengji Tang, Jiayuan Fan, Tao Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:47:49Z

**Summary**: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) for video understanding are primarily fine-tuned with various videos scraped from online platforms. Existing datasets, such as ActivityNet, require considerable human labor for structuring and annotation before effectively utilized for tuning LVLMs. While current LVLMs are primarily trained on existing datasets in broad, general-purpose settings, adapting them to specific downstream scenarios remains challenging, as collecting and annotating task-specific videos is highly labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a three-stage framework named DreamFrame for automatically generating style-consistent keyframes and corresponding question-answer (QA) pairs to support LVLM instruction tuning. DreamFrame generates datasets in a movie-like manner. First, we utilize an LLM to generate structured movie plots including movie prior information (like overview and style), frame descriptions and plot-related QA pairs, with a story expansion strategy to mitigate context length limitations.Then, to ensure visual consistency across generated frames, we design a Style Immobilization Process which maintains consistent style through an embedding learning strategy. Finally, frame descriptions and style embeddings are integrated to produce coherent keyframes. Using DreamFrame, we construct a dataset comprising approximately 1k stylized keyframe-like videos and 100k diverse QA pairs. Extensive fine-tuned experiments on various LVLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset. Furthermore, based on the proposed dataset, we fine-tune a new LVLM named DreamFrame-7B, which significantly surpasses the previous similar-sized LVLMs across different benchmarks.

### TAG: A Simple Yet Effective Temporal-Aware Approach for Zero-Shot Video   Temporal Grounding
**Authors**: Jin-Seop Lee, SungJoon Lee, Jaehan Ahn, YunSeok Choi, Jee-Hyong Lee

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:38:46Z

**Summary**: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to extract relevant video segments based on a given natural language query. Recently, zero-shot VTG methods have gained attention by leveraging pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to localize target moments without additional training. However, existing approaches suffer from semantic fragmentation, where temporally continuous frames sharing the same semantics are split across multiple segments. When segments are fragmented, it becomes difficult to predict an accurate target moment that aligns with the text query. Also, they rely on skewed similarity distributions for localization, making it difficult to select the optimal segment. Furthermore, they heavily depend on the use of LLMs which require expensive inferences. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{TAG}, a simple yet effective Temporal-Aware approach for zero-shot video temporal Grounding, which incorporates temporal pooling, temporal coherence clustering, and similarity adjustment. Our proposed method effectively captures the temporal context of videos and addresses distorted similarity distributions without training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions benchmark datasets without rely on LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Nuetee/TAG

### RSVLM-QA: A Benchmark Dataset for Remote Sensing Vision Language   Model-based Question Answering
**Authors**: Xing Zi, Jinghao Xiao, Yunxiao Shi, Xian Tao, Jun Li, Ali Braytee, Mukesh Prasad

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:32:48Z

**Summary**: Visual Question Answering (VQA) in remote sensing (RS) is pivotal for interpreting Earth observation data. However, existing RS VQA datasets are constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain. RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1 then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises 13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs), demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.

**Summary**: Using LLMs in a production environment presents security challenges that include vulnerabilities to jailbreaks and prompt injections, which can result in harmful outputs for humans or the enterprise. The challenge is amplified when working within a specific domain, as topics generally accepted for LLMs to address may be irrelevant to that field. These problems can be mitigated, for example, by fine-tuning large language models with domain-specific and security-focused data. However, these alone are insufficient, as jailbreak techniques evolve. Additionally, API-accessed models do not offer the flexibility needed to tailor behavior to industry-specific objectives, and in-context learning is not always sufficient or reliable. In response to these challenges, we introduce Archias, an expert model adept at distinguishing between in-domain and out-of-domain communications. Archias classifies user inquiries into several categories: in-domain (specifically for the automotive industry), malicious questions, price injections, prompt injections, and out-of-domain examples. Our methodology integrates outputs from the expert model (Archias) into prompts, which are then processed by the LLM to generate responses. This method increases the model's ability to understand the user's intention and give appropriate answers. Archias can be adjusted, fine-tuned, and used for many different purposes due to its small size. Therefore, it can be easily customized to the needs of any industry. To validate our approach, we created a benchmark dataset for the automotive industry. Furthermore, in the interest of advancing research and development, we release our benchmark dataset to the community.

**Authors**: Chen Cecilia Liu, Hiba Arnaout, Nils Kovačić, Dana Atzil-Slonim, Iryna Gurevych

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:17:58Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in offering emotional support and generating empathetic responses for individuals in distress, but their ability to deliver culturally sensitive support remains underexplored due to lack of resources. In this work, we introduce CultureCare, the first dataset designed for this task, spanning four cultures and including 1729 distress messages, 1523 cultural signals, and 1041 support strategies with fine-grained emotional and cultural annotations. Leveraging CultureCare, we (i) develop and test four adaptation strategies for guiding three state-of-the-art LLMs toward culturally sensitive responses; (ii) conduct comprehensive evaluations using LLM judges, in-culture human annotators, and clinical psychologists; (iii) show that adapted LLMs outperform anonymous online peer responses, and that simple cultural role-play is insufficient for cultural sensitivity; and (iv) explore the application of LLMs in clinical training, where experts highlight their potential in fostering cultural competence in future therapists.

**Authors**: Vincenzo De Martino, Joel Castaño, Fabio Palomba, Xavier Franch, Silverio Martínez-Fernández

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:16:03Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software engineering research, offering new opportunities for automating repository mining tasks. However, despite their growing popularity, the methodological integration of LLMs into Mining Software Repositories (MSR) remains poorly understood. Existing studies tend to focus on specific capabilities or performance benchmarks, providing limited insight into how researchers utilize LLMs across the full research pipeline. To address this gap, we conduct a mixed-method study that combines a rapid review and questionnaire survey in the field of LLM4MSR. We investigate (1) the approaches and (2) the threats that affect the empirical rigor of researchers involved in this field. Our findings reveal 15 methodological approaches, nine main threats, and 25 mitigation strategies. Building on these findings, we present PRIMES 2.0, a refined empirical framework organized into six stages, comprising 23 methodological substeps, each mapped to specific threats and corresponding mitigation strategies, providing prescriptive and adaptive support throughout the lifecycle of LLM-based MSR studies. Our work contributes to establishing a more transparent and reproducible foundation for LLM-based MSR research.

### Not Yet AlphaFold for the Mind: Evaluating Centaur as a Synthetic   Participant
**Authors**: Sabrina Namazova, Alessandra Brondetta, Younes Strittmatter, Matthew Nassar, Sebastian Musslick

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:05:18Z

**Summary**: Simulators have revolutionized scientific practice across the natural sciences. By generating data that reliably approximate real-world phenomena, they enable scientists to accelerate hypothesis testing and optimize experimental designs. This is perhaps best illustrated by AlphaFold, a Nobel-prize winning simulator in chemistry that predicts protein structures from amino acid sequences, enabling rapid prototyping of molecular interactions, drug targets, and protein functions. In the behavioral sciences, a reliable participant simulator - a system capable of producing human-like behavior across cognitive tasks - would represent a similarly transformative advance. Recently, Binz et al. introduced Centaur, a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on human data from 160 experiments, proposing its use not only as a model of cognition but also as a participant simulator for "in silico prototyping of experimental studies", e.g., to advance automated cognitive science. Here, we review the core criteria for a participant simulator and assess how well Centaur meets them. Although Centaur demonstrates strong predictive accuracy, its generative behavior - a critical criterion for a participant simulator - systematically diverges from human data. This suggests that, while Centaur is a significant step toward predicting human behavior, it does not yet meet the standards of a reliable participant simulator or an accurate model of cognition.

### Autonomous Navigation of Cloud-Controlled Quadcopters in Confined Spaces   Using Multi-Modal Perception and LLM-Driven High Semantic Reasoning
**Authors**: Shoaib Ahmmad, Zubayer Ahmed Aditto, Md Mehrab Hossain, Noushin Yeasmin, Shorower Hossain

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T12:00:03Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces an advanced AI-driven perception system for autonomous quadcopter navigation in GPS-denied indoor environments. The proposed framework leverages cloud computing to offload computationally intensive tasks and incorporates a custom-designed printed circuit board (PCB) for efficient sensor data acquisition, enabling robust navigation in confined spaces. The system integrates YOLOv11 for object detection, Depth Anything V2 for monocular depth estimation, a PCB equipped with Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware decision-making. A virtual safety envelope, enforced by calibrated sensor offsets, ensures collision avoidance, while a multithreaded architecture achieves low-latency processing. Enhanced spatial awareness is facilitated by 3D bounding box estimation with Kalman filtering. Experimental results in an indoor testbed demonstrate strong performance, with object detection achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.6, depth estimation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.2 cm, only 16 safety envelope breaches across 42 trials over approximately 11 minutes, and end-to-end system latency below 1 second. This cloud-supported, high-intelligence framework serves as an auxiliary perception and navigation system, complementing state-of-the-art drone autonomy for GPS-denied confined spaces.

### Scalable and Energy-Efficient Predictive Data Collection in Wireless   Sensor Networks with Constructive Interference
**Authors**: Conor Muldoon

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:56:33Z

**Summary**: A new class of Wireless Sensor Network has emerged whereby multiple nodes transmit data simultaneously, exploiting constructive interference to enable data collection frameworks with low energy usage and latency. This paper presents STAIR (Spatio-Temporal Activation for Intelligent Relaying), a scalable, resilient framework for Wireless Sensor Networks that leverages constructive interference and operates effectively under stringent resource constraints. Using constructive interference requires all nodes to transmit the same packet at the same time, thus, only one source node can send data per time slot. STAIR uses coarse-grained topology information to flood a selected subset of the network, relaying sensor readings from individual nodes during their allocated time slots. A submodular optimisation algorithm with proven quality bounds determines near-optimal sensor activation locations and times, aiming to minimise the sum of mean squared prediction errors from a multiple multivariate linear regression model, which is used to estimate values at unselected locations and times. This framework has been extensively validated on a real-world testbed deployment.

### Multi-agent systems for chemical engineering: A review and perspective
**Authors**: Sophia Rupprecht, Qinghe Gao, Tanuj Karia, Artur M. Schweidtmann

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:55:18Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MASs) are a recent but rapidly evolving technology with the potential to transform chemical engineering by decomposing complex workflows into teams of collaborative agents with specialized knowledge and tools. This review surveys the state-of-the-art of MAS within chemical engineering. While early studies demonstrate promising results, scientific challenges remain, including the design of tailored architectures, integration of heterogeneous data modalities, development of foundation models with domain-specific modalities, and strategies for ensuring transparency, safety, and environmental impact. As a young but fast-moving field, MASs offer exciting opportunities to rethink chemical engineering workflows.

### Solving Zero-Shot 3D Visual Grounding as Constraint Satisfaction   Problems
**Authors**: Qihao Yuan, Kailai Li, Jiaming Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:50:10Z

**Summary**: 3D visual grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in a 3D scene with natural language descriptions. Supervised methods have achieved decent accuracy, but have a closed vocabulary and limited language understanding ability. Zero-shot methods utilize large language models (LLMs) to handle natural language descriptions, where the LLM either produces grounding results directly or generates programs that compute results (symbolically). In this work, we propose a zero-shot method that reformulates the 3DVG task as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), where the variables and constraints represent objects and their spatial relations, respectively. This allows a global symbolic reasoning of all relevant objects, producing grounding results of both the target and anchor objects. Moreover, we demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by handling negation- and counting-based queries with only minor extra coding efforts. Our system, Constraint Satisfaction Visual Grounding (CSVG), has been extensively evaluated on the public datasets ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets using only open-source LLMs. Results show the effectiveness of CSVG and superior grounding accuracy over current state-of-the-art zero-shot 3DVG methods with improvements of $+7.0\%$ (Acc@0.5 score) and $+11.2\%$ on the ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets, respectively. The code of our system is available at https://asig-x.github.io/csvg_web.

### CoherenDream: Boosting Holistic Text Coherence in 3D Generation via   Multimodal Large Language Models Feedback
**Authors**: Chenhan Jiang, Yihan Zeng, Dit-Yan Yeung

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:43:39Z

**Summary**: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has achieved remarkable success in text-to-3D content generation. However, SDS-based methods struggle to maintain semantic fidelity for user prompts, particularly when involving multiple objects with intricate interactions. While existing approaches often address 3D consistency through multiview diffusion model fine-tuning on 3D datasets, this strategy inadvertently exacerbates text-3D alignment degradation. The limitation stems from SDS's inherent accumulation of view-independent biases during optimization, which progressively diverges from the ideal text alignment direction. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel SDS objective, dubbed as Textual Coherent Score Distillation (TCSD), which integrates alignment feedback from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our TCSD leverages cross-modal understanding capabilities of MLLMs to assess and guide the text-3D correspondence during the optimization. We further develop 3DLLaVA-CRITIC - a fine-tuned MLLM specialized for evaluating multiview text alignment in 3D generations. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-layout initialization that significantly accelerates optimization convergence through semantic-aware spatial configuration. Our framework, CoherenDream, achieves consistent improvement across multiple metrics on TIFA subset.As the first study to incorporate MLLMs into SDS optimization, we also conduct extensive ablation studies to explore optimal MLLM adaptations for 3D generation tasks.

### Aligning Instruction Tuning with Pre-training
**Authors**: Yiming Liang, Tianyu Zheng, Xinrun Du, Ge Zhang, Jiaheng Liu, Xingwei Qu, Wenqiang Zu, Xingrun Xing, Chujie Zheng, Lei Ma, Guoyin Wang, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Wenhao Huang, Xiang Yue, Jiajun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:28:39Z

**Summary**: Instruction tuning enhances large language models (LLMs) to follow human instructions across diverse tasks, relying on high-quality datasets to guide behavior. However, these datasets, whether manually curated or synthetically generated, are often narrowly focused and misaligned with the broad distributions captured during pre-training, limiting LLM generalization and effective use of pre-trained knowledge. We propose Aligning Instruction Tuning with Pre-training (AITP), a method that bridges this gap by identifying coverage shortfalls in instruction-tuning datasets and rewriting underrepresented pre-training data into high-quality instruction-response pairs. This approach enriches dataset diversity while preserving task-specific objectives. Evaluations on three fully open LLMs across eight benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements with AITP. Ablations highlight the benefits of adaptive data selection, controlled rewriting, and balanced integration, emphasizing the importance of aligning instruction tuning with pre-training distributions to unlock the full potential of LLMs.

### Being-M0.5: A Real-Time Controllable Vision-Language-Motion Model
**Authors**: Bin Cao, Sipeng Zheng, Ye Wang, Lujie Xia, Qianshan Wei, Qin Jin, Jing Liu, Zongqing Lu

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:26:10Z

**Summary**: Human motion generation has emerged as a critical technology with transformative potential for real-world applications. However, existing vision-language-motion models (VLMMs) face significant limitations that hinder their practical deployment. We identify controllability as a main bottleneck, manifesting in five key aspects: inadequate response to diverse human commands, limited pose initialization capabilities, poor performance on long-term sequences, insufficient handling of unseen scenarios, and lack of fine-grained control over individual body parts. To overcome these limitations, we present Being-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our approach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human motion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion sequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed part-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We introduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion tokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts during generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's superior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive efficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities. Our contributions include design insights and detailed computational analysis to guide future development of practical motion generators. We believe that HuMo100M and Being-M0.5 represent significant advances that will accelerate the adoption of motion generation technologies in real-world applications.

### Large Language Models for Czech Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
**Authors**: Jakub Šmíd, Pavel Přibáň, Pavel Král

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:24:57Z

**Summary**: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task that aims to identify sentiment toward specific aspects of an entity. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their capabilities for Czech ABSA remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 19 LLMs of varying sizes and architectures on Czech ABSA, comparing their performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. Our results show that small domain-specific models fine-tuned for ABSA outperform general-purpose LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while fine-tuned LLMs achieve state-of-the-art results. We analyze how factors such as multilingualism, model size, and recency influence performance and present an error analysis highlighting key challenges, particularly in aspect term prediction. Our findings provide insights into the suitability of LLMs for Czech ABSA and offer guidance for future research in this area.

### Overconfidence in LLM-as-a-Judge: Diagnosis and Confidence-Driven   Solution
**Authors**: Zailong Tian, Zhuoheng Han, Yanzhe Chen, Haozhe Xu, Xi Yang, Richeng Xuan, Houfeng Wang, Lizi Liao

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:15:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as automated judges, where practical value depends on both accuracy and trustworthy, risk-aware judgments. Existing approaches predominantly focus on accuracy, overlooking the necessity of well-calibrated confidence, which is vital for adaptive and reliable evaluation pipelines. In this work, we advocate a shift from accuracy-centric evaluation to confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems, emphasizing the necessity of well-calibrated confidence for trustworthy and adaptive evaluation. We systematically identify the Overconfidence Phenomenon in current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence significantly overstates actual correctness, undermining reliability in practical deployment. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce TH-Score, a novel metric measuring confidence-accuracy alignment. Furthermore, we propose LLM-as-a-Fuser, an ensemble framework that transforms LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves calibration and enables adaptive, confidence-driven evaluation pipelines, achieving superior reliability and accuracy compared to existing baselines.

### LLMs for Law: Evaluating Legal-Specific LLMs on Contract Understanding
**Authors**: Amrita Singh, H. Suhan Karaca, Aditya Joshi, Hye-young Paik, Jiaojiao Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T11:08:32Z

**Summary**: Despite advances in legal NLP, no comprehensive evaluation covering multiple legal-specific LLMs currently exists for contract classification tasks in contract understanding. To address this gap, we present an evaluation of 10 legal-specific LLMs on three English language contract understanding tasks and compare them with 7 general-purpose LLMs. The results show that legal-specific LLMs consistently outperform general-purpose models, especially on tasks requiring nuanced legal understanding. Legal-BERT and Contracts-BERT establish new SOTAs on two of the three tasks, despite having 69% fewer parameters than the best-performing general-purpose LLM. We also identify CaseLaw-BERT and LexLM as strong additional baselines for contract understanding. Our results provide a holistic evaluation of legal-specific LLMs and will facilitate the development of more accurate contract understanding systems.

### DAGR: Decomposition Augmented Graph Retrieval with LLMs
**Authors**: Valentin Six, Evan Dufraisse, Gaël de Chalendar

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T10:35:31Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but struggle with multi-hop reasoning and factual consistency, limiting their effectiveness on knowledge-intensive tasks like complex question answering (QA). Linking Knowledge Graphs (KG) and LLMs has shown promising results, but LLMs generally lack the ability to reason efficiently over graph-structured information. To address this challenge, we introduce DAGR, a retrieval method that leverages both complex questions and their decomposition in subquestions to extract relevant, linked textual subgraphs. DAGR first breaks down complex queries, retrieves subgraphs guided by a weighted similarity function over both the original and decomposed queries, and creates a question-specific knowledge graph to guide answer generation. The resulting Graph-RAG pipeline is suited to handle complex multi-hop questions and effectively reason over graph-structured data. We evaluate DAGR on standard multi-hop QA benchmarks and show that it achieves comparable or superior performance to competitive existing methods, using smaller models and fewer LLM calls.

### First Experience with Real-Time Control Using Simulated VQC-Based   Quantum Policies
**Authors**: Yize Sun, Mohamad Hagog, Marc Weber, Daniel Hein, Steffen Udluft, Volker Tresp, Yunpu Ma

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T10:22:51Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates the integration of quantum computing into offline reinforcement learning and the deployment of the resulting quantum policy in a real-time control hardware realization of the cart-pole system. Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) are used to represent the policy. Classical model-based offline policy search was applied, in which a pure VQC with trainable input-output weights is used as a policy network instead of a classical multilayer perceptron. The goal is to evaluate the potential of deploying quantum architectures in real-world industrial control problems. The experimental results show that the investigated model-based offline policy search is able to generate quantum policies that can balance the hardware cart-pole. A latency analysis reveals that while local simulated execution meets real-time requirements, cloud-based quantum processing remains too slow for closed-loop control.

### Evaluating Large Language Models as Expert Annotators
**Authors**: Yu-Min Tseng, Wei-Lin Chen, Chung-Chi Chen, Hsin-Hsi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T10:19:10Z

**Summary**: Textual data annotation, the process of labeling or tagging text with relevant information, is typically costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential as direct alternatives to human annotators for general domains natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their effectiveness on annotation tasks in domains requiring expert knowledge remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate: whether top-performing LLMs, which might be perceived as having expert-level proficiency in academic and professional benchmarks, can serve as direct alternatives to human expert annotators? To this end, we evaluate both individual LLMs and multi-agent approaches across three highly specialized domains: finance, biomedicine, and law. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent discussion framework to simulate a group of human annotators, where LLMs are tasked to engage in discussions by considering others' annotations and justifications before finalizing their labels. Additionally, we incorporate reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) to enable a more comprehensive comparison. Our empirical results reveal that: (1) Individual LLMs equipped with inference-time techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT), self-consistency) show only marginal or even negative performance gains, contrary to prior literature suggesting their broad effectiveness. (2) Overall, reasoning models do not demonstrate statistically significant improvements over non-reasoning models in most settings. This suggests that extended long CoT provides relatively limited benefits for data annotation in specialized domains. (3) Certain model behaviors emerge in the multi-agent discussion environment. For instance, Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking rarely changes its initial annotations, even when other agents provide correct annotations or valid reasoning.

### Do LLMs Understand Your Translations? Evaluating Paragraph-level MT with   Question Answering
**Authors**: Patrick Fernandes, Sweta Agrawal, Emmanouil Zaranis, André F. T. Martins, Graham Neubig

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T10:08:37Z

**Summary**: Despite the steady progress in machine translation evaluation, existing automatic metrics struggle to capture how well meaning is preserved beyond sentence boundaries. We posit that reliance on a single intrinsic quality score, trained to mimic human judgments, might be insufficient for evaluating translations of long, complex passages, and a more ``pragmatic'' approach that assesses how accurately key information is conveyed by a translation in context is needed. We introduce TREQA (Translation Evaluation via Question-Answering), a framework that extrinsically evaluates translation quality by assessing how accurately candidate translations answer reading comprehension questions that target key information in the original source or reference texts. In challenging domains that require long-range understanding, such as literary texts, we show that TREQA is competitive with and, in some cases, outperforms state-of-the-art neural and LLM-based metrics in ranking alternative paragraph-level translations, despite never being explicitly optimized to correlate with human judgments. Furthermore, the generated questions and answers offer interpretability: empirical analysis shows that they effectively target translation errors identified by experts in evaluated datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/deep-spin/treqa

### EvoCoT: Overcoming the Exploration Bottleneck in Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Huanyu Liu, Jia Li, Chang Yu, Taozhi Chen, Yihong Dong, Lecheng Wang, Hu XiaoLong, Ge Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T09:49:01Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) has become a promising paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve their reasoning capability. However, when the rollout accuracy is low on hard problems, the reward becomes sparse, limiting learning efficiency and causing exploration bottlenecks. Existing approaches either rely on stronger LLMs for distillation or filter out difficult problems, which limits scalability or restricts reasoning improvement through exploration.   We propose EvoCoT, a self-evolving curriculum learning framework based on two-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning optimization. EvoCoT constrains the exploration space by self-generating and verifying CoT trajectories, then gradually shortens them to expand the space in a controlled way. This enables LLMs to stably learn from initially unsolved hard problems under sparse rewards. We apply EvoCoT to multiple LLM families, including Qwen, DeepSeek, and Llama. Experiments show that EvoCoT enables LLMs to solve previously unsolved problems, improves reasoning capability without external CoT supervision, and is compatible with various RL fine-tuning methods. We release the source code to support future research.

### Can You Trick the Grader? Adversarial Persuasion of LLM Judges
**Authors**: Yerin Hwang, Dongryeol Lee, Taegwan Kang, Yongil Kim, Kyomin Jung

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T09:45:02Z

**Summary**: As large language models take on growing roles as automated evaluators in practical settings, a critical question arises: Can individuals persuade an LLM judge to assign unfairly high scores? This study is the first to reveal that strategically embedded persuasive language can bias LLM judges when scoring mathematical reasoning tasks, where correctness should be independent of stylistic variation. Grounded in Aristotle's rhetorical principles, we formalize seven persuasion techniques (Majority, Consistency, Flattery, Reciprocity, Pity, Authority, Identity) and embed them into otherwise identical responses. Across six math benchmarks, we find that persuasive language leads LLM judges to assign inflated scores to incorrect solutions, by up to 8% on average, with Consistency causing the most severe distortion. Notably, increasing model size does not substantially mitigate this vulnerability. Further analysis demonstrates that combining multiple persuasion techniques amplifies the bias, and pairwise evaluation is likewise susceptible. Moreover, the persuasive effect persists under counter prompting strategies, highlighting a critical vulnerability in LLM-as-a-Judge pipelines and underscoring the need for robust defenses against persuasion-based attacks.

**Authors**: Eleftherios Tzanis, Michail E. Klontzas

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T09:40:16Z

**Summary**: Agentic systems built on large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating complex workflows in healthcare AI. We introduce mAIstro, an open-source, autonomous multi-agentic framework for end-to-end development and deployment of medical AI models. The system orchestrates exploratory data analysis, radiomic feature extraction, image segmentation, classification, and regression through a natural language interface, requiring no coding from the user. Built on a modular architecture, mAIstro supports both open- and closed-source LLMs, and was evaluated using a large and diverse set of prompts across 16 open-source datasets, covering a wide range of imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and data types. The agents successfully executed all tasks, producing interpretable outputs and validated models. This work presents the first agentic framework capable of unifying data analysis, AI model development, and inference across varied healthcare applications, offering a reproducible and extensible foundation for clinical and research AI integration.

**Summary**: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is a cornerstone of modern state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). MoE models facilitate scalability by enabling sparse parameter activation. However, traditional MoE architecture uses homogeneous experts of a uniform size, activating a fixed number of parameters irrespective of input complexity and thus limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Grove MoE, a novel architecture incorporating experts of varying sizes, inspired by the heterogeneous big.LITTLE CPU architecture. This architecture features novel adjugate experts with a dynamic activation mechanism, enabling model capacity expansion while maintaining manageable computational overhead. Building on this architecture, we present GroveMoE-Base and GroveMoE-Inst, 33B-parameter LLMs developed by applying an upcycling strategy to the Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base model during mid-training and post-training. GroveMoE models dynamically activate 3.14-3.28B parameters based on token complexity and achieve performance comparable to SOTA open-source models of similar or even larger size.

### Interactive Imitation Learning for Dexterous Robotic Manipulation:   Challenges and Perspectives -- A Survey
**Authors**: Edgar Welte, Rania Rayyes

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T09:13:37Z

**Summary**: Dexterous manipulation is a crucial yet highly complex challenge in humanoid robotics, demanding precise, adaptable, and sample-efficient learning methods. As humanoid robots are usually designed to operate in human-centric environments and interact with everyday objects, mastering dexterous manipulation is critical for real-world deployment. Traditional approaches, such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning, have made significant strides, but they often struggle due to the unique challenges of real-world dexterous manipulation, including high-dimensional control, limited training data, and covariate shift. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of these challenges and reviews existing learning-based methods for real-world dexterous manipulation, spanning imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and hybrid approaches. A promising yet underexplored direction is interactive imitation learning, where human feedback actively refines a robots behavior during training. While interactive imitation learning has shown success in various robotic tasks, its application to dexterous manipulation remains limited. To address this gap, we examine current interactive imitation learning techniques applied to other robotic tasks and discuss how these methods can be adapted to enhance dexterous manipulation. By synthesizing state-of-the-art research, this paper highlights key challenges, identifies gaps in current methodologies, and outlines potential directions for leveraging interactive imitation learning to improve dexterous robotic skills.

### SASST: Leveraging Syntax-Aware Chunking and LLMs for Simultaneous Speech   Translation
**Authors**: Zeyu Yang, Lai Wei, Roman Koshkin, Xi Chen, Satoshi Nakamura

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T09:13:35Z

**Summary**: This work proposes a grammar-based chunking strategy that segments input streams into semantically complete units by parsing dependency relations (e.g., noun phrase boundaries, verb-object structures) and punctuation features. The method ensures chunk coherence and minimizes semantic fragmentation. Building on this mechanism, we present SASST (Syntax-Aware Simultaneous Speech Translation), an end-to-end framework integrating frozen Whisper encoder and decoder-only LLM. The unified architecture dynamically outputs translation tokens or <WAIT> symbols to jointly optimize translation timing and content, with target-side reordering addressing word-order divergence. Experiments on CoVoST2 multilingual corpus En-{De, Zh, Ja} demonstrate significant translation quality improvements across languages and validate the effectiveness of syntactic structures in LLM-driven SimulST systems.

### Invisible Walls in Cities: Leveraging Large Language Models to Predict   Urban Segregation Experience with Social Media Content
**Authors**: Bingbing Fan, Lin Chen, Songwei Li, Jian Yuan, Fengli Xu, Pan Hui, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T09:00:40Z

**Summary**: Understanding experienced segregation in urban daily life is crucial for addressing societal inequalities and fostering inclusivity. The abundance of user-generated reviews on social media encapsulates nuanced perceptions and feelings associated with different places, offering rich insights into segregation. However, leveraging this data poses significant challenges due to its vast volume, ambiguity, and confluence of diverse perspectives. To tackle these challenges, we propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate online review mining for segregation prediction. We design a Reflective LLM Coder to digest social media content into insights consistent with real-world feedback, and eventually produce a codebook capturing key dimensions that signal segregation experience, such as cultural resonance and appeal, accessibility and convenience, and community engagement and local involvement. Guided by the codebook, LLMs can generate both informative review summaries and ratings for segregation prediction. Moreover, we design a REasoning-and-EMbedding (RE'EM) framework, which combines the reasoning and embedding capabilities of language models to integrate multi-channel features for segregation prediction. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our framework greatly improves prediction accuracy, with a 22.79% elevation in R2 and a 9.33% reduction in MSE. The derived codebook is generalizable across three different cities, consistently improving prediction accuracy. Moreover, our user study confirms that the codebook-guided summaries provide cognitive gains for human participants in perceiving POIs' social inclusiveness. Our study marks an important step toward understanding implicit social barriers and inequalities, demonstrating the great potential of promoting social inclusiveness with AI.

**Authors**: Yizheng Zhang, Zhenjun Yu, Jiaxin Lai, Cewu Lu, Lei Han

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T08:56:19Z

**Summary**: We introduce AgentWorld, an interactive simulation platform for developing household mobile manipulation capabilities. Our platform combines automated scene construction that encompasses layout generation, semantic asset placement, visual material configuration, and physics simulation, with a dual-mode teleoperation system supporting both wheeled bases and humanoid locomotion policies for data collection. The resulting AgentWorld Dataset captures diverse tasks ranging from primitive actions (pick-and-place, push-pull, etc.) to multistage activities (serve drinks, heat up food, etc.) across living rooms, bedrooms, and kitchens. Through extensive benchmarking of imitation learning methods including behavior cloning, action chunking transformers, diffusion policies, and vision-language-action models, we demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for sim-to-real transfer. The integrated system provides a comprehensive solution for scalable robotic skill acquisition in complex home environments, bridging the gap between simulation-based training and real-world deployment. The code, datasets will be available at https://yizhengzhang1.github.io/agent_world/

### Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment for Language Models
**Authors**: Qiang He, Setareh Maghsudi

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T08:54:14Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that require careful balancing of multiple, often conflicting, objectives, such as informativeness versus conciseness, or helpfulness versus creativity. However, current alignment methods, primarily based on RLHF, optimize LLMs toward a single reward function, resulting in rigid behavior that fails to capture the complexity and diversity of human preferences. This limitation hinders the adaptability of LLMs to practical scenarios, making multi-objective alignment (MOA) a critical yet underexplored area. To bridge this gap, we propose Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment (PAMA), a principled and computationally efficient algorithm designed explicitly for MOA in LLMs. In contrast to computationally prohibitive multi-objective optimization (MOO) methods, PAMA transforms multi-objective RLHF into a convex optimization with a closed-form solution, significantly enhancing scalability. Traditional MOO approaches suffer from prohibitive O(n^2*d) complexity, where d represents the number of model parameters, typically in the billions for LLMs, rendering direct optimization infeasible. PAMA reduces this complexity to O(n) where n is the number of objectives, enabling optimization to be completed within milliseconds. We provide theoretical guarantees that PAMA converges to a Pareto stationary point, where no objective can be improved without degrading at least one other. Extensive experiments across language models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters demonstrate PAMA's robust and effective MOA capabilities, aligning with its theoretical advantages. PAMA provides a highly efficient solution to the MOA problem that was previously considered intractable, offering a practical and theoretically grounded approach to aligning LLMs with diverse human values, paving the way for versatile and adaptable real-world AI deployments.

### Towards Greater Leverage: Scaling Laws for Efficient Mixture-of-Experts   Language Models
**Authors**: Changxin Tian, Kunlong Chen, Jia Liu, Ziqi Liu, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T08:47:10Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently by decoupling total parameters from computational cost. However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge: predicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert activation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address this gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the computational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a large-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to systematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural configurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the expert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following predictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator with a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified scaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its configuration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained Ling-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active parameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an identical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance of the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources, thereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws. This work provides a principled and empirically-grounded foundation for the scaling of efficient MoE models.

### WSM: Decay-Free Learning Rate Schedule via Checkpoint Merging for LLM   Pre-training
**Authors**: Changxin Tian, Jiapeng Wang, Qian Zhao, Kunlong Chen, Jia Liu, Ziqi Liu, Jiaxin Mao, Wayne Xin Zhao, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T08:36:31Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in learning rate (LR) scheduling have demonstrated the effectiveness of decay-free approaches that eliminate the traditional decay phase while maintaining competitive performance. Model merging techniques have emerged as particularly promising solutions in this domain. We present Warmup-Stable and Merge (WSM), a general framework that establishes a formal connection between learning rate decay and model merging. WSM provides a unified theoretical foundation for emulating various decay strategies-including cosine decay, linear decay and inverse square root decay-as principled model averaging schemes, while remaining fully compatible with diverse optimization methods. Through extensive experiments, we identify merge duration-the training window for checkpoint aggregation-as the most critical factor influencing model performance, surpassing the importance of both checkpoint interval and merge quantity. Our framework consistently outperforms the widely-adopted Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) approach across multiple benchmarks, achieving significant improvements of +3.5% on MATH, +2.9% on HumanEval, and +5.5% on MMLU-Pro. The performance advantages extend to supervised fine-tuning scenarios, highlighting WSM's potential for long-term model refinement.

### Exploring Causal Effect of Social Bias on Faithfulness Hallucinations in   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhenliang Zhang, Junzhe Zhang, Xinyu Hu, HuiXuan Zhang, Xiaojun Wan

**Updated**: 2025-08-11T08:34:28Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to faithfulness hallucinations, where the output does not align with the input. In this study, we investigate whether social bias contributes to these hallucinations, a causal relationship that has not been explored. A key challenge is controlling confounders within the context, which complicates the isolation of causality between bias states and hallucinations. To address this, we utilize the Structural Causal Model (SCM) to establish and validate the causality and design bias interventions to control confounders. In addition, we develop the Bias Intervention Dataset (BID), which includes various social biases, enabling precise measurement of causal effects. Experiments on mainstream LLMs reveal that biases are significant causes of faithfulness hallucinations, and the effect of each bias state differs in direction. We further analyze the scope of these causal effects across various models, specifically focusing on unfairness hallucinations, which are primarily targeted by social bias, revealing the subtle yet significant causal effect of bias on hallucination generation.
