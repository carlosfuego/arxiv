**Authors**: Yijiong Yu, Huiqiang Jiang, Xufang Luo, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Dongsheng Li, Yuqing Yang, Yongfeng Huang, Lili Qiu

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various real-world scenarios due to their excellent generalization capabilities and robust generative abilities. However, they exhibit position bias, also known as "lost in the middle", a phenomenon that is especially pronounced in long-context scenarios, which indicates the placement of the key information in different positions of a prompt can significantly affect accuracy. This paper first explores the micro-level manifestations of position bias, concluding that attention weights are a micro-level expression of position bias. It further identifies that, in addition to position embeddings, causal attention mask also contributes to position bias by creating position-specific hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose a method to mitigate position bias by scaling this positional hidden states. Experiments on the NaturalQuestions Multi-document QA, KV retrieval, LongBench and timeline reorder tasks, using various models including RoPE models, context windowextended models, and Alibi models, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach. Our method can improve performance by up to 15.2% by modifying just one dimension of hidden states. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/PositionalHidden.

### VidCompress: Memory-Enhanced Temporal Compression for Video   Understanding in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Xiaohan Lan, Yitian Yuan, Zequn Jie, Lin Ma

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T09:07:25Z

**Summary**: Video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) possess significant potential for video understanding tasks. However, most Video-LLMs treat videos as a sequential set of individual frames, which results in insufficient temporal-spatial interaction that hinders fine-grained comprehension and difficulty in processing longer videos due to limited visual token capacity. To address these challenges, we propose VidCompress, a novel Video-LLM featuring memory-enhanced temporal compression. VidCompress employs a dual-compressor approach: a memory-enhanced compressor captures both short-term and long-term temporal relationships in videos and compresses the visual tokens using a multiscale transformer with a memory-cache mechanism, while a text-perceived compressor generates condensed visual tokens by utilizing Q-Former and integrating temporal contexts into query embeddings with cross attention. Experiments on several VideoQA datasets and comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that VidCompress efficiently models complex temporal-spatial relations and significantly outperforms existing Video-LLMs.

**Authors**: Zayd Muhammad Kawakibi Zuhri, Muhammad Farid Adilazuarda, Ayu Purwarianti, Alham Fikri Aji

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T08:45:18Z

**Summary**: Auto-regressive inference of transformers benefit greatly from Key-Value (KV) caching, but can lead to major memory bottlenecks as model size, batch size, and sequence length grow at scale. We introduce Multi-Layer Key-Value (MLKV) sharing, a novel approach extending KV sharing across transformer layers to reduce memory usage beyond what was possible with Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA). Evaluations on various NLP benchmarks and inference metrics using uptrained Pythia-160M variants demonstrate that MLKV significantly reduces memory usage with minimal performance loss, reducing KV cache size down to a factor of 6x compared to MQA. These results highlight MLKV's potential for efficient deployment of transformer models at scale. We provide code at https://github.com/zaydzuhri/pythia-mlkv

### A Training-free Sub-quadratic Cost Transformer Model Serving Framework   With Hierarchically Pruned Attention
**Authors**: Heejun Lee, Geon Park, Youngwan Lee, Jaduk Suh, Jina Kim, Wonyoung Jeong, Bumsik Kim, Hyemin Lee, Myeongjae Jeon, Sung Ju Hwang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T06:09:35Z

**Summary**: In modern large language models (LLMs), increasing the context length is crucial for improving comprehension and coherence in long-context, multi-modal, and retrieval-augmented language generation. While many recent transformer models attempt to extend their context length over a million tokens, they remain impractical due to the quadratic time and space complexities. Although recent works on linear and sparse attention mechanisms can achieve this goal, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train from scratch and significantly worse performance. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which reduces the time complexity of the attention mechanism to $O(T \log T)$ and the space complexity to $O(T)$, where $T$ is the sequence length. We notice a pattern in the attention scores of pretrained LLMs where tokens close together tend to have similar scores, which we call ``attention locality''. Based on this observation, we utilize a novel tree-search-like algorithm that estimates the top-$k$ key tokens for a given query on the fly, which is mathematically guaranteed to have better performance than random attention pruning. In addition to improving the time complexity of the attention mechanism, we further optimize GPU memory usage by implementing KV cache offloading, which stores only $O(\log T)$ tokens on the GPU while maintaining similar decoding throughput. Experiments on benchmarks show that HiP, with its training-free nature, significantly reduces both prefill and decoding latencies, as well as memory usage, while maintaining high-quality generation with minimal degradation. HiP enables pretrained LLMs to scale up to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs, potentially unlocking long-context LLM applications previously deemed infeasible.

### QSpec: Speculative Decoding with Complementary Quantization Schemes
**Authors**: Juntao Zhao, Wenhao Lu, Sheng Wang, Lingpeng Kong, Chuan Wu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T05:57:51Z

**Summary**: Quantization has been substantially adopted to accelerate inference and reduce memory consumption of large language models (LLMs). While activation-weight joint quantization speeds up the inference process through low-precision kernels, we demonstrate that it suffers severe performance degradation on multi-step reasoning tasks, rendering it ineffective. We propose a novel quantization paradigm called QSPEC, which seamlessly integrates two complementary quantization schemes for speculative decoding. Leveraging nearly cost-free execution switching, QSPEC drafts tokens with low-precision, fast activation-weight quantization, and verifies them with high-precision weight-only quantization, effectively combining the strengths of both quantization schemes. Compared to high-precision quantization methods, QSPEC empirically boosts token generation throughput by up to 1.80x without any quality compromise, distinguishing it from other low-precision quantization approaches. This enhancement is also consistent across various serving tasks, model sizes, quantization methods, and batch sizes. Unlike existing speculative decoding techniques, our approach reuses weights and the KV cache, avoiding additional memory overhead. Furthermore, QSPEC offers a plug-and-play advantage without requiring any training. We believe that QSPEC demonstrates unique strengths for future deployment of high-fidelity quantization schemes, particularly in memory-constrained scenarios (e.g., edge devices).

### Recommenadation aided Caching using Combinatorial Multi-armed Bandits
**Authors**: Pavamana K J, Chandramani Kishore Singh

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T05:34:07Z

**Summary**: We study content caching with recommendations in a wireless network where the users are connected through a base station equipped with a finite-capacity cache. We assume a fixed set of contents with unknown user preferences and content popularities. The base station can cache a subset of the contents and can also recommend subsets of the contents to different users in order to encourage them to request the recommended contents. Recommendations, depending on their acceptability, can thus be used to increase cache hits. We first assume that the users' recommendation acceptabilities are known and formulate the cache hit optimization problem as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB). We propose a UCB-based algorithm to decide which contents to cache and recommend and provide an upper bound on the regret of this algorithm. Subsequently, we consider a more general scenario where the users' recommendation acceptabilities are also unknown and propose another UCB-based algorithm that learns these as well. We numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithms and compare these to state-of-the-art algorithms.

### A Zoned Storage Optimized Flash Cache on ZNS SSDs
**Authors**: Chongzhuo Yang, Chang Guo, Ming Zhao, Zhichao Cao

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T04:35:49Z

**Summary**: Zoned Namespace SSDs (ZNS) are introduced recently to mitigate the block interface penalties of flash-based SSDs. It is a good opportunity for flash cache to address cache throughput and write amplification (WA) issues by fully controlling data allocation and garbage collection via zone-based interfaces. However, there are several critical challenges that need to be addressed including zone-interface compatibility, data management of large zone size, and a better tradeoff between throughput, cache hit ratio, and WA.   In this paper, we present Z-CacheLib, a zoned storage optimized flash cache on ZNS SSDs. In Z-CacheLib, we propose: 1) a new zStorage Engine for ZNS SSDs with low mapping and operational overhead, and 2) a novel zCache Engine with cross-layer optimizations to resolve the throughput regression and WA issues of garbage collection, which consists of delayed data eviction with virtual over-provisioning (vOP), a top-down eviction policy (zLRU) optimized from LRU, and a bottom-up drop mechanism (zDrop) for low WA. Our evaluation shows that Z-CacheLib can achieve up to 2X throughput, 5% improvement hit ratio, and almost no WA compared to CacheLib with compatible regular SSDs, demonstrating benefits of using ZNS SSDs for cache. Moreover, Z-CacheLib can achieve up to 6X throughput and 92% WA reduction compared with F2FS-based scheme.

### Enhancing High-Level Synthesis with Automated Pragma Insertion and Code   Transformation Framework
**Authors**: Stéphane Pouget, Louis-Noël Pouchet, Jason Cong

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T19:12:48Z

**Summary**: High-level synthesis, source-to-source compilers, and various Design Space Exploration techniques for pragma insertion have significantly improved the Quality of Results of generated designs. These tools offer benefits such as reduced development time and enhanced performance. However, achieving high-quality results often requires additional manual code transformations and tiling selections, which are typically performed separately or as pre-processing steps. Although DSE techniques enable code transformation upfront, the vastness of the search space often limits the exploration of all possible code transformations, making it challenging to determine which transformations are necessary. Additionally, ensuring correctness remains challenging, especially for complex transformations and optimizations.   To tackle this obstacle, we first propose a comprehensive framework leveraging HLS compilers. Our system streamlines code transformation, pragma insertion, and tiles size selection for on-chip data caching through a unified optimization problem, aiming to enhance parallelization, particularly beneficial for computation-bound kernels. Them employing a novel Non-Linear Programming (NLP) approach, we simultaneously ascertain transformations, pragmas, and tile sizes, focusing on regular loop-based kernels. Our evaluation demonstrates that our framework adeptly identifies the appropriate transformations, including scenarios where no transformation is necessary, and inserts pragmas to achieve a favorable Quality of Results.

### DuoAttention: Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference with Retrieval and   Streaming Heads
**Authors**: Guangxuan Xiao, Jiaming Tang, Jingwei Zuo, Junxian Guo, Shang Yang, Haotian Tang, Yao Fu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T17:59:58Z

**Summary**: Deploying long-context large language models (LLMs) is essential but poses significant computational and memory challenges. Caching all Key and Value (KV) states across all attention heads consumes substantial memory. Existing KV cache pruning methods either damage the long-context capabilities of LLMs or offer only limited efficiency improvements. In this paper, we identify that only a fraction of attention heads, a.k.a, Retrieval Heads, are critical for processing long contexts and require full attention across all tokens. In contrast, all other heads, which primarily focus on recent tokens and attention sinks--referred to as Streaming Heads--do not require full attention. Based on this insight, we introduce DuoAttention, a framework that only applies a full KV cache to retrieval heads while using a light-weight, constant-length KV cache for streaming heads, which reduces both LLM's decoding and pre-filling memory and latency without compromising its long-context abilities. DuoAttention uses a lightweight, optimization-based algorithm with synthetic data to identify retrieval heads accurately. Our method significantly reduces long-context inference memory by up to 2.55x for MHA and 1.67x for GQA models while speeding up decoding by up to 2.18x and 1.50x and accelerating pre-filling by up to 1.73x and 1.63x for MHA and GQA models, respectively, with minimal accuracy loss compared to full attention. Notably, combined with quantization, DuoAttention enables Llama-3-8B decoding with 3.3 million context length on a single A100 GPU. Code is provided in https://github.com/mit-han-lab/duo-attention.

### When Attention Sink Emerges in Language Models: An Empirical View
**Authors**: Xiangming Gu, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Qian Liu, Fengzhuo Zhang, Cunxiao Du, Ye Wang, Min Lin

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T17:50:28Z

**Summary**: Language Models (LMs) assign significant attention to the first token, even if it is not semantically important, which is known as attention sink. This phenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long context generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model quantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of attention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that attention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small models. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM pre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution, loss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its emergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective optimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly correlated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we find that attention sink acts more like key biases, storing extra attention scores, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value computation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems from tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax normalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention with other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without normalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Attention-Sink.

### Customize Your Visual Autoregressive Recipe with Set Autoregressive   Modeling
**Authors**: Wenze Liu, Le Zhuo, Yi Xin, Sheng Xia, Peng Gao, Xiangyu Yue

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T13:49:06Z

**Summary**: We introduce a new paradigm for AutoRegressive (AR) image generation, termed Set AutoRegressive Modeling (SAR). SAR generalizes the conventional AR to the next-set setting, i.e., splitting the sequence into arbitrary sets containing multiple tokens, rather than outputting each token in a fixed raster order. To accommodate SAR, we develop a straightforward architecture termed Fully Masked Transformer. We reveal that existing AR variants correspond to specific design choices of sequence order and output intervals within the SAR framework, with AR and Masked AR (MAR) as two extreme instances. Notably, SAR facilitates a seamless transition from AR to MAR, where intermediate states allow for training a causal model that benefits from both few-step inference and KV cache acceleration, thus leveraging the advantages of both AR and MAR. On the ImageNet benchmark, we carefully explore the properties of SAR by analyzing the impact of sequence order and output intervals on performance, as well as the generalization ability regarding inference order and steps. We further validate the potential of SAR by training a 900M text-to-image model capable of synthesizing photo-realistic images with any resolution. We hope our work may inspire more exploration and application of AR-based modeling across diverse modalities.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Token-wise Feature Caching
**Authors**: Chang Zou, Xuyang Liu, Ting Liu, Siteng Huang, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T09:35:35Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.

### FedCache 2.0: Federated Edge Learning with Knowledge Caching and Dataset   Distillation
**Authors**: Quyang Pan, Sheng Sun, Zhiyuan Wu, Yuwei Wang, Min Liu, Bo Gao, Jingyuan Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T07:58:39Z

**Summary**: Federated Edge Learning (FEL) has emerged as a promising approach for enabling edge devices to collaboratively train machine learning models while preserving data privacy. Despite its advantages, practical FEL deployment faces significant challenges related to device constraints and device-server interactions, necessitating heterogeneous, user-adaptive model training with limited and uncertain communication. In this paper, we introduce FedCache 2.0, a novel personalized FEL architecture that simultaneously addresses these challenges. FedCache 2.0 incorporates the benefits of both dataset distillation and knowledge cache-driven federated learning by storing and organizing distilled data as knowledge in the server-side knowledge cache. Moreover, a device-centric cache sampling strategy is introduced to tailor transferred knowledge for individual devices within controlled communication bandwidth. Extensive experiments on five datasets covering image recognition, audio understanding, and mobile sensor data mining tasks demonstrate that (1) FedCache 2.0 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods regardless of model structures, data distributions, and modalities. (2) FedCache 2.0 can train splendid personalized on-device models with at least $\times$28.6 improvement in communication efficiency.

### Caching Content Placement and Beamforming Co-design for IRS-Aided MIMO   Systems with Imperfect CSI
**Authors**: Meng Gao, Yang Wang, Huafu Li, Junqi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T04:49:22Z

**Summary**: When offloading links encounter deep fading and obstruction, edge caching cannot fully enhance wireless network performance and improve the QoS of edge nodes, as it fails to effectively reduce backhaul burden. The emerging technology of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) compensates for this disadvantage by creating a smart and reconfigurable wireless environment. Subsequently, we jointly design content placement and active/passive beamforming to minimize network costs under imperfect channel state information (CSI) in the IRS-oriented edge caching system. This minimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems. The content placement subproblem is addressed by applying KKT optimality conditions. We then develop the alternating optimization method to resolve precoder and reflection beamforming. Specifically, we reduce transmission power by first fixing the phase shift, reducing the problem to a convex one relative to the precoder, which is solved through convex optimization. Next, we fix the precoder and resolve the resulting reflection beamforming problem using the penalty convex-concave procedure (CCP) method. Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms uniform caching and random phase approaches in reducing transmission power and saving network costs. Eventually, the proposed approach offers potential improvements in the caching optimization and transmission robustness of wireless communication with imperfect CSI.

### Fast and Accurate Neural Rendering Using Semi-Gradients
**Authors**: In-Young Cho, Jaewoong Cho

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T04:30:38Z

**Summary**: We propose a simple yet effective neural network-based framework for global illumination rendering. Recently, rendering techniques that learn neural radiance caches by minimizing the difference (i.e., residual) between the left and right sides of the rendering equation have been suggested. Due to their ease of implementation and the advantage of excluding path integral calculations, these techniques have been applied to various fields, such as free-viewpoint rendering, differentiable rendering, and real-time rendering. However, issues of slow training and occasionally darkened renders have been noted. We identify the cause of these issues as the bias and high variance present in the gradient estimates of the existing residual-based objective function. To address this, we introduce a new objective function that maintains the same global optimum as before but allows for unbiased and low-variance gradient estimates, enabling faster and more accurate training of neural networks. In conclusion, this method is simply implemented by ignoring the partial derivatives of the right-hand side, and theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed loss.

**Authors**: Jinjin Shen, Yan Lin, Yijin Zhang, Weibin Zhang, Feng Shu, Jun Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T01:25:56Z

**Summary**: In order to avoid repeated task offloading and realize the reuse of popular task computing results, we construct a novel content caching-assisted vehicular edge computing (VEC) framework. In the face of irregular network topology and unknown environmental dynamics, we further propose a multi-agent graph attention reinforcement learning (MGARL) based edge caching scheme, which utilizes the graph attention convolution kernel to integrate the neighboring nodes' features of each agent and further enhance the cooperation among agents. Our simulation results show that our proposed scheme is capable of improving the utilization of caching resources while reducing the long-term task computing latency compared to the baselines.

### Leveraging Semantic Cues from Foundation Vision Models for Enhanced   Local Feature Correspondence
**Authors**: Felipe Cadar, Guilherme Potje, Renato Martins, Cédric Demonceaux, Erickson R. Nascimento

**Updated**: 2024-10-12T13:45:26Z

**Summary**: Visual correspondence is a crucial step in key computer vision tasks, including camera localization, image registration, and structure from motion. The most effective techniques for matching keypoints currently involve using learned sparse or dense matchers, which need pairs of images. These neural networks have a good general understanding of features from both images, but they often struggle to match points from different semantic areas. This paper presents a new method that uses semantic cues from foundation vision model features (like DINOv2) to enhance local feature matching by incorporating semantic reasoning into existing descriptors. Therefore, the learned descriptors do not require image pairs at inference time, allowing feature caching and fast matching using similarity search, unlike learned matchers. We present adapted versions of six existing descriptors, with an average increase in performance of 29% in camera localization, with comparable accuracy to existing matchers as LightGlue and LoFTR in two existing benchmarks. Both code and trained models are available at https://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/descriptors/reasoning_accv24

### Viscoelastic Effects on the Hydrodynamics of an Active Compound Particle
**Authors**: KVS Chaithanya, Sumesh P. Thampi

**Updated**: 2024-10-12T10:38:39Z

**Summary**: Understanding the hydrodynamics of microswimmers in viscoelastic fluids and confined environments is crucial for interpreting their behaviour in natural settings and designing synthetic microswimmers for practical applications like cargo transport. In this study, we explore the hydrodynamics of a concentric active compound particle - a model microswimmer (a squirmer) positioned at the centre of a viscoelastic fluid droplet (a model cargo) suspended in another viscoelastic medium. We consider the Oldroyd-B constitutive model to characterize the fluids and employ a perturbative approach in the Deborah number to analyze viscoelastic effects analytically, assuming a small Capillary number so that the droplet remains spherical and does not deform. We examine three cases: (i) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in a Newtonian fluid, (ii) a squirmer confined within a Newtonian fluid droplet suspended in a viscoelastic fluid, and (iii) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in another viscoelastic fluid. Our findings reveal that the swimming speeds of the squirmer and the droplet are determined by the complex interplay of viscoelasticity, the size ratio of the droplet to the squirmer (confinement strength), and the viscosity ratio of the surrounding fluid to the droplet fluid. A critical aspect of this interaction is the positioning of stagnation points within the fluid flow, which governs the distribution of polymeric stress. This distribution, in turn, plays a crucial role in determining the influence of viscoelasticity on the squirmer's dynamics. Our analysis suggests that viscoelastic effects can either enhance or hinder the swimming speed of the squirmer when confined in a droplet, depending on the specific configuration of the system.

### Fine-grained Attention I/O Complexity: Comprehensive Analysis for   Backward Passes
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Yufa Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-10-12T07:01:30Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing long-context information. However, the quadratic complexity of attention computation with respect to sequence length poses significant computational challenges, and I/O aware algorithms have been proposed. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the I/O complexity for attention mechanisms, focusing on backward passes by categorizing into small and large cache scenarios. Using the red-blue pebble game framework, we establish tight bounds on I/O complexity across all cache sizes. We confirm that the de facto standard I/O aware algorithm FlashAttention is optimal for both forward and backward passes for the large cache size scenario. For small cache sizes, we provide an algorithm that improves over existing methods and achieves the tight bounds. Additionally, we extend our analysis to sparse attention, a mainstream speeding-up approach, deriving fine-grained lower bounds for both forward and backward passes and both small and large caches. Our findings complete the theoretical foundation for I/O complexity in attention mechanisms, offering insights for designing efficient algorithms of LLM training and inference.

### In-place Switch: Reprogramming based SLC Cache Design for Hybrid 3D SSDs
**Authors**: Xufeng Yang, Zhengjian Cong, Congming Gao

**Updated**: 2024-10-12T02:11:14Z

**Summary**: Recently, 3D SSDs are widely adopted in PCs, data centers, and cloud storage systems. To increase capacity, high bit-density cells, such as Triple-Level Cell (TLC), are utilized within 3D SSDs. However, due to the inferior performance of TLC, a portion of TLCs is configured to operate as Single-Level Cell (SLC) to provide high performance, with host data initially directed to the SLCs. In SLC/TLC hybrid 3D SSDs, a portion of the TLC space is designated as an SLC cache to achieve high SSD performance by writing host data at the SLC speed. Given the limited size of the SLC cache, block reclamation is necessary to free up the SLC cache during idle periods. However, our preliminary studies indicate that the SLC cache can lead to a performance cliff if filled rapidly and cause significant write amplification when data migration occurs during idle times.   In this work, we propose leveraging a reprogram operation to address these challenges. Specifically, when the SLC cache is full or during idle periods, a reprogram operation is performed to switch used SLC pages to TLC pages in place (termed In-place Switch, IPS). Subsequently, other free TLC space is allocated as the new SLC cache. IPS can continuously provide sufficient SLC cache within SSDs, significantly improving write performance and reducing write amplification. Experimental results demonstrate that IPS can reduce write latency and write amplification by up to 0.75 times and 0.53 times, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art SLC cache technologies.

**Summary**: Recent advances in deep learning for processing point clouds hold increased interest in Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL) for 3D computer vision. This paper introduces a new method to tackle the Few-Shot Continual Incremental Learning (FSCIL) problem in 3D point cloud environments. We leverage a foundational 3D model trained extensively on point cloud data. Drawing from recent improvements in foundation models, known for their ability to work well across different tasks, we propose a novel strategy that does not require additional training to adapt to new tasks. Our approach uses a dual cache system: first, it uses previous test samples based on how confident the model was in its predictions to prevent forgetting, and second, it includes a small number of new task samples to prevent overfitting. This dynamic adaptation ensures strong performance across different learning tasks without needing lots of fine-tuning. We tested our approach on datasets like ModelNet, ShapeNet, ScanObjectNN, and CO3D, showing that it outperforms other FSCIL methods and demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

### Calibrated Cache Model for Few-Shot Vision-Language Model Adaptation
**Authors**: Kun Ding, Qiang Yu, Haojian Zhang, Gaofeng Meng, Shiming Xiang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:12:30Z

**Summary**: Cache-based approaches stand out as both effective and efficient for adapting vision-language models (VLMs). Nonetheless, the existing cache model overlooks three crucial aspects. 1) Pre-trained VLMs are mainly optimized for image-text similarity, neglecting the importance of image-image similarity, leading to a gap between pre-training and adaptation. 2) The current cache model is based on the Nadaraya-Watson (N-W) estimator, which disregards the intricate relationships among training samples while constructing weight function. 3) Under the condition of limited samples, the logits generated by cache model are of high uncertainty, directly using these logits without accounting for the confidence could be problematic. This work presents three calibration modules aimed at addressing the above challenges. Similarity Calibration refines the image-image similarity by using unlabeled images. We add a learnable projection layer with residual connection on top of the pre-trained image encoder of CLIP and optimize the parameters by minimizing self-supervised contrastive loss. Weight Calibration introduces a precision matrix into the weight function to adequately model the relation between training samples, transforming the existing cache model to a Gaussian Process (GP) regressor, which could be more accurate than N-W estimator. Confidence Calibration leverages the predictive variances computed by GP Regression to dynamically re-scale the logits of cache model, ensuring that the cache model's outputs are appropriately adjusted based on their confidence levels. Besides, to reduce the high complexity of GPs, we further propose a group-based learning strategy. Integrating the above designs, we propose both training-free and training-required variants. Extensive experiments on 11 few-shot classification datasets validate that the proposed methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

### Unlocking FedNL: Self-Contained Compute-Optimized Implementation
**Authors**: Konstantin Burlachenko, Peter Richtárik

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T12:19:18Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that enables intelligent agents to collaboratively train Machine Learning (ML) models in a distributed manner, eliminating the need for sharing their local data. The recent work (arXiv:2106.02969) introduces a family of Federated Newton Learn (FedNL) algorithms, marking a significant step towards applying second-order methods to FL and large-scale optimization. However, the reference FedNL prototype exhibits three serious practical drawbacks: (i) It requires 4.8 hours to launch a single experiment in a sever-grade workstation; (ii) The prototype only simulates multi-node setting; (iii) Prototype integration into resource-constrained applications is challenging. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we present a self-contained implementation of FedNL, FedNL-LS, FedNL-PP for single-node and multi-node settings. Our work resolves the aforementioned issues and reduces the wall clock time by x1000. With this FedNL outperforms alternatives for training logistic regression in a single-node -- CVXPY (arXiv:1603.00943), and in a multi-node -- Apache Spark (arXiv:1505.06807), Ray/Scikit-Learn (arXiv:1712.05889). Finally, we propose two practical-orientated compressors for FedNL - adaptive TopLEK and cache-aware RandSeqK, which fulfill the theory of FedNL.

### AsyncFS: Metadata Updates Made Asynchronous for Distributed Filesystems   with In-Network Coordination
**Authors**: Jingwei Xu, Mingkai Dong, Qiulin Tian, Ziyi Tian, Tong Xin, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T08:33:58Z

**Summary**: Distributed filesystems typically employ synchronous metadata updates, facing inherent challenges for access efficiency, load balancing, and directory contention, especially under dynamic and skewed workloads. This paper argues that synchronous updates are overly conservative for distributed filesystems. We propose AsyncFS with asynchronous metadata updates, allowing operations to return early and defer directory updates until respective read to enable latency hiding and conflict resolution. The key challenge is efficiently maintaining the synchronous semantics of metadata updates. To address this, AsyncFS is co-designed with a programmable switch, leveraging the constrained on-switch resources to holistically track directory states in the network with negligible cost. This allows AsyncFS to timely aggregate and efficiently apply delayed updates using batching and consolidation before directory reads. Evaluation shows that AsyncFS achieves up to 13.34$\times$ and 3.85$\times$ higher throughput, and 61.6% and 57.3% lower latency than two state-of-the-art distributed filesystems, InfiniFS and CFS-KV, respectively, on skewed workloads. For real-world workloads, AsyncFS improves end-to-end throughput by 21.1$\times$, 1.1$\times$ and 30.1% over Ceph, IndexFS and CFS-KV, respectively.

### ZipVL: Efficient Large Vision-Language Models with Dynamic Token   Sparsification and KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Yefei He, Feng Chen, Jing Liu, Wenqi Shao, Hong Zhou, Kaipeng Zhang, Bohan Zhuang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T07:24:21Z

**Summary**: The efficiency of large vision-language models (LVLMs) is constrained by the computational bottleneck of the attention mechanism during the prefill phase and the memory bottleneck of fetching the key-value (KV) cache in the decoding phase, particularly in scenarios involving high-resolution images or videos. Visual content often exhibits substantial redundancy, resulting in highly sparse attention maps within LVLMs. This sparsity can be leveraged to accelerate attention computation or compress the KV cache through various approaches. However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these bottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity concerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an efficient inference framework designed for LVLMs that resolves both computation and memory bottlenecks through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform attention mechanism solely on those important tokens to accelerate the prefill phase. To mitigate the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase, we employ mixed-precision quantization to the KV cache, where high-bit quantization is used for caches of important tokens, while low-bit quantization is applied to those of less importance. Our experiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by 2.6$\times$ and reduce GPU memory usage by 50.0%, with a minimal accuracy reduction of only 0.2% on Video-MME benchmark over LongVA-7B model, effectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.

### Long Context Compression with Activation Beacon
**Authors**: Peitian Zhang, Zheng Liu, Shitao Xiao, Ninglu Shao, Qiwei Ye, Zhicheng Dou

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T02:18:24Z

**Summary**: Long context compression is a critical research problem due to its significance in reducing the high computational and memory costs associated with LLMs. In this paper, we propose Activation Beacon, a plug-in module for transformer-based LLMs that targets effective, efficient, and flexible compression of long contexts. To achieve this, our method introduces the following technical designs. 1) We directly compress the activations (i.e. keys and values at every layer), rather than leveraging soft prompts to relay information (which constitute a major bottleneck to encapsulate the complex information within long contexts). 2) We tailor the compression workflow, where each fine-grained input unit is progressively compressed, enabling high-quality compression and efficient computation during both training and inference. 3) We train the model through compression-based auto-regression, making full use of plain texts and instructional data to optimize the model's compression performance. 4) During training, we randomly sample a compression ratio at each step, teaching the model to support a wide range of compression configurations. Extensive evaluations are conducted on various long-context tasks whose lengths (e.g., 128K) may far exceed the maximum training length (20K), such as document understanding, few-shot learning, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Whilst existing methods struggle to handle these challenging tasks, Activation Beacon maintains a comparable performance to the uncompressed baseline across various scenarios, achieving a 2x acceleration in inference time and an 8x reduction of memory costs for KV cache. Our data, model, and code have been released at \url{https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding/}.

### KV Prediction for Improved Time to First Token
**Authors**: Maxwell Horton, Qingqing Cao, Chenfan Sun, Yanzi Jin, Sachin Mehta, Mohammad Rastegari, Moin Nabi

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T21:55:11Z

**Summary**: Inference with transformer-based language models begins with a prompt processing step. In this step, the model generates the first output token and stores the KV cache needed for future generation steps. This prompt processing step can be computationally expensive, taking 10s of seconds or more for billion-parameter models on edge devices when prompt lengths or batch sizes rise. This degrades user experience by introducing significant latency into the model's outputs. To reduce the time spent producing the first output (known as the ``time to first token'', or TTFT) of a pretrained model, we introduce a novel method called KV Prediction. In our method, a small auxiliary model is used to process the prompt and produce an approximation of the KV cache used by a base model. This approximated KV cache is then used with the base model for autoregressive generation without the need to query the auxiliary model again. We demonstrate that our method produces a pareto-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-off when compared to baselines. On TriviaQA, we demonstrate relative accuracy improvements in the range of $15\%-50\%$ across a range of TTFT FLOPs budgets. We also demonstrate accuracy improvements of up to $30\%$ on HumanEval python code completion at fixed TTFT FLOPs budgets. Additionally, we benchmark models on an Apple M2 Pro CPU and demonstrate that our improvement in FLOPs translates to a TTFT speedup on hardware. We release our code at https://github.com/apple/corenet/tree/main/projects/kv-prediction .

### Amplifying Main Memory-Based Timing Covert and Side Channels using   Processing-in-Memory Operations
**Authors**: Konstantinos Kanellopoulos, F. Nisa Bostanci, Ataberk Olgun, A. Giray Yaglikci, Ismail Emir Yuksel, Nika Mansouri Ghiasi, Zulal Bingol, Mohammad Sadrosadati, Onur Mutlu

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T16:57:34Z

**Summary**: The adoption of processing-in-memory (PiM) architectures has been gaining momentum because they provide high performance and low energy consumption by alleviating the data movement bottleneck. Yet, the security of such architectures has not been thoroughly explored. The adoption of PiM solutions provides a new way to directly access main memory, which malicious user applications can exploit. We show that this new way to access main memory opens opportunities for high-throughput timing attacks that are hard-to-mitigate without significant performance overhead.   We introduce IMPACT, a set of high-throughput main memory-based timing attacks that leverage characteristics of PiM architectures to establish covert and side channels. IMPACT enables high-throughput communication and private information leakage by exploiting the shared DRAM row buffer. To achieve high throughput, IMPACT (i) eliminates cache bypassing steps required by processor-centric main memory and cache-based timing attacks and (ii) leverages the intrinsic parallelism of PiM operations. We showcase two applications of IMPACT. First, we build two covert-channel attacks that run on the host CPU and leverage different PiM approaches to gain direct and fast access to main memory and establish high-throughput communication covert channels. Second, we showcase a side-channel attack that leaks private information of concurrently running victim applications that are accelerated with PiM. Our results demonstrate that (i) our covert channels achieve 12.87 Mb/s and 14.16 Mb/s communication throughput, respectively, which is up to 4.91x and 5.41x faster than the state-of-the-art main memory-based covert channels, and (ii) our side-channel attack allows the attacker to leak secrets with a low error rate. To avoid such covert and side channels in emerging PiM systems, we propose and evaluate three defenses.

### C$^3$P-VoxelMap: Compact, Cumulative and Coalescible Probabilistic Voxel   Mapping
**Authors**: Xu Yang, Wenhao Li, Qijie Ge, Lulu Suo, Weijie Tang, Zhengyu Wei, Longxiang Huang, Bo Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T11:01:44Z

**Summary**: This work presents a compact, cumulative and coalescible probabilistic voxel mapping method to enhance performance, accuracy and memory efficiency in LiDAR odometry. Probabilistic voxel mapping requires storing past point clouds and re-iterating on them to update the uncertainty every iteration, which consumes large memory space and CPU cycles. To solve this problem, we propose a two-folded strategy. First, we introduce a compact point-free representation for probabilistic voxels and derive a cumulative update of the planar uncertainty without caching original point clouds. Our voxel structure only keeps track of a predetermined set of statistics for points that lie inside it. This method reduces the runtime complexity from $O(MN)$ to $O(N)$ and the space complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ where $M$ is the number of iterations and $N$ is the number of points. Second, to further minimize memory usage and enhance mapping accuracy, we provide a strategy to dynamically merge voxels associated with the same physical planes by taking advantage of the geometric features in the real world. Rather than scanning for these coalescible voxels constantly at every iteration, our merging strategy accumulates voxels in a locality-sensitive hash and triggers merging lazily. On-demand merging not only reduces memory footprint with minimal computational overhead but also improves localization accuracy thanks to cross-voxel denoising. Experiments exhibit 20% higher accuracy, 20% faster performance and 70% lower memory consumption than the state-of-the-art.

### SqueezeAttention: 2D Management of KV-Cache in LLM Inference via   Layer-wise Optimal Budget
**Authors**: Zihao Wang, Bin Cui, Shaoduo Gan

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T05:11:52Z

**Summary**: Optimizing the Key-Value (KV) cache of the Large Language Model (LLM) has been considered critical to saving the cost of inference. Most of the existing KV-cache compression algorithms attempted to sparsify the sequence of tokens by taking advantage of the different importance of tokens. However, most of these methods treat all layers equally, allocating the same KV budget to each layer. This approach is suboptimal, as some layers may be less sensitive to input tokens yet still receive the same budget as others. In this work, we found that by identifying the importance of attention layers, we could optimize the KV-cache jointly from two dimensions, i.e., sequence-wise and layer-wise. Based on our observations regarding layer-wise importance in inference, we propose SqueezeAttention to precisely optimize the allocation of KV-cache budget among layers on-the-fly and then incorporate three representative sequence-wise algorithms to compress the KV-cache for each layer with its very own budget. Specifically, we first measure each layer's importance by calculating the cosine similarity of the input prompt differences before and after the self-attention layers. Based on this similarity, we then categorize the layers into two groups and adjust their KV budgets accordingly. By optimizing the KV-cache from both sequence's and layer's dimensions, SqueezeAttention achieves around 30% to 70% of the memory reductions and up to 2.2 times of throughput improvements in a wide range of LLMs and benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/hetailang/SqueezeAttention.

### TurboRAG: Accelerating Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Precomputed   KV Caches for Chunked Text
**Authors**: Songshuo Lu, Hua Wang, Yutian Rong, Zhi Chen, Yaohua Tang

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T03:52:54Z

**Summary**: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems concatenate and process numerous retrieved document chunks for prefill which requires a large volume of computation, therefore leading to significant latency in time-to-first-token (TTFT). To reduce the computation overhead as well as TTFT, we introduce TurboRAG, a novel RAG system that redesigns the inference paradigm of the current RAG system by first pre-computing and storing the key-value (KV) caches of documents offline, and then directly retrieving the saved KV cache for prefill. Hence, online computation of KV caches is eliminated during inference. In addition, we provide a number of insights into the mask matrix and positional embedding mechanisms, plus fine-tune a pretrained language model to maintain model accuracy of TurboRAG. Our approach is applicable to most existing large language models and their applications without any requirement in modification of models and inference systems. Experimental results across a suite of RAG benchmarks demonstrate that TurboRAG reduces TTFT by up to 9.4x compared to the conventional RAG systems (on an average of 8.6x), but reserving comparable performance to the standard RAG systems.

### Teddy: Efficient Large-Scale Dataset Distillation via   Taylor-Approximated Matching
**Authors**: Ruonan Yu, Songhua Liu, Jingwen Ye, Xinchao Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T03:28:46Z

**Summary**: Dataset distillation or condensation refers to compressing a large-scale dataset into a much smaller one, enabling models trained on this synthetic dataset to generalize effectively on real data. Tackling this challenge, as defined, relies on a bi-level optimization algorithm: a novel model is trained in each iteration within a nested loop, with gradients propagated through an unrolled computation graph. However, this approach incurs high memory and time complexity, posing difficulties in scaling up to large datasets such as ImageNet. Addressing these concerns, this paper introduces Teddy, a Taylor-approximated dataset distillation framework designed to handle large-scale dataset and enhance efficiency. On the one hand, backed up by theoretical analysis, we propose a memory-efficient approximation derived from Taylor expansion, which transforms the original form dependent on multi-step gradients to a first-order one. On the other hand, rather than repeatedly training a novel model in each iteration, we unveil that employing a pre-cached pool of weak models, which can be generated from a single base model, enhances both time efficiency and performance concurrently, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Teddy attains state-of-the-art efficiency and performance on the Tiny-ImageNet and original-sized ImageNet-1K dataset, notably surpassing prior methods by up to 12.8%, while reducing 46.6% runtime. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Lexie-YU/Teddy.

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T15:57:03Z

**Summary**: Understanding the physics of electromagnetic pulse emission and nozzle damage is critical for the long-term operation of laser experiments with gas targets, particularly at facilities looking to produce stable sources of radiation at high repetition rate. We present a theoretical model of plasma formation and electrostatic charging when high-power lasers are focused inside gases. The model can be used to estimate the amplitude of gigahertz electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) produced by the laser and the extent of damage to the gas jet nozzle. Looking at a range of laser and target properties relevant to existing high-power laser systems, we find that EMP fields of tens to hundreds of kV/m can be generated several metres from the gas jet. Model predictions are compared with measurements of EMP, plasma formation and nozzle damage from two experiments on the VEGA-3 laser and one experiment on the Vulcan Petawatt laser.

### VEC-Sim: A Simulation Platform for Evaluating Service Caching and   Computation Offloading Policies in Vehicular Edge Networks
**Authors**: Fan Wu, Xiaolong Xu, Muhammad Bilal, Xiangwei Wang, Hao Cheng, Siyu Wu

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T14:28:59Z

**Summary**: Computer simulation platforms offer an alternative solution by emulating complex systems in a controlled manner. However, existing Edge Computing (EC) simulators, as well as general-purpose vehicular network simulators, are not tailored for VEC and lack dedicated support for modeling the distinct access pattern, entity mobility trajectory and other unique characteristics of VEC networks. To fill this gap, this paper proposes VEC-Sim, a versatile simulation platform for in-depth evaluation and analysis of various service caching and computation offloading policies in VEC networks. VEC-Sim incorporates realistic mechanisms to replicate real-world access patterns, including service feature vector, vehicle mobility modeling, evolving service popularity, new service upload and user preference shifts, etc. Moreover, its modular architecture and extensive Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow seamless integration of customized scheduling policies and user-defined metrics. A comprehensive evaluation of VEC-Sim's capabilities is undertaken in comparison to real-world ground truths. Results prove it to be accurate in reproducing classical scheduling algorithms and extremely effective in conducting case studies.

### LayerKV: Optimizing Large Language Model Serving with Layer-wise KV   Cache Management
**Authors**: Yi Xiong, Hao Wu, Changxu Shao, Ziqing Wang, Rui Zhang, Yuhong Guo, Junping Zhao, Ke Zhang, Zhenxuan Pan

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T11:40:31Z

**Summary**: The expanding context windows in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their capabilities in various applications, but they also introduce significant challenges in maintaining low latency, particularly in Time to First Token (TTFT). This paper identifies that the sharp rise in TTFT as context length increases is predominantly driven by queuing delays, which are caused by the growing demands for GPU Key-Value (KV) cache allocation clashing with the limited availability of KV cache blocks. To address this issue, we propose LayerKV, a simple yet effective plug-in method that effectively reduces TTFT without requiring additional hardware or compromising output performance, while seamlessly integrating with existing parallelism strategies and scheduling techniques. Specifically, LayerKV introduces layer-wise KV block allocation, management, and offloading for fine-grained control over system memory, coupled with an SLO-aware scheduler to optimize overall Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Comprehensive evaluations on representative models, ranging from 7B to 70B parameters, across various GPU configurations, demonstrate that LayerKV improves TTFT latency up to 69x and reduces SLO violation rates by 28.7%, significantly enhancing the user experience.

### Variations in Multi-Agent Actor-Critic Frameworks for Joint   Optimizations in UAV Swarm Networks: Recent Evolution, Challenges, and   Directions
**Authors**: Muhammad Morshed Alam, Muhammad Yeasir Aarafat, Tamim Hossain

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T07:22:40Z

**Summary**: Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm networks (UAVSNs) can effectively execute surveillance, connectivity, and computing services to ground users (GUs). These missions require trajectory planning, UAV-GUs association, task offloading, next-hop selection, and resources such as transmit power, bandwidth, caching, and computing allocation to improve network performances. Owing to the highly dynamic topology, limited resources, and non-availability of global knowledge, optimizing network performance in UAVSNs is very intricate. Hence, it requires an adaptive joint optimization framework that can tackle both discrete and continuous decision variables to ensure optimal network performance under dynamic constraints. Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based adaptive actor-critic framework can efficiently address these problems. This paper investigates the recent evolutions of actor-critic frameworks to deal with joint optimization problems in UAVSNs. In addition, challenges and potential solutions are addressed as research directions.

### UpDLRM: Accelerating Personalized Recommendation using Real-World PIM   Architecture
**Authors**: Sitian Chen, Haobin Tan, Amelie Chi Zhou, Yusen Li, Pavan Balaji

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T04:11:28Z

**Summary**: Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) have gained popularity in recommendation systems due to their effectiveness in handling large-scale recommendation tasks. The embedding layers of DLRMs have become the performance bottleneck due to their intensive needs on memory capacity and memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose UpDLRM, which utilizes real-world processingin-memory (PIM) hardware, UPMEM DPU, to boost the memory bandwidth and reduce recommendation latency. The parallel nature of the DPU memory can provide high aggregated bandwidth for the large number of irregular memory accesses in embedding lookups, thus offering great potential to reduce the inference latency. To fully utilize the DPU memory bandwidth, we further studied the embedding table partitioning problem to achieve good workload-balance and efficient data caching. Evaluations using real-world datasets show that, UpDLRM achieves much lower inference time for DLRM compared to both CPU-only and CPU-GPU hybrid counterparts.

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T02:51:27Z

**Summary**: The increasing complexity of deep learning models used for calculating user representations presents significant challenges, particularly with limited computational resources and strict service-level agreements (SLAs). Previous research efforts have focused on optimizing model inference but have overlooked a critical question: is it necessary to perform user model inference for every ad request in large-scale social networks? To address this question and these challenges, we first analyze user access patterns at Meta and find that most user model inferences occur within a short timeframe. T his observation reveals a triangular relationship among model complexity, embedding freshness, and service SLAs. Building on this insight, we designed, implemented, and evaluated ERCache, an efficient and robust caching framework for large-scale user representations in ads recommendation systems on social networks. ERCache categorizes cache into direct and failover types and applies customized settings and eviction policies for each model, effectively balancing model complexity, embedding freshness, and service SLAs, even considering the staleness introduced by caching. ERCache has been deployed at Meta for over six months, supporting more than 30 ranking models while efficiently conserving computational resources and complying with service SLA requirements.

### Simultaneous Masking, Not Prompting Optimization: A Paradigm Shift in   Fine-tuning LLMs for Simultaneous Translation
**Authors**: Matthew Raffel, Victor Agostinelli, Lizhong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T01:12:19Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.

### KV Cache Compression, But What Must We Give in Return? A Comprehensive   Benchmark of Long Context Capable Approaches
**Authors**: Jiayi Yuan, Hongyi Liu, Shaochen Zhong, Yu-Neng Chuang, Songchen Li, Guanchu Wang, Duy Le, Hongye Jin, Vipin Chaudhary, Zhaozhuo Xu, Zirui Liu, Xia Hu

**Summary**: Long context capability is a crucial competency for large language models (LLMs) as it mitigates the human struggle to digest long-form texts. This capability enables complex task-solving scenarios such as book summarization, code assistance, and many more tasks that are traditionally manpower-intensive. However, transformer-based LLMs face significant challenges with long context input due to the growing size of the KV cache and the intrinsic complexity of attending to extended inputs; where multiple schools of efficiency-driven approaches - such as KV cache quantization, token dropping, prompt compression, linear-time sequence models, and hybrid architectures - have been proposed to produce efficient yet long context-capable models. Despite these advancements, no existing work has comprehensively benchmarked these methods in a reasonably aligned environment. In this work, we fill this gap by providing a taxonomy of current methods and evaluating 10+ state-of-the-art approaches across seven categories of long context tasks. Our work reveals numerous previously unknown phenomena and offers insights - as well as a friendly workbench - for the future development of long context-capable LLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/henryzhongsc/longctx_bench.

### Numerical analysis of partial discharge ignition in H2 bubbles floating   in dielectric oils, for High-Voltage Solid State Transformer applications
**Authors**: Konstantinos Kourtzanidis, Panagiotis Dimitrakellis, Dimitrios Rakopoulos

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T11:28:30Z

**Summary**: We report on a self-consistent numerical analysis campaign of partial discharge (PD) ignition in H2 bubbles floating in biobased dielectric oils. We investigate various configurations (bubble sizes, bubble position, existence of protrusion) on a cylinder-to-cylinder setup that emulates a specific SST module (from SSTAR Horizon Europe project) under transient overvoltage as well as in its design operational conditions (VRMS = 66 kV, AC excitation of 50 Hz). Our results on electrical characteristics and plasma dynamics leading to the PD ignition, indicate that under transient overvoltage and for mm size bubbles (diameter 1 -4.5 mm), the smaller the bubble the less the inception voltage, while the peak inception voltage is higher than 70 kV. The existence of metallic protrusion can affect the inception voltage of a remote floating bubble only slightly and when this is close to the sharp tip. The extreme scenario of a protrusion in contact (inside) a gas bubble severely affects the insulation properties and drops the PD inception voltage remarkably. The larger the bubble and the sharper the tip of the protrusion the lower the inception peak voltage, that can reach values well below 40 kV. On the contrary and under design operation, larger bubbles increase the severity and probability of PD events, leading to lower instantaneous inception voltages. Current pulses produced in bubbles can quickly transit to intense streamer discharges (which can also transit to catastrophic arcing) if the operational frequency is reduced and/or under transient, HF overvoltage.

### Enhancing Playback Performance in Video Recommender Systems with an   On-Device Gating and Ranking Framework
**Authors**: Yunfei Yang, Zhenghao Qi, Honghuan Wu, Qi Song, Tieyao Zhang, Hao Li, Yimin Tu, Kaiqiao Zhan, Ben Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T09:53:10Z

**Summary**: Video recommender systems (RSs) have gained increasing attention in recent years. Existing mainstream RSs focus on optimizing the matching function between users and items. However, we noticed that users frequently encounter playback issues such as slow loading or stuttering while browsing the videos, especially in weak network conditions, which will lead to a subpar browsing experience, and may cause users to leave, even when the video content and recommendations are superior. It is quite a serious issue, yet easily overlooked. To tackle this issue, we propose an on-device Gating and Ranking Framework (GRF) that cooperates with server-side RS. Specifically, we utilize a gate model to identify videos that may have playback issues in real-time, and then we employ a ranking model to select the optimal result from a locally-cached pool to replace the stuttering videos. Our solution has been fully deployed on Kwai, a large-scale short video platform with hundreds of millions of users globally. Moreover, it significantly enhances video playback performance and improves overall user experience and retention rates.

### A Scalable State Sharing Protocol for Low-Resource Validator Nodes in   Blockchain Networks
**Authors**: Ruben Hias, Weihong Wang, Jan Vanhoof, Tom Van Cutsem

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T09:46:38Z

**Summary**: The perpetual growth of data stored on popular blockchains such as Ethereum leads to significant scalability challenges and substantial storage costs for operators of full nodes. Increasing costs may lead to fewer independently operated nodes in the network, which poses risks to decentralization (and hence network security), but also pushes decentralized app developers towards centrally hosted API services.   This paper introduces a new protocol that allows validator nodes to participate in a blockchain network without the need to store the full state of the network on each node. The key idea is to use the blockchain network as both a replicated state machine and as a distributed storage system. By distributing states across nodes and enabling efficient data retrieval through a Kademlia-inspired routing protocol, we reduce storage costs for validators. Cryptographic proofs (such as Merkle proofs) are used to allow nodes to verify data stored by other nodes without having to trust those nodes directly. While the protocol trades off data storage for increased network bandwidth, we show how gossiping and caching can minimize the increased bandwidth needs.   To validate our state sharing protocol, we conduct an extensive quantitative analysis of Ethereum's data storage and data access patterns. Our findings indicate that while our protocol significantly lowers storage needs, it comes with an increased bandwidth usage ranging from 1.5 MB to 5 MB per block, translating to an additional monthly bandwidth of 319 GB to 1,065 GB. Despite this, the size remains small enough such that it can be passed to all nodes and validated within Ethereum's 12-second block validation window. Further analysis shows that Merkle proofs are the most significant contributor to the additional bandwidth. To address this concern, we also analyze the impact of switching to the more space-efficient Verkle Proofs.

### CItruS: Chunked Instruction-aware State Eviction for Long Sequence   Modeling
**Authors**: Yu Bai, Xiyuan Zou, Heyan Huang, Sanxing Chen, Marc-Antoine Rondeau, Yang Gao, Jackie Chi Kit Cheung

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T04:25:41Z

**Summary**: Long sequence modeling has gained broad interest as large language models (LLMs) continue to advance. Recent research has identified that a large portion of hidden states within the key-value caches of Transformer models can be discarded (also termed evicted) without affecting the perplexity performance in generating long sequences. However, we show that these methods, despite preserving perplexity performance, often drop information that is important for solving downstream tasks, a problem which we call information neglect. To address this issue, we introduce Chunked Instruction-aware State Eviction (CItruS), a novel modeling technique that integrates the attention preferences useful for a downstream task into the eviction process of hidden states. In addition, we design a method for chunked sequence processing to further improve efficiency. Our training-free method exhibits superior performance on long sequence comprehension and retrieval tasks over several strong baselines under the same memory budget, while preserving language modeling perplexity. The code and data have been released at https://github.com/ybai-nlp/CItruS.

### PrefixQuant: Static Quantization Beats Dynamic through Prefixed Outliers   in LLMs
**Authors**: Mengzhao Chen, Yi Liu, Jiahao Wang, Yi Bin, Wenqi Shao, Ping Luo

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T17:59:35Z

**Summary**: Quantization is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) by enhancing memory efficiency and inference speed. Existing methods for activation quantization mainly address channel-wise outliers, often neglecting token-wise outliers, leading to reliance on costly per-token dynamic quantization. To address this, we introduce PrefixQuant, a novel technique that isolates outlier tokens offline without re-training. Specifically, PrefixQuant identifies high-frequency outlier tokens and prefixes them in the KV cache, preventing the generation of outlier tokens during inference and simplifying quantization. To our knowledge, PrefixQuant is the first to enable efficient per-tensor static quantization to outperform expensive per-token dynamic quantization. For instance, in W4A4KV4 (4- bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) Llama-3-8B, PrefixQuant with per-tensor static quantization achieves a 7.43 WikiText2 perplexity and 71.08% average accuracy on 5 common-sense reasoning tasks, outperforming previous per-token dynamic quantization methods like QuaRot with 0.98 perplexity improvement and +5.98 points accuracy. Additionally, the inference speed of W4A4 quantized models using PrefixQuant is 1.60x to 2.81x faster than FP16 models and exceeds QuaRot models by 1.2x to 1.3x. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/ChenMnZ/PrefixQuant}.

### Stateful Large Language Model Serving with Pensieve
**Authors**: Lingfan Yu, Jinkun Lin, Jinyang Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T17:21:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are wildly popular today and it is important to serve them efficiently. Existing LLM serving systems are stateless across requests. Consequently, when LLMs are used in the common setting of multi-turn conversations, a growing log of the conversation history must be processed alongside any request by the serving system at each turn, resulting in repeated processing.   In this paper, we design $Pensieve$, a system optimized for multi-turn conversation LLM serving. $Pensieve$ maintains the conversation state across requests by caching previously processed history to avoid duplicate processing. $Pensieve$'s multi-tier caching strategy can utilize both GPU and CPU memory to efficiently store and retrieve cached data. $Pensieve$ also generalizes the recent PagedAttention kernel to support attention between multiple input tokens with a GPU cache spread over non-contiguous memory. Our evaluation shows that $Pensieve$ can achieve $1.14$-$3.0\times$ the throughput of vLLM and TensorRT-LLM and significantly reduce latency.

### KV-Compress: Paged KV-Cache Compression with Variable Compression Rates   per Attention Head
**Authors**: Isaac Rehg

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T15:07:09Z

**Summary**: Context lengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) have exploded in recent years, with 128k-token context becoming a standard and million-token context becoming a reality. Efficiently supporting long-context inference remains challenging as the memory that must be allocated in key-value (KV) cache for a generation scales with its context length, limiting the number of long-context requests that can be served concurrently under a given memory budget. KV cache compression can mitigate this issue by removing under-utilized KVs from each attention head's cache and reducing its memory footprint. Higher theoretical compression rates can be achieved when the number of removed KVs varies across attention heads, but application of such a strategy within existing inference frameworks adds fragmentation and cannot realize the theoretical compression rates in physical memory. We introduce KV-Compress, a novel compression method that evicts contiguous KV blocks within a PagedAttention framework, reducing the memory footprint of the KV cache proportionally to this theoretical compression rate. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on LongBench for both Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct while lowering the total number of compressed KVs by 4x compared with prior methods. Evaluations on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-FP8 achieve compression rates up to 8x with negligible impact on performance, and up to 64x while retaining over 90% of full-cache performance for all but three of the suite's subsets. We benchmark an integration of our method with vLLM that increases total throughput by up to 5.18x by enabling larger decoding batches.

### TidalDecode: Fast and Accurate LLM Decoding with Position Persistent   Sparse Attention
**Authors**: Lijie Yang, Zhihao Zhang, Zhuofu Chen, Zikun Li, Zhihao Jia

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T14:30:27Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have driven significant advancements across diverse NLP tasks, with long-context models gaining prominence for handling extended inputs. However, the expanding key-value (KV) cache size required by Transformer architectures intensifies the memory constraints, particularly during the decoding phase, creating a significant bottleneck. Existing sparse attention mechanisms designed to address this bottleneck have two limitations: (1) they often fail to reliably identify the most relevant tokens for attention, and (2) they overlook the spatial coherence of token selection across consecutive Transformer layers, which can lead to performance degradation and substantial overhead in token selection. This paper introduces TidalDecode, a simple yet effective algorithm and system for fast and accurate LLM decoding through position persistent sparse attention. TidalDecode leverages the spatial coherence of tokens selected by existing sparse attention methods and introduces a few token selection layers that perform full attention to identify the tokens with the highest attention scores, while all other layers perform sparse attention with the pre-selected tokens. This design enables TidalDecode to substantially reduce the overhead of token selection for sparse attention without sacrificing the quality of the generated results. Evaluation on a diverse set of LLMs and tasks shows that TidalDecode closely matches the generative performance of full attention methods while reducing the LLM decoding latency by up to 2.1x.

### FAME: Towards Factual Multi-Task Model Editing
**Authors**: Li Zeng, Yingyu Shan, Zeming Liu, Jiashu Yao, Yuhang Guo

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T13:46:06Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) embed extensive knowledge and utilize it to perform exceptionally well across various tasks. Nevertheless, outdated knowledge or factual errors within LLMs can lead to misleading or incorrect responses, causing significant issues in practical applications. To rectify the fatal flaw without the necessity for costly model retraining, various model editing approaches have been proposed to correct inaccurate knowledge within LLMs in a cost-efficient way. To evaluate these model editing methods, previous work introduced a series of datasets. However, most of the previous datasets only contain fabricated data in a single format, which diverges from real-world model editing scenarios, raising doubts about their usability in practice. To facilitate the application of model editing in real-world scenarios, we propose the challenge of practicality. To resolve such challenges and effectively enhance the capabilities of LLMs, we present FAME, an factual, comprehensive, and multi-task dataset, which is designed to enhance the practicality of model editing. We then propose SKEME, a model editing method that uses a novel caching mechanism to ensure synchronization with the real world. The experiments demonstrate that SKEME performs excellently across various tasks and scenarios, confirming its practicality.

### Extended Functional Representation Lemma: A Tool For Privacy, Semantic   Representation, Caching, and Compression Design
**Authors**: Amirreza Zamani, Mikael Skoglund

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T13:33:23Z

**Summary**: This paper provides an overview of a problem in information-theoretic privacy mechanism design, addressing two scenarios in which private data is either observable or hidden. In each scenario, different privacy measures are used, including bounded mutual information and two types of per-letter privacy constraints. Considering the first scenario, an agent observes useful data that is correlated with private data, and wants to disclose the useful information to a user. Due to the privacy concerns, direct disclosure is prohibited. Hence, a privacy mechanism is designed to generate disclosed data which maximizes the revealed information about the useful data while satisfying a privacy constraint. In the second scenario, the agent has additionally access to the private data. We discuss how the Functional Representation Lemma, the Strong Functional Representation Lemma, and their extended versions are useful for designing low-complexity privacy mechanisms that achieve optimal privacy-utility trade-offs under certain constraints. Furthermore, another privacy design problem is presented where part of the private attribute is more private than the remaining part. Finally, we provide applications including semantic communications, caching and delivery, and compression designs, where the approach can be applied.

### Fast State Restoration in LLM Serving with HCache
**Authors**: Shiwei Gao, Youmin Chen, Jiwu Shu

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T13:03:45Z

**Summary**: The growing complexity of LLM usage today, e.g., multi-round conversation and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), makes contextual states (i.e., KV cache) reusable across user requests. Given the capacity constraints of GPU memory, only a limited number of contexts can be cached on GPU for reusing. Existing inference systems typically evict part of the KV cache and restore it by recomputing it from the original tokens or offloading it to host storage for later retrieval, both of which introduce substantial computational or I/O overheads. We propose HCache, a novel LLM state restoration method. Its key idea is to restore LLM states from intermediate activations and thus utilize computational and I/O resources with low overhead. We enhance HCache with two techniques, including i) a bubble-free restoration scheduler that integrates resource-complementary methods to optimize the balance between computation and IO tasks; and ii) a chunk-based storage manager to address the layout mismatch issue (i.e., layer-before-token saving versus token-before-layer restoration). Our evaluations, conducted using real-world tasks, show that HCache reduces the TTFT by up to 1.93X compared to KV offload while consuming 1.92-2.40X less storage space; compared to token recomputation, HCache achieves up to 5.73X reduction in TTFT.

### SpinQuant: LLM quantization with learned rotations
**Authors**: Zechun Liu, Changsheng Zhao, Igor Fedorov, Bilge Soran, Dhruv Choudhary, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yuandong Tian, Tijmen Blankevoort

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T01:27:59Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques applied to weights, activations, and the KV cache greatly reduce memory usage, latency, and power consumption of Large Language Models (LLMs), but may lead to large quantization errors when outliers are present. Rotating activation or weight matrices helps remove outliers and benefits quantization. In this work, we identify a collection of applicable rotation parameterizations that lead to identical outputs in full-precision Transformer architectures while enhancing quantization accuracy. In addition, we find that some random rotations lead to much better quantization than others, with an up to 13 points difference in downstream zero-shot reasoning performance. As a result, we propose SpinQuant, a novel approach that incorporates learned rotation matrices for optimal quantized network accuracy. With 4-bit quantization of weight, activation, and KV-cache, SpinQuant narrows the accuracy gap on zero-shot reasoning tasks with full precision to merely 2.9 points on the LLaMA-2 7B model, surpassing LLM-QAT by 19.1 points and SmoothQuant by 25.0 points. Furthermore, SpinQuant also outperforms concurrent work QuaRot, which applies random rotations to remove outliers. In particular, for LLaMA-3 8B models that are hard to quantize, SpinQuant reduces the gap to full precision by up to 45.1% relative to QuaRot.

### Superposed Decoding: Multiple Generations from a Single Autoregressive   Inference Pass
**Authors**: Ethan Shen, Alan Fan, Sarah M. Pratt, Jae Sung Park, Matthew Wallingford, Sham M. Kakade, Ari Holtzman, Ranjay Krishna, Ali Farhadi, Aditya Kusupati

**Updated**: 2024-10-06T22:13:16Z

**Summary**: Many applications today provide users with multiple auto-complete drafts as they type, including GitHub's code completion, Gmail's smart compose, and Apple's messaging auto-suggestions. Under the hood, language models support this by running an autoregressive inference pass to provide a draft. Consequently, providing $k$ drafts to the user requires running an expensive language model $k$ times. To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$ inference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that generates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference pass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token embeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the language model. At every inference step we combine the $k$ drafts with the top-$k$ tokens to get $k^2$ new drafts and cache the $k$ most likely options, using an n-gram interpolation with minimal compute overhead to filter out incoherent generations. Our experiments show that $k$ drafts from Superposed Decoding are at least as coherent and factual as Nucleus Sampling and Greedy Decoding respectively, while being at least $2.44\times$ faster for $k\ge3$. In a compute-normalized setting, user evaluations demonstrably favor text generated by Superposed Decoding over Nucleus Sampling. Superposed Decoding can also be combined with other decoding strategies, resulting in universal coverage gains when scaling inference time compute. Code and more examples open-sourced at https://github.com/RAIVNLab/SuperposedDecoding.

### Self-compensating Light Calorimetry with Liquid Argon Time Projection   Chamber for GeV Neutrino Physics
**Authors**: Xuyang Ning, Wei Shi, Chao Zhang, Ciro Riccio, Jay Hyun Jo

**Updated**: 2024-10-06T19:36:34Z

**Summary**: Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) is an exceptional dual calorimeter capable of estimating the energy of incident particles through both the ionization charge and the scintillation light. Our studies show that due to the mechanisms of charge recombination and light generation involved in the energy dissipation in liquid argon, light calorimetry in LArTPCs is inherently self-compensating: the missing energy in the hadronic component is compensated for by the extra recombination luminescence compared to the electromagnetic component. Good compensation of the electron-to-hadron response ratio (e/h) around unity can be achieved across a broad range of drift electric fields from 0.2 to 1.8 kV/cm.This inherent self-compensation enhances the appeal of light calorimetry in LArTPCs, complementing the well-established charge calorimetry. Using GeV neutrinos as a case study, we show that light calorimetry can achieve an energy resolution comparable to the more sophisticated charge imaging calorimetry. The synergy between light and charge calorimetry offers a novel approach to evaluating and mitigating systematic uncertainties in energy measurements with LArTPCs.

### Lazy Qubit Reordering for Accelerating Parallel State-Vector-based   Quantum Circuit Simulation
**Authors**: Yusuke Teranishi, Shoma Hiraoka, Wataru Mizukami, Masao Okita, Fumihiko Ino

**Updated**: 2024-10-05T18:20:37Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes two quantum operation scheduling methods for accelerating parallel state-vector-based quantum circuit simulation using multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). The proposed methods reduce all-to-all communication caused by qubit reordering (QR), which can dominate the overhead of parallel simulation. Our approach eliminates redundant QRs by introducing intentional delays in QR communications such that multiple QRs can be aggregated into a single QR. The delays are carefully introduced based on the principles of time-space tiling, or a cache optimization technique for classical computers, which we use to arrange the execution order of quantum operations. Moreover, we present an extended scheduling method for the hierarchical interconnection of GPU cluster systems to avoid slow inter-node communication. We develop these methods tailored for two primary procedures in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulation: quantum state update (QSU) and expectation value computation (EVC). Experimental validation on 32-GPU executions demonstrates acceleration in QSU and EVC -- up to 54$\times$ and 606$\times$, respectively -- compared to existing methods. Moreover, our extended scheduling method further reduced communication time by up to 15\% in a two-layered interconnected cluster system. Our approach is useful for any quantum circuit simulations, including QSU and/or EVC.

### SwiftKV: Fast Prefill-Optimized Inference with Knowledge-Preserving   Model Transformation
**Authors**: Aurick Qiao, Zhewei Yao, Samyam Rajbhandari, Yuxiong He

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T22:45:26Z

**Summary**: LLM inference for popular enterprise use cases, such as summarization, RAG, and code-generation, typically observes orders of magnitude longer prompt lengths than generation lengths. This characteristic leads to high cost of prefill and increased response latency. In this paper, we present SwiftKV, a novel model transformation and distillation procedure specifically designed to reduce the time and cost of processing prompt tokens while preserving high quality of generated tokens. SwiftKV combines three key mechanisms: i) SingleInputKV, which prefills later layers' KV cache using a much earlier layer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip much of the model computation, ii) AcrossKV, which merges the KV caches of neighboring layers to reduce the memory footprint and support larger batch size for higher throughput, and iii) a knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs for SwiftKV with minimal accuracy impact and low compute and data requirement. For Llama-3.1-8B and 70B, SwiftKV reduces the compute requirement of prefill by 50% and the memory requirement of the KV cache by 62.5% while incurring minimum quality degradation across a wide range of tasks. In the end-to-end inference serving using an optimized vLLM implementation, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x higher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve a staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which translates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B in 16-bit precision on 4x H100 GPUs.

### HarmoniCa: Harmonizing Training and Inference for Better Feature Cache   in Diffusion Transformer Acceleration
**Authors**: Yushi Huang, Zining Wang, Ruihao Gong, Jing Liu, Xinjie Zhang, Jun Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T10:14:17Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have gained prominence for outstanding scalability and extraordinary performance in generative tasks. However, their considerable inference costs impede practical deployment. The feature cache mechanism, which involves storing and retrieving redundant computations across timesteps, holds promise for reducing per-step inference time in diffusion models. Most existing caching methods for DiT are manually designed. Although the learning-based approach attempts to optimize strategies adaptively, it suffers from discrepancies between training and inference, which hampers both the performance and acceleration ratio. Upon detailed analysis, we pinpoint that these discrepancies primarily stem from two aspects: (1) Prior Timestep Disregard, where training ignores the effect of cache usage at earlier timesteps, and (2) Objective Mismatch, where the training target (align predicted noise in each timestep) deviates from the goal of inference (generate the high-quality image). To alleviate these discrepancies, we propose HarmoniCa, a novel method that Harmonizes training and inference with a novel learning-based Caching framework built upon Step-Wise Denoising Training (SDT) and Image Error Proxy-Guided Objective (IEPO). Compared to the traditional training paradigm, the newly proposed SDT maintains the continuity of the denoising process, enabling the model to leverage information from prior timesteps during training, similar to the way it operates during inference. Furthermore, we design IEPO, which integrates an efficient proxy mechanism to approximate the final image error caused by reusing the cached feature. Therefore, IEPO helps balance final image quality and cache utilization, resolving the issue of training that only considers the impact of cache usage on the predicted output at each timestep.

### Unleashing the Potential of the Diffusion Model in Few-shot Semantic   Segmentation
**Authors**: Muzhi Zhu, Yang Liu, Zekai Luo, Chenchen Jing, Hao Chen, Guangkai Xu, Xinlong Wang, Chunhua Shen

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T07:54:58Z

**Summary**: The Diffusion Model has not only garnered noteworthy achievements in the realm of image generation but has also demonstrated its potential as an effective pretraining method utilizing unlabeled data. Drawing from the extensive potential unveiled by the Diffusion Model in both semantic correspondence and open vocabulary segmentation, our work initiates an investigation into employing the Latent Diffusion Model for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation. Recently, inspired by the in-context learning ability of large language models, Few-shot Semantic Segmentation has evolved into In-context Segmentation tasks, morphing into a crucial element in assessing generalist segmentation models. In this context, we concentrate on Few-shot Semantic Segmentation, establishing a solid foundation for the future development of a Diffusion-based generalist model for segmentation. Our initial focus lies in understanding how to facilitate interaction between the query image and the support image, resulting in the proposal of a KV fusion method within the self-attention framework. Subsequently, we delve deeper into optimizing the infusion of information from the support mask and simultaneously re-evaluating how to provide reasonable supervision from the query mask. Based on our analysis, we establish a simple and effective framework named DiffewS, maximally retaining the original Latent Diffusion Model's generative framework and effectively utilizing the pre-training prior. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the previous SOTA models in multiple settings.

### Prefixing Attention Sinks can Mitigate Activation Outliers for Large   Language Model Quantization
**Authors**: Seungwoo Son, Wonpyo Park, Woohyun Han, Kyuyeun Kim, Jaeho Lee

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T06:26:20Z

**Summary**: Despite recent advances in LLM quantization, activation quantization remains to be challenging due to the activation outliers. Conventional remedies, e.g., mixing precisions for different channels, introduce extra overhead and reduce the speedup. In this work, we develop a simple yet effective strategy to facilitate per-tensor activation quantization by preventing the generation of problematic tokens. Precisely, we propose a method to find a set of key-value cache, coined CushionCache, which mitigates outliers in subsequent tokens when inserted as a prefix. CushionCache works in two steps: First, we greedily search for a prompt token sequence that minimizes the maximum activation values in subsequent tokens. Then, we further tune the token cache to regularize the activations of subsequent tokens to be more quantization-friendly. The proposed method successfully addresses activation outliers of LLMs, providing a substantial performance boost for per-tensor activation quantization methods. We thoroughly evaluate our method over a wide range of models and benchmarks and find that it significantly surpasses the established baseline of per-tensor W8A8 quantization and can be seamlessly integrated with the recent activation quantization method.

### LoRC: Low-Rank Compression for LLMs KV Cache with a Progressive   Compression Strategy
**Authors**: Rongzhi Zhang, Kuang Wang, Liyuan Liu, Shuohang Wang, Hao Cheng, Chao Zhang, Yelong Shen

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T03:10:53Z

**Summary**: The Key-Value (KV) cache is a crucial component in serving transformer-based autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling faster inference by storing previously computed KV vectors. However, its memory consumption scales linearly with sequence length and batch size, posing a significant bottleneck in LLM deployment. Existing approaches to mitigate this issue include: (1) efficient attention variants integrated in upcycling stages, which requires extensive parameter tuning thus unsuitable for pre-trained LLMs; (2) KV cache compression at test time, primarily through token eviction policies, which often overlook inter-layer dependencies and can be task-specific.   This paper introduces an orthogonal approach to KV cache compression. We propose a low-rank approximation of KV weight matrices, allowing for plug-in integration with existing transformer-based LLMs without model retraining. To effectively compress KV cache at the weight level, we adjust for layerwise sensitivity and introduce a progressive compression strategy, which is supported by our theoretical analysis on how compression errors accumulate in deep networks. Our method is designed to function without model tuning in upcycling stages or task-specific profiling in test stages. Extensive experiments with LLaMA models ranging from 8B to 70B parameters across various tasks show that our approach significantly reduces the GPU memory footprint while maintaining performance.

### UNComp: Uncertainty-Aware Long-Context Compressor for Efficient Large   Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Jing Xiong, Jianghan Shen, Fanghua Ye, Chaofan Tao, Zhongwei Wan, Jianqiao Lu, Xun Wu, Chuanyang Zheng, Zhijiang Guo, Lingpeng Kong, Ngai Wong

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T02:32:36Z

**Summary**: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their high memory and computational demands, especially during long-context inference. While key-value (KV) caching accelerates inference by reusing previously computed keys and values, it also introduces significant memory overhead. Existing KV cache compression methods such as eviction and merging typically compress the KV cache after it is generated and overlook the eviction of hidden states, failing to improve the speed of the prefilling stage. Additionally, applying a uniform compression rate across different attention heads can harm crucial retrieval heads in needle-in-a-haystack tasks due to excessive compression. In this paper, we propose UNComp, an uncertainty-aware compression scheme that leverages matrix entropy to estimate model uncertainty across layers and heads at the token sequence level. By grouping layers and heads based on their uncertainty, UNComp adaptively compresses both the hidden states and the KV cache. Our method achieves a 1.6x speedup in the prefilling stage and reduces the KV cache to 4.74% of its original size, resulting in a 6.4x increase in throughput and a 1.4x speedup in inference with only a 1.41% performance loss. Remarkably, in needle-in-a-haystack tasks, UNComp outperforms the full-size KV cache even when compressed to 9.38% of its original size. Our approach offers an efficient, training-free Grouped-Query Attention paradigm that can be seamlessly integrated into existing KV cache schemes.

### Compute Or Load KV Cache? Why Not Both?
**Authors**: Shuowei Jin, Xueshen Liu, Qingzhao Zhang, Z. Morley Mao

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T01:11:09Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly increased context window sizes, enabling sophisticated applications but also introducing substantial computational overheads, particularly computing key-value (KV) cache in the prefill stage. Prefix caching has emerged to save GPU power in this scenario, which saves KV cache at disks and reuse them across multiple queries. However, traditional prefix caching mechanisms often suffer from substantial latency because the speed of loading KV cache from disks to GPU memory is bottlenecked by the throughput of I/O devices. To optimize the latency of long-context prefill, we propose Cake, a novel KV cache loader, which employs a bidirectional parallelized KV cache generation strategy. Upon receiving a prefill task, Cake simultaneously and dynamically loads saved KV cache from prefix cache locations and computes KV cache on local GPUs, maximizing the utilization of available computation and I/O bandwidth resources. Additionally, Cake automatically adapts to diverse system statuses without manual parameter. tuning. In experiments on various prompt datasets, GPUs, and I/O devices, Cake offers up to 68.1% Time To First Token (TTFT) reduction compare with compute-only method and 94.6% TTFT reduction compare with I/O-only method.

### DeFT: Decoding with Flash Tree-attention for Efficient Tree-structured   LLM Inference
**Authors**: Jinwei Yao, Kaiqi Chen, Kexun Zhang, Jiaxuan You, Binhang Yuan, Zeke Wang, Tao Lin

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T22:17:01Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex tasks that process multiple generation calls in a tree structure with shared prefixes of tokens, including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, speculative decoding, etc. However, existing inference systems for tree-based applications are inefficient due to improper partitioning of queries and KV cache during attention calculation. This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory access (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load balancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory and shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges, we propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient attention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions. DeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention calculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading KV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose Flattened Tree KV Splitting, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the KV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU utilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99 KV cache IO and nearly 100 IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves up to 2.52/3.82x speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three practical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention algorithms.

### GaNI: Global and Near Field Illumination Aware Neural Inverse Rendering
**Authors**: Jiaye Wu, Saeed Hadadan, Geng Lin, Matthias Zwicker, David Jacobs, Roni Sengupta

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T22:11:19Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present GaNI, a Global and Near-field Illumination-aware neural inverse rendering technique that can reconstruct geometry, albedo, and roughness parameters from images of a scene captured with co-located light and camera. Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera focus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and near-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We introduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct the geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse neural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo and roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple technical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that NeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections from the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of near-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle specular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant illumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during capture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and additional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method outperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering techniques. Our approach produces significantly better reflectance and slightly better geometry than capture strategies that do not require a dark room.

### ReLIC: A Recipe for 64k Steps of In-Context Reinforcement Learning for   Embodied AI
**Authors**: Ahmad Elawady, Gunjan Chhablani, Ram Ramrakhya, Karmesh Yadav, Dhruv Batra, Zsolt Kira, Andrew Szot

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T17:58:11Z

**Summary**: Intelligent embodied agents need to quickly adapt to new scenarios by integrating long histories of experience into decision-making. For instance, a robot in an unfamiliar house initially wouldn't know the locations of objects needed for tasks and might perform inefficiently. However, as it gathers more experience, it should learn the layout of its environment and remember where objects are, allowing it to complete new tasks more efficiently. To enable such rapid adaptation to new tasks, we present ReLIC, a new approach for in-context reinforcement learning (RL) for embodied agents. With ReLIC, agents are capable of adapting to new environments using 64,000 steps of in-context experience with full attention while being trained through self-generated experience via RL. We achieve this by proposing a novel policy update scheme for on-policy RL called "partial updates'' as well as a Sink-KV mechanism that enables effective utilization of a long observation history for embodied agents. Our method outperforms a variety of meta-RL baselines in adapting to unseen houses in an embodied multi-object navigation task. In addition, we find that ReLIC is capable of few-shot imitation learning despite never being trained with expert demonstrations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of ReLIC, highlighting that the combination of large-scale RL training, the proposed partial updates scheme, and the Sink-KV are essential for effective in-context learning. The code for ReLIC and all our experiments is at https://github.com/aielawady/relic

### Preble: Efficient Distributed Prompt Scheduling for LLM Serving
**Authors**: Vikranth Srivatsa, Zijian He, Reyna Abhyankar, Dongming Li, Yiying Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T17:50:33Z

**Summary**: Prompts to large language models (LLMs) have evolved beyond simple user questions. For LLMs to solve complex problems, today's practices are to include domain-specific instructions, illustration of tool usages, and/or long context such as textbook chapters in prompts. As such, many parts of prompts are repetitive across requests. Recent works propose to cache and reuse KV state of prompts. However, they are all confined to a single-GPU optimization, while production LLM serving systems are distributed by nature.   This paper proposes Preble, the first distributed LLM serving platform that targets and optimizes for prompt sharing. We designed a distributed scheduling system that co-optimizes KV state reuse and computation load-balancing with a new scheduling algorithm and a hierarchical scheduling mechanism. Our evaluation of Preble with real workloads and request arrival patterns on two open-source LLMs shows that Preble outperforms the SOTA serving systems by 1.5X to 14.5X on average latency and 2X to 10X on p99 latency.

### Disaggregated Memory with SmartNIC Offloading: a Case Study on Graph   Processing
**Authors**: Jacob Wahlgren, Gabin Schieffer, Maya Gokhale, Roger Pearce, Ivy Peng

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T15:41:31Z

**Summary**: Disaggregated memory breaks the boundary of monolithic servers to enable memory provisioning on demand. Using network-attached memory to provide memory expansion for memory-intensive applications on compute nodes can improve the overall memory utilization on a cluster and reduce the total cost of ownership. However, current software solutions for leveraging network-attached memory must consume resources on the compute node for memory management tasks. Emerging off-path smartNICs provide general-purpose programmability at low-cost low-power cores. This work provides a general architecture design that enables network-attached memory and offloading tasks onto off-path programmable SmartNIC. We provide a prototype implementation called SODA on Nvidia BlueField DPU. SODA adapts communication paths and data transfer alternatives, pipelines data movement stages, and enables customizable data caching and prefetching optimizations. We evaluate SODA in five representative graph applications on real-world graphs. Our results show that SODA can achieve up to 7.9x speedup compared to node-local SSD and reduce network traffic by 42% compared to disaggregated memory without SmartNIC offloading at similar or better performance.

### Learning from Offline Foundation Features with Tensor Augmentations
**Authors**: Emir Konuk, Christos Matsoukas, Moein Sorkhei, Phitchapha Lertsiravaramet, Kevin Smith

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T14:35:35Z

**Summary**: We introduce Learning from Offline Foundation Features with Tensor Augmentations (LOFF-TA), an efficient training scheme designed to harness the capabilities of foundation models in limited resource settings where their direct development is not feasible. LOFF-TA involves training a compact classifier on cached feature embeddings from a frozen foundation model, resulting in up to $37\times$ faster training and up to $26\times$ reduced GPU memory usage. Because the embeddings of augmented images would be too numerous to store, yet the augmentation process is essential for training, we propose to apply tensor augmentations to the cached embeddings of the original non-augmented images. LOFF-TA makes it possible to leverage the power of foundation models, regardless of their size, in settings with limited computational capacity. Moreover, LOFF-TA can be used to apply foundation models to high-resolution images without increasing compute. In certain scenarios, we find that training with LOFF-TA yields better results than directly fine-tuning the foundation model.

### Sub-cycle Nanotip Field Emission of Electrons Driven by Air Plasma   Generated THz Pulses
**Authors**: Benjamin Colmey, Rodrigo T. Paulino, Gaspard Beaufort, David G. Cooke

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T11:47:21Z

**Summary**: Terahertz pulses generated by two-color laser plasmas have reported peak field strengths exceeding MV/cm, and when illuminating metal nanotips the near-field enhancement at the tip apex should result in extremely high bunch charges and electron energies via sub-cycle cold field emission. Here, electron emission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long filament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch charges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values expected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector. Investigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting vector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal restructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring significantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm, consistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their dependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our results surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of magnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing these by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is proposed.

### PyramidKV: Dynamic KV Cache Compression based on Pyramidal Information   Funneling
**Authors**: Zefan Cai, Yichi Zhang, Bofei Gao, Yuliang Liu, Tianyu Liu, Keming Lu, Wayne Xiong, Yue Dong, Baobao Chang, Junjie Hu, Wen Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T08:46:42Z

**Summary**: In this study, we investigate whether attention-based information flow inside large language models (LLMs) is aggregated through noticeable patterns for long context processing. Our observations reveal that LLMs aggregate information through Pyramidal Information Funneling where attention is scattering widely in lower layers, progressively consolidating within specific contexts, and ultimately focusing on critical tokens (a.k.a massive activation or attention sink) in higher layers. Motivated by these insights, we developed PyramidKV, a novel and effective KV cache compression method. This approach dynamically adjusts the KV cache size across different layers, allocating more cache in lower layers and less in higher ones, diverging from traditional methods that maintain a uniform KV cache size. Our experimental evaluations, utilizing the LongBench benchmark, show that PyramidKV matches the performance of models with a full KV cache while retaining only 12% of the KV cache, thus significantly reducing memory usage. In scenarios emphasizing memory efficiency, where only 0.7% of the KV cache is maintained, PyramidKV surpasses other KV cache compression techniques, achieving up to a 20.5 absolute accuracy improvement on TREC dataset. In the Needle-in-a-Haystack experiment, PyramidKV outperforms competing methods in maintaining long-context comprehension in LLMs; notably, retaining just 128 KV cache entries enables the LLAMA-3-70B model to achieve 100% Acc. performance, matching that of a full KV cache.

### ThinK: Thinner Key Cache by Query-Driven Pruning
**Authors**: Yuhui Xu, Zhanming Jie, Hanze Dong, Lei Wang, Xudong Lu, Aojun Zhou, Amrita Saha, Caiming Xiong, Doyen Sahoo

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T03:03:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications. However, their increased computational and memory demands present significant challenges, especially when handling long sequences. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence length, we identify substantial redundancy in the channel dimension of the KV cache, as indicated by an uneven magnitude distribution and a low-rank structure in the attention weights. In response, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in KV cache memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction and quantization methods. For instance, ThinK integrated with KIVI can achieve a 2.8x reduction in peak memory usage while maintaining nearly the same quality, enabling up to a 5x increase in batch size when using a single GPU. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets verified the efficiency of ThinK, establishing a new baseline algorithm for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance.

### Locret: Enhancing Eviction in Long-Context LLM Inference with Trained   Retaining Heads
**Authors**: Yuxiang Huang, Binhang Yuan, Xu Han, Chaojun Xiao, Zhiyuan Liu

**Updated**: 2024-10-02T17:59:52Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in supporting long-context comprehension and processing tasks. However, scaling the generation inference of LLMs to such long contexts incurs significant additional computation load, and demands a substantial GPU memory footprint to maintain the key-value (KV) cache of transformer-based LLMs. Existing KV cache compression methods, such as quantization, face memory bottlenecks as context length increases, while static-sized caches, such as eviction, suffer from inefficient policies. These limitations restrict deployment on consumer-grade devices like a single Nvidia 4090 GPU. To overcome this, we propose Locret, a framework for long-context LLM inference that introduces retaining heads to evaluate the causal importance of KV cache units, allowing for more accurate eviction within a fixed cache size. Locret is fine-tuned on top of the frozen backbone LLM using a minimal amount of data from standard long-context SFT datasets. During inference, we evict low-importance cache units along with a chunked prefill pattern, significantly reducing peak GPU memory usage. We conduct an extensive empirical study to evaluate Locret, where the experimental results show that Locret outperforms the recent competitive approaches, including InfLLM, Quantization, SirLLM, and MInference, in terms of memory efficiency and the quality of generated contents -- Locret achieves over a 20x and 8x KV cache compression ratio compared to the full KV cache for Phi-3-mini-128K and Llama-3.1-8B-instruct. Additionally, Locret can be combined with other methods, such as quantization and token merging. To our knowledge, Locret is the first framework capable of deploying Llama-3.1-8B or similar models on a single Nvidia 4090 GPU, enabling 128K long-context inference without compromising generation quality, and requiring little additional system optimizations.

**Summary**: We address the problem of learning-augmented online caching in the scenario when each request is accompanied by a prediction of the next occurrence of the requested page. We improve currently known bounds on the competitive ratio of the BlindOracle algorithm, which evicts a page predicted to be requested last. We also prove a lower bound on the competitive ratio of any randomized algorithm and show that a combination of the BlindOracle with the Marker algorithm achieves a competitive ratio that is optimal up to some constant.

**Updated**: 2024-10-02T15:22:08Z

**Summary**: We address the challenge of efficient auto-regressive generation in sequence prediction models by introducing FutureFill: a method for fast generation that applies to any sequence prediction algorithm based on convolutional operators. Our approach reduces the generation time requirement from linear to square root relative to the context length. Additionally, FutureFill requires a prefill cache sized only by the number of tokens generated, which is smaller than the cache requirements for standard convolutional and attention-based models. We validate our theoretical findings with experimental evidence demonstrating correctness and efficiency gains in a synthetic generation task.

**Updated**: 2024-10-02T13:09:41Z

**Summary**: Handling long input contexts remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices. Our work aims to address this limitation by introducing InfiniPot, a novel KV cache control framework designed to enable pre-trained LLMs to manage extensive sequences within fixed memory constraints efficiently, without requiring additional training. InfiniPot leverages Continual Context Distillation (CCD), an iterative process that compresses and retains essential information through novel importance metrics, effectively maintaining critical data even without access to future context. Our comprehensive evaluations indicate that InfiniPot significantly outperforms models trained for long contexts in various NLP tasks, establishing its efficacy and versatility. This work represents a substantial advancement toward making LLMs applicable to a broader range of real-world scenarios.

### A Little Goes a Long Way: Efficient Long Context Training and Inference   with Partial Contexts
**Authors**: Suyu Ge, Xihui Lin, Yunan Zhang, Jiawei Han, Hao Peng

**Updated**: 2024-10-02T12:35:53Z

**Summary**: Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs substantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a pretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length extension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural modifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper argues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction architecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but also achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed LongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during length extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention patterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink (initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are well-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their GPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just theoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to have direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention layers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data is sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.   We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its effectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts, LongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%, compared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV cache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding speedup.

### Attention Score is not All You Need for Token Importance Indicator in KV   Cache Reduction: Value Also Matters
**Authors**: Zhiyu Guo, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe

**Updated**: 2024-10-02T00:19:13Z

**Summary**: Scaling the context size of large language models (LLMs) enables them to perform various new tasks, e.g., book summarization. However, the memory cost of the Key and Value (KV) cache in attention significantly limits the practical applications of LLMs. Recent works have explored token pruning for KV cache reduction in LLMs, relying solely on attention scores as a token importance indicator. However, our investigation into value vector norms revealed a notably non-uniform pattern questioning their reliance only on attention scores. Inspired by this, we propose a new method: Value-Aware Token Pruning (VATP) which uses both attention scores and the $ \ell_{1} $ norm of value vectors to evaluate token importance. Extensive experiments on LLaMA2-7B-chat and Vicuna-v1.5-7B across 16 LongBench tasks demonstrate that VATP outperforms attention-score-only baselines in over 12 tasks, confirming the effectiveness of incorporating value vector norms into token importance evaluation of LLMs.

**Updated**: 2024-10-01T12:55:47Z

**Summary**: In this article we present PARSIR (PARallel SImulation Runner), a package that enables the effective exploitation of shared-memory multi-processor machines for running discrete event simulation models. PARSIR is a compile/run-time environment for discrete event simulation models developed with the {\tt C} programming language. The architecture of PARSIR has been designed in order to keep low the amount of CPU-cycles required for running models. This is achieved via the combination of a set of techniques like: 1) causally consistent batch-processing of simulation events at an individual simulation object for caching effectiveness; 2) high likelihood of disjoint access parallelism; 3) the favoring of memory accesses on local NUMA (Non-Uniform-Memory-Access) nodes in the architecture, while still enabling well balanced workload distribution via work-stealing from remote nodes; 4) the use of RMW (Read-Modify-Write) machine instructions for fast access to simulation engine data required by the worker threads for managing the concurrent simulation objects and distributing the workload. Furthermore, any architectural solution embedded in the PARSIR engine is fully transparent to the application level code implementing the simulation model. We also provide experimental results showing the effectiveness of PARSIR when running the reference PHOLD benchmark on a NUMA shared-memory multi-processor machine equipped with 40 CPUs.

### Fine-Grained Vectorized Merge Sorting on RISC-V: From Register to Cache
**Authors**: Jin Zhang, Jincheng Zhou, Xiang Zhang, Di Ma, Chunye Gong

**Updated**: 2024-10-01T07:19:21Z

**Summary**: Merge sort as a divide-sort-merge paradigm has been widely applied in computer science fields. As modern reduced instruction set computing architectures like the fifth generation (RISC-V) regard multiple registers as a vector register group for wide instruction parallelism, optimizing merge sort with this vectorized property is becoming increasingly common. In this paper, we overhaul the divide-sort-merge paradigm, from its register-level sort to the cache-aware merge, to develop a fine-grained RISC-V vectorized merge sort (RVMS). From the register-level view, the inline vectorized transpose instruction is missed in RISC-V, so implementing it efficiently is non-trivial. Besides, the vectorized comparisons do not always work well in the merging networks. Both issues primarily stem from the expensive data shuffle instruction. To bypass it, RVMS strides to take register data as the proxy of data shuffle to accelerate the transpose operation, and meanwhile replaces vectorized comparisons with scalar cousin for more light real value swap. On the other hand, as cache-aware merge makes larger data merge in the cache, most merge schemes have two drawbacks: the in-cache merge usually has low cache utilization, while the out-of-cache merging network remains an ineffectively symmetric structure. To this end, we propose the half-merge scheme to employ the auxiliary space of in-place merge to halve the footprint of naive merge sort, and meanwhile copy one sequence to this space to avoid the former data exchange. Furthermore, an asymmetric merging network is developed to adapt to two different input sizes.

### Block-Attention for Efficient RAG
**Authors**: East Sun, Yan Wang, Lan Tian

**Updated**: 2024-10-01T03:40:08Z

**Summary**: We introduce Block-Attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Traditional approaches often encode the entire context. Instead, Block-Attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each block independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-Attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during inference. The implementation of Block-Attention involves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-Attention mechanism. Experiments on four RAG benchmarks demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block-Attention model achieves performance comparable to self-attention models (68.4\% vs 67.9\% on Llama3) or even superior performance (62.8\% vs 59.6\% on Mistral). Notably, Block-Attention significantly reduces the time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared to the self-attention models, the time consumption and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7\% and 99.8\%, respectively.

### Self-controller: Controlling LLMs with Multi-round Step-by-step   Self-awareness
**Authors**: Xiao Peng, Xufan Geng

**Updated**: 2024-10-01T03:14:12Z

**Summary**: The applications of large language models (LLMs) have been widely spread across all domains. However, the basic abilities such as the controllability of LLMs are still limited. To address this, we propose "Self-controller", a novel agentic framework bringing self-awareness into LLMs' reasoning logic. The core idea of this work is to maintain states based on the LLM's response, letting the LLM become self-aware of current status and think step by step in a multi-round chain-of-thought paradigm. Our experiment on the state of textual length has shown the controllability and effectiveness of the Self-controller. We further implement a binary search algorithm to accelerate the generation process based on the linearity and monotonicity of the textual length state. Another advantage of the Self-controller comes with DeepSeek's Context Caching technology, which significantly saves computational token consumption when a cluster of conversations shares the same prefix of context. Theoretically, we prove that in this scenario the extra time complexity is $O(c \log n)$. Results of the back-of-the-envelope estimation suggest that the token consumption of our method is no more than twice as much as that of the trivial single-round generation. Furthermore, our ablation study on word constraints demonstrates the Self-controller's consistent controllability across all foundation models.

### GEAR: An Efficient KV Cache Compression Recipe for Near-Lossless   Generative Inference of LLM
**Authors**: Hao Kang, Qingru Zhang, Souvik Kundu, Geonhwa Jeong, Zaoxing Liu, Tushar Krishna, Tuo Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-09-30T22:44:58Z

**Summary**: Key-value (KV) caching has become the de-facto to accelerate generation speed for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, the growing cache demand with increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory bound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing methods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing all entries uniformly. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to represent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further compounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model generation and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose GEAR, an efficient KV cache compression framework that achieves near-lossless high-ratio compression. GEAR first applies quantization to majority of entries of similar magnitudes to ultra-low precision. It then employs a low rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse matrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating three techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to alternatives, GEAR achieves near-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression with up to 2.38x throughput improvement, while reducing peak-memory size up to 2.29x. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoKang-Timmy/GEAR.

### Cache-Oblivious Representation of B-Tree Structures
**Authors**: Lukáš Ondráček, Ondřej Mička

**Updated**: 2024-09-30T18:23:07Z

**Summary**: We propose a general data structure CORoBTS for storing B-tree-like search trees dynamically in a cache-oblivious way combining the van Emde Boas memory layout with packed memory array.   In the use of the vEB layout mostly search complexity was considered, so far. We show the complexity of depth-first search of a subtree and contiguous memory area and provide better insight into the relationship between positions of vertices in tree and in memory. We describe how to build an arbitrary tree in vEB layout if we can simulate its depth-first search. Similarly, we examine batch updates of packed memory array.   In CORoBTS, the stored search tree has to satisfy that all leaves are at the same depth and vertices have arity between the chosen constants $a$ and $b$. The data structure allows searching with an optimal I/O complexity $\mathcal{O}(\log_B{N})$ and is stored in linear space. It provides operations for inserting and removing a subtree; both have an amortized I/O complexity $\mathcal{O}(S\cdot(\log^2 N)/B + \log_B N\cdot\log\log S + 1)$ and amortized time complexity $\mathcal{O}(S\cdot\log^2 N)$, where $S$ is the size of the subtree and $N$ the size of the whole stored tree. Rebuilding an existing subtree saves the multiplicative $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 N)$ in both complexities if the number of vertices on individual tree levels is not changed; it is paid only for the inserted/removed vertices otherwise.   Modifying cache-oblivious partially persistent array proposed by Davoodi et al. [ESA, pages 296-308. Springer, 2014] to use CORoBTS improves its space complexity from $\mathcal{O}(U^{\log_2 3} + V \log U)$ to $\mathcal{O}(U + V \log U)$, where $U$ is the maximal size of the array and $V$ is the number of versions; the data locality and I/O complexity of both present and persistent reads are kept unchanged; I/O complexity of writes is worsened by a polylogarithmic factor.

### Impact of Device Caching and Handovers on the Performance of 3D UAV   Networks with Blockages
**Authors**: Neetu R R, Gourab Ghatak, Vivek Ashok Bohara

**Updated**: 2024-09-30T15:53:36Z

**Summary**: We investigate an urban network characterized by blockages, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer ad-hoc coverage to mobile users with distinct service rate requirements. The UAV-BSs are modeled using a two-dimensional (2-D) marked-poisson point process (MPPP), where the marks represent the altitude of each UAV-base station (UAV-BS). Initially, we model the network blockages and analyze the association probabilities of line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) UAV-BSs using stochastic geometry. Subsequently, we derive the bth moment of the conditional success probability (CSP) and employ a meta distribution (MD)-based analytical framework of signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) taking into account the blockage distribution in the network. Furthermore, we proposea cache-based handover management strategy that dynamically selects the cell search time and delays the received signal strength (RSS)-based base station (BS) associations. This strategy aims to minimize unnecessary handovers (HOs) experienced by users by leveraging caching capabilities at user equipment (UE). We evaluate the HO rate and average throughput experienced by users ensuring their service rate requirements are met. We demonstrate that LoS associations decrease as the network density increases due to the substantial increase of NLoS UAV-BSs in the network. Additionally, we show that the presence of blockages does not necessarily have a negative impact on network reliability

### Multi-Antenna Coded Caching for Multi-Access Networks with Cyclic   Wrap-Around
**Authors**: Elizabath Peter, K. K. Krishnan Namboodiri, B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2024-09-30T14:38:41Z

**Summary**: This work explores a multiple transmit antenna setting in a multi-access coded caching (MACC) network where each user accesses more than one cache. A MACC network has $K$ users and $K$ caches, and each user has access to $r < K$ consecutive caches in a cyclic wrap-around manner. There are $L$ antennas at the server, and each cache has a normalized size of $M/N \leq 1$. The cyclic wrap-around MACC network with a single antenna at the server has been a well-investigated topic, and several coded caching schemes and improved lower bounds on the performance are known for the same. However, this MACC network has not yet been studied under multi-antenna settings in the coded caching literature. We study the multi-antenna MACC problem and propose a solution for the same by constructing a pair of arrays called caching and delivery arrays. We present three constructions of caching and delivery arrays for different scenarios and obtain corresponding multi-antenna MACC schemes for the same. Two schemes resulting from the above constructions achieve optimal performance under uncoded placement and one-shot delivery. The optimality is shown by matching the performance of the multi-antenna MACC scheme to that of an optimal multi-antenna scheme for a dedicated cache network having an identical number of users, and each user has a normalized cache size of $rM/N$. Further, as a special case, one of the proposed schemes subsumes an existing optimal MACC scheme for the single-antenna setting.

### Improving Achievability of Cache-Aided Private Variable-Length Coding   with Zero Leakage
**Authors**: Amirreza Zamani, Mikael Skoglund

**Updated**: 2024-09-30T09:33:37Z

**Summary**: A statistical cache-aided compression problem with a privacy constraint is studied, where a server has access to a database of $N$ files, $(Y_1,...,Y_N)$, each of size $F$ bits and is linked through a shared channel to $K$ users, where each has access to a local cache memory of size $MF$ bits. During the placement phase, the server fills the users' caches without prior knowledge of their demands, while the delivery phase takes place after the users send their demands to the server. We assume that each file in database $Y_i$ is arbitrarily correlated with a private attribute $X$, and an adversary is assumed to have access to the shared channel. The users and the server have access to a shared key $W$. The goal is to design the cache contents and the delivered message $\cal C$ such that the average length of $\mathcal{C}$ is minimized, while satisfying: i. The response $\cal C$ does not reveal any information about $X$, i.e., $I(X;\mathcal{C})=0$; ii. User $i$ can decode its demand, $Y_{d_i}$, by using the shared key $W$, $\cal C$, and its local cache $Z_i$. In a previous work, we have proposed a variable-length coding scheme that combines privacy-aware compression with coded caching techniques. In this paper, we propose a new achievability scheme using minimum entropy coupling concept and a greedy entropy-based algorithm. We show that the proposed scheme improves the previous results. Moreover, considering two special cases we improve the obtained bounds using the common information concept.

### The Early Bird Catches the Leak: Unveiling Timing Side Channels in LLM   Serving Systems
**Authors**: Linke Song, Zixuan Pang, Wenhao Wang, Zihao Wang, XiaoFeng Wang, Hongbo Chen, Wei Song, Yier Jin, Dan Meng, Rui Hou

**Updated**: 2024-09-30T06:55:00Z

**Summary**: The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.

### FAST: A Dual-tier Few-Shot Learning Paradigm for Whole Slide Image   Classification
**Authors**: Kexue Fu, Xiaoyuan Luo, Linhao Qu, Shuo Wang, Ying Xiong, Ilias Maglogiannis, Longxiang Gao, Manning Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-29T14:31:52Z

**Summary**: The expensive fine-grained annotation and data scarcity have become the primary obstacles for the widespread adoption of deep learning-based Whole Slide Images (WSI) classification algorithms in clinical practice. Unlike few-shot learning methods in natural images that can leverage the labels of each image, existing few-shot WSI classification methods only utilize a small number of fine-grained labels or weakly supervised slide labels for training in order to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation. They lack sufficient mining of available WSIs, severely limiting WSI classification performance. To address the above issues, we propose a novel and efficient dual-tier few-shot learning paradigm for WSI classification, named FAST. FAST consists of a dual-level annotation strategy and a dual-branch classification framework. Firstly, to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation, we collect a very small number of WSIs at the slide level, and annotate an extremely small number of patches. Then, to fully mining the available WSIs, we use all the patches and available patch labels to build a cache branch, which utilizes the labeled patches to learn the labels of unlabeled patches and through knowledge retrieval for patch classification. In addition to the cache branch, we also construct a prior branch that includes learnable prompt vectors, using the text encoder of visual-language models for patch classification. Finally, we integrate the results from both branches to achieve WSI classification. Extensive experiments on binary and multi-class datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly surpasses existing few-shot classification methods and approaches the accuracy of fully supervised methods with only 0.22$\%$ annotation costs. All codes and models will be publicly available on https://github.com/fukexue/FAST.

### Development of a 3D-printed canine head phantom for veterinary   radiotherapy
**Authors**: Sandhya Rottoo, Luke Frangella, Magdalena Bazalova-Carter, Olivia Masella

**Updated**: 2024-09-29T12:53:29Z

**Summary**: Purpose: To develop the Ultimate Phantom Dog for Orthovoltage Glioma Treatment (UPDOG), an anatomically-correct phantom which mimics a dog's head, for quality assurance (QA) of kilovoltage (kV) radiotherapy treatments.   Methods: A computed tomography (CT) scan of a canine glioma patient was segmented into bone and soft tissue using 3DSlicer. The segments were converted to stereolithographic (STL) files and smoothed in Fusion360. A slit to accommodate a radiochromic film (RCF) was added at the location of the glioma tumor. UPDOG was 3D printed on a polyjet printer using VeroUltraWhite ($\rho$ = 1.19-1.20 g/cm\textsuperscript{3}) for the bone and Agilus30 ($\rho$ = 1.14-1.15 g/cm\textsuperscript{3}) for the soft tissue. CT scans of UPDOG were acquired on a clinical CT scanner. An LD-V1 RCF was inserted into UPDOG and irradiated with a kV x-ray source from two angles. The delivered dose to the RCF was compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations performed in TOPAS.   Results: The bone and soft tissue segments in UPDOG were mimicked the patient anatomy well with tube voltage-dependent CT numbers. The contrast in HU was of 49, 47 and 50 HU for the 80, 100, and 120 kVp scans, respectively, sufficient for anatomy visualization. The irradiations delivered a maximum dose to RCF of 284 mGy which was compared to the results of MC simulations using a depth dose curve and central-axis (CAX) beam profiles. The mean difference in CAX profiles and PDD between RCF and MC results was 15.9\% and 2.3\%, respectively.   Conclusions: We have demonstrated that UPDOG is a useful QA tool for kV canine radiotherapy. UPDOG successfully anatomically mimicked the dog anatomy, with a reduced but sufficient bone contrast. We showed that dose delivered to a canine glioma with kV x-rays can be successfully measured with an RCF positioned at the tumor location.

### RTL2M$μ$PATH: Multi-$μ$PATH Synthesis with Applications to Hardware   Security Verification
**Authors**: Yao Hsiao, Nikos Nikoleris, Artem Khyzha, Dominic P. Mulligan, Gustavo Petri, Christopher W. Fletcher, Caroline Trippel

**Updated**: 2024-09-28T23:01:48Z

**Summary**: The Check tools automate formal memory consistency model and security verification of processors by analyzing abstract models of microarchitectures, called $\mu$SPEC models. Despite the efficacy of this approach, a verification gap between $\mu$SPEC models, which must be manually written, and RTL limits the Check tools' broad adoption. Our prior work, called RTL2$\mu$SPEC, narrows this gap by automatically synthesizing formally verified $\mu$SPEC models from SystemVerilog implementations of simple processors. But, RTL2$\mu$SPEC assumes input designs where an instruction (e.g., a load) cannot exhibit more than one microarchitectural execution path ($\mu$PATH, e.g., a cache hit or miss path) -- its single-execution-path assumption.   In this paper, we first propose an automated approach and tool, called RTL2M$\mu$PATH, that resolves RTL2$\mu$SPEC's single-execution-path assumption. Given a SystemVerilog processor design, instruction encodings, and modest design metadata, RTL2M$\mu$PATH finds a complete set of formally verified $\mu$PATHs for each instruction. Next, we make an important observation: an instruction that can exhibit more than one $\mu$PATH strongly indicates the presence of a microarchitectural side channel in the input design. Based on this observation, we then propose an automated approach and tool, called SynthLC, that extends RTL2M$\mu$PATH with a symbolic information flow analysis to support synthesizing a variety of formally verified leakage contracts from SystemVerilog processor designs. Leakage contracts are foundational to state-of-the-art defenses against hardware side-channel attacks. SynthLC is the first automated methodology for formally verifying hardware adherence to them.

### DOTA: Distributional Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Zongbo Han, Jialong Yang, Junfan Li, Qinghua Hu, Qianli Xu, Mike Zheng Shou, Changqing Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-28T15:03:28Z

**Summary**: Vision-language foundation models (e.g., CLIP) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models may be unreliable when significant distribution gaps exist between the training and test data. The training-free test-time dynamic adapter (TDA) is a promising approach to address this issue by storing representative test samples to guide the classification of subsequent ones. However, TDA only naively maintains a limited number of reference samples in the cache, leading to severe test-time catastrophic forgetting when the cache is updated by dropping samples. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method for DistributiOnal Test-time Adaptation (Dota). Instead of naively memorizing representative test samples, Dota continually estimates the distributions of test samples, allowing the model to continually adapt to the deployment environment. The test-time posterior probabilities are then computed using the estimated distributions based on Bayes' theorem for adaptation purposes. To further enhance the adaptability on the uncertain samples, we introduce a new human-in-the-loop paradigm which identifies uncertain samples, collects human-feedback, and incorporates it into the Dota framework. Extensive experiments validate that Dota enables CLIP to continually learn, resulting in a significant improvement compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

### Analog In-Memory Computing Attention Mechanism for Fast and   Energy-Efficient Large Language Models
**Authors**: Nathan Leroux, Paul-Philipp Manea, Chirag Sudarshan, Jan Finkbeiner, Sebastian Siegel, John Paul Strachan, Emre Neftci

**Updated**: 2024-09-28T11:00:11Z

**Summary**: Transformer neural networks, driven by self-attention mechanisms, are core components of foundational and Large Language Models. In generative transformers, self-attention uses cache memory to store token projections, avoiding recomputation at each time step. However, GPU-stored projections must be loaded into SRAM for each new generation step, causing latency and energy bottlenecks for long sequences. In this work, we propose a fast and energy-efficient hardware implementation of self-attention using analog in-memory computing based on gain cell memories. Volatile gain cell memories can be efficiently written to store new tokens during sequence generation, while performing analog signed weight multiplications to compute the dot-products required for self-attention. We implement Sliding Window Attention, which keeps memory of a finite set of past steps. A charge-to-pulse converter for array readout eliminates the need for analog-to-digital conversion between self-attention stages. Using a co-designed initialization algorithm to adapt pre-trained weights to gain cell non-idealities, we achieve NLP performance comparable to ChatGPT-2 with minimal training iterations, despite hardware constraints. Our end-to-end hardware design includes digital controls, estimating area, latency, and energy. The system reduces attention latency by up to two orders of magnitude and energy consumption by up to five orders compared to GPUs, marking a significant step toward ultra-fast, low-power sequence generation in Large Language Models.

### Token Caching for Diffusion Transformer Acceleration
**Authors**: Jinming Lou, Wenyang Luo, Yufan Liu, Bing Li, Xinmiao Ding, Weiming Hu, Jiajiong Cao, Yuming Li, Chenguang Ma

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:05:34Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have gained substantial interest in diffusion generative modeling due to their outstanding performance. However, their high computational cost, arising from the quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanisms and multi-step inference, presents a significant bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose TokenCache, a novel post-training acceleration method that leverages the token-based multi-block architecture of transformers to reduce redundant computations among tokens across inference steps. TokenCache specifically addresses three critical questions in the context of diffusion transformers: (1) which tokens should be pruned to eliminate redundancy, (2) which blocks should be targeted for efficient pruning, and (3) at which time steps caching should be applied to balance speed and quality. In response to these challenges, TokenCache introduces a Cache Predictor that assigns importance scores to tokens, enabling selective pruning without compromising model performance. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive block selection strategy to focus on blocks with minimal impact on the network's output, along with a Two-Phase Round-Robin (TPRR) scheduling policy to optimize caching intervals throughout the denoising process. Experimental results across various models demonstrate that TokenCache achieves an effective trade-off between generation quality and inference speed for diffusion transformers. Our code will be publicly available.

### FlooNoC: A 645 Gbps/link 0.15 pJ/B/hop Open-Source NoC with Wide   Physical Links and End-to-End AXI4 Parallel Multi-Stream Support
**Authors**: Tim Fischer, Michael Rogenmoser, Thomas Benz, Frank K. Gürkaynak, Luca Benini

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T07:44:47Z

**Summary**: The new generation of domain-specific AI accelerators is characterized by rapidly increasing demands for bulk data transfers, as opposed to small, latency-critical cache line transfers typical of traditional cache-coherent systems. In this paper, we address this critical need by introducing the FlooNoC Network-on-Chip (NoC), featuring very wide, fully Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI4) compliant links designed to meet the massive bandwidth needs at high energy efficiency. At the transport level, non-blocking transactions are supported for latency tolerance. Additionally, a novel end-to-end ordering approach for AXI4, enabled by a multi-stream capable Direct Memory Access (DMA) engine simplifies network interfaces and eliminates inter-stream dependencies. Furthermore, dedicated physical links are instantiated for short, latency-critical messages. A complete end-to-end reference implementation in 12nm FinFET technology demonstrates the physical feasibility and power performance area (PPA) benefits of our approach. Utilizing wide links on high levels of metal, we achieve a bandwidth of 645 Gbps per link and a total aggregate bandwidth of 103 Tbps for an 8x4 mesh of processors cluster tiles, with a total of 288 RISC-V cores. The NoC imposes a minimal area overhead of only 3.5% per compute tile and achieves a leading-edge energy efficiency of 0.15 pJ/B/hop at 0.8 V. Compared to state-of-the-art NoCs, our system offers three times the energy efficiency and more than double the link bandwidth. Furthermore, compared to a traditional AXI4-based multi-layer interconnect, our NoC achieves a 30% reduction in area, corresponding to a 47% increase in GFLOPSDP within the same floorplan.

**Authors**: Yizheng Liu, Saurav Roy, Carl Peterson, Arkka Bhattacharyya, Sriram Krishnamoorthy

**Updated**: 2024-09-25T21:37:01Z

**Summary**: This work reports the fabrication and characterization of a NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterojunction diode (HJD) that uses a metallic nickel (Ni) target to deposit NiOx layers via reactive RF magnetron sputtering and lift-off processing with >3 kV breakdown voltage, record-low reverse current leakage under high reverse bias, and high junction electric fields (>3.34 MV/cm). The heterojunction diodes are fabricated via bilayer NiOx sputtering followed by self-aligned mesa-etching for field-termination on both large (1-mm2) and small area (100-{\mu}m diameter) devices. The HJD exhibits a ~135 A/cm2 forward current density at 5 V with a rectifying ratio of ~1010. The minimum differential specific on-resistance is measured to be 17.26 m{\Omega} cm2. The breakdown voltage on 100-{\mu}m diameter pads was measured to be greater than 3 kV with a noise floor-level reverse leakage current density (10-8~10-6 A/cm2) until 3 kV, accomplishing a parallel-plane junction electric field to be at least 3.34 MV/cm at 3 kV with a power figure of merit (PFOM) >0.52 GW/cm2. Temperature-dependent forward current density-voltage (J-V) measurements are performed from room temperature (25 C) to 200 C which showed a temperature coefficient of resistance ({\alpha}) equaling 1.56, higher than that of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs), indicating potential conductivity degradation within NiOx at elevated temperatures.

### Mnemosyne: Parallelization Strategies for Efficiently Serving   Multi-Million Context Length LLM Inference Requests Without Approximations
**Authors**: Amey Agrawal, Junda Chen, Íñigo Goiri, Ramachandran Ramjee, Chaojie Zhang, Alexey Tumanov, Esha Choukse

**Updated**: 2024-09-25T18:21:05Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) evolve to handle increasingly longer contexts, serving inference requests for context lengths in the range of millions of tokens presents unique challenges. While existing techniques are effective for training, they fail to address the unique challenges of inference, such as varying prefill and decode phases and their associated latency constraints - like Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Between Tokens (TBT). Furthermore, there are no long context inference solutions that allow batching requests to increase the hardware utilization today.   In this paper, we propose three key innovations for efficient interactive long context LLM inference, without resorting to any approximation: adaptive chunking to reduce prefill overheads in mixed batching, Sequence Pipeline Parallelism (SPP) to lower TTFT, and KV Cache Parallelism (KVP) to minimize TBT. These contributions are combined into a 3D parallelism strategy, enabling Mnemosyne to scale interactive inference to context lengths at least up to 10 million tokens with high throughput enabled with batching. To our knowledge, Mnemosyne is the first to be able to achieve support for 10 million long context inference efficiently, while satisfying production-grade SLOs on TBT (30ms) on contexts up to and including 10 million.

### Adaptive Cost Model for Query Optimization
**Authors**: Nikita Vasilenko, Alexander Demin, Denis Ponomaryov

**Updated**: 2024-09-25T17:55:07Z

**Summary**: The principal component of conventional database query optimizers is a cost model that is used to estimate expected performance of query plans. The accuracy of the cost model has direct impact on the optimality of execution plans selected by the optimizer and thus, on the resulting query latency. Several common parameters of cost models in modern DBMS are related to the performance of CPU and I/O and are typically set by a database administrator upon system tuning. However these performance characteristics are not stable and therefore, a single point estimation may not suffice for all DB load regimes. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Cost Model (ACM) which dynamically optimizes CPU- and I/O-related plan cost parameters at DB runtime. By continuously monitoring query execution statistics and the state of DB buffer cache ACM adjusts cost parameters without the need for manual intervention from a database administrator. This allows for responding to changes in the workload and system performance ensuring more optimal query execution plans. We describe the main ideas in the implementation of ACM and report on a preliminary experimental evaluation showing 20\% end-to-end latency improvement on TPC-H benchmark.

### Event-Triggered Non-Linear Control of Offshore MMC Grids for   Asymmetrical AC Faults
**Authors**: Naajein Cherat, Vaibhav Nougain, Milovan Majstorović, Peter Palensky, Aleksandra Lekić

**Updated**: 2024-09-25T08:52:07Z

**Summary**: Fault ride-through capability studies of MMC-HVDC connected wind power plants have focused primarily on the DC link and onshore AC grid faults. Offshore AC faults, mainly asymmetrical faults have not gained much attention in the literature despite being included in the future development at national levels in the ENTSO-E HVDC code. The proposed work gives an event-triggered control to stabilize the system once the offshore AC fault has occurred, identified, and isolated. Different types of control actions such as proportional-integral (PI) controller and super-twisted sliding mode control (STSMC) are used to smoothly transition the post-fault system to a new steady state operating point by suppressing the negative sequence control. Initially, the effect of a negative sequence current control scheme on the transient behavior of the power system with a PI controller is discussed in this paper. Further, a non-linear control strategy (STSMC) is proposed which gives quicker convergence of the system post-fault in comparison to PI control action. These post-fault control operations are only triggered in the presence of a fault in the system, i.e., they are event-triggered. The validity of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by simulation on a $\pm$525 kV, three-terminal meshed MMC-HVDC system model in Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS).

### AlignedKV: Reducing Memory Access of KV-Cache with Precision-Aligned   Quantization
**Authors**: Yifan Tan, Haoze Wang, Chao Yan, Yangdong Deng

**Updated**: 2024-09-25T01:39:02Z

**Summary**: Model quantization has become a crucial technique to address the issues of large memory consumption and long inference times associated with LLMs. Mixed-precision quantization, which distinguishes between important and unimportant parameters, stands out among numerous quantization schemes as it achieves a balance between precision and compression rate. However, existing approaches can only identify important parameters through qualitative analysis and manual experiments without quantitatively analyzing how their importance is determined. We propose a new criterion, so-called 'precision alignment', to build a quantitative framework to holistically evaluate the importance of parameters in mixed-precision quantization. Our observations on floating point addition under various real-world scenarios suggest that two addends should have identical precision, otherwise the information in the higher-precision number will be wasted. Such an observation offers an essential principle to determine the precision of each parameter in matrix multiplication operation. As the first step towards applying the above discovery to large model inference, we develop a dynamic KV-Cache quantization technique to effectively reduce memory access latency. Different from existing quantization approaches that focus on memory saving, this work directly aims to accelerate LLM inference through quantifying floating numbers. The proposed technique attains a 25% saving of memory access and delivers up to 1.3x speedup in the computation of attention in the decoding phase of LLM, with almost no loss of precision.

### SWARM: Replicating Shared Disaggregated-Memory Data in No Time
**Authors**: Antoine Murat, Clément Burgelin, Athanasios Xygkis, Igor Zablotchi, Marcos K. Aguilera, Rachid Guerraoui

**Updated**: 2024-09-24T17:28:47Z

**Summary**: Memory disaggregation is an emerging data center architecture that improves resource utilization and scalability. Replication is key to ensure the fault tolerance of applications, but replicating shared data in disaggregated memory is hard. We propose SWARM (Swift WAit-free Replication in disaggregated Memory), the first replication scheme for in-disaggregated-memory shared objects to provide (1) single-roundtrip reads and writes in the common case, (2) strong consistency (linearizability), and (3) strong liveness (wait-freedom). SWARM makes two independent contributions. The first is Safe-Guess, a novel wait-free replication protocol with single-roundtrip operations. The second is In-n-Out, a novel technique to provide conditional atomic update and atomic retrieval of large buffers in disaggregated memory in one roundtrip. Using SWARM, we build SWARM-KV, a low-latency, strongly consistent and highly available disaggregated key-value store. We evaluate SWARM-KV and find that it has marginal latency overhead compared to an unreplicated key-value store, and that it offers much lower latency and better availability than FUSEE, a state-of-the-art replicated disaggregated key-value store.

 ### MoH: Multi-Head Attention as Mixture-of-Head Attention
**Authors**: Peng Jin, Bo Zhu, Li Yuan, Shuicheng Yan

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:59:44Z

**Summary**: In this work, we upgrade the multi-head attention mechanism, the core of the Transformer model, to improve efficiency while maintaining or surpassing the previous accuracy level. We show that multi-head attention can be expressed in the summation form. Drawing on the insight that not all attention heads hold equal significance, we propose Mixture-of-Head attention (MoH), a new architecture that treats attention heads as experts in the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism. MoH has two significant advantages: First, MoH enables each token to select the appropriate attention heads, enhancing inference efficiency without compromising accuracy or increasing the number of parameters. Second, MoH replaces the standard summation in multi-head attention with a weighted summation, introducing flexibility to the attention mechanism and unlocking extra performance potential. Extensive experiments on ViT, DiT, and LLMs demonstrate that MoH outperforms multi-head attention by using only 50%-90% of the attention heads. Moreover, we demonstrate that pre-trained multi-head attention models, such as LLaMA3-8B, can be further continue-tuned into our MoH models. Notably, MoH-LLaMA3-8B achieves an average accuracy of 64.0% across 14 benchmarks, outperforming LLaMA3-8B by 2.4% by utilizing only 75% of the attention heads. We believe the proposed MoH is a promising alternative to multi-head attention and provides a strong foundation for developing advanced and efficient attention-based models.

### GaVaMoE: Gaussian-Variational Gated Mixture of Experts for Explainable   Recommendation
**Authors**: Fei Tang, Yongliang Shen, Hang Zhang, Zeqi Tan, Wenqi Zhang, Guiyang Hou, Kaitao Song, Weiming Lu, Yueting Zhuang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:59:30Z

**Summary**: Large language model-based explainable recommendation (LLM-based ER) systems show promise in generating human-like explanations for recommendations. However, they face challenges in modeling user-item collaborative preferences, personalizing explanations, and handling sparse user-item interactions. To address these issues, we propose GaVaMoE, a novel Gaussian-Variational Gated Mixture of Experts framework for explainable recommendation. GaVaMoE introduces two key components: (1) a rating reconstruction module that employs Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to capture complex user-item collaborative preferences, serving as a pre-trained multi-gating mechanism; and (2) a set of fine-grained expert models coupled with the multi-gating mechanism for generating highly personalized explanations. The VAE component models latent factors in user-item interactions, while the GMM clusters users with similar behaviors. Each cluster corresponds to a gate in the multi-gating mechanism, routing user-item pairs to appropriate expert models. This architecture enables GaVaMoE to generate tailored explanations for specific user types and preferences, mitigating data sparsity by leveraging user similarities. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GaVaMoE significantly outperforms existing methods in explanation quality, personalization, and consistency. Notably, GaVaMoE exhibits robust performance in scenarios with sparse user-item interactions, maintaining high-quality explanations even for users with limited historical data.

### High-Resolution Frame Interpolation with Patch-based Cascaded Diffusion
**Authors**: Junhwa Hur, Charles Herrmann, Saurabh Saxena, Janne Kontkanen, Wei-Sheng Lai, Yichang Shih, Michael Rubinstein, David J. Fleet, Deqing Sun

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:59:04Z

**Summary**: Despite the recent progress, existing frame interpolation methods still struggle with processing extremely high resolution input and handling challenging cases such as repetitive textures, thin objects, and large motion. To address these issues, we introduce a patch-based cascaded pixel diffusion model for frame interpolation, HiFI, that excels in these scenarios while achieving competitive performance on standard benchmarks. Cascades, which generate a series of images from low- to high-resolution, can help significantly with large or complex motion that require both global context for a coarse solution and detailed context for high resolution output. However, contrary to prior work on cascaded diffusion models which perform diffusion on increasingly large resolutions, we use a single model that always performs diffusion at the same resolution and upsamples by processing patches of the inputs and the prior solution. We show that this technique drastically reduces memory usage at inference time and also allows us to use a single model at test time, solving both frame interpolation and spatial up-sampling, saving training cost. We show that HiFI helps significantly with high resolution and complex repeated textures that require global context. HiFI demonstrates comparable or beyond state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks (Vimeo, Xiph, X-Test, SEPE-8K). On our newly introduced dataset that focuses on particularly challenging cases, HiFI also significantly outperforms other baselines on these cases.

### TemporalBench: Benchmarking Fine-grained Temporal Understanding for   Multimodal Video Models
**Authors**: Mu Cai, Reuben Tan, Jianrui Zhang, Bocheng Zou, Kai Zhang, Feng Yao, Fangrui Zhu, Jing Gu, Yiwu Zhong, Yuzhang Shang, Yao Dou, Jaden Park, Jianfeng Gao, Yong Jae Lee, Jianwei Yang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:55:46Z

**Summary**: Understanding fine-grained temporal dynamics is crucial for multimodal video comprehension and generation. Due to the lack of fine-grained temporal annotations, existing video benchmarks mostly resemble static image benchmarks and are incompetent at evaluating models for temporal understanding. In this paper, we introduce TemporalBench, a new benchmark dedicated to evaluating fine-grained temporal understanding in videos. TemporalBench consists of ~10K video question-answer pairs, derived from ~2K high-quality human annotations detailing the temporal dynamics in video clips. As a result, our benchmark provides a unique testbed for evaluating various temporal understanding and reasoning abilities such as action frequency, motion magnitude, event order, etc. Moreover, it enables evaluations on various tasks like both video question answering and captioning, both short and long video understanding, as well as different models such as multimodal video embedding models and text generation models. Results show that state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o achieve only 38.5% question answering accuracy on TemporalBench, demonstrating a significant gap (~30%) between humans and AI in temporal understanding. Furthermore, we notice a critical pitfall for multi-choice QA where LLMs can detect the subtle changes in negative captions and find a centralized description as a cue for its prediction, where we propose Multiple Binary Accuracy (MBA) to correct such bias. We hope that TemporalBench can foster research on improving models' temporal reasoning capabilities. Both dataset and evaluation code will be made available.

### FinDKG: Dynamic Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models for   Detecting Global Trends in Financial Markets
**Authors**: Xiaohui Victor Li, Francesco Sanna Passino

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:44:57Z

**Summary**: Dynamic knowledge graphs (DKGs) are popular structures to express different types of connections between objects over time. They can also serve as an efficient mathematical tool to represent information extracted from complex unstructured data sources, such as text or images. Within financial applications, DKGs could be used to detect trends for strategic thematic investing, based on information obtained from financial news articles. In this work, we explore the properties of large language models (LLMs) as dynamic knowledge graph generators, proposing a novel open-source fine-tuned LLM for this purpose, called the Integrated Contextual Knowledge Graph Generator (ICKG). We use ICKG to produce a novel open-source DKG from a corpus of financial news articles, called FinDKG, and we propose an attention-based GNN architecture for analysing it, called KGTransformer. We test the performance of the proposed model on benchmark datasets and FinDKG, demonstrating superior performance on link prediction tasks. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of the KGTransformer on FinDKG for thematic investing, showing it can outperform existing thematic ETFs.

### SGEdit: Bridging LLM with Text2Image Generative Model for Scene   Graph-based Image Editing
**Authors**: Zhiyuan Zhang, DongDong Chen, Jing Liao

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:40:48Z

**Summary**: Scene graphs offer a structured, hierarchical representation of images, with nodes and edges symbolizing objects and the relationships among them. It can serve as a natural interface for image editing, dramatically improving precision and flexibility. Leveraging this benefit, we introduce a new framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with Text2Image generative model for scene graph-based image editing. This integration enables precise modifications at the object level and creative recomposition of scenes without compromising overall image integrity. Our approach involves two primary stages: 1) Utilizing a LLM-driven scene parser, we construct an image's scene graph, capturing key objects and their interrelationships, as well as parsing fine-grained attributes such as object masks and descriptions. These annotations facilitate concept learning with a fine-tuned diffusion model, representing each object with an optimized token and detailed description prompt. 2) During the image editing phase, a LLM editing controller guides the edits towards specific areas. These edits are then implemented by an attention-modulated diffusion editor, utilizing the fine-tuned model to perform object additions, deletions, replacements, and adjustments. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing image editing methods in terms of editing precision and scene aesthetics.

### NesTools: A Dataset for Evaluating Nested Tool Learning Abilities of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Han Han, Tong Zhu, Xiang Zhang, Mengsong Wu, Hao Xiong, Wenliang Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:33:43Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) combined with tool learning have gained impressive results in real-world applications. During tool learning, LLMs may call multiple tools in nested orders, where the latter tool call may take the former response as its input parameters. However, current research on the nested tool learning capabilities is still under-explored, since the existing benchmarks lack of relevant data instances. To address this problem, we introduce NesTools to bridge the current gap in comprehensive nested tool learning evaluations. NesTools comprises a novel automatic data generation method to construct large-scale nested tool calls with different nesting structures. With manual review and refinement, the dataset is in high quality and closely aligned with real-world scenarios. Therefore, NesTools can serve as a new benchmark to evaluate the nested tool learning abilities of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on 22 LLMs, and provide in-depth analyses with NesTools, which shows that current LLMs still suffer from the complex nested tool learning task.

### Curriculum effects and compositionality emerge with in-context learning   in neural networks
**Authors**: Jacob Russin, Ellie Pavlick, Michael J. Frank

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:29:13Z

**Summary**: Human learning embodies a striking duality: sometimes, we appear capable of following logical, compositional rules and benefit from structured curricula (e.g., in formal education), while other times, we rely on an incremental approach or trial-and-error, learning better from curricula that are unstructured or randomly interleaved. Influential psychological theories explain this seemingly disparate behavioral evidence by positing two qualitatively different learning systems -- one for rapid, rule-based inferences and another for slow, incremental adaptation. It remains unclear how to reconcile such theories with neural networks, which learn via incremental weight updates and are thus a natural model for the latter type of learning, but are not obviously compatible with the former. However, recent evidence suggests that both metalearning neural networks and large language models are capable of "in-context learning" (ICL) -- the ability to flexibly grasp the structure of a new task from a few examples given at inference time. Here, we show that networks capable of ICL can reproduce human-like learning and compositional behavior on rule-governed tasks, while at the same time replicating human behavioral phenomena in tasks lacking rule-like structure via their usual in-weight learning (IWL). Our work shows how emergent ICL can equip neural networks with fundamentally different learning properties than those traditionally attributed to them, and that these can coexist with the properties of their native IWL, thus offering a novel perspective on dual-process theories and human cognitive flexibility.

### Unraveling Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Networks: A Non-Parametric   Approach Based on Node Connectivity
**Authors**: Heejong Bong, Colin B. Fogarty, Liza Levina, Ji Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:20:50Z

**Summary**: In network settings, interference between units makes causal inference more challenging as outcomes may depend on the treatments received by others in the network. Typical estimands in network settings focus on treatment effects aggregated across individuals in the population. We propose a framework for estimating node-wise counterfactual means, allowing for more granular insights into the impact of network structure on treatment effect heterogeneity. We develop a doubly robust and non-parametric estimation procedure, KECENI (Kernel Estimation of Causal Effect under Network Interference), which offers consistency and asymptotic normality under network dependence. The utility of this method is demonstrated through an application to microfinance data, revealing the impact of network characteristics on treatment effects.

**Authors**: Zhiyuan Ma, Yuzhu Zhang, Guoli Jia, Liangliang Zhao, Yichao Ma, Mingjie Ma, Gaofeng Liu, Kaiyan Zhang, Jianjun Li, Bowen Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:19:46Z

**Summary**: As one of the most popular and sought-after generative models in the recent years, diffusion models have sparked the interests of many researchers and steadily shown excellent advantage in various generative tasks such as image synthesis, video generation, molecule design, 3D scene rendering and multimodal generation, relying on their dense theoretical principles and reliable application practices. The remarkable success of these recent efforts on diffusion models comes largely from progressive design principles and efficient architecture, training, inference, and deployment methodologies. However, there has not been a comprehensive and in-depth review to summarize these principles and practices to help the rapid understanding and application of diffusion models. In this survey, we provide a new efficiency-oriented perspective on these existing efforts, which mainly focuses on the profound principles and efficient practices in architecture designs, model training, fast inference and reliable deployment, to guide further theoretical research, algorithm migration and model application for new scenarios in a reader-friendly way. \url{https://github.com/ponyzym/Efficient-DMs-Survey}

### AGaLiTe: Approximate Gated Linear Transformers for Online Reinforcement   Learning
**Authors**: Subhojeet Pramanik, Esraa Elelimy, Marlos C. Machado, Adam White

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:14:26Z

**Summary**: In this paper we investigate transformer architectures designed for partially observable online reinforcement learning. The self-attention mechanism in the transformer architecture is capable of capturing long-range dependencies and it is the main reason behind its effectiveness in processing sequential data. Nevertheless, despite their success, transformers have two significant drawbacks that still limit their applicability in online reinforcement learning: (1) in order to remember all past information, the self-attention mechanism requires access to the whole history to be provided as context. (2) The inference cost in transformers is expensive. In this paper, we introduce recurrent alternatives to the transformer self-attention mechanism that offer context-independent inference cost, leverage long-range dependencies effectively, and performs well in online reinforcement learning task. We quantify the impact of the different components of our architecture in a diagnostic environment and assess performance gains in 2D and 3D pixel-based partially-observable environments (e.g. T-Maze, Mystery Path, Craftax, and Memory Maze). Compared with a state-of-the-art architecture, GTrXL, inference in our approach is at least 40% cheaper while reducing memory use more than 50%. Our approach either performs similarly or better than GTrXL, improving more than 37% upon GTrXL performance in harder tasks.

### Harnessing The Collective Wisdom: Fusion Learning Using Decision   Sequences From Diverse Sources
**Authors**: Trambak Banerjee, Bowen Gang, Jianliang He

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:10:57Z

**Summary**: Learning from the collective wisdom of crowds is related to the statistical notion of fusion learning from multiple data sources or studies. However, fusing inferences from diverse sources is challenging since cross-source heterogeneity and potential data-sharing complicate statistical inference. Moreover, studies may rely on disparate designs, employ myriad modeling techniques, and prevailing data privacy norms may forbid sharing even summary statistics across the studies for an overall analysis. We propose an Integrative Ranking and Thresholding (IRT) framework for fusion learning in multiple testing. IRT operates under the setting where from each study a triplet is available: the vector of binary accept-reject decisions on the tested hypotheses, its False Discovery Rate (FDR) level and the hypotheses tested by it. Under this setting, IRT constructs an aggregated and nonparametric measure of evidence against each null hypotheses, which facilitates ranking the hypotheses in the order of their likelihood of being rejected. We show that IRT guarantees an overall FDR control if the studies control their respective FDR at the desired levels. IRT is extremely flexible, and a comprehensive numerical study demonstrates its practical relevance for pooling inferences. A real data illustration and extensions to alternative forms of Type I error control are discussed.

**Summary**: We present two multilingual LLMs designed to embrace Europe's linguistic diversity by supporting all 24 official languages of the European Union. Trained on a dataset comprising around 60% non-English data and utilizing a custom multilingual tokenizer, our models address the limitations of existing LLMs that predominantly focus on English or a few high-resource languages. We detail the models' development principles, i.e., data composition, tokenizer optimization, and training methodologies. The models demonstrate competitive performance across multilingual benchmarks, as evidenced by their performance on European versions of ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, and TruthfulQA.

### Selection-p: Self-Supervised Task-Agnostic Prompt Compression for   Faithfulness and Transferability
**Authors**: Tsz Ting Chung, Leyang Cui, Lemao Liu, Xinting Huang, Shuming Shi, Dit-Yan Yeung

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:05:25Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of natural language processing tasks when leveraging in-context learning. To mitigate the additional computational and financial costs associated with in-context learning, several prompt compression methods have been proposed to compress the in-context learning prompts. Despite their success, these methods face challenges with transferability due to model-specific compression, or rely on external training data, such as GPT-4. In this paper, we investigate the ability of LLMs to develop a unified compression method that discretizes uninformative tokens, utilizing a self-supervised pre-training technique. By introducing a small number of parameters during the continual pre-training, the proposed Selection-p produces a probability for each input token, indicating whether to preserve or discard it. Experiments show Selection-p achieves state-of-the-art performance across numerous classification tasks, achieving compression rates of up to 10 times while experiencing only a marginal 0.8% decrease in performance. Moreover, it exhibits superior transferability to different models compared to prior work. Additionally, we further analyze how Selection-p helps maintain performance on in-context learning with long contexts.

**Authors**: Xiaofei Wang, Yunfeng Zhao, Chao Qiu, Qinghua Hu, Victor C. M. Leung

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:04:51Z

**Summary**: Amidst the robust impetus from artificial intelligence (AI) and big data, edge intelligence (EI) has emerged as a nascent computing paradigm, synthesizing AI with edge computing (EC) to become an exemplary solution for unleashing the full potential of AI services. Nonetheless, challenges in communication costs, resource allocation, privacy, and security continue to constrain its proficiency in supporting services with diverse requirements. In response to these issues, this paper introduces socialized learning (SL) as a promising solution, further propelling the advancement of EI. SL is a learning paradigm predicated on social principles and behaviors, aimed at amplifying the collaborative capacity and collective intelligence of agents within the EI system. SL not only enhances the system's adaptability but also optimizes communication, and networking processes, essential for distributed intelligence across diverse devices and platforms. Therefore, a combination of SL and EI may greatly facilitate the development of collaborative intelligence in the future network. This paper presents the findings of a literature review on the integration of EI and SL, summarizing the latest achievements in existing research on EI and SL. Subsequently, we delve comprehensively into the limitations of EI and how it could benefit from SL. Special emphasis is placed on the communication challenges and networking strategies and other aspects within these systems, underlining the role of optimized network solutions in improving system efficiency. Based on these discussions, we elaborate in detail on three integrated components: socialized architecture, socialized training, and socialized inference, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we identify some possible future applications of combining SL and EI, discuss open problems and suggest some future research.

### Frequentist Inference for Semi-mechanistic Epidemic Models with   Interventions
**Authors**: Heejong Bong, Valérie Ventura, Larry Wasserman

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:04:35Z

**Summary**: The effect of public health interventions on an epidemic are often estimated by adding the intervention to epidemic models. During the Covid-19 epidemic, numerous papers used such methods for making scenario predictions. The majority of these papers use Bayesian methods to estimate the parameters of the model. In this paper we show how to use frequentist methods for estimating these effects which avoids having to specify prior distributions. We also use model-free shrinkage methods to improve estimation when there are many different geographic regions. This allows us to borrow strength from different regions while still getting confidence intervals with correct coverage and without having to specify a hierarchical model. Throughout, we focus on a semi-mechanistic model which provides a simple, tractable alternative to compartmental methods.

### Prompt a Robot to Walk with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yen-Jen Wang, Bike Zhang, Jianyu Chen, Koushil Sreenath

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:04:20Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on vast internet-scale data have showcased remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. Recently, there has been escalating interest in deploying LLMs for robotics, aiming to harness the power of foundation models in real-world settings. However, this approach faces significant challenges, particularly in grounding these models in the physical world and in generating dynamic robot motions. To address these issues, we introduce a novel paradigm in which we use few-shot prompts collected from the physical environment, enabling the LLM to autoregressively generate low-level control commands for robots without task-specific fine-tuning. Experiments across various robots and environments validate that our method can effectively prompt a robot to walk. We thus illustrate how LLMs can proficiently function as low-level feedback controllers for dynamic motion control even in high-dimensional robotic systems.

### Latent BKI: Open-Dictionary Continuous Mapping in Visual-Language Latent   Spaces with Quantifiable Uncertainty
**Authors**: Joey Wilson, Ruihan Xu, Yile Sun, Parker Ewen, Minghan Zhu, Kira Barton, Maani Ghaffari

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:02:32Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a novel probabilistic mapping algorithm, Latent BKI, which enables open-vocabulary mapping with quantifiable uncertainty. Traditionally, semantic mapping algorithms focus on a fixed set of semantic categories which limits their applicability for complex robotic tasks. Vision-Language (VL) models have recently emerged as a technique to jointly model language and visual features in a latent space, enabling semantic recognition beyond a predefined, fixed set of semantic classes. Latent BKI recurrently incorporates neural embeddings from VL models into a voxel map with quantifiable uncertainty, leveraging the spatial correlations of nearby observations through Bayesian Kernel Inference (BKI). Latent BKI is evaluated against similar explicit semantic mapping and VL mapping frameworks on the popular MatterPort-3D and Semantic KITTI data sets, demonstrating that Latent BKI maintains the probabilistic benefits of continuous mapping with the additional benefit of open-dictionary queries. Real-world experiments demonstrate applicability to challenging indoor environments.

### G-Designer: Architecting Multi-agent Communication Topologies via Graph   Neural Networks
**Authors**: Guibin Zhang, Yanwei Yue, Xiangguo Sun, Guancheng Wan, Miao Yu, Junfeng Fang, Kun Wang, Dawei Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:01:21Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated that collective intelligence can significantly surpass the capabilities of individual agents, primarily due to well-crafted inter-agent communication topologies. Despite the diverse and high-performing designs available, practitioners often face confusion when selecting the most effective pipeline for their specific task: \textit{Which topology is the best choice for my task, avoiding unnecessary communication token overhead while ensuring high-quality solution?} In response to this dilemma, we introduce G-Designer, an adaptive, efficient, and robust solution for multi-agent deployment, which dynamically designs task-aware, customized communication topologies. Specifically, G-Designer models the multi-agent system as a multi-agent network, leveraging a variational graph auto-encoder to encode both the nodes (agents) and a task-specific virtual node, and decodes a task-adaptive and high-performing communication topology. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks showcase that G-Designer is: \textbf{(1) high-performing}, achieving superior results on MMLU with accuracy at $84.50\%$ and on HumanEval with pass@1 at $89.90\%$; \textbf{(2) task-adaptive}, architecting communication protocols tailored to task difficulty, reducing token consumption by up to $95.33\%$ on HumanEval; and \textbf{(3) adversarially robust}, defending against agent adversarial attacks with merely $0.3\%$ accuracy drop.

### Language Models Encode Numbers Using Digit Representations in Base 10
**Authors**: Amit Arnold Levy, Mor Geva

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:00:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) frequently make errors when handling even simple numerical problems, such as comparing two small numbers. A natural hypothesis is that these errors stem from how LLMs represent numbers, and specifically, whether their representations of numbers capture their numeric values. We tackle this question from the observation that LLM errors on numerical tasks are often distributed across \textit{the digits} of the answer rather than normally around \textit{its numeric value}. Through a series of probing experiments and causal interventions, we show that LLMs internally represent numbers with individual circular representations per-digit in base 10. This digit-wise representation, as opposed to a value representation, sheds light on the error patterns of models on tasks involving numerical reasoning and could serve as a basis for future studies on analyzing numerical mechanisms in LLMs.

### On the Training Convergence of Transformers for In-Context   Classification
**Authors**: Wei Shen, Ruida Zhou, Jing Yang, Cong Shen

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:57:14Z

**Summary**: While transformers have demonstrated impressive capacities for in-context learning (ICL) in practice, theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanism enabling transformers to perform ICL is still in its infant stage. This work aims to theoretically study the training dynamics of transformers for in-context classification tasks. We demonstrate that, for in-context classification of Gaussian mixtures under certain assumptions, a single-layer transformer trained via gradient descent converges to a globally optimal model at a linear rate. We further quantify the impact of the training and testing prompt lengths on the ICL inference error of the trained transformer. We show that when the lengths of training and testing prompts are sufficiently large, the prediction of the trained transformer approaches the Bayes-optimal classifier. Experimental results corroborate the theoretical findings.

### Fractal Calibration for long-tailed object detection
**Authors**: Konstantinos Panagiotis Alexandridis, Ismail Elezi, Jiankang Deng, Anh Nguyen, Shan Luo

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:55:10Z

**Summary**: Real-world datasets follow an imbalanced distribution, which poses significant challenges in rare-category object detection. Recent studies tackle this problem by developing re-weighting and re-sampling methods, that utilise the class frequencies of the dataset. However, these techniques focus solely on the frequency statistics and ignore the distribution of the classes in image space, missing important information. In contrast to them, we propose FRActal CALibration (FRACAL): a novel post-calibration method for long-tailed object detection. FRACAL devises a logit adjustment method that utilises the fractal dimension to estimate how uniformly classes are distributed in image space. During inference, it uses the fractal dimension to inversely downweight the probabilities of uniformly spaced class predictions achieving balance in two axes: between frequent and rare categories, and between uniformly spaced and sparsely spaced classes. FRACAL is a post-processing method and it does not require any training, also it can be combined with many off-the-shelf models such as one-stage sigmoid detectors and two-stage instance segmentation models. FRACAL boosts the rare class performance by up to 8.6% and surpasses all previous methods on LVIS dataset, while showing good generalisation to other datasets such as COCO, V3Det and OpenImages. The code will be released.

### Layer-wise Importance Matters: Less Memory for Better Performance in   Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Kai Yao, Penlei Gao, Lichun Li, Yuan Zhao, Xiaofeng Wang, Wei Wang, Jianke Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:53:26Z

**Summary**: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have gained significant popularity for adapting pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, primarily due to their potential to significantly reduce memory and computational overheads. However, a common limitation in most PEFT approaches is their application of a uniform architectural design across all layers. This uniformity involves identical trainable modules and ignores the varying importance of each layer, leading to sub-optimal fine-tuning results. To overcome the above limitation and obtain better performance, we develop a novel approach, Importance-aware Sparse Tuning (IST), to fully utilize the inherent sparsity and select the most important subset of full layers with effective layer-wise importance scoring. The proposed IST is a versatile and plug-and-play technique compatible with various PEFT methods that operate on a per-layer basis. By leveraging the estimated importance scores, IST dynamically updates these selected layers in PEFT modules, leading to reduced memory demands. We further provide theoretical proof of convergence and empirical evidence of superior performance to demonstrate the advantages of IST over uniform updating strategies. Extensive experiments on a range of LLMs, PEFTs, and downstream tasks substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed method, showcasing IST's capacity to enhance existing layer-based PEFT methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Kaiseem/IST.

### LAP, Using Action Feasibility for Improved Uncertainty Alignment of   Large Language Model Planners
**Authors**: James F. Mullen Jr., Dinesh Manocha

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:35:56Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) showcase many desirable traits for intelligent and helpful robots. However, they are also known to hallucinate predictions. This issue is exacerbated in robotics where LLM hallucinations may result in robots confidently executing plans that are contrary to user goals, relying more frequently on human assistance, or preventing the robot from asking for help at all. In this work, we present LAP, a novel approach for utilizing off-the-shelf LLMs, alongside a novel Action feasibility metric, in robotic Planners that minimize harmful hallucinations and human intervention. Our key finding is that calculating and leveraging a new metric, which we call A-Feasibility, a measure of whether a given action is possible and safe in the provided scene, helps to mitigate hallucinations in LLM predictions and better align the LLM's confidence measure with the probability of success. We specifically propose an A-Feasibility metric which both combines scene context and prompting a LLM to determine if a given action is possible and safe in the scene, using the LLM's response to compute the score. Through experiments in both simulation and the real world on tasks with a variety of ambiguities, we show that LAP significantly increases success rate and decreases the amount of human intervention required relative to prior art. For example, in our real-world testing paradigm, LAP decreases the human help rate of previous methods by over 33% at a success rate of 70%.

### Transforming In-Vehicle Network Intrusion Detection: VAE-based Knowledge   Distillation Meets Explainable AI
**Authors**: Muhammet Anil Yagiz, Pedram MohajerAnsari, Mert D. Pese, Polat Goktas

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:29:55Z

**Summary**: In the evolving landscape of autonomous vehicles, ensuring robust in-vehicle network (IVN) security is paramount. This paper introduces an advanced intrusion detection system (IDS) called KD-XVAE that uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based knowledge distillation approach to enhance both performance and efficiency. Our model significantly reduces complexity, operating with just 1669 parameters and achieving an inference time of 0.3 ms per batch, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained automotive environments. Evaluations in the HCRL Car-Hacking dataset demonstrate exceptional capabilities, attaining perfect scores (Recall, Precision, F1 Score of 100%, and FNR of 0%) under multiple attack types, including DoS, Fuzzing, Gear Spoofing, and RPM Spoofing. Comparative analysis on the CICIoV2024 dataset further underscores its superiority over traditional machine learning models, achieving perfect detection metrics. We furthermore integrate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure transparency in the model's decisions. The VAE compresses the original feature space into a latent space, on which the distilled model is trained. SHAP(SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into the importance of each latent dimension, mapped back to original features for intuitive understanding. Our paper advances the field by integrating state-of-the-art techniques, addressing critical challenges in the deployment of efficient, trustworthy, and reliable IDSes for autonomous vehicles, ensuring enhanced protection against emerging cyber threats.

### Do financial regulators act in the public's interest? A Bayesian latent   class estimation framework for assessing regulatory responses to banking   crises
**Authors**: Padma Sharma, Trambak Banerjee

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:27:40Z

**Summary**: When banks fail amidst financial crises, the public criticizes regulators for bailing out or liquidating specific banks, especially the ones that gain attention due to their size or dominance. A comprehensive assessment of regulators, however, requires examining all their decisions, and not just specific ones, against the regulator's dual objective of preserving financial stability while discouraging moral hazard. In this article, we develop a Bayesian latent class estimation framework to assess regulators on these competing objectives and evaluate their decisions against resolution rules recommended by theoretical studies of bank behavior designed to contain moral hazard incentives. The proposed estimation framework addresses the unobserved heterogeneity underlying regulator's decisions in resolving failed banks and provides a disciplined statistical approach for inferring if they acted in the public interest. Our results reveal that during the crises of 1980's, the U.S. banking regulator's resolution decisions were consistent with recommended decision rules, while the U.S. savings and loans (S&L) regulator, which ultimately faced insolvency in 1989 at a cost of $132 billion to the taxpayer, had deviated from such recommendations. Timely interventions based on this evaluation could have redressed the S&L regulator's decision structure and prevented losses to taxpayers.

### Expressing and visualizing model uncertainty in Bayesian variable   selection using Cartesian credible sets
**Authors**: J. E. Griffin

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:26:29Z

**Summary**: Modern regression applications can involve hundreds or thousands of variables which motivates the use of variable selection methods. Bayesian variable selection defines a posterior distribution on the possible subsets of the variables (which are usually termed models) to express uncertainty about which variables are strongly linked to the response. This can be used to provide Bayesian model averaged predictions or inference, and to understand the relative importance of different variables. However, there has been little work on meaningful representations of this uncertainty beyond first order summaries. We introduce Cartesian credible sets to address this gap. The elements of these sets are formed by concatenating sub-models defined on each block of a partition of the variables. Investigating these sub-models allow us to understand whether the models in the Cartesian credible set always/never/sometimes include a particular variable or group of variables and provide a useful summary of model uncertainty. We introduce a method to find these sets that emphasizes ease of understanding and can be easily computed from Markov chain Monte Carlo output. The potential of the method is illustrated on regression problems with both small and large numbers of variables.

### Personas with Attitudes: Controlling LLMs for Diverse Data Annotation
**Authors**: Leon Fröhling, Gianluca Demartini, Dennis Assenmacher

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:22:49Z

**Summary**: We present a novel approach for enhancing diversity and control in data annotation tasks by personalizing large language models (LLMs). We investigate the impact of injecting diverse persona descriptions into LLM prompts across two studies, exploring whether personas increase annotation diversity and whether the impacts of individual personas on the resulting annotations are consistent and controllable. Our results show that persona-prompted LLMs produce more diverse annotations than LLMs prompted without personas and that these effects are both controllable and repeatable, making our approach a suitable tool for improving data annotation in subjective NLP tasks like toxicity detection.

### DySpec: Faster Speculative Decoding with Dynamic Token Tree Structure
**Authors**: Yunfan Xiong, Ruoyu Zhang, Yanzeng Li, Tianhao Wu, Lei Zou

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:21:15Z

**Summary**: While speculative decoding has recently appeared as a promising direction for accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs), the speedup and scalability are strongly bounded by the token acceptance rate. Prevalent methods usually organize predicted tokens as independent chains or fixed token trees, which fails to generalize to diverse query distributions. In this paper, we propose DySpec, a faster speculative decoding algorithm with a novel dynamic token tree structure. We begin by bridging the draft distribution and acceptance rate from intuitive and empirical clues, and successfully show that the two variables are strongly correlated. Based on this, we employ a greedy strategy to dynamically expand the token tree at run time. Theoretically, we show that our method can achieve optimal results under mild assumptions. Empirically, DySpec yields a higher acceptance rate and speedup than fixed trees. DySpec can drastically improve the throughput and reduce the latency of token generation across various data distribution and model sizes, which significantly outperforms strong competitors, including Specinfer and Sequoia. Under low temperature setting, DySpec can improve the throughput up to 9.1$\times$ and reduce the latency up to 9.4$\times$ on Llama2-70B. Under high temperature setting, DySpec can also improve the throughput up to 6.21$\times$, despite the increasing difficulty of speculating more than one token per step for draft model.

### Addressing the Null Paradox in Epidemic Models: Correcting for Collider   Bias in Causal Inference
**Authors**: Heejong Bong, Valérie Ventura, Larry Wasserman

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:18:44Z

**Summary**: We address the null paradox in epidemic models, where standard methods estimate a non-zero treatment effect despite the true effect being zero. This occurs when epidemic models mis-specify how causal effects propagate over time, especially when covariates act as colliders between past interventions and latent variables, leading to spurious correlations. Standard approaches like maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods can misinterpret these biases, inferring false causal relationships. While semi-parametric models and inverse propensity weighting offer potential solutions, they often limit the ability of domain experts to incorporate epidemic-specific knowledge. To resolve this, we propose an alternative estimating equation that corrects for collider bias while allowing for statistical inference with frequentist guarantees, previously unavailable for complex models like SEIR.

### LLM-Based Robust Product Classification in Commerce and Compliance
**Authors**: Sina Gholamian, Gianfranco Romani, Bartosz Rudnikowicz, Stavroula Skylaki

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:18:10Z

**Summary**: Product classification is a crucial task in international trade, as compliance regulations are verified and taxes and duties are applied based on product categories. Manual classification of products is time-consuming and error-prone, and the sheer volume of products imported and exported renders the manual process infeasible. Consequently, e-commerce platforms and enterprises involved in international trade have turned to automatic product classification using machine learning. However, current approaches do not consider the real-world challenges associated with product classification, such as very abbreviated and incomplete product descriptions. In addition, recent advancements in generative Large Language Models (LLMs) and their reasoning capabilities are mainly untapped in product classification and e-commerce. In this research, we explore the real-life challenges of industrial classification and we propose data perturbations that allow for realistic data simulation. Furthermore, we employ LLM-based product classification to improve the robustness of the prediction in presence of incomplete data. Our research shows that LLMs with in-context learning outperform the supervised approaches in the clean-data scenario. Additionally, we illustrate that LLMs are significantly more robust than the supervised approaches when data attacks are present.

### Probabilistic Principles for Biophysics and Neuroscience: Entropy   Production, Bayesian Mechanics & the Free-Energy Principle
**Authors**: Lancelot Da Costa

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:11:52Z

**Summary**: This thesis focuses on three fundamental aspects of biological systems; namely, entropy production, Bayesian mechanics, and the free-energy principle. The contributions are threefold: 1) We compute the entropy production for a greater class of systems than before, including almost any stationary diffusion process, such as degenerate diffusions where the driving noise does not act on all coordinates of the system. Importantly, this class of systems encompasses Markovian approximations of stochastic differential equations driven by colored noise, which is significant since biological systems at the macro- and meso-scale are generally subject to colored fluctuations. 2) We develop a Bayesian mechanics for biological and physical entities that interact with their environment in which we give sufficient and necessary conditions for the internal states of something to infer its external states, consistently with variational Bayesian inference in statistics and theoretical neuroscience. 3) We refine the constraints on Bayesian mechanics to obtain a description that is more specific to biological systems, called the free-energy principle. This says that active and internal states of biological systems unfold as minimising a quantity known as free energy. The mathematical foundation to the free-energy principle, presented here, unlocks a first principles approach to modeling and simulating behavior in neurobiology and artificial intelligence, by minimising free energy given a generative model of external and sensory states.

### LongHalQA: Long-Context Hallucination Evaluation for MultiModal Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Han Qiu, Jiaxing Huang, Peng Gao, Qin Qi, Xiaoqin Zhang, Ling Shao, Shijian Lu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:10:26Z

**Summary**: Hallucination, a phenomenon where multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) tend to generate textual responses that are plausible but unaligned with the image, has become one major hurdle in various MLLM-related applications. Several benchmarks have been created to gauge the hallucination levels of MLLMs, by either raising discriminative questions about the existence of objects or introducing LLM evaluators to score the generated text from MLLMs. However, the discriminative data largely involve simple questions that are not aligned with real-world text, while the generative data involve LLM evaluators that are computationally intensive and unstable due to their inherent randomness. We propose LongHalQA, an LLM-free hallucination benchmark that comprises 6K long and complex hallucination text. LongHalQA is featured by GPT4V-generated hallucinatory data that are well aligned with real-world scenarios, including object/image descriptions and multi-round conversations with 14/130 words and 189 words, respectively, on average. It introduces two new tasks, hallucination discrimination and hallucination completion, unifying both discriminative and generative evaluations in a single multiple-choice-question form and leading to more reliable and efficient evaluations without the need for LLM evaluators. Further, we propose an advanced pipeline that greatly facilitates the construction of future hallucination benchmarks with long and complex questions and descriptions. Extensive experiments over multiple recent MLLMs reveal various new challenges when they are handling hallucinations with long and complex textual data. Dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/hanqiu-hq/LongHalQA.

### THaMES: An End-to-End Tool for Hallucination Mitigation and Evaluation   in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Mengfei Liang, Archish Arun, Zekun Wu, Cristian Munoz, Jonathan Lutch, Emre Kazim, Adriano Koshiyama, Philip Treleaven

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:05:27Z

**Summary**: Hallucination, the generation of factually incorrect content, is a growing challenge in Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing detection and mitigation methods are often isolated and insufficient for domain-specific needs, lacking a standardized pipeline. This paper introduces THaMES (Tool for Hallucination Mitigations and EvaluationS), an integrated framework and library addressing this gap. THaMES offers an end-to-end solution for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs, featuring automated test set generation, multifaceted benchmarking, and adaptable mitigation strategies. It automates test set creation from any corpus, ensuring high data quality, diversity, and cost-efficiency through techniques like batch processing, weighted sampling, and counterfactual validation. THaMES assesses a model's ability to detect and reduce hallucinations across various tasks, including text generation and binary classification, applying optimal mitigation strategies like In-Context Learning (ICL), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT). Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs using a knowledge base of academic papers, political news, and Wikipedia reveal that commercial models like GPT-4o benefit more from RAG than ICL, while open-weight models like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-Nemo gain more from ICL. Additionally, PEFT significantly enhances the performance of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct in both evaluation tasks.

### Dash: Accelerating Distributed Private Convolutional Neural Network   Inference with Arithmetic Garbled Circuits
**Authors**: Jonas Sander, Sebastian Berndt, Ida Bruhns, Thomas Eisenbarth

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:02:47Z

**Summary**: The adoption of machine learning solutions is rapidly increasing across all parts of society. As the models grow larger, both training and inference of machine learning models is increasingly outsourced, e.g. to cloud service providers. This means that potentially sensitive data is processed on untrusted platforms, which bears inherent data security and privacy risks. In this work, we investigate how to protect distributed machine learning systems, focusing on deep convolutional neural networks. The most common and best-performing mixed MPC approaches are based on HE, secret sharing, and garbled circuits. They commonly suffer from large performance overheads, big accuracy losses, and communication overheads that grow linearly in the depth of the neural network. To improve on these problems, we present Dash, a fast and distributed private convolutional neural network inference scheme secure against malicious attackers. Building on arithmetic garbling gadgets [BMR16] and fancy-garbling [BCM+19], Dash is based purely on arithmetic garbled circuits. We introduce LabelTensors that allow us to leverage the massive parallelity of modern GPUs. Combined with state-of-the-art garbling optimizations, Dash outperforms previous garbling approaches up to a factor of about 100. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient scaling operation over the residues of the Chinese remainder theorem representation to arithmetic garbled circuits, which allows us to garble larger networks and achieve much higher accuracy than previous approaches. Finally, Dash requires only a single communication round per inference step, regardless of the depth of the neural network, and a very small constant online communication volume.

### GOVERN: Gradient Orientation Vote Ensemble for Multi-Teacher Reinforced   Distillation
**Authors**: Wenjie Zhou, Zhenxin Ding, Xiaodong Zhang, Haibo Shi, Junfeng Wang, Dawei Yin

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:01:11Z

**Summary**: Pre-trained language models have become an integral component of question-answering systems, achieving remarkable performance. However, for practical deployment, it is crucial to perform knowledge distillation to maintain high performance while operating under computational constraints. In this paper, we address a key question: given the importance of unsupervised distillation for student model performance, how can knowledge from multiple teacher models be effectively ensemble during this stage without the guidance of labels? We propose a novel algorithm, GOVERN, to tackle this issue. GOVERN has demonstrated significant improvements in both offline and online experiments, enabling the student model to achieve results comparable to that of teacher ensembles. Our experiments show that GOVERN remarkably requires a mere 1\% of the ensemble method's inference budget to achieve 99.5\% of performance. The proposed algorithm has been successfully deployed in a real-world commercial question-answering system, demonstrating its real-world applicability.

### Mitigate Position Bias in Large Language Models via Scaling a Single   Dimension
**Authors**: Yijiong Yu, Huiqiang Jiang, Xufang Luo, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Dongsheng Li, Yuqing Yang, Yongfeng Huang, Lili Qiu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:58:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various real-world scenarios due to their excellent generalization capabilities and robust generative abilities. However, they exhibit position bias, also known as "lost in the middle", a phenomenon that is especially pronounced in long-context scenarios, which indicates the placement of the key information in different positions of a prompt can significantly affect accuracy. This paper first explores the micro-level manifestations of position bias, concluding that attention weights are a micro-level expression of position bias. It further identifies that, in addition to position embeddings, causal attention mask also contributes to position bias by creating position-specific hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose a method to mitigate position bias by scaling this positional hidden states. Experiments on the NaturalQuestions Multi-document QA, KV retrieval, LongBench and timeline reorder tasks, using various models including RoPE models, context windowextended models, and Alibi models, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach. Our method can improve performance by up to 15.2% by modifying just one dimension of hidden states. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/PositionalHidden.

### Learning Truncated Causal History Model for Video Restoration
**Authors**: Amirhosein Ghasemabadi, Muhammad Kamran Janjua, Mohammad Salameh, Di Niu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:57:10Z

**Summary**: One key challenge to video restoration is to model the transition dynamics of video frames governed by motion. In this work, we propose TURTLE to learn the truncated causal history model for efficient and high-performing video restoration. Unlike traditional methods that process a range of contextual frames in parallel, TURTLE enhances efficiency by storing and summarizing a truncated history of the input frame latent representation into an evolving historical state. This is achieved through a sophisticated similarity-based retrieval mechanism that implicitly accounts for inter-frame motion and alignment. The causal design in TURTLE enables recurrence in inference through state-memorized historical features while allowing parallel training by sampling truncated video clips. We report new state-of-the-art results on a multitude of video restoration benchmark tasks, including video desnowing, nighttime video deraining, video raindrops and rain streak removal, video super-resolution, real-world and synthetic video deblurring, and blind video denoising while reducing the computational cost compared to existing best contextual methods on all these tasks.

**Authors**: Harsh Chaudhari, Giorgio Severi, John Abascal, Matthew Jagielski, Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, Milad Nasr, Cristina Nita-Rotaru, Alina Oprea

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:56:58Z

**Summary**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) expands the capabilities of modern large language models (LLMs), by anchoring, adapting, and personalizing their responses to the most relevant knowledge sources. It is particularly useful in chatbot applications, allowing developers to customize LLM output without expensive retraining. Despite their significant utility in various applications, RAG systems present new security risks. In this work, we propose new attack vectors that allow an adversary to inject a single malicious document into a RAG system's knowledge base, and mount a backdoor poisoning attack. We design Phantom, a general two-stage optimization framework against RAG systems, that crafts a malicious poisoned document leading to an integrity violation in the model's output. First, the document is constructed to be retrieved only when a specific trigger sequence of tokens appears in the victim's queries. Second, the document is further optimized with crafted adversarial text that induces various adversarial objectives on the LLM output, including refusal to answer, reputation damage, privacy violations, and harmful behaviors. We demonstrate our attacks on multiple LLM architectures, including Gemma, Vicuna, and Llama, and show that they transfer to GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4. Finally, we successfully conducted a Phantom attack on NVIDIA's black-box production RAG system, "Chat with RTX".

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:52:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown effectiveness across many applications. However, their use in data science scenarios requiring solving long-term interconnected tasks, dynamic data adjustments and domain expertise remains challenging. Previous approaches primarily focus on individual tasks, making it difficult to assess the complete data science workflow. Moreover, they struggle to handle real-time changes in intermediate data and fail to adapt dynamically to evolving task dependencies inherent to data science problems. In this paper, we present Data Interpreter, an LLM-based agent designed to automatically solve various data science problems end-to-end. Our Data Interpreter incorporates two key modules: 1) Hierarchical Graph Modeling, which breaks down complex problems into manageable subproblems, enabling dynamic node generation and graph optimization; and 2) Programmable Node Generation, a technique that refines and verifies each subproblem to iteratively improve code generation results and robustness. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the superiority of Data Interpreter. On InfiAgent-DABench, it achieves a 25% performance boost, raising accuracy from 75.9% to 94.9%. For machine learning and open-ended tasks, it improves performance from 88% to 95%, and from 60% to 97%, respectively. Moreover, on the MATH dataset, Data Interpreter achieves remarkable performance with a 26% improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT.

### Light-Weight Fault Tolerant Attention for Large Language Model Training
**Authors**: Yuhang Liang, Xinyi Li, Jie Ren, Ang Li, Bo Fang, Jieyang Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:52:45Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, the training of these models is computationally intensive and susceptible to faults, particularly in the attention mechanism, which is a critical component of transformer-based LLMs. In this paper, we investigate the impact of faults on LLM training, focusing on INF, NaN, and near-INF values in the computation results with systematic fault injection experiments. We observe the propagation patterns of these errors, which can trigger non-trainable states in the model and disrupt training, forcing the procedure to load from checkpoints.To mitigate the impact of these faults, we propose ATTNChecker, the first Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) technique tailored for the attention mechanism in LLMs. ATTNChecker is designed based on fault propagation patterns of LLM and incorporates performance optimization to adapt to both system reliability and model vulnerability while providing lightweight protection for fast LLM training. Evaluations on four LLMs show that ATTNChecker on average incurs on average 7% overhead on training while detecting and correcting all extreme errors. Compared with the state-of-the-art checkpoint/restore approach, ATTNChecker reduces recovery overhead by up to 49x.

### Converging to a Lingua Franca: Evolution of Linguistic Regions and   Semantics Alignment in Multilingual Large Language Models
**Authors**: Hongchuan Zeng, Senyu Han, Lu Chen, Kai Yu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:49:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, particularly in multilingual contexts. While recent studies suggest that LLMs can transfer skills learned in one language to others, the internal mechanisms behind this ability remain unclear. We observed that the neuron activation patterns of LLMs exhibit similarities when processing the same language, revealing the existence and location of key linguistic regions. Additionally, we found that neuron activation patterns are similar when processing sentences with the same semantic meaning in different languages. This indicates that LLMs map semantically identical inputs from different languages into a "Lingua Franca", a common semantic latent space that allows for consistent processing across languages. This semantic alignment becomes more pronounced with training and increased model size, resulting in a more language-agnostic activation pattern. Moreover, we found that key linguistic neurons are concentrated in the first and last layers of LLMs, becoming denser in the first layers as training progresses. Experiments on BLOOM and LLaMA2 support these findings, highlighting the structural evolution of multilingual LLMs during training and scaling up. This paper provides insights into the internal workings of LLMs, offering a foundation for future improvements in their cross-lingual capabilities.

### Randomization-based Inference for MCP-Mod
**Authors**: Lukas Pin, Oleksandr Sverdlov, Frank Bretz, Björn Bornkamp

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:48:27Z

**Summary**: Dose selection is critical in pharmaceutical drug development, as it directly impacts therapeutic efficacy and patient safety of a drug. The Generalized Multiple Comparison Procedures and Modeling (MCP-Mod) approach is commonly used in Phase II trials for testing and estimation of dose-response relationships. However, its effectiveness in small sample sizes, particularly with binary endpoints, is hindered by issues like complete separation in logistic regression, leading to non-existence of estimates. Motivated by an actual clinical trial using the MCP-Mod approach, this paper introduces penalized maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and randomization-based inference techniques to address these challenges. Randomization-based inference allows for exact finite sample inference, while population-based inference for MCP-Mod typically relies on asymptotic approximations. Simulation studies demonstrate that randomization-based tests can enhance statistical power in small to medium-sized samples while maintaining control over type-I error rates, even in the presence of time trends. Our results show that residual-based randomization tests using penalized MLEs not only improve computational efficiency but also outperform standard randomization-based methods, making them an adequate choice for dose-finding analyses within the MCP-Mod framework. Additionally, we apply these methods to pharmacometric settings, demonstrating their effectiveness in such scenarios. The results in this paper underscore the potential of randomization-based inference for the analysis of dose-finding trials, particularly in small sample contexts.

### Enhancing Agent Learning through World Dynamics Modeling
**Authors**: Zhiyuan Sun, Haochen Shi, Marc-Alexandre Côté, Glen Berseth, Xingdi Yuan, Bang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:48:04Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to tasks in language understanding and interactive decision-making, with their impressive performance largely attributed to the extensive domain knowledge embedded within them. However, the depth and breadth of this knowledge can vary across domains. Many existing approaches assume that LLMs possess a comprehensive understanding of their environment, often overlooking potential gaps in their grasp of actual world dynamics. To address this, we introduce Discover, Verify, and Evolve (DiVE), a framework that discovers world dynamics from a small number of demonstrations, verifies the accuracy of these dynamics, and evolves new, advanced dynamics tailored to the current situation. Through extensive evaluations, we assess the impact of each component on performance and compare the dynamics generated by DiVE to human-annotated dynamics. Our results show that LLMs guided by DiVE make more informed decisions, achieving rewards comparable to human players in the Crafter environment and surpassing methods that require prior task-specific training in the MiniHack environment.

### Enhancing Statistical Validity and Power in Hybrid Controlled Trials: A   Randomization Inference Approach with Conformal Selective Borrowing
**Authors**: Ke Zhu, Shu Yang, Xiaofei Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:47:10Z

**Summary**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for causal inference on treatment effects. However, they can be underpowered due to small population sizes in rare diseases and limited number of patients willing to participate due to questions regarding equipoise among treatment groups in common diseases. Hybrid controlled trials use external controls (ECs) from historical studies or large observational databases to enhance statistical efficiency, and as such, are considered for drug evaluation in rare diseases or indications associated with low trial participation. However, non-randomized ECs can introduce biases that compromise validity and inflate type I errors for treatment discovery, particularly in small samples. To address this, we extend the Fisher randomization test (FRT) to hybrid controlled trials. Our approach involves a test statistic combining RCT and EC data and is based solely on randomization in the RCT. This method strictly controls the type I error rate, even with biased ECs, and improves power by incorporating unbiased ECs. To mitigate the power loss caused by biased ECs, we introduce conformal selective borrowing, which uses conformal p-values to individually select unbiased ECs, offering the flexibility to use either computationally efficient parametric models or off-the-shelf machine learning models to construct the conformal score function, along with model-agnostic reliability. We identify a risk-benefit trade-off in the power of FRT associated with different selection thresholds for conformal p-values. We offer both fixed and adaptive selection threshold options, enabling robust performance across varying levels of hidden bias. The advantages of our method are demonstrated through simulations and an application to a small lung cancer RCT with ECs from the National Cancer Database. Our method is available in the R package intFRT on GitHub.

### Parameter estimation of structural dynamics with neural operators   enabled surrogate modeling
**Authors**: Mingyuan Zhou, Haoze Song, Wenjing Ye, Wei Wang, Zhilu Lai

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:47:01Z

**Summary**: Parameter estimation generally involves inferring the values of mathematical models derived from first principles or expert knowledge, which is challenging for complex structural systems. In this work, we present a unified deep learning-based framework for parameterization, forward modeling, and inverse modeling of structural dynamics. The parameterization is flexible and can be user-defined, including physical and/or non-physical (customized) parameters. In forward modeling, we train a neural operator for response prediction -- forming a surrogate model, which leverages the defined system parameters and excitation forces as inputs. The inverse modeling focuses on estimating system parameters. In particular, the learned forward surrogate model (which is differentiable) is utilized for preliminary parameter estimation via gradient-based optimization; to further boost the parameter estimation, we introduce a neural refinement method to mitigate ill-posed problems, which often occur in the former. The framework's effectiveness is verified numerically and experimentally, in both interpolation and extrapolation cases, indicating its capability to capture intrinsic dynamics of structural systems from both forward and inverse perspectives. Moreover, the framework's flexibility is expected to support a wide range of applications, including surrogate modeling, structural identification, damage detection, and inverse design of structural systems.

**Authors**: Abdelhakim Benechehab, Youssef Attia El Hili, Ambroise Odonnat, Oussama Zekri, Albert Thomas, Giuseppe Paolo, Maurizio Filippone, Ievgen Redko, Balázs Kégl

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:46:53Z

**Summary**: The emerging zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their applications in areas extending well beyond natural language processing tasks. In reinforcement learning, while LLMs have been extensively used in text-based environments, their integration with continuous state spaces remains understudied. In this paper, we investigate how pre-trained LLMs can be leveraged to predict in context the dynamics of continuous Markov decision processes. We identify handling multivariate data and incorporating the control signal as key challenges that limit the potential of LLMs' deployment in this setup and propose Disentangled In-Context Learning (DICL) to address them. We present proof-of-concept applications in two reinforcement learning settings: model-based policy evaluation and data-augmented off-policy reinforcement learning, supported by theoretical analysis of the proposed methods. Our experiments further demonstrate that our approach produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. We release the code at https://github.com/abenechehab/dicl.

### MTU-Bench: A Multi-granularity Tool-Use Benchmark for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Pei Wang, Yanan Wu, Zekun Wang, Jiaheng Liu, Xiaoshuai Song, Zhongyuan Peng, Ken Deng, Chenchen Zhang, Jiakai Wang, Junran Peng, Ge Zhang, Hangyu Guo, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:46:17Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have displayed massive improvements in reasoning and decision-making skills and can hold natural conversations with users. Recently, many tool-use benchmark datasets have been proposed. However, existing datasets have the following limitations: (1). Insufficient evaluation scenarios (e.g., only cover limited tool-use scenes). (2). Extensive evaluation costs (e.g., GPT API costs). To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a multi-granularity tool-use benchmark for large language models called MTU-Bench. For the "multi-granularity" property, our MTU-Bench covers five tool usage scenes (i.e., single-turn and single-tool, single-turn and multiple-tool, multiple-turn and single-tool, multiple-turn and multiple-tool, and out-of-distribution tasks). Besides, all evaluation metrics of our MTU-Bench are based on the prediction results and the ground truth without using any GPT or human evaluation metrics. Moreover, our MTU-Bench is collected by transforming existing high-quality datasets to simulate real-world tool usage scenarios, and we also propose an instruction dataset called MTU-Instruct data to enhance the tool-use abilities of existing LLMs. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our MTU-Bench. Code and data will be released at https: //github.com/MTU-Bench-Team/MTU-Bench.git.

### Mitigating Backdoor Attack by Injecting Proactive Defensive Backdoor
**Authors**: Shaokui Wei, Hongyuan Zha, Baoyuan Wu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:30:46Z

**Summary**: Data-poisoning backdoor attacks are serious security threats to machine learning models, where an adversary can manipulate the training dataset to inject backdoors into models. In this paper, we focus on in-training backdoor defense, aiming to train a clean model even when the dataset may be potentially poisoned. Unlike most existing methods that primarily detect and remove/unlearn suspicious samples to mitigate malicious backdoor attacks, we propose a novel defense approach called PDB (Proactive Defensive Backdoor). Specifically, PDB leverages the home-field advantage of defenders by proactively injecting a defensive backdoor into the model during training. Taking advantage of controlling the training process, the defensive backdoor is designed to suppress the malicious backdoor effectively while remaining secret to attackers. In addition, we introduce a reversible mapping to determine the defensive target label. During inference, PDB embeds a defensive trigger in the inputs and reverses the model's prediction, suppressing malicious backdoor and ensuring the model's utility on the original task. Experimental results across various datasets and models demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art defense performance against a wide range of backdoor attacks. The code is available at https://github.com/shawkui/Proactive_Defensive_Backdoor.

### IntGrad MT: Eliciting LLMs' Machine Translation Capabilities with   Sentence Interpolation and Gradual MT
**Authors**: Seung-Woo Choi, Ga-Hyun Yoo, Jay-Yoon Lee

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T01:45:28Z

**Summary**: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in translation without needing to be finetuned on additional parallel corpora. However, they still underperform for low-resource language pairs. Previous works have focused on mitigating this issue by leveraging relevant few-shot examples or external resources such as dictionaries or grammar books, making models heavily reliant on these nonparametric sources of information. In this paper, we propose a novel method named IntGrad MT that focuses on fully exploiting an LLM's inherent translation capability. IntGrad MT achieves this by constructing a chain of few-shot examples, each consisting of a source sentence and the model's own translation, that rise incrementally in difficulty. IntGrad MT employs two techniques: Sentence Interpolation, which generates a sequence of sentences that gradually change from an easy sentence to translate to a difficult one, and Gradual MT, which sequentially translates this chain using translations of earlier sentences as few-shot examples for the translation of subsequent ones. With this approach, we observe a substantial enhancement in the xCOMET scores of various LLMs for multiple languages, especially in low-resource languages such as Hindi(8.26), Swahili(7.10), Bengali(6.97) and Marathi(13.03). Our approach presents a practical way of enhancing LLMs' performance without extra training.

### An Experimental Design for Anytime-Valid Causal Inference on Multi-Armed   Bandits
**Authors**: Biyonka Liang, Iavor Bojinov

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:25:03Z

**Summary**: Experimentation is crucial for managers to rigorously quantify the value of a change and determine if it leads to a statistically significant improvement over the status quo. As companies increasingly mandate that all changes undergo experimentation before widespread release, two challenges arise: (1) minimizing the proportion of customers assigned to the inferior treatment and (2) increasing experimentation velocity by enabling data-dependent stopping. This paper addresses both challenges by introducing the Mixture Adaptive Design (MAD), a new experimental design for multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms that enables anytime-valid inference on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) for \emph{any} MAB algorithm. Intuitively, MAD "mixes" any bandit algorithm with a Bernoulli design, where at each time step, the probability of assigning a unit via the Bernoulli design is determined by a user-specified deterministic sequence that can converge to zero. This sequence lets managers directly control the trade-off between regret minimization and inferential precision. Under mild conditions on the rate the sequence converges to zero, we provide a confidence sequence that is asymptotically anytime-valid and guaranteed to shrink around the true ATE. Hence, when the true ATE converges to a non-zero value, the MAD confidence sequence is guaranteed to exclude zero in finite time. Therefore, the MAD enables managers to stop experiments early while ensuring valid inference, enhancing both the efficiency and reliability of adaptive experiments. Empirically, we demonstrate that the MAD achieves finite-sample anytime-validity while accurately and precisely estimating the ATE, all without incurring significant losses in reward compared to standard bandit designs.

### Polarization-encoded photonic quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory based   on a quantum dot source
**Authors**: Giovanni Rodari, Francesco Hoch, Alessia Suprano, Taira Giordani, Elena Negro, Gonzalo Carvacho, Nicolò Spagnolo, Ernesto F. Galvão, Fabio Sciarrino

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:21:03Z

**Summary**: A Bernoulli factory is a randomness manipulation routine that takes as input a Bernoulli random variable, outputting another Bernoulli variable whose bias is a function of the input bias. Recently proposed quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory schemes encode both input and output variables in qubit amplitudes. This primitive could be used as a sub-routine for more complex quantum algorithms involving Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo methods. Here, we report an experimental implementation of a polarization-encoded photonic quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory. We present and test three interferometric set-ups implementing the basic operations of an algebraic field (inversion, multiplication, and addition) which, chained together, allow for the implementation of a generic quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory. These in-bulk schemes are validated using a quantum dot-based single-photon source featuring high brightness and indistinguishability, paired with a time-to-spatial demultiplexing setup to prepare input resources of up to three single-photon states.

### Population synthesis and astrophysical inference for high-$z$ JWST   galaxies
**Authors**: Trey Driskell, Ethan O. Nadler, Andrew Benson, Vera Gluscevic

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:18:46Z

**Summary**: Observations of the high-$z$ Universe from JWST have revealed a new population of bright, early galaxies. A robust statistical interpretation of this data requires fast forward models that account for uncertainties in galaxy evolution and incorporate observational systematic effects. We present a probabilistic framework for population synthesis of high-$z$ galaxies and inference of their properties. Our framework is based on the semi-analytic galaxy-formation model Galacticus. To infer the astrophysical parameters governing high-$z$ galaxy evolution, we analyze JWST data from the CEERS and NGDEEP surveys and calculate the likelihood of observing individual objects in apparent magnitude--redshift space, for $z\geq8.5$ galaxy candidates. We include observational selection effects due to limited survey volume and depth, as well as photometric redshift uncertainties. We recover the posterior probability distribution for parameters describing star formation and outflow rates. We place an upper limit on the star formation timescale of $500~\mathrm{Myr}$ at a disk velocity of $50~\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$, and we infer a characteristic velocity at which the outflow mass-loading factor is $\sim 1$ of $150^{+280}_{-60}~\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$, both at $95\%$ confidence. Marginalizing over our astrophysical model, we find that galaxies in CEERS and NGDEEP data occupy halos with virial masses $10^{10\pm 0.5}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ at $8.5\leq z\leq 12$, at $95\%$ confidence. The star formation timescale preferred by our fit is relatively short compared to typical values at lower redshifts, consistent with previous findings. The modeling and analysis framework presented here can enable systematic tests of high-$z$ galaxies' dust content, initial mass functions, and star formation burstiness in the future.

### Structured Optimal Variational Inference for Dynamic Latent Space Models
**Authors**: Peng Zhao, Anirban Bhattacharya, Debdeep Pati, Bani K. Mallick

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:09:41Z

**Summary**: We consider a latent space model for dynamic networks, where our objective is to estimate the pairwise inner products plus the intercept of the latent positions. To balance posterior inference and computational scalability, we consider a structured mean-field variational inference framework, where the time-dependent properties of the dynamic networks are exploited to facilitate computation and inference. Additionally, an easy-to-implement block coordinate ascent algorithm is developed with message-passing type updates in each block, whereas the complexity per iteration is linear with the number of nodes and time points. To certify the optimality, we demonstrate that the variational risk of the proposed variational inference approach attains the minimax optimal rate with only a logarithm factor under certain conditions. To this end, we first derive the minimax lower bound, which might be of independent interest. In addition, we show that the posterior under commonly adopted Gaussian random walk priors can achieve the minimax lower bound with only a logarithm factor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such a throughout theoretical analysis of Bayesian dynamic latent space models. Simulations and real data analysis demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology and the efficiency of our algorithm.

**Authors**: Md Kowsher, Md. Shohanur Islam Sobuj, Nusrat Jahan Prottasha, E. Alejandro Alanis, Ozlem Ozmen Garibay, Niloofar Yousefi

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:08:57Z

**Summary**: Time series forecasting remains a challenging task, particularly in the context of complex multiscale temporal patterns. This study presents LLM-Mixer, a framework that improves forecasting accuracy through the combination of multiscale time-series decomposition with pre-trained LLMs (Large Language Models). LLM-Mixer captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends by decomposing the data into multiple temporal resolutions and processing them with a frozen LLM, guided by a textual prompt specifically designed for time-series data. Extensive experiments conducted on multivariate and univariate datasets demonstrate that LLM-Mixer achieves competitive performance, outperforming recent state-of-the-art models across various forecasting horizons. This work highlights the potential of combining multiscale analysis and LLMs for effective and scalable time-series forecasting.

### Unlocking Structured Thinking in Language Models with Cognitive   Prompting
**Authors**: Oliver Kramer, Jill Baumann

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:08:32Z

**Summary**: We propose cognitive prompting as a novel approach to guide problem-solving in large language models (LLMs) through structured, human-like cognitive operations such as goal clarification, decomposition, filtering, abstraction, and pattern recognition. By employing systematic, step-by-step reasoning, cognitive prompting enables LLMs to efficiently tackle complex, multi-step tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive prompting on Meta's LLaMA models, comparing performance on arithmetic reasoning tasks using the GSM8K dataset and on commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Our analysis includes comparisons between models without cognitive prompting, models with a static sequence of cognitive operations, and models using reflective cognitive prompting, where the LLM dynamically self-selects the sequence of cognitive operations. The results show that cognitive prompting, particularly when dynamically adapted, significantly improves the performance of larger models, such as LLaMA3.1 70B, and enhances their ability to handle multi-step reasoning tasks. This approach also improves interpretability and flexibility, highlighting cognitive prompting as a promising strategy for general-purpose AI reasoning.

### Leaving the barn door open for Clever Hans: Simple features predict LLM   benchmark answers
**Authors**: Lorenzo Pacchiardi, Marko Tesic, Lucy G. Cheke, José Hernández-Orallo

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:05:41Z

**Summary**: The integrity of AI benchmarks is fundamental to accurately assess the capabilities of AI systems. The internal validity of these benchmarks - i.e., making sure they are free from confounding factors - is crucial for ensuring that they are measuring what they are designed to measure. In this paper, we explore a key issue related to internal validity: the possibility that AI systems can solve benchmarks in unintended ways, bypassing the capability being tested. This phenomenon, widely known in human and animal experiments, is often referred to as the 'Clever Hans' effect, where tasks are solved using spurious cues, often involving much simpler processes than those putatively assessed. Previous research suggests that language models can exhibit this behaviour as well. In several older Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks, individual $n$-grams like "not" have been found to be highly predictive of the correct labels, and supervised NLP models have been shown to exploit these patterns. In this work, we investigate the extent to which simple $n$-grams extracted from benchmark instances can be combined to predict labels in modern multiple-choice benchmarks designed for LLMs, and whether LLMs might be using such $n$-gram patterns to solve these benchmarks. We show how simple classifiers trained on these $n$-grams can achieve high scores on several benchmarks, despite lacking the capabilities being tested. Additionally, we provide evidence that modern LLMs might be using these superficial patterns to solve benchmarks. This suggests that the internal validity of these benchmarks may be compromised and caution should be exercised when interpreting LLM performance results on them.

### Teaching AI Agents to Search with Reflective-MCTS and Exploratory   Learning
**Authors**: Xiao Yu, Baolin Peng, Vineeth Vajipey, Hao Cheng, Michel Galley, Jianfeng Gao, Zhou Yu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:59:46Z

**Summary**: Autonomous agents have demonstrated significant potential in automating complex multistep decision-making tasks. However, even state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4o, still fall short of human-level performance, particularly in intricate web environments and long-horizon planning tasks. To address these limitations, we present Reflective Monte Carlo Tree Search (R-MCTS) and Exploratory Learning to build o1-like models for agentic applications. We first introduce R-MCTS, a novel test-time algorithm designed to enhance the ability of AI agents to explore decision space on the fly. R-MCTS extends traditional MCTS by 1) incorporating contrastive reflection, allowing agents to learn from past interactions and dynamically improve their search efficiency; and 2) using multi-agent debate to provide reliable state evaluation. Next, we introduce Exploratory Learning, a novel learning strategy to teach agents to search at inference time without relying on any external search algorithms. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, our GPT-4o-based R-MCTS agent achieves a 6% to 30% relative improvement across various tasks compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Additionally, we show that the experience gained from test-time search can be effectively transferred back to GPT-4o via fine-tuning. After Exploratory Learning, GPT-4o 1) demonstrates the ability to explore the environment, evaluate a state, and backtrack to viable ones when it detects that the current state cannot lead to success, and 2) matches 87% of R-MCTS's performance while using significantly less compute. Notably, our work demonstrates the compute scaling properties in both training - data collection with R-MCTS - and testing time. These results suggest a promising research direction to enhance VLMs' reasoning and planning capabilities for agentic applications via test-time search and self-learning.

**Summary**: Having a detailed knowledge of the intracluster medium (ICM) to infer the exact cluster physics such as the cluster dynamical state is crucial for cluster-based cosmological studies. This knowledge limits the accuracy and precision of mass estimation, a key parameter for such studies. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of cluster ACT-CL J0240.0+0116 using a multi-wavelength approach, with a primary focus on high angular resolution Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) thermal component observations obtained under the NIKA2 Sunyaev-Zeldovich Large Programme (LPSZ). We create composite images using NIKA2, X-ray, and optical galaxy number density maps. The results reveal distinct signs of disturbance within the cluster with the distributions of gas and member galaxies that do not overlap. We also find suggestions of an inflow of matter onto the cluster from the southwestern direction. Ultimately, we classify the cluster as disturbed, using morphological indicators derived from its SZ, X-ray, and optical image. The cluster SZ signal is also contaminated by a strong central point source. We adopt different approaches to handling this contaminant and find the estimates of our pressure and hydrostatic mass profiles robust to the point source mitigation model. The cluster hydrostatic mass is estimated at $4.25^{+0.50}_{-0.45\, } \times 10^{14} \,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ for the case where the point source was masked. These values are consistent with the mass estimated using only X-ray data and with those from previous SZ studies of the Atacama cosmology telescope (ACT) survey, with improved precision on the mass estimate. Our findings strongly suggest that ACT-CL J0240.0+0116 is a disturbed cluster system, and the detailed observations and derived values serve as a compelling case study for the capabilities of the LPSZ in mapping the cluster ICM with high precision.

### GA-NIFS: An extremely nitrogen-loud and chemically stratified galaxy at   $z\sim 5.55$

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:53:04Z

**Summary**: We report the chemical abundance pattern of GS\_3073, a galaxy at $z=5.55$ which was previously confirmed to host an overmassive active black hole, by leveraging the detection of about 40 emission lines, combining JWST/NIRSpec observations and ground-based (VLT/VIMOS) data. Based on the rest-frame UV emission lines, which trace high-density ($\sim 10^5~{\rm cm}^{-3}$) and highly ionized gas, we derived an abundance ratio of $\rm log(N/O) = 0.42^{+0.13}_{-0.10}$. At an estimated metallicity of $0.2~Z_{\odot}$, this is the most extreme nitrogen-rich object found by JWST thus far. In comparison, the relative carbon abundance derived from the rest-frame UV emission lines is $\rm log(C/O) = -0.38^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$, which is not significantly higher than those in local galaxies and stars with similar metallicities. We also found potential detection of coronal lines including [FeVII]$\lambda 6087$ and [FeXIV]$\lambda 5303$, both blended with [CaV]. We inferred a range of Fe abundances compatible with those in local stars and galaxies. Overall, the chemical abundance pattern of GS\_3073 is compatible with enrichment by super-massive stars with $M_* \gtrsim 1000~M_\odot$, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, or Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Interestingly, when using optical emission lines which trace lower density ($\sim 10^3~{\rm cm}^{-3}$) and lower ionization gas, we found a sub-solar N/O ratio. We interpret the difference in N/O derived from UV lines and optical lines as evidence for a stratified system, where the inner and denser region is both more chemically enriched and more ionized. Taking this luminous, well-studied system as a benchmark, our results suggest that nitrogen loudness in high-$z$ galaxies is confined to the central, dense, and highly ionized region of the galaxies, while the bulk of the galaxies evolves more normally.

### LLM-wrapper: Black-Box Semantic-Aware Adaptation of Vision-Language   Models for Referring Expression Comprehension
**Authors**: Amaia Cardiel, Eloi Zablocki, Elias Ramzi, Oriane Siméoni, Matthieu Cord

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:52:55Z

**Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various open-vocabulary tasks, yet their zero-shot performance lags behind task-specific finetuned models, particularly in complex tasks like Referring Expression Comprehension (REC). Fine-tuning usually requires 'white-box' access to the model's architecture and weights, which is not always feasible due to proprietary or privacy concerns. In this work, we propose LLM-wrapper, a method for 'black-box' adaptation of VLMs for the REC task using Large Language Models (LLMs). LLM-wrapper capitalizes on the reasoning abilities of LLMs, improved with a light fine-tuning, to select the most relevant bounding box matching the referring expression, from candidates generated by a zero-shot black-box VLM. Our approach offers several advantages: it enables the adaptation of closed-source models without needing access to their internal workings, it is versatile as it works with any VLM, it transfers to new VLMs, and it allows for the adaptation of an ensemble of VLMs. We evaluate LLM-wrapper on multiple datasets using different VLMs and LLMs, demonstrating significant performance improvements and highlighting the versatility of our method. While LLM-wrapper is not meant to directly compete with standard white-box fine-tuning, it offers a practical and effective alternative for black-box VLM adaptation. The code will be open-sourced.

### Eliciting Textual Descriptions from Representations of Continuous   Prompts
**Authors**: Dana Ramati, Daniela Gottesman, Mor Geva

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:46:11Z

**Summary**: Continuous prompts, or "soft prompts", are a widely-adopted parameter-efficient tuning strategy for large language models, but are often less favorable due to their opaque nature. Prior attempts to interpret continuous prompts relied on projecting individual prompt tokens onto the vocabulary space. However, this approach is problematic as performant prompts can yield arbitrary or contradictory text, and it interprets prompt tokens individually. In this work, we propose a new approach to interpret continuous prompts that elicits textual descriptions from their representations during model inference. Using a Patchscopes variant (Ghandeharioun et al., 2024) called InSPEcT over various tasks, we show our method often yields accurate task descriptions which become more faithful as task performance increases. Moreover, an elaborated version of InSPEcT reveals biased features in continuous prompts, whose presence correlates with biased model predictions. Providing an effective interpretability solution, InSPEcT can be leveraged to debug unwanted properties in continuous prompts and inform developers on ways to mitigate them.

### Retrieval Augmented Spelling Correction for E-Commerce Applications
**Authors**: Xuan Guo, Rohit Patki, Dante Everaert, Christopher Potts

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:42:18Z

**Summary**: The rapid introduction of new brand names into everyday language poses a unique challenge for e-commerce spelling correction services, which must distinguish genuine misspellings from novel brand names that use unconventional spelling. We seek to address this challenge via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). On this approach, product names are retrieved from a catalog and incorporated into the context used by a large language model (LLM) that has been fine-tuned to do contextual spelling correction. Through quantitative evaluation and qualitative error analyses, we find improvements in spelling correction utilizing the RAG framework beyond a stand-alone LLM. We also demonstrate the value of additional finetuning of the LLM to incorporate retrieved context.

### Transformer Layer Injection: A Novel Approach for Efficient Upscaling of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: James Vo

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:41:44Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we propose Transformer Layer Injection (TLI), a novel method for efficiently upscaling large language models (LLMs) while minimizing computational costs and maintaining model performance. Model scale is a key factor in enhancing the quality of machine learning models, and TLI addresses the challenge of scaling by reducing initial loss, minimizing fine-tuning requirements, and preserving model complexity. Our approach improves upon the conventional Depth Up-Scaling (DUS) technique by injecting new layers into every set of K layers, enabling hidden representations to pass through transformer blocks with minimal disruption. We compare TLI with existing approaches, including Mixture of Experts (MoE) and DUS, and validate its efficiency through experiments on small LLMs (LLama3 1B, 3B, and 8B). Results show that TLI achieves better initialization, requires fewer training steps, and delivers superior accuracy on tasks such as KoBEST and KMCQA, with models performing effectively even without additional training. TLI is demonstrated to be both data-efficient and cost-effective, significantly outperforming existing methods. Its scalability and simplicity make it a promising solution for upscaling transformer-based models, with potential applications in scaling models from 10B to 405B parameters.

### ED-ViT: Splitting Vision Transformer for Distributed Inference on Edge   Devices
**Authors**: Xiang Liu, Yijun Song, Xia Li, Yifei Sun, Huiying Lan, Zemin Liu, Linshan Jiang, Jialin Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:38:14Z

**Summary**: Deep learning models are increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices for real-time data analytics. In recent years, Vision Transformer models and their variants have demonstrated outstanding performance across various computer vision tasks. However, their high computational demands and inference latency pose significant challenges for model deployment on resource-constraint edge devices. To address this issue, we propose a novel Vision Transformer splitting framework, ED-ViT, designed to execute complex models across multiple edge devices efficiently. Specifically, we partition Vision Transformer models into several sub-models, where each sub-model is tailored to handle a specific subset of data classes. To further minimize computation overhead and inference latency, we introduce a class-wise pruning technique that reduces the size of each sub-model. We conduct extensive experiments on five datasets with three model structures, demonstrating that our approach significantly reduces inference latency on edge devices and achieves a model size reduction of up to 28.9 times and 34.1 times, respectively, while maintaining test accuracy comparable to the original Vision Transformer. Additionally, we compare ED-ViT with two state-of-the-art methods that deploy CNN and SNN models on edge devices, evaluating accuracy, inference time, and overall model size. Our comprehensive evaluation underscores the effectiveness of the proposed ED-ViT framework.

### Measuring Spiritual Values and Bias of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Songyuan Liu, Ziyang Zhang, Runze Yan, Wei Wu, Carl Yang, Jiaying Lu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:33:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral tool for users from various backgrounds. LLMs, trained on vast corpora, reflect the linguistic and cultural nuances embedded in their pre-training data. However, the values and perspectives inherent in this data can influence the behavior of LLMs, leading to potential biases. As a result, the use of LLMs in contexts involving spiritual or moral values necessitates careful consideration of these underlying biases. Our work starts with verification of our hypothesis by testing the spiritual values of popular LLMs. Experimental results show that LLMs' spiritual values are quite diverse, as opposed to the stereotype of atheists or secularists. We then investigate how different spiritual values affect LLMs in social-fairness scenarios e.g., hate speech identification). Our findings reveal that different spiritual values indeed lead to different sensitivity to different hate target groups. Furthermore, we propose to continue pre-training LLMs on spiritual texts, and empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in mitigating spiritual bias.

### Prediction-Centric Uncertainty Quantification via MMD
**Authors**: Zheyang Shen, Jeremias Knoblauch, Sam Power, Chris. J. Oates

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:28:15Z

**Summary**: Deterministic mathematical models, such as those specified via differential equations, are a powerful tool to communicate scientific insight. However, such models are necessarily simplified descriptions of the real world. Generalised Bayesian methodologies have been proposed for inference with misspecified models, but these are typically associated with vanishing parameter uncertainty as more data are observed. In the context of a misspecified deterministic mathematical model, this has the undesirable consequence that posterior predictions become deterministic and certain, while being incorrect. Taking this observation as a starting point, we propose Prediction-Centric Uncertainty Quantification, where a mixture distribution based on the deterministic model confers improved uncertainty quantification in the predictive context. Computation of the mixing distribution is cast as a (regularised) gradient flow of the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), enabling consistent numerical approximations to be obtained. Results are reported on both a toy model from population ecology and a real model of protein signalling in cell biology.

### Capturing Minds, Not Just Words: Enhancing Role-Playing Language Models   with Personality-Indicative Data
**Authors**: Yiting Ran, Xintao Wang, Rui Xu, Xinfeng Yuan, Jiaqing Liang, Deqing Yang, Yanghua Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:24:56Z

**Summary**: Role-playing agents (RPA) have been a popular application area for large language models (LLMs), attracting significant interest from both industry and academia.While existing RPAs well portray the characters' knowledge and tones, they face challenges in capturing their minds, especially for small role-playing language models (RPLMs). In this paper, we propose to enhance RPLMs via personality-indicative data. Specifically, we leverage questions from psychological scales and distill advanced RPAs to generate dialogues that grasp the minds of characters. Experimental results validate that RPLMs trained with our dataset exhibit advanced role-playing capabilities for both general and personality-related evaluations. Code and data are available at \href{https://github.com/alienet1109/RolePersonality}{this URL}.

### MotionLCM: Real-time Controllable Motion Generation via Latent   Consistency Model
**Authors**: Wenxun Dai, Ling-Hao Chen, Jingbo Wang, Jinpeng Liu, Bo Dai, Yansong Tang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:22:49Z

**Summary**: This work introduces MotionLCM, extending controllable motion generation to a real-time level. Existing methods for spatial-temporal control in text-conditioned motion generation suffer from significant runtime inefficiency. To address this issue, we first propose the motion latent consistency model (MotionLCM) for motion generation, building upon the latent diffusion model. By adopting one-step (or few-step) inference, we further improve the runtime efficiency of the motion latent diffusion model for motion generation. To ensure effective controllability, we incorporate a motion ControlNet within the latent space of MotionLCM and enable explicit control signals (e.g., initial poses) in the vanilla motion space to control the generation process directly, similar to controlling other latent-free diffusion models for motion generation. By employing these techniques, our approach can generate human motions with text and control signals in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate the remarkable generation and controlling capabilities of MotionLCM while maintaining real-time runtime efficiency.

### OLAPH: Improving Factuality in Biomedical Long-form Question Answering
**Authors**: Minbyul Jeong, Hyeon Hwang, Chanwoong Yoon, Taewhoo Lee, Jaewoo Kang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:21:54Z

**Summary**: In the medical domain, numerous scenarios necessitate the long-form generation ability of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, when addressing patients' questions, it is essential that the model's response conveys factual claims, highlighting the need for an automated method to evaluate those claims. Thus, we introduce MedLFQA, a benchmark dataset reconstructed using long-form question-answering datasets related to the biomedical domain. We use MedLFQA to facilitate a cost-effective automatic evaluations of factuality. We also propose OLAPH, a simple and novel framework that utilizes cost-effective and multifaceted automatic evaluation to construct a synthetic preference set and answers questions in our preferred manner. Our framework leads us to train LLMs step-by-step to reduce hallucinations and include crucial medical claims. We highlight that, even on evaluation metrics not used during training, LLMs trained with our OLAPH framework demonstrate significant performance improvement in factuality. Our findings reveal that a 7B LLM trained with our OLAPH framework can provide long answers comparable to the medical experts' answers in terms of factuality. We believe that our work could shed light on gauging the long-text generation ability of LLMs in the medical domain. Our code and datasets are available.

### Inducing anxiety in large language models can induce bias
**Authors**: Julian Coda-Forno, Kristin Witte, Akshay K. Jagadish, Marcel Binz, Zeynep Akata, Eric Schulz

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:20:51Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming research on machine learning while galvanizing public debates. Understanding not only when these models work well and succeed but also why they fail and misbehave is of great societal relevance. We propose to turn the lens of psychiatry, a framework used to describe and modify maladaptive behavior, to the outputs produced by these models. We focus on twelve established LLMs and subject them to a questionnaire commonly used in psychiatry. Our results show that six of the latest LLMs respond robustly to the anxiety questionnaire, producing comparable anxiety scores to humans. Moreover, the LLMs' responses can be predictably changed by using anxiety-inducing prompts. Anxiety-induction not only influences LLMs' scores on an anxiety questionnaire but also influences their behavior in a previously-established benchmark measuring biases such as racism and ageism. Importantly, greater anxiety-inducing text leads to stronger increases in biases, suggesting that how anxiously a prompt is communicated to large language models has a strong influence on their behavior in applied settings. These results demonstrate the usefulness of methods taken from psychiatry for studying the capable algorithms to which we increasingly delegate authority and autonomy.

### Exploring the effect of different cosmologies on the Epoch of   Reionization 21-cm signal with POLAR
**Authors**: Anshuman Acharya, Qing-bo Ma, Sambit K. Giri, Benedetta Ciardi, Raghunath Ghara, Garrelt Mellema, Saleem Zaroubi, Ian Hothi, Ilian T. Iliev, Léon V. E. Koopmans, Michele Bianco

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T13:58:39Z

**Summary**: A detection of the 21-cm signal power spectrum from the Epoch of Reionization is imminent, thanks to consistent advancements from telescopes such as LOFAR, MWA, and HERA, along with the development of SKA. In light of this progress, it is crucial to expand the parameter space of simulations used to infer astrophysical properties from this signal. In this work, we explore the role of cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the matter clustering amplitude $\sigma_8$, whose values as provided by measurements at different redshifts are in tension. We run $N$-body simulations using GADGET-4, and post-process them with the reionization simulation code POLAR, that uses L-GALAXIES to include galaxy formation and evolution properties and GRIZZLY to execute 1-D radiative transfer of ionizing photons in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We compare our results with the latest JWST observations and explore which astrophysical properties for different cosmologies are necessary to match the observed UV luminosity functions at redshifts $z = 10$ and 9. Additionally, we explore the impact of these parameters on the observed 21-cm signal power spectrum, focusing on the redshifts within the range of LOFAR 21-cm signal observations ($z \approx 8.5-10$). Despite differences in cosmological and astrophysical parameters, the 21-cm power spectrum at these redshifts agrees with presently observed upper limits. This suggests the need for broader physical parameter spaces for inference modeling to account for all models that agree with observations. However, we also propose stronger constraining power by using a combination of galactic and IGM observables.

### Agent Planning with World Knowledge Model
**Authors**: Shuofei Qiao, Runnan Fang, Ningyu Zhang, Yuqi Zhu, Xiang Chen, Shumin Deng, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Huajun Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T13:58:17Z

**Summary**: Recent endeavors towards directly using large language models (LLMs) as agent models to execute interactive planning tasks have shown commendable results. Despite their achievements, however, they still struggle with brainless trial-and-error in global planning and generating hallucinatory actions in local planning due to their poor understanding of the ``real'' physical world. Imitating humans' mental world knowledge model which provides global prior knowledge before the task and maintains local dynamic knowledge during the task, in this paper, we introduce parametric World Knowledge Model (WKM) to facilitate agent planning. Concretely, we steer the agent model to self-synthesize knowledge from both expert and sampled trajectories. Then we develop WKM, providing prior task knowledge to guide the global planning and dynamic state knowledge to assist the local planning. Experimental results on three complex real-world simulated datasets with three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, Mistral-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama-3-8B, demonstrate that our method can achieve superior performance compared to various strong baselines. Besides, we analyze to illustrate that our WKM can effectively alleviate the blind trial-and-error and hallucinatory action issues, providing strong support for the agent's understanding of the world. Other interesting findings include: 1) our instance-level task knowledge can generalize better to unseen tasks, 2) weak WKM can guide strong agent model planning, and 3) unified WKM training has promising potential for further development.

**Authors**: Nico Wagner, Michael Desmond, Rahul Nair, Zahra Ashktorab, Elizabeth M. Daly, Qian Pan, Martín Santillán Cooper, James M. Johnson, Werner Geyer

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T13:29:22Z

**Summary**: LLM-as-a-Judge is a widely used method for evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various tasks. We address the challenge of quantifying the uncertainty of LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. While uncertainty quantification has been well-studied in other domains, applying it effectively to LLMs poses unique challenges due to their complex decision-making capabilities and computational demands. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for quantifying uncertainty designed to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. The method quantifies uncertainty by analyzing the relationships between generated assessments and possible ratings. By cross-evaluating these relationships and constructing a confusion matrix based on token probabilities, the method derives labels of high or low uncertainty. We evaluate our method across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating a strong correlation between the accuracy of LLM evaluations and the derived uncertainty scores. Our findings suggest that this method can significantly improve the reliability and consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations.

**Authors**: Manuel Barusco, Francesco Borsatti, Davide Dalle Pezze, Francesco Paissan, Elisabetta Farella, Gian Antonio Susto

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T13:25:43Z

**Summary**: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) has gained significant research attention for its ability to identify anomalous images and pinpoint the specific areas responsible for the anomaly. A key advantage of VAD is its unsupervised nature, which eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming labeled data collection. However, despite its potential for real-world applications, the literature has given limited focus to resource-efficient VAD, particularly for deployment on edge devices. This work addresses this gap by leveraging lightweight neural networks to reduce memory and computation requirements, enabling VAD deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We benchmark the major VAD algorithms within this framework and demonstrate the feasibility of edge-based VAD using the well-known MVTec dataset. Furthermore, we introduce a novel algorithm, Partially Shared Teacher-student (PaSTe), designed to address the high resource demands of the existing Student Teacher Feature Pyramid Matching (STFPM) approach. Our results show that PaSTe decreases the inference time by 25%, while reducing the training time by 33% and peak RAM usage during training by 76%. These improvements make the VAD process significantly more efficient, laying a solid foundation for real-world deployment on edge devices.

### Causal Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Knowledge Graph Approach
**Authors**: Yejin Kim, Eojin Kang, Juae Kim, H. Howie Huang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T13:24:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) typically improve performance by either retrieving semantically similar information, or enhancing reasoning abilities through structured prompts like chain-of-thought. While both strategies are considered crucial, it remains unclear which has a greater impact on model performance or whether a combination of both is necessary. This paper answers this question by proposing a knowledge graph (KG)-based random-walk reasoning approach that leverages causal relationships. We conduct experiments on the commonsense question answering task that is based on a KG. The KG inherently provides both relevant information, such as related entity keywords, and a reasoning structure through the connections between nodes. Experimental results show that the proposed KG-based random-walk reasoning method improves the reasoning ability and performance of LLMs. Interestingly, incorporating three seemingly irrelevant sentences into the query using KG-based random-walk reasoning enhances LLM performance, contrary to conventional wisdom. These findings suggest that integrating causal structures into prompts can significantly improve reasoning capabilities, providing new insights into the role of causality in optimizing LLM performance.

### Minimum Tuning to Unlock Long Output from LLMs with High Quality Data as   the Key
**Authors**: Yingda Chen, Xingjun Wang, Jintao Huang, Yunlin Mao, Daoze Zhang, Yuze Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T13:21:19Z

**Summary**: As large language models rapidly evolve to support longer context, there is a notable disparity in their capability to generate output at greater lengths. Recent study suggests that the primary cause for this imbalance may arise from the lack of data with long-output during alignment training. In light of this observation, attempts are made to re-align foundation models with data that fills the gap, which result in models capable of generating lengthy output when instructed. In this paper, we explore the impact of data-quality in tuning a model for long output, and the possibility of doing so from the starting points of human-aligned (instruct or chat) models. With careful data curation, we show that it possible to achieve similar performance improvement in our tuned models, with only a small fraction of training data instances and compute. In addition, we assess the generalizability of such approaches by applying our tuning-recipes to several models. our findings suggest that, while capacities for generating long output vary across different models out-of-the-box, our approach to tune them with high-quality data using lite compute, consistently yields notable improvement across all models we experimented on. We have made public our curated dataset for tuning long-writing capability, the implementations of model tuning and evaluation, as well as the fine-tuned models, all of which can be openly-accessed.

### DeformPAM: Data-Efficient Learning for Long-horizon Deformable Object   Manipulation via Preference-based Action Alignment
**Authors**: Wendi Chen, Han Xue, Fangyuan Zhou, Yuan Fang, Cewu Lu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T13:19:16Z

**Summary**: In recent years, imitation learning has made progress in the field of robotic manipulation. However, it still faces challenges when dealing with complex long-horizon deformable object tasks, such as high-dimensional state spaces, complex dynamics, and multimodal action distributions. Traditional imitation learning methods often require a large amount of data and encounter distributional shifts and accumulative errors in these tasks. To address these issues, we propose a data-efficient general learning framework (DeformPAM) based on preference learning and reward-guided action selection. DeformPAM decomposes long-horizon tasks into multiple action primitives, utilizes 3D point cloud inputs and diffusion models to model action distributions, and trains an implicit reward model using human preference data. During the inference phase, the reward model scores multiple candidate actions, selecting the optimal action for execution, thereby reducing the occurrence of anomalous actions and improving task completion quality. Experiments conducted on three challenging real-world long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. Results show that DeformPAM improves both task completion quality and efficiency compared to baseline methods even with limited data. Code and data will be available at https://deform-pam.robotflow.ai.

### Gotcha! This Model Uses My Code! Evaluating Membership Leakage Risks in   Code Models
**Authors**: Zhou Yang, Zhipeng Zhao, Chenyu Wang, Jieke Shi, Dongsum Kim, Donggyun Han, David Lo

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:58:00Z

**Summary**: Given large-scale source code datasets available in open-source projects and advanced large language models, recent code models have been proposed to address a series of critical software engineering tasks, such as program repair and code completion. The training data of the code models come from various sources, not only the publicly available source code, e.g., open-source projects on GitHub but also the private data such as the confidential source code from companies, which may contain sensitive information (for example, SSH keys and personal information). As a result, the use of these code models may raise new privacy concerns.   In this paper, we focus on a critical yet not well-explored question on using code models: what is the risk of membership information leakage in code models? Membership information leakage refers to the risk that an attacker can infer whether a given data point is included in (i.e., a member of) the training data. To answer this question, we propose Gotcha, a novel membership inference attack method specifically for code models. We investigate the membership leakage risk of code models. Our results reveal a worrying fact that the risk of membership leakage is high: although the previous attack methods are close to random guessing, Gotcha can predict the data membership with a high true positive rate of 0.95 and a low false positive rate of 0.10. We also show that the attacker's knowledge of the victim model (e.g., the model architecture and the pre-training data) impacts the success rate of attacks. Further analysis demonstrates that changing the decoding strategy can mitigate the risk of membership leakage. This study calls for more attention to understanding the privacy of code models and developing more effective countermeasures against such attacks.

### DiaSynth: Synthetic Dialogue Generation Framework for Low Resource   Dialogue Applications
**Authors**: Sathya Krishnan Suresh, Wu Mengjun, Tushar Pranav, Eng Siong Chng

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:55:27Z

**Summary**: The scarcity of domain-specific dialogue datasets limits the development of dialogue systems across applications. Existing research is constrained by general or niche datasets that lack sufficient scale for training dialogue systems. To address this gap, we introduce DiaSynth - a synthetic dialogue generation framework capable of generating high-quality, contextually rich dialogues across a wide range of domains. Unlike existing frameworks, DiaSynth uses Large Language Models (LLMs) and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning to generate dynamic, domain-specific dialogues with simulated personas and diverse conversational features. We perform our experiments by generating synthetic data using different LLMs and few-shot examples from DialogSum and SAMSum. The pretrained language models fine-tuned on the synthetic data outperform the base models by 16.47% on dialogue summarization, while the comparison between models fine-tuned on in-domain data and synthetic data shows that the synthetic data is able to capture 90.48% of the performance distribution of the in-domain data on dialogue summarization. The quality of the data generated also increases as we increase the size of LLM from 3B to 8B. These results validate DiaSynth's potential as a robust alternative to traditional data collection methods. We open source the code and data generated for future research.

**Authors**: Leonard Paeleke, Navid Keshtiarast, Paul Seehofer, Roland Bless, Holger Karl, Marina Petrova, Martina Zitterbart

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:54:13Z

**Summary**: 6G networks will be highly dynamic, re-configurable, and resilient. To enable and support such features, employing AI has been suggested. Integrating AIin networks will likely require distributed AI deployments with resilient connectivity, e.g., for communication between RL agents and environment. Such approaches need to be validated in realistic network environments. In this demo, we use ContainerNet to emulate AI-capable and autonomic networks that employ the routing protocol KIRA to provide resilient connectivity and service discovery. As an example AI application, we train and infer deep RL agents learning medium access control (MAC) policies for a wireless network environment in the emulated network.

### The Empirical Impact of Neural Parameter Symmetries, or Lack Thereof
**Authors**: Derek Lim, Theo Moe Putterman, Robin Walters, Haggai Maron, Stefanie Jegelka

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:53:48Z

**Summary**: Many algorithms and observed phenomena in deep learning appear to be affected by parameter symmetries -- transformations of neural network parameters that do not change the underlying neural network function. These include linear mode connectivity, model merging, Bayesian neural network inference, metanetworks, and several other characteristics of optimization or loss-landscapes. However, theoretical analysis of the relationship between parameter space symmetries and these phenomena is difficult. In this work, we empirically investigate the impact of neural parameter symmetries by introducing new neural network architectures that have reduced parameter space symmetries. We develop two methods, with some provable guarantees, of modifying standard neural networks to reduce parameter space symmetries. With these new methods, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study consisting of multiple tasks aimed at assessing the effect of removing parameter symmetries. Our experiments reveal several interesting observations on the empirical impact of parameter symmetries; for instance, we observe linear mode connectivity between our networks without alignment of weight spaces, and we find that our networks allow for faster and more effective Bayesian neural network training.

### PAVLM: Advancing Point Cloud based Affordance Understanding Via   Vision-Language Model
**Authors**: Shang-Ching Liu, Van Nhiem Tran, Wenkai Chen, Wei-Lun Cheng, Yen-Lin Huang, I-Bin Liao, Yung-Hui Li, Jianwei Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:53:42Z

**Summary**: Affordance understanding, the task of identifying actionable regions on 3D objects, plays a vital role in allowing robotic systems to engage with and operate within the physical world. Although Visual Language Models (VLMs) have excelled in high-level reasoning and long-horizon planning for robotic manipulation, they still fall short in grasping the nuanced physical properties required for effective human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce PAVLM (Point cloud Affordance Vision-Language Model), an innovative framework that utilizes the extensive multimodal knowledge embedded in pre-trained language models to enhance 3D affordance understanding of point cloud. PAVLM integrates a geometric-guided propagation module with hidden embeddings from large language models (LLMs) to enrich visual semantics. On the language side, we prompt Llama-3.1 models to generate refined context-aware text, augmenting the instructional input with deeper semantic cues. Experimental results on the 3D-AffordanceNet benchmark demonstrate that PAVLM outperforms baseline methods for both full and partial point clouds, particularly excelling in its generalization to novel open-world affordance tasks of 3D objects.

### Efficiera Residual Networks: Hardware-Friendly Fully Binary Weight with   2-bit Activation Model Achieves Practical ImageNet Accuracy
**Authors**: Shuntaro Takahashi, Takuya Wakisaka, Hiroyuki Tokunaga

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:43:28Z

**Summary**: The edge-device environment imposes severe resource limitations, encompassing computation costs, hardware resource usage, and energy consumption for deploying deep neural network models. Ultra-low-bit quantization and hardware accelerators have been explored as promising approaches to address these challenges. Ultra-low-bit quantization significantly reduces the model size and the computational cost. Despite progress so far, many competitive ultra-low-bit models still partially rely on float or non-ultra-low-bit quantized computation such as the input and output layer. We introduce Efficiera Residual Networks (ERNs), a model optimized for low-resource edge devices. ERNs achieve full ultra-low-bit quantization, with all weights, including the initial and output layers, being binary, and activations set at 2 bits. We introduce the shared constant scaling factor technique to enable integer-valued computation in residual connections, allowing our model to operate without float values until the final convolution layer. Demonstrating competitiveness, ERNs achieve an ImageNet top-1 accuracy of 72.5pt with a ResNet50-compatible architecture and 63.6pt with a model size less than 1MB. Moreover, ERNs exhibit impressive inference times, reaching 300FPS with the smallest model and 60FPS with the largest model on a cost-efficient FPGA device.

**Authors**: Tengfei Ma, Xuan Lin, Tianle Li, Chaoyi Li, Long Chen, Peng Zhou, Xibao Cai, Xinyu Yang, Daojian Zeng, Dongsheng Cao, Xiangxiang Zeng

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:39:20Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in general tasks across various fields. However, their effectiveness within specific domains such as drug development remains challenges. To solve these challenges, we introduce \textbf{Y-Mol}, forming a well-established LLM paradigm for the flow of drug development. Y-Mol is a multiscale biomedical knowledge-guided LLM designed to accomplish tasks across lead compound discovery, pre-clinic, and clinic prediction. By integrating millions of multiscale biomedical knowledge and using LLaMA2 as the base LLM, Y-Mol augments the reasoning capability in the biomedical domain by learning from a corpus of publications, knowledge graphs, and expert-designed synthetic data. The capability is further enriched with three types of drug-oriented instructions: description-based prompts from processed publications, semantic-based prompts for extracting associations from knowledge graphs, and template-based prompts for understanding expert knowledge from biomedical tools. Besides, Y-Mol offers a set of LLM paradigms that can autonomously execute the downstream tasks across the entire process of drug development, including virtual screening, drug design, pharmacological properties prediction, and drug-related interaction prediction. Our extensive evaluations of various biomedical sources demonstrate that Y-Mol significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs in discovering lead compounds, predicting molecular properties, and identifying drug interaction events.

### Bayesian inference of mixed Gaussian phylogenetic models
**Authors**: Bayu Brahmantio, Krzysztof Bartoszek, Etka Yapar

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:32:49Z

**Summary**: Background: Continuous traits evolution of a group of taxa that are correlated through a phylogenetic tree is commonly modelled using parametric stochastic differential equations to represent deterministic change of trait through time, while incorporating noises that represent different unobservable evolutionary pressures. Often times, a heterogeneous Gaussian process that consists of multiple parametric sub-processes is often used when the observed data come from a very diverse set of taxa. In the maximum likelihood setting, challenges can be found when exploring the involved likelihood surface and when interpreting the uncertainty around the parameters.   Results: We extend the methods to tackle inference problems for mixed Gaussian phylogenetic models (MGPMs) by implementing a Bayesian scheme that can take into account biologically relevant priors. The posterior inference method is based on the Population Monte Carlo (PMC) algorithm that are easily parallelized, and using an efficient algorithm to calculate the likelihood of phylogenetically correlated observations. A model evaluation method that is based on the proximity of the posterior predictive distribution to the observed data is also implemented. Simulation study is done to test the inference and evaluation capability of the method. Finally, we test our method on a real-world dataset.   Conclusion: We implement the method in the R package bgphy, available at github.com/bayubeta/bgphy. Simulation study demonstrates that the method is able to infer parameters and evaluate models properly, while its implementation on the real-world dataset indicates that a carefully selected model of evolution based on naturally occurring classifications results in a better fit to the observed data.

### A model learning framework for inferring the dynamics of transmission   rate depending on exogenous variables for epidemic forecasts
**Authors**: Giovanni Ziarelli, Stefano Pagani, Nicola Parolini, Francesco Regazzoni, Marco Verani

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:24:55Z

**Summary**: In this work, we aim to formalize a novel scientific machine learning framework to reconstruct the hidden dynamics of the transmission rate, whose inaccurate extrapolation can significantly impair the quality of the epidemic forecasts, by incorporating the influence of exogenous variables (such as environmental conditions and strain-specific characteristics). We propose an hybrid model that blends a data-driven layer with a physics-based one. The data-driven layer is based on a neural ordinary differential equation that learns the dynamics of the transmission rate, conditioned on the meteorological data and wave-specific latent parameters. The physics-based layer, instead, consists of a standard SEIR compartmental model, wherein the transmission rate represents an input. The learning strategy follows an end-to-end approach: the loss function quantifies the mismatch between the actual numbers of infections and its numerical prediction obtained from the SEIR model incorporating as an input the transmission rate predicted by the neural ordinary differential equation. We validate this original approach using both a synthetic test case and a realistic test case based on meteorological data (temperature and humidity) and influenza data from Italy between 2010 and 2020. In both scenarios, we achieve low generalization error on the test set and observe strong alignment between the reconstructed model and established findings on the influence of meteorological factors on epidemic spread. Finally, we implement a data assimilation strategy to adapt the neural equation to the specific characteristics of an epidemic wave under investigation, and we conduct sensitivity tests on the network hyperparameters.

### Data Quality Control in Federated Instruction-tuning of Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Yaxin Du, Rui Ye, Fengting Yuchi, Wanru Zhao, Jingjing Qu, Yanfeng Wang, Siheng Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:14:57Z

**Summary**: By leveraging massively distributed data, federated learning (FL) enables collaborative instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs) in a privacy-preserving way. While FL effectively expands the data quantity, the issue of data quality remains under-explored in the current literature on FL for LLMs. To address this gap, we propose a new framework of federated instruction tuning of LLMs with data quality control (FedDQC), which measures data quality to facilitate the subsequent filtering and hierarchical training processes. Our approach introduces an efficient metric to assess each client's instruction-response alignment (IRA), identifying potentially noisy data through single-shot inference. Low-IRA samples are potentially noisy and filtered to mitigate their negative impacts. To further utilize this IRA value, we propose a quality-aware hierarchical training paradigm, where LLM is progressively fine-tuned from high-IRA to low-IRA data, mirroring the easy-to-hard learning process. We conduct extensive experiments on 4 synthetic and a real-world dataset, and compare our method with baselines adapted from centralized setting. Results show that our method consistently and significantly improves the performance of LLMs trained on mix-quality data in FL.

### Multi-round jailbreak attack on large language models
**Authors**: Yihua Zhou, Xiaochuan Shi

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:08:14Z

**Summary**: Ensuring the safety and alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is crucial for generating responses that are beneficial to humanity. While LLMs have the capability to identify and avoid harmful queries, they remain vulnerable to "jailbreak" attacks, where carefully crafted prompts can induce the generation of toxic content. Traditional single-round jailbreak attacks, such as GCG and AutoDAN, do not alter the sensitive words in the dangerous prompts. Although they can temporarily bypass the model's safeguards through prompt engineering, their success rate drops significantly as the LLM is further fine-tuned, and they cannot effectively circumvent static rule-based filters that remove the hazardous vocabulary.   In this study, to better understand jailbreak attacks, we introduce a multi-round jailbreak approach. This method can rewrite the dangerous prompts, decomposing them into a series of less harmful sub-questions to bypass the LLM's safety checks. We first use the LLM to perform a decomposition task, breaking down a set of natural language questions into a sequence of progressive sub-questions, which are then used to fine-tune the Llama3-8B model, enabling it to decompose hazardous prompts. The fine-tuned model is then used to break down the problematic prompt, and the resulting sub-questions are sequentially asked to the victim model. If the victim model rejects a sub-question, a new decomposition is generated, and the process is repeated until the final objective is achieved. Our experimental results show a 94\% success rate on the llama2-7B and demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in circumventing static rule-based filters.

**Authors**: Xinjie Zhao, Moritz Blum, Rui Yang, Boming Yang, Luis Márquez Carpintero, Mónica Pina-Navarro, Tony Wang, Xin Li, Huitao Li, Yanran Fu, Rongrong Wang, Juntao Zhang, Irene Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:05:58Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models~(LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities across various applications but face challenges such as hallucination, limited reasoning abilities, and factual inconsistencies, especially when tackling complex, domain-specific tasks like question answering~(QA). While Knowledge Graphs~(KGs) have been shown to help mitigate these issues, research on the integration of LLMs with background KGs remains limited. In particular, user accessibility and the flexibility of the underlying KG have not been thoroughly explored. We introduce AGENTiGraph (Adaptive Generative ENgine for Task-based Interaction and Graphical Representation), a platform for knowledge management through natural language interaction. It integrates knowledge extraction, integration, and real-time visualization. AGENTiGraph employs a multi-agent architecture to dynamically interpret user intents, manage tasks, and integrate new knowledge, ensuring adaptability to evolving user requirements and data contexts. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in knowledge graph interactions, particularly for complex domain-specific tasks. Experimental results on a dataset of 3,500 test cases show AGENTiGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot baselines, achieving 95.12\% accuracy in task classification and 90.45\% success rate in task execution. User studies corroborate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To showcase versatility, we extended AGENTiGraph to legislation and healthcare domains, constructing specialized KGs capable of answering complex queries in legal and medical contexts.

### Human-LLM Collaborative Construction of a Cantonese Emotion Lexicon
**Authors**: Yusong Zhang, Dong Dong, Chi-tim Hung, Leonard Heyerdahl, Tamara Giles-Vernick, Eng-kiong Yeoh

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T11:57:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation. Advanced utilization of the knowledge embedded in LLMs for automated annotation has consistently been explored. This study proposed to develop an emotion lexicon for Cantonese, a low-resource language, through collaborative efforts between LLM and human annotators. By integrating emotion labels provided by LLM and human annotators, the study leveraged existing linguistic resources including lexicons in other languages and local forums to construct a Cantonese emotion lexicon enriched with colloquial expressions. The consistency of the proposed emotion lexicon in emotion extraction was assessed through modification and utilization of three distinct emotion text datasets. This study not only validates the efficacy of the constructed lexicon but also emphasizes that collaborative annotation between human and artificial intelligence can significantly enhance the quality of emotion labels, highlighting the potential of such partnerships in facilitating natural language processing tasks for low-resource languages.

### Conjugate Bayesian Two-step Change Point Detection for Hawkes Process
**Authors**: Zeyue Zhang, Xiaoling Lu, Feng Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T11:52:53Z

**Summary**: The Bayesian two-step change point detection method is popular for the Hawkes process due to its simplicity and intuitiveness. However, the non-conjugacy between the point process likelihood and the prior requires most existing Bayesian two-step change point detection methods to rely on non-conjugate inference methods. These methods lack analytical expressions, leading to low computational efficiency and impeding timely change point detection. To address this issue, this work employs data augmentation to propose a conjugate Bayesian two-step change point detection method for the Hawkes process, which proves to be more accurate and efficient. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of our method compared to baseline methods. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to explore the robustness of our method concerning various hyperparameters. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Aurora2050/CoBay-CPD.

### Leveraging LLM Embeddings for Cross Dataset Label Alignment and Zero   Shot Music Emotion Prediction
**Authors**: Renhang Liu, Abhinaba Roy, Dorien Herremans

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T11:48:31Z

**Summary**: In this work, we present a novel method for music emotion recognition that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) embeddings for label alignment across multiple datasets and zero-shot prediction on novel categories. First, we compute LLM embeddings for emotion labels and apply non-parametric clustering to group similar labels, across multiple datasets containing disjoint labels. We use these cluster centers to map music features (MERT) to the LLM embedding space. To further enhance the model, we introduce an alignment regularization that enables dissociation of MERT embeddings from different clusters. This further enhances the model's ability to better adaptation to unseen datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing zero-shot inference on a new dataset, showcasing its ability to generalize to unseen labels without additional training.

### DIRAS: Efficient LLM Annotation of Document Relevance in Retrieval   Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Jingwei Ni, Tobias Schimanski, Meihong Lin, Mrinmaya Sachan, Elliott Ash, Markus Leippold

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T11:37:04Z

**Summary**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely employed to ground responses to queries on domain-specific documents. But do RAG implementations leave out important information when answering queries that need an integrated analysis of information (e.g., Tell me good news in the stock market today.)? To address these concerns, RAG developers need to annotate information retrieval (IR) data for their domain of interest, which is challenging because (1) domain-specific queries usually need nuanced definitions of relevance beyond shallow semantic relevance; and (2) human or GPT-4 annotation is costly and cannot cover all (query, document) pairs (i.e., annotation selection bias), thus harming the effectiveness in evaluating IR recall. To address these challenges, we propose DIRAS (Domain-specific Information Retrieval Annotation with Scalability), a manual-annotation-free schema that fine-tunes open-sourced LLMs to consider nuanced relevance definition and annotate (partial) relevance labels with calibrated relevance scores. Extensive evaluation shows that DIRAS enables smaller (8B) LLMs to achieve GPT-4-level performance on annotating and ranking unseen (query, document) pairs, and is helpful for real-world RAG development. All code, LLM generations, and human annotations can be found in \url{https://github.com/EdisonNi-hku/DIRAS}.

### Are Large Language Models Strategic Decision Makers? A Study of   Performance and Bias in Two-Player Non-Zero-Sum Games
**Authors**: Nathan Herr, Fernando Acero, Roberta Raileanu, María Pérez-Ortiz, Zhibin Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T11:29:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used in real-world settings, yet their strategic decision-making abilities remain largely unexplored. To fully benefit from the potential of LLMs, it's essential to understand their ability to function in complex social scenarios. Game theory, which is already used to understand real-world interactions, provides a good framework for assessing these abilities. This work investigates the performance and merits of LLMs in canonical game-theoretic two-player non-zero-sum games, Stag Hunt and Prisoner Dilemma. Our structured evaluation of GPT-3.5, GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama-3-8B shows that these models, when making decisions in these games, are affected by at least one of the following systematic biases: positional bias, payoff bias, or behavioural bias. This indicates that LLMs do not fully rely on logical reasoning when making these strategic decisions. As a result, it was found that the LLMs' performance drops when the game configuration is misaligned with the affecting biases. When misaligned, GPT-3.5, GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama-3-8B show an average performance drop of 32\%, 25\%, 34\%, and 29\% respectively in Stag Hunt, and 28\%, 16\%, 34\%, and 24\% respectively in Prisoner's Dilemma. Surprisingly, GPT-4o (a top-performing LLM across standard benchmarks) suffers the most substantial performance drop, suggesting that newer models are not addressing these issues. Interestingly, we found that a commonly used method of improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, reduces the biases in GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and Llama-3-8B but increases the effect of the bias in GPT-4-Turbo, indicating that CoT alone cannot fully serve as a robust solution to this problem. We perform several additional experiments, which provide further insight into these observed behaviours.

### Revisiting Benchmark and Assessment: An Agent-based Exploratory Dynamic   Evaluation Framework for LLMs
**Authors**: Wanying Wang, Zeyu Ma, Pengfei Liu, Mingang Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T11:20:42Z

**Summary**: While various vertical domain large language models (LLMs) have been developed, the challenge of automatically evaluating their performance across different domains remains significant in addressing real-world user needs. Current benchmark-based evaluation methods exhibit rigid, purposeless interactions and rely on pre-collected static datasets that are costly to build, inflexible across domains, and misaligned with practical user needs. To address this, we revisit the evaluation components and introduce two definitions: **Benchmark+**, which extends traditional QA benchmarks into a more flexible ``strategy-criterion'' format; and **Assessment+**, which enhances the interaction process for greater exploration and enables both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights that capture nuanced target LLM behaviors from richer multi-turn interactions. We propose an agent-based evaluation framework called *TestAgent*, which implements these two concepts through retrieval augmented generation and reinforcement learning. Experiments on tasks ranging from building vertical domain evaluation from scratch to activating existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of *TestAgent* across various scenarios. We believe this work offers an interesting perspective on automatic evaluation for LLMs.

### CoRA: Collaborative Information Perception by Large Language Model's   Weights for Recommendation
**Authors**: Yuting Liu, Jinghao Zhang, Yizhou Dang, Yuliang Liang, Qiang Liu, Guibing Guo, Jianzhe Zhao, Xingwei Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T11:01:33Z

**Summary**: Involving collaborative information in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a promising technique for adapting LLMs for recommendation. Existing methods achieve this by concatenating collaborative features with text tokens into a unified sequence input and then fine-tuning to align these features with LLM's input space. Although effective, in this work, we identify two limitations when adapting LLMs to recommendation tasks, which hinder the integration of general knowledge and collaborative information, resulting in sub-optimal recommendation performance. (1) Fine-tuning LLM with recommendation data can undermine its inherent world knowledge and fundamental competencies, which are crucial for interpreting and inferring recommendation text. (2) Incorporating collaborative features into textual prompts disrupts the semantics of the original prompts, preventing LLM from generating appropriate outputs. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm, CoRA (an acronym for Collaborative LoRA), with a collaborative weights generator. Rather than input space alignment, this method aligns collaborative information with LLM's parameter space, representing them as incremental weights to update LLM's output. This way, LLM perceives collaborative information without altering its general knowledge and text inference capabilities. Specifically, we employ a collaborative filtering model to extract user and item embeddings, converting them into collaborative weights with low-rank properties through the collaborative weights generator. We then merge the collaborative weights into LLM's weights, enabling LLM to perceive the collaborative signals and generate personalized recommendations without fine-tuning or extra collaborative tokens in prompts. Extensive experiments confirm that CoRA effectively integrates collaborative information into LLM, enhancing recommendation performance.

### Unraveling the Mechanics of Learning-Based Demonstration Selection for   In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Hui Liu, Wenya Wang, Hao Sun, Chris Xing Tian, Chenqi Kong, Xin Dong, Haoliang Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T10:53:55Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities from few-shot demonstration exemplars. While recent learning-based demonstration selection methods have proven beneficial to ICL by choosing more useful exemplars, their underlying mechanisms are opaque, hindering efforts to address limitations such as high training costs and poor generalization across tasks. These methods generally assume the selection process captures similarities between the exemplar and the target instance, however, it remains unknown what kinds of similarities are captured and vital to performing ICL. To dive into this question, we analyze the working mechanisms of the learning-based demonstration selection methods and empirically identify two important factors related to similarity measurement: 1) The ability to integrate different levels of task-agnostic text similarities between the input of exemplars and test cases enhances generalization power across different tasks. 2) Incorporating task-specific labels when measuring the similarities significantly improves the performance on each specific task. We validate these two findings through extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses across ten datasets and various LLMs. Based on our findings, we introduce two effective yet simplified exemplar selection methods catering to task-agnostic and task-specific demands, eliminating the costly LLM inference overhead.

### AIC MLLM: Autonomous Interactive Correction MLLM for Robust Robotic   Manipulation
**Authors**: Chuyan Xiong, Chengyu Shen, Xiaoqi Li, Kaichen Zhou, Jiaming Liu, Ruiping Wang, Hao Dong

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T06:29:55Z

**Summary**: The ability to reflect on and correct failures is crucial for robotic systems to interact stably with real-life objects. Observing the generalization and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), previous approaches have aimed to utilize these models to enhance robotic systems accordingly. However, these methods typically focus on high-level planning corrections using an additional MLLM, with limited utilization of failed samples to correct low-level contact poses which is particularly prone to occur during articulated object manipulation. To address this gap, we propose an Autonomous Interactive Correction (AIC) MLLM, which makes use of previous low-level interaction experiences to correct SE(3) pose predictions for articulated object. Specifically, AIC MLLM is initially fine-tuned to acquire both pose prediction and feedback prompt comprehension abilities. We design two types of prompt instructions for interactions with objects: 1) visual masks to highlight unmovable parts for position correction, and 2) textual descriptions to indicate potential directions for rotation correction. During inference, a Feedback Information Extraction module is introduced to recognize the failure cause, allowing AIC MLLM to adaptively correct the pose prediction using the corresponding prompts. To further enhance manipulation stability, we devise a Test Time Adaptation strategy that enables AIC MLLM to better adapt to the current scene configuration. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted in both simulated and real-world environments to evaluate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that our AIC MLLM can efficiently correct failure samples by leveraging interaction experience prompts. Our project website is https://sites.google.com/view/aic-mllm.

### Mathador-LM: A Dynamic Benchmark for Mathematical Reasoning on Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Eldar Kurtic, Amir Moeini, Dan Alistarh

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T10:35:17Z

**Summary**: We introduce Mathador-LM, a new benchmark for evaluating the mathematical reasoning on large language models (LLMs), combining ruleset interpretation, planning, and problem-solving. This benchmark is inspired by the Mathador game, where the objective is to reach a target number using basic arithmetic operations on a given set of base numbers, following a simple set of rules. We show that, across leading LLMs, we obtain stable average performance while generating benchmark instances \emph{dynamically}, following a target difficulty level. Thus, our benchmark alleviates concerns about test-set leakage into training data, an issue that often undermines popular benchmarks. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both open and closed-source state-of-the-art LLMs on Mathador-LM. Our findings reveal that contemporary models struggle with Mathador-LM, scoring significantly lower than average 3rd graders. This stands in stark contrast to their strong performance on popular mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The implementation of Mathador-LM benchmark is available at \href{https://github.com/IST-DASLab/Mathador-LM}{github.com/IST-DASLab/Mathador-LM}.

 ### MoH: Multi-Head Attention as Mixture-of-Head Attention
**Authors**: Peng Jin, Bo Zhu, Li Yuan, Shuicheng Yan

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:59:44Z

**Summary**: In this work, we upgrade the multi-head attention mechanism, the core of the Transformer model, to improve efficiency while maintaining or surpassing the previous accuracy level. We show that multi-head attention can be expressed in the summation form. Drawing on the insight that not all attention heads hold equal significance, we propose Mixture-of-Head attention (MoH), a new architecture that treats attention heads as experts in the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism. MoH has two significant advantages: First, MoH enables each token to select the appropriate attention heads, enhancing inference efficiency without compromising accuracy or increasing the number of parameters. Second, MoH replaces the standard summation in multi-head attention with a weighted summation, introducing flexibility to the attention mechanism and unlocking extra performance potential. Extensive experiments on ViT, DiT, and LLMs demonstrate that MoH outperforms multi-head attention by using only 50%-90% of the attention heads. Moreover, we demonstrate that pre-trained multi-head attention models, such as LLaMA3-8B, can be further continue-tuned into our MoH models. Notably, MoH-LLaMA3-8B achieves an average accuracy of 64.0% across 14 benchmarks, outperforming LLaMA3-8B by 2.4% by utilizing only 75% of the attention heads. We believe the proposed MoH is a promising alternative to multi-head attention and provides a strong foundation for developing advanced and efficient attention-based models.

### GaVaMoE: Gaussian-Variational Gated Mixture of Experts for Explainable   Recommendation
**Authors**: Fei Tang, Yongliang Shen, Hang Zhang, Zeqi Tan, Wenqi Zhang, Guiyang Hou, Kaitao Song, Weiming Lu, Yueting Zhuang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:59:30Z

**Summary**: Large language model-based explainable recommendation (LLM-based ER) systems show promise in generating human-like explanations for recommendations. However, they face challenges in modeling user-item collaborative preferences, personalizing explanations, and handling sparse user-item interactions. To address these issues, we propose GaVaMoE, a novel Gaussian-Variational Gated Mixture of Experts framework for explainable recommendation. GaVaMoE introduces two key components: (1) a rating reconstruction module that employs Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to capture complex user-item collaborative preferences, serving as a pre-trained multi-gating mechanism; and (2) a set of fine-grained expert models coupled with the multi-gating mechanism for generating highly personalized explanations. The VAE component models latent factors in user-item interactions, while the GMM clusters users with similar behaviors. Each cluster corresponds to a gate in the multi-gating mechanism, routing user-item pairs to appropriate expert models. This architecture enables GaVaMoE to generate tailored explanations for specific user types and preferences, mitigating data sparsity by leveraging user similarities. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GaVaMoE significantly outperforms existing methods in explanation quality, personalization, and consistency. Notably, GaVaMoE exhibits robust performance in scenarios with sparse user-item interactions, maintaining high-quality explanations even for users with limited historical data.

### Problem of Locating and Allocating Charging Equipment for Battery   Electric Buses under Stochastic Charging Demand
**Authors**: Sadjad Bazarnovi, Taner Cokyasar, Omer Verbas, Abolfazl Kouros Mohammadian

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:55:50Z

**Summary**: Bus electrification plays a crucial role in advancing urban transportation sustainability. Battery Electric Buses (BEBs), however, often need recharging, making the Problem of Locating and Allocating Charging Equipment for BEBs (PLACE-BEB) essential for efficient operations. This study proposes an optimization framework to solve the PLACE-BEB by determining the optimal placement of charger types at potential locations under the stochastic charging demand. Leveraging the existing stochastic location literature, we develop a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Program (MINLP) to model the problem. To solve this problem, we develop an exact solution method that minimizes the costs related to building charging stations, charger allocation, travel to stations, and average queueing and charging times. Queueing dynamics are modeled using an M/M/s queue, with the number of servers at each location treated as a decision variable. To improve scalability, we implement a Simulated Annealing (SA) and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) allowing for efficient solutions to large-scale problems. The computational performance of the methods was thoroughly evaluated, revealing that SA was effective for small-scale problems, while GA outperformed others for large-scale instances. A case study comparing garage-only, other-only, and mixed scenarios, along with joint deployment, highlighted the cost benefits of a collaborative and a comprehensive approach. Sensitivity analyses showed that the waiting time is a key factor to consider in the decision-making.

### TemporalBench: Benchmarking Fine-grained Temporal Understanding for   Multimodal Video Models
**Authors**: Mu Cai, Reuben Tan, Jianrui Zhang, Bocheng Zou, Kai Zhang, Feng Yao, Fangrui Zhu, Jing Gu, Yiwu Zhong, Yuzhang Shang, Yao Dou, Jaden Park, Jianfeng Gao, Yong Jae Lee, Jianwei Yang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:55:46Z

**Summary**: Understanding fine-grained temporal dynamics is crucial for multimodal video comprehension and generation. Due to the lack of fine-grained temporal annotations, existing video benchmarks mostly resemble static image benchmarks and are incompetent at evaluating models for temporal understanding. In this paper, we introduce TemporalBench, a new benchmark dedicated to evaluating fine-grained temporal understanding in videos. TemporalBench consists of ~10K video question-answer pairs, derived from ~2K high-quality human annotations detailing the temporal dynamics in video clips. As a result, our benchmark provides a unique testbed for evaluating various temporal understanding and reasoning abilities such as action frequency, motion magnitude, event order, etc. Moreover, it enables evaluations on various tasks like both video question answering and captioning, both short and long video understanding, as well as different models such as multimodal video embedding models and text generation models. Results show that state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o achieve only 38.5% question answering accuracy on TemporalBench, demonstrating a significant gap (~30%) between humans and AI in temporal understanding. Furthermore, we notice a critical pitfall for multi-choice QA where LLMs can detect the subtle changes in negative captions and find a centralized description as a cue for its prediction, where we propose Multiple Binary Accuracy (MBA) to correct such bias. We hope that TemporalBench can foster research on improving models' temporal reasoning capabilities. Both dataset and evaluation code will be made available.

### Autonomous Improvement of Instruction Following Skills via Foundation   Models
**Authors**: Zhiyuan Zhou, Pranav Atreya, Abraham Lee, Homer Walke, Oier Mees, Sergey Levine

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:54:17Z

**Summary**: Intelligent instruction-following robots capable of improving from autonomously collected experience have the potential to transform robot learning: instead of collecting costly teleoperated demonstration data, large-scale deployment of fleets of robots can quickly collect larger quantities of autonomous data that can collectively improve their performance. However, autonomous improvement requires solving two key problems: (i) fully automating a scalable data collection procedure that can collect diverse and semantically meaningful robot data and (ii) learning from non-optimal, autonomous data with no human annotations. To this end, we propose a novel approach that addresses these challenges, allowing instruction-following policies to improve from autonomously collected data without human supervision. Our framework leverages vision-language models to collect and evaluate semantically meaningful experiences in new environments, and then utilizes a decomposition of instruction following tasks into (semantic) language-conditioned image generation and (non-semantic) goal reaching, which makes it significantly more practical to improve from this autonomously collected data without any human annotations. We carry out extensive experiments in the real world to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and find that in a suite of unseen environments, the robot policy can be improved 2x with autonomously collected data. We open-source the code for our semantic autonomous improvement pipeline, as well as our autonomous dataset of 30.5K trajectories collected across five tabletop environments.

### Learning Smooth Humanoid Locomotion through Lipschitz-Constrained   Policies
**Authors**: Zixuan Chen, Xialin He, Yen-Jen Wang, Qiayuan Liao, Yanjie Ze, Zhongyu Li, S. Shankar Sastry, Jiajun Wu, Koushil Sreenath, Saurabh Gupta, Xue Bin Peng

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:52:20Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning combined with sim-to-real transfer offers a general framework for developing locomotion controllers for legged robots. To facilitate successful deployment in the real world, smoothing techniques, such as low-pass filters and smoothness rewards, are often employed to develop policies with smooth behaviors. However, because these techniques are non-differentiable and usually require tedious tuning of a large set of hyperparameters, they tend to require extensive manual tuning for each robotic platform. To address this challenge and establish a general technique for enforcing smooth behaviors, we propose a simple and effective method that imposes a Lipschitz constraint on a learned policy, which we refer to as Lipschitz-Constrained Policies (LCP). We show that the Lipschitz constraint can be implemented in the form of a gradient penalty, which provides a differentiable objective that can be easily incorporated with automatic differentiation frameworks. We demonstrate that LCP effectively replaces the need for smoothing rewards or low-pass filters and can be easily integrated into training frameworks for many distinct humanoid robots. We extensively evaluate LCP in both simulation and real-world humanoid robots, producing smooth and robust locomotion controllers. All simulation and deployment code, along with complete checkpoints, is available on our project page: https://lipschitz-constrained-policy.github.io.

### FinDKG: Dynamic Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models for   Detecting Global Trends in Financial Markets
**Authors**: Xiaohui Victor Li, Francesco Sanna Passino

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:44:57Z

**Summary**: Dynamic knowledge graphs (DKGs) are popular structures to express different types of connections between objects over time. They can also serve as an efficient mathematical tool to represent information extracted from complex unstructured data sources, such as text or images. Within financial applications, DKGs could be used to detect trends for strategic thematic investing, based on information obtained from financial news articles. In this work, we explore the properties of large language models (LLMs) as dynamic knowledge graph generators, proposing a novel open-source fine-tuned LLM for this purpose, called the Integrated Contextual Knowledge Graph Generator (ICKG). We use ICKG to produce a novel open-source DKG from a corpus of financial news articles, called FinDKG, and we propose an attention-based GNN architecture for analysing it, called KGTransformer. We test the performance of the proposed model on benchmark datasets and FinDKG, demonstrating superior performance on link prediction tasks. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of the KGTransformer on FinDKG for thematic investing, showing it can outperform existing thematic ETFs.

### SGEdit: Bridging LLM with Text2Image Generative Model for Scene   Graph-based Image Editing
**Authors**: Zhiyuan Zhang, DongDong Chen, Jing Liao

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:40:48Z

**Summary**: Scene graphs offer a structured, hierarchical representation of images, with nodes and edges symbolizing objects and the relationships among them. It can serve as a natural interface for image editing, dramatically improving precision and flexibility. Leveraging this benefit, we introduce a new framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with Text2Image generative model for scene graph-based image editing. This integration enables precise modifications at the object level and creative recomposition of scenes without compromising overall image integrity. Our approach involves two primary stages: 1) Utilizing a LLM-driven scene parser, we construct an image's scene graph, capturing key objects and their interrelationships, as well as parsing fine-grained attributes such as object masks and descriptions. These annotations facilitate concept learning with a fine-tuned diffusion model, representing each object with an optimized token and detailed description prompt. 2) During the image editing phase, a LLM editing controller guides the edits towards specific areas. These edits are then implemented by an attention-modulated diffusion editor, utilizing the fine-tuned model to perform object additions, deletions, replacements, and adjustments. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing image editing methods in terms of editing precision and scene aesthetics.

### Advancements in Road Lane Mapping: Comparative Fine-Tuning Analysis of   Deep Learning-based Semantic Segmentation Methods Using Aerial Imagery
**Authors**: Willow Liu, Shuxin Qiao, Kyle Gao, Hongjie He, Michael A. Chapman, Linlin Xu, Jonathan Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:37:45Z

**Summary**: This research addresses the need for high-definition (HD) maps for autonomous vehicles (AVs), focusing on road lane information derived from aerial imagery. While Earth observation data offers valuable resources for map creation, specialized models for road lane extraction are still underdeveloped in remote sensing. In this study, we perform an extensive comparison of twelve foundational deep learning-based semantic segmentation models for road lane marking extraction from high-definition remote sensing images, assessing their performance under transfer learning with partially labeled datasets. These models were fine-tuned on the partially labeled Waterloo Urban Scene dataset, and pre-trained on the SkyScapes dataset, simulating a likely scenario of real-life model deployment under partial labeling. We observed and assessed the fine-tuning performance and overall performance. Models showed significant performance improvements after fine-tuning, with mean IoU scores ranging from 33.56% to 76.11%, and recall ranging from 66.0% to 98.96%. Transformer-based models outperformed convolutional neural networks, emphasizing the importance of model pre-training and fine-tuning in enhancing HD map development for AV navigation.

### NesTools: A Dataset for Evaluating Nested Tool Learning Abilities of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Han Han, Tong Zhu, Xiang Zhang, Mengsong Wu, Hao Xiong, Wenliang Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:33:43Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) combined with tool learning have gained impressive results in real-world applications. During tool learning, LLMs may call multiple tools in nested orders, where the latter tool call may take the former response as its input parameters. However, current research on the nested tool learning capabilities is still under-explored, since the existing benchmarks lack of relevant data instances. To address this problem, we introduce NesTools to bridge the current gap in comprehensive nested tool learning evaluations. NesTools comprises a novel automatic data generation method to construct large-scale nested tool calls with different nesting structures. With manual review and refinement, the dataset is in high quality and closely aligned with real-world scenarios. Therefore, NesTools can serve as a new benchmark to evaluate the nested tool learning abilities of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on 22 LLMs, and provide in-depth analyses with NesTools, which shows that current LLMs still suffer from the complex nested tool learning task.

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:19:46Z

**Summary**: As one of the most popular and sought-after generative models in the recent years, diffusion models have sparked the interests of many researchers and steadily shown excellent advantage in various generative tasks such as image synthesis, video generation, molecule design, 3D scene rendering and multimodal generation, relying on their dense theoretical principles and reliable application practices. The remarkable success of these recent efforts on diffusion models comes largely from progressive design principles and efficient architecture, training, inference, and deployment methodologies. However, there has not been a comprehensive and in-depth review to summarize these principles and practices to help the rapid understanding and application of diffusion models. In this survey, we provide a new efficiency-oriented perspective on these existing efforts, which mainly focuses on the profound principles and efficient practices in architecture designs, model training, fast inference and reliable deployment, to guide further theoretical research, algorithm migration and model application for new scenarios in a reader-friendly way. \url{https://github.com/ponyzym/Efficient-DMs-Survey}

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:17:54Z

**Summary**: We study the problem of teaching humanoid robots manipulation skills by imitating from single video demonstrations. We introduce OKAMI, a method that generates a manipulation plan from a single RGB-D video and derives a policy for execution. At the heart of our approach is object-aware retargeting, which enables the humanoid robot to mimic the human motions in an RGB-D video while adjusting to different object locations during deployment. OKAMI uses open-world vision models to identify task-relevant objects and retarget the body motions and hand poses separately. Our experiments show that OKAMI achieves strong generalizations across varying visual and spatial conditions, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline on open-world imitation from observation. Furthermore, OKAMI rollout trajectories are leveraged to train closed-loop visuomotor policies, which achieve an average success rate of 79.2% without the need for labor-intensive teleoperation.

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:09:40Z

**Summary**: We present two multilingual LLMs designed to embrace Europe's linguistic diversity by supporting all 24 official languages of the European Union. Trained on a dataset comprising around 60% non-English data and utilizing a custom multilingual tokenizer, our models address the limitations of existing LLMs that predominantly focus on English or a few high-resource languages. We detail the models' development principles, i.e., data composition, tokenizer optimization, and training methodologies. The models demonstrate competitive performance across multilingual benchmarks, as evidenced by their performance on European versions of ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, and TruthfulQA.

### Selection-p: Self-Supervised Task-Agnostic Prompt Compression for   Faithfulness and Transferability
**Authors**: Tsz Ting Chung, Leyang Cui, Lemao Liu, Xinting Huang, Shuming Shi, Dit-Yan Yeung

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:05:25Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of natural language processing tasks when leveraging in-context learning. To mitigate the additional computational and financial costs associated with in-context learning, several prompt compression methods have been proposed to compress the in-context learning prompts. Despite their success, these methods face challenges with transferability due to model-specific compression, or rely on external training data, such as GPT-4. In this paper, we investigate the ability of LLMs to develop a unified compression method that discretizes uninformative tokens, utilizing a self-supervised pre-training technique. By introducing a small number of parameters during the continual pre-training, the proposed Selection-p produces a probability for each input token, indicating whether to preserve or discard it. Experiments show Selection-p achieves state-of-the-art performance across numerous classification tasks, achieving compression rates of up to 10 times while experiencing only a marginal 0.8% decrease in performance. Moreover, it exhibits superior transferability to different models compared to prior work. Additionally, we further analyze how Selection-p helps maintain performance on in-context learning with long contexts.

**Authors**: Yen-Jen Wang, Bike Zhang, Jianyu Chen, Koushil Sreenath

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:04:20Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on vast internet-scale data have showcased remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. Recently, there has been escalating interest in deploying LLMs for robotics, aiming to harness the power of foundation models in real-world settings. However, this approach faces significant challenges, particularly in grounding these models in the physical world and in generating dynamic robot motions. To address these issues, we introduce a novel paradigm in which we use few-shot prompts collected from the physical environment, enabling the LLM to autoregressively generate low-level control commands for robots without task-specific fine-tuning. Experiments across various robots and environments validate that our method can effectively prompt a robot to walk. We thus illustrate how LLMs can proficiently function as low-level feedback controllers for dynamic motion control even in high-dimensional robotic systems.

### G-Designer: Architecting Multi-agent Communication Topologies via Graph   Neural Networks
**Authors**: Guibin Zhang, Yanwei Yue, Xiangguo Sun, Guancheng Wan, Miao Yu, Junfeng Fang, Kun Wang, Dawei Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:01:21Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated that collective intelligence can significantly surpass the capabilities of individual agents, primarily due to well-crafted inter-agent communication topologies. Despite the diverse and high-performing designs available, practitioners often face confusion when selecting the most effective pipeline for their specific task: \textit{Which topology is the best choice for my task, avoiding unnecessary communication token overhead while ensuring high-quality solution?} In response to this dilemma, we introduce G-Designer, an adaptive, efficient, and robust solution for multi-agent deployment, which dynamically designs task-aware, customized communication topologies. Specifically, G-Designer models the multi-agent system as a multi-agent network, leveraging a variational graph auto-encoder to encode both the nodes (agents) and a task-specific virtual node, and decodes a task-adaptive and high-performing communication topology. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks showcase that G-Designer is: \textbf{(1) high-performing}, achieving superior results on MMLU with accuracy at $84.50\%$ and on HumanEval with pass@1 at $89.90\%$; \textbf{(2) task-adaptive}, architecting communication protocols tailored to task difficulty, reducing token consumption by up to $95.33\%$ on HumanEval; and \textbf{(3) adversarially robust}, defending against agent adversarial attacks with merely $0.3\%$ accuracy drop.

### Language Models Encode Numbers Using Digit Representations in Base 10
**Authors**: Amit Arnold Levy, Mor Geva

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T17:00:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) frequently make errors when handling even simple numerical problems, such as comparing two small numbers. A natural hypothesis is that these errors stem from how LLMs represent numbers, and specifically, whether their representations of numbers capture their numeric values. We tackle this question from the observation that LLM errors on numerical tasks are often distributed across \textit{the digits} of the answer rather than normally around \textit{its numeric value}. Through a series of probing experiments and causal interventions, we show that LLMs internally represent numbers with individual circular representations per-digit in base 10. This digit-wise representation, as opposed to a value representation, sheds light on the error patterns of models on tasks involving numerical reasoning and could serve as a basis for future studies on analyzing numerical mechanisms in LLMs.

### Self-Data Distillation for Recovering Quality in Pruned Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Vithursan Thangarasa, Ganesh Venkatesh, Nish Sinnadurai, Sean Lie

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:57:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models have driven significant progress in natural language processing, but their deployment requires substantial compute and memory resources. As models scale, compression techniques become essential for balancing model quality with computational efficiency. Structured pruning, which removes less critical components of the model, is a promising strategy for reducing complexity. However, one-shot pruning often results in significant quality degradation, particularly in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. To recover lost quality, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly applied, but it can lead to catastrophic forgetting by shifting the model's learned data distribution. Therefore, addressing the degradation from both pruning and SFT is essential to preserve the original model's quality. In this work, we propose self-data distilled fine-tuning to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the original, unpruned model to generate a distilled dataset that preserves semantic richness and mitigates catastrophic forgetting by maintaining alignment with the base model's knowledge. Empirically, we demonstrate that self-data distillation consistently outperforms standard SFT, improving average accuracy by up to 8% on the HuggingFace OpenLLM Leaderboard v1. Specifically, when pruning 6 decoder blocks on Llama3.1-8B Instruct (i.e., 32 to 26 layers, reducing the model size from 8.03B to 6.72B parameters), our method retains 91.2% of the original model's accuracy compared to 81.7% with SFT, while reducing real-world FLOPs by 16.30%. Furthermore, our approach scales effectively across datasets, with the quality improving as the dataset size increases.

### Layer-wise Importance Matters: Less Memory for Better Performance in   Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Kai Yao, Penlei Gao, Lichun Li, Yuan Zhao, Xiaofeng Wang, Wei Wang, Jianke Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:53:26Z

**Summary**: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have gained significant popularity for adapting pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, primarily due to their potential to significantly reduce memory and computational overheads. However, a common limitation in most PEFT approaches is their application of a uniform architectural design across all layers. This uniformity involves identical trainable modules and ignores the varying importance of each layer, leading to sub-optimal fine-tuning results. To overcome the above limitation and obtain better performance, we develop a novel approach, Importance-aware Sparse Tuning (IST), to fully utilize the inherent sparsity and select the most important subset of full layers with effective layer-wise importance scoring. The proposed IST is a versatile and plug-and-play technique compatible with various PEFT methods that operate on a per-layer basis. By leveraging the estimated importance scores, IST dynamically updates these selected layers in PEFT modules, leading to reduced memory demands. We further provide theoretical proof of convergence and empirical evidence of superior performance to demonstrate the advantages of IST over uniform updating strategies. Extensive experiments on a range of LLMs, PEFTs, and downstream tasks substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed method, showcasing IST's capacity to enhance existing layer-based PEFT methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Kaiseem/IST.

### LAP, Using Action Feasibility for Improved Uncertainty Alignment of   Large Language Model Planners
**Authors**: James F. Mullen Jr., Dinesh Manocha

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:35:56Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) showcase many desirable traits for intelligent and helpful robots. However, they are also known to hallucinate predictions. This issue is exacerbated in robotics where LLM hallucinations may result in robots confidently executing plans that are contrary to user goals, relying more frequently on human assistance, or preventing the robot from asking for help at all. In this work, we present LAP, a novel approach for utilizing off-the-shelf LLMs, alongside a novel Action feasibility metric, in robotic Planners that minimize harmful hallucinations and human intervention. Our key finding is that calculating and leveraging a new metric, which we call A-Feasibility, a measure of whether a given action is possible and safe in the provided scene, helps to mitigate hallucinations in LLM predictions and better align the LLM's confidence measure with the probability of success. We specifically propose an A-Feasibility metric which both combines scene context and prompting a LLM to determine if a given action is possible and safe in the scene, using the LLM's response to compute the score. Through experiments in both simulation and the real world on tasks with a variety of ambiguities, we show that LAP significantly increases success rate and decreases the amount of human intervention required relative to prior art. For example, in our real-world testing paradigm, LAP decreases the human help rate of previous methods by over 33% at a success rate of 70%.

**Authors**: Muhammet Anil Yagiz, Pedram MohajerAnsari, Mert D. Pese, Polat Goktas

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:29:55Z

**Summary**: In the evolving landscape of autonomous vehicles, ensuring robust in-vehicle network (IVN) security is paramount. This paper introduces an advanced intrusion detection system (IDS) called KD-XVAE that uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based knowledge distillation approach to enhance both performance and efficiency. Our model significantly reduces complexity, operating with just 1669 parameters and achieving an inference time of 0.3 ms per batch, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained automotive environments. Evaluations in the HCRL Car-Hacking dataset demonstrate exceptional capabilities, attaining perfect scores (Recall, Precision, F1 Score of 100%, and FNR of 0%) under multiple attack types, including DoS, Fuzzing, Gear Spoofing, and RPM Spoofing. Comparative analysis on the CICIoV2024 dataset further underscores its superiority over traditional machine learning models, achieving perfect detection metrics. We furthermore integrate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure transparency in the model's decisions. The VAE compresses the original feature space into a latent space, on which the distilled model is trained. SHAP(SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into the importance of each latent dimension, mapped back to original features for intuitive understanding. Our paper advances the field by integrating state-of-the-art techniques, addressing critical challenges in the deployment of efficient, trustworthy, and reliable IDSes for autonomous vehicles, ensuring enhanced protection against emerging cyber threats.

### Personas with Attitudes: Controlling LLMs for Diverse Data Annotation
**Authors**: Leon Fröhling, Gianluca Demartini, Dennis Assenmacher

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:22:49Z

**Summary**: We present a novel approach for enhancing diversity and control in data annotation tasks by personalizing large language models (LLMs). We investigate the impact of injecting diverse persona descriptions into LLM prompts across two studies, exploring whether personas increase annotation diversity and whether the impacts of individual personas on the resulting annotations are consistent and controllable. Our results show that persona-prompted LLMs produce more diverse annotations than LLMs prompted without personas and that these effects are both controllable and repeatable, making our approach a suitable tool for improving data annotation in subjective NLP tasks like toxicity detection.

### DySpec: Faster Speculative Decoding with Dynamic Token Tree Structure
**Authors**: Yunfan Xiong, Ruoyu Zhang, Yanzeng Li, Tianhao Wu, Lei Zou

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:21:15Z

**Summary**: While speculative decoding has recently appeared as a promising direction for accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs), the speedup and scalability are strongly bounded by the token acceptance rate. Prevalent methods usually organize predicted tokens as independent chains or fixed token trees, which fails to generalize to diverse query distributions. In this paper, we propose DySpec, a faster speculative decoding algorithm with a novel dynamic token tree structure. We begin by bridging the draft distribution and acceptance rate from intuitive and empirical clues, and successfully show that the two variables are strongly correlated. Based on this, we employ a greedy strategy to dynamically expand the token tree at run time. Theoretically, we show that our method can achieve optimal results under mild assumptions. Empirically, DySpec yields a higher acceptance rate and speedup than fixed trees. DySpec can drastically improve the throughput and reduce the latency of token generation across various data distribution and model sizes, which significantly outperforms strong competitors, including Specinfer and Sequoia. Under low temperature setting, DySpec can improve the throughput up to 9.1$\times$ and reduce the latency up to 9.4$\times$ on Llama2-70B. Under high temperature setting, DySpec can also improve the throughput up to 6.21$\times$, despite the increasing difficulty of speculating more than one token per step for draft model.

### LLM-Based Robust Product Classification in Commerce and Compliance
**Authors**: Sina Gholamian, Gianfranco Romani, Bartosz Rudnikowicz, Stavroula Skylaki

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:18:10Z

**Summary**: Product classification is a crucial task in international trade, as compliance regulations are verified and taxes and duties are applied based on product categories. Manual classification of products is time-consuming and error-prone, and the sheer volume of products imported and exported renders the manual process infeasible. Consequently, e-commerce platforms and enterprises involved in international trade have turned to automatic product classification using machine learning. However, current approaches do not consider the real-world challenges associated with product classification, such as very abbreviated and incomplete product descriptions. In addition, recent advancements in generative Large Language Models (LLMs) and their reasoning capabilities are mainly untapped in product classification and e-commerce. In this research, we explore the real-life challenges of industrial classification and we propose data perturbations that allow for realistic data simulation. Furthermore, we employ LLM-based product classification to improve the robustness of the prediction in presence of incomplete data. Our research shows that LLMs with in-context learning outperform the supervised approaches in the clean-data scenario. Additionally, we illustrate that LLMs are significantly more robust than the supervised approaches when data attacks are present.

### LongHalQA: Long-Context Hallucination Evaluation for MultiModal Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Han Qiu, Jiaxing Huang, Peng Gao, Qin Qi, Xiaoqin Zhang, Ling Shao, Shijian Lu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:10:26Z

**Summary**: Hallucination, a phenomenon where multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) tend to generate textual responses that are plausible but unaligned with the image, has become one major hurdle in various MLLM-related applications. Several benchmarks have been created to gauge the hallucination levels of MLLMs, by either raising discriminative questions about the existence of objects or introducing LLM evaluators to score the generated text from MLLMs. However, the discriminative data largely involve simple questions that are not aligned with real-world text, while the generative data involve LLM evaluators that are computationally intensive and unstable due to their inherent randomness. We propose LongHalQA, an LLM-free hallucination benchmark that comprises 6K long and complex hallucination text. LongHalQA is featured by GPT4V-generated hallucinatory data that are well aligned with real-world scenarios, including object/image descriptions and multi-round conversations with 14/130 words and 189 words, respectively, on average. It introduces two new tasks, hallucination discrimination and hallucination completion, unifying both discriminative and generative evaluations in a single multiple-choice-question form and leading to more reliable and efficient evaluations without the need for LLM evaluators. Further, we propose an advanced pipeline that greatly facilitates the construction of future hallucination benchmarks with long and complex questions and descriptions. Extensive experiments over multiple recent MLLMs reveal various new challenges when they are handling hallucinations with long and complex textual data. Dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/hanqiu-hq/LongHalQA.

### THaMES: An End-to-End Tool for Hallucination Mitigation and Evaluation   in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Mengfei Liang, Archish Arun, Zekun Wu, Cristian Munoz, Jonathan Lutch, Emre Kazim, Adriano Koshiyama, Philip Treleaven

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:05:27Z

**Summary**: Hallucination, the generation of factually incorrect content, is a growing challenge in Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing detection and mitigation methods are often isolated and insufficient for domain-specific needs, lacking a standardized pipeline. This paper introduces THaMES (Tool for Hallucination Mitigations and EvaluationS), an integrated framework and library addressing this gap. THaMES offers an end-to-end solution for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs, featuring automated test set generation, multifaceted benchmarking, and adaptable mitigation strategies. It automates test set creation from any corpus, ensuring high data quality, diversity, and cost-efficiency through techniques like batch processing, weighted sampling, and counterfactual validation. THaMES assesses a model's ability to detect and reduce hallucinations across various tasks, including text generation and binary classification, applying optimal mitigation strategies like In-Context Learning (ICL), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT). Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs using a knowledge base of academic papers, political news, and Wikipedia reveal that commercial models like GPT-4o benefit more from RAG than ICL, while open-weight models like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-Nemo gain more from ICL. Additionally, PEFT significantly enhances the performance of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct in both evaluation tasks.

### GOVERN: Gradient Orientation Vote Ensemble for Multi-Teacher Reinforced   Distillation
**Authors**: Wenjie Zhou, Zhenxin Ding, Xiaodong Zhang, Haibo Shi, Junfeng Wang, Dawei Yin

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T16:01:11Z

**Summary**: Pre-trained language models have become an integral component of question-answering systems, achieving remarkable performance. However, for practical deployment, it is crucial to perform knowledge distillation to maintain high performance while operating under computational constraints. In this paper, we address a key question: given the importance of unsupervised distillation for student model performance, how can knowledge from multiple teacher models be effectively ensemble during this stage without the guidance of labels? We propose a novel algorithm, GOVERN, to tackle this issue. GOVERN has demonstrated significant improvements in both offline and online experiments, enabling the student model to achieve results comparable to that of teacher ensembles. Our experiments show that GOVERN remarkably requires a mere 1\% of the ensemble method's inference budget to achieve 99.5\% of performance. The proposed algorithm has been successfully deployed in a real-world commercial question-answering system, demonstrating its real-world applicability.

### Mitigate Position Bias in Large Language Models via Scaling a Single   Dimension
**Authors**: Yijiong Yu, Huiqiang Jiang, Xufang Luo, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Dongsheng Li, Yuqing Yang, Yongfeng Huang, Lili Qiu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:58:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various real-world scenarios due to their excellent generalization capabilities and robust generative abilities. However, they exhibit position bias, also known as "lost in the middle", a phenomenon that is especially pronounced in long-context scenarios, which indicates the placement of the key information in different positions of a prompt can significantly affect accuracy. This paper first explores the micro-level manifestations of position bias, concluding that attention weights are a micro-level expression of position bias. It further identifies that, in addition to position embeddings, causal attention mask also contributes to position bias by creating position-specific hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose a method to mitigate position bias by scaling this positional hidden states. Experiments on the NaturalQuestions Multi-document QA, KV retrieval, LongBench and timeline reorder tasks, using various models including RoPE models, context windowextended models, and Alibi models, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach. Our method can improve performance by up to 15.2% by modifying just one dimension of hidden states. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/PositionalHidden.

**Authors**: Harsh Chaudhari, Giorgio Severi, John Abascal, Matthew Jagielski, Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, Milad Nasr, Cristina Nita-Rotaru, Alina Oprea

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:56:58Z

**Summary**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) expands the capabilities of modern large language models (LLMs), by anchoring, adapting, and personalizing their responses to the most relevant knowledge sources. It is particularly useful in chatbot applications, allowing developers to customize LLM output without expensive retraining. Despite their significant utility in various applications, RAG systems present new security risks. In this work, we propose new attack vectors that allow an adversary to inject a single malicious document into a RAG system's knowledge base, and mount a backdoor poisoning attack. We design Phantom, a general two-stage optimization framework against RAG systems, that crafts a malicious poisoned document leading to an integrity violation in the model's output. First, the document is constructed to be retrieved only when a specific trigger sequence of tokens appears in the victim's queries. Second, the document is further optimized with crafted adversarial text that induces various adversarial objectives on the LLM output, including refusal to answer, reputation damage, privacy violations, and harmful behaviors. We demonstrate our attacks on multiple LLM architectures, including Gemma, Vicuna, and Llama, and show that they transfer to GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4. Finally, we successfully conducted a Phantom attack on NVIDIA's black-box production RAG system, "Chat with RTX".

### RClicks: Realistic Click Simulation for Benchmarking Interactive   Segmentation
**Authors**: Anton Antonov, Andrey Moskalenko, Denis Shepelev, Alexander Krapukhin, Konstantin Soshin, Anton Konushin, Vlad Shakhuro

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:55:00Z

**Summary**: The emergence of Segment Anything (SAM) sparked research interest in the field of interactive segmentation, especially in the context of image editing tasks and speeding up data annotation. Unlike common semantic segmentation, interactive segmentation methods allow users to directly influence their output through prompts (e.g. clicks). However, click patterns in real-world interactive segmentation scenarios remain largely unexplored. Most methods rely on the assumption that users would click in the center of the largest erroneous area. Nevertheless, recent studies show that this is not always the case. Thus, methods may have poor performance in real-world deployment despite high metrics in a baseline benchmark. To accurately simulate real-user clicks, we conducted a large crowdsourcing study of click patterns in an interactive segmentation scenario and collected 475K real-user clicks. Drawing on ideas from saliency tasks, we develop a clickability model that enables sampling clicks, which closely resemble actual user inputs. Using our model and dataset, we propose RClicks benchmark for a comprehensive comparison of existing interactive segmentation methods on realistic clicks. Specifically, we evaluate not only the average quality of methods, but also the robustness w.r.t. click patterns. According to our benchmark, in real-world usage interactive segmentation models may perform worse than it has been reported in the baseline benchmark, and most of the methods are not robust. We believe that RClicks is a significant step towards creating interactive segmentation methods that provide the best user experience in real-world cases.

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:52:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown effectiveness across many applications. However, their use in data science scenarios requiring solving long-term interconnected tasks, dynamic data adjustments and domain expertise remains challenging. Previous approaches primarily focus on individual tasks, making it difficult to assess the complete data science workflow. Moreover, they struggle to handle real-time changes in intermediate data and fail to adapt dynamically to evolving task dependencies inherent to data science problems. In this paper, we present Data Interpreter, an LLM-based agent designed to automatically solve various data science problems end-to-end. Our Data Interpreter incorporates two key modules: 1) Hierarchical Graph Modeling, which breaks down complex problems into manageable subproblems, enabling dynamic node generation and graph optimization; and 2) Programmable Node Generation, a technique that refines and verifies each subproblem to iteratively improve code generation results and robustness. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the superiority of Data Interpreter. On InfiAgent-DABench, it achieves a 25% performance boost, raising accuracy from 75.9% to 94.9%. For machine learning and open-ended tasks, it improves performance from 88% to 95%, and from 60% to 97%, respectively. Moreover, on the MATH dataset, Data Interpreter achieves remarkable performance with a 26% improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT.

### Light-Weight Fault Tolerant Attention for Large Language Model Training
**Authors**: Yuhang Liang, Xinyi Li, Jie Ren, Ang Li, Bo Fang, Jieyang Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:52:45Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, the training of these models is computationally intensive and susceptible to faults, particularly in the attention mechanism, which is a critical component of transformer-based LLMs. In this paper, we investigate the impact of faults on LLM training, focusing on INF, NaN, and near-INF values in the computation results with systematic fault injection experiments. We observe the propagation patterns of these errors, which can trigger non-trainable states in the model and disrupt training, forcing the procedure to load from checkpoints.To mitigate the impact of these faults, we propose ATTNChecker, the first Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) technique tailored for the attention mechanism in LLMs. ATTNChecker is designed based on fault propagation patterns of LLM and incorporates performance optimization to adapt to both system reliability and model vulnerability while providing lightweight protection for fast LLM training. Evaluations on four LLMs show that ATTNChecker on average incurs on average 7% overhead on training while detecting and correcting all extreme errors. Compared with the state-of-the-art checkpoint/restore approach, ATTNChecker reduces recovery overhead by up to 49x.

### Converging to a Lingua Franca: Evolution of Linguistic Regions and   Semantics Alignment in Multilingual Large Language Models
**Authors**: Hongchuan Zeng, Senyu Han, Lu Chen, Kai Yu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:49:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, particularly in multilingual contexts. While recent studies suggest that LLMs can transfer skills learned in one language to others, the internal mechanisms behind this ability remain unclear. We observed that the neuron activation patterns of LLMs exhibit similarities when processing the same language, revealing the existence and location of key linguistic regions. Additionally, we found that neuron activation patterns are similar when processing sentences with the same semantic meaning in different languages. This indicates that LLMs map semantically identical inputs from different languages into a "Lingua Franca", a common semantic latent space that allows for consistent processing across languages. This semantic alignment becomes more pronounced with training and increased model size, resulting in a more language-agnostic activation pattern. Moreover, we found that key linguistic neurons are concentrated in the first and last layers of LLMs, becoming denser in the first layers as training progresses. Experiments on BLOOM and LLaMA2 support these findings, highlighting the structural evolution of multilingual LLMs during training and scaling up. This paper provides insights into the internal workings of LLMs, offering a foundation for future improvements in their cross-lingual capabilities.

### Enhancing Agent Learning through World Dynamics Modeling
**Authors**: Zhiyuan Sun, Haochen Shi, Marc-Alexandre Côté, Glen Berseth, Xingdi Yuan, Bang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:48:04Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to tasks in language understanding and interactive decision-making, with their impressive performance largely attributed to the extensive domain knowledge embedded within them. However, the depth and breadth of this knowledge can vary across domains. Many existing approaches assume that LLMs possess a comprehensive understanding of their environment, often overlooking potential gaps in their grasp of actual world dynamics. To address this, we introduce Discover, Verify, and Evolve (DiVE), a framework that discovers world dynamics from a small number of demonstrations, verifies the accuracy of these dynamics, and evolves new, advanced dynamics tailored to the current situation. Through extensive evaluations, we assess the impact of each component on performance and compare the dynamics generated by DiVE to human-annotated dynamics. Our results show that LLMs guided by DiVE make more informed decisions, achieving rewards comparable to human players in the Crafter environment and surpassing methods that require prior task-specific training in the MiniHack environment.

**Authors**: Abdelhakim Benechehab, Youssef Attia El Hili, Ambroise Odonnat, Oussama Zekri, Albert Thomas, Giuseppe Paolo, Maurizio Filippone, Ievgen Redko, Balázs Kégl

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:46:53Z

**Summary**: The emerging zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their applications in areas extending well beyond natural language processing tasks. In reinforcement learning, while LLMs have been extensively used in text-based environments, their integration with continuous state spaces remains understudied. In this paper, we investigate how pre-trained LLMs can be leveraged to predict in context the dynamics of continuous Markov decision processes. We identify handling multivariate data and incorporating the control signal as key challenges that limit the potential of LLMs' deployment in this setup and propose Disentangled In-Context Learning (DICL) to address them. We present proof-of-concept applications in two reinforcement learning settings: model-based policy evaluation and data-augmented off-policy reinforcement learning, supported by theoretical analysis of the proposed methods. Our experiments further demonstrate that our approach produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. We release the code at https://github.com/abenechehab/dicl.

### MTU-Bench: A Multi-granularity Tool-Use Benchmark for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Pei Wang, Yanan Wu, Zekun Wang, Jiaheng Liu, Xiaoshuai Song, Zhongyuan Peng, Ken Deng, Chenchen Zhang, Jiakai Wang, Junran Peng, Ge Zhang, Hangyu Guo, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:46:17Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have displayed massive improvements in reasoning and decision-making skills and can hold natural conversations with users. Recently, many tool-use benchmark datasets have been proposed. However, existing datasets have the following limitations: (1). Insufficient evaluation scenarios (e.g., only cover limited tool-use scenes). (2). Extensive evaluation costs (e.g., GPT API costs). To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a multi-granularity tool-use benchmark for large language models called MTU-Bench. For the "multi-granularity" property, our MTU-Bench covers five tool usage scenes (i.e., single-turn and single-tool, single-turn and multiple-tool, multiple-turn and single-tool, multiple-turn and multiple-tool, and out-of-distribution tasks). Besides, all evaluation metrics of our MTU-Bench are based on the prediction results and the ground truth without using any GPT or human evaluation metrics. Moreover, our MTU-Bench is collected by transforming existing high-quality datasets to simulate real-world tool usage scenarios, and we also propose an instruction dataset called MTU-Instruct data to enhance the tool-use abilities of existing LLMs. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our MTU-Bench. Code and data will be released at https: //github.com/MTU-Bench-Team/MTU-Bench.git.

### IntGrad MT: Eliciting LLMs' Machine Translation Capabilities with   Sentence Interpolation and Gradual MT
**Authors**: Seung-Woo Choi, Ga-Hyun Yoo, Jay-Yoon Lee

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T01:45:28Z

**Summary**: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in translation without needing to be finetuned on additional parallel corpora. However, they still underperform for low-resource language pairs. Previous works have focused on mitigating this issue by leveraging relevant few-shot examples or external resources such as dictionaries or grammar books, making models heavily reliant on these nonparametric sources of information. In this paper, we propose a novel method named IntGrad MT that focuses on fully exploiting an LLM's inherent translation capability. IntGrad MT achieves this by constructing a chain of few-shot examples, each consisting of a source sentence and the model's own translation, that rise incrementally in difficulty. IntGrad MT employs two techniques: Sentence Interpolation, which generates a sequence of sentences that gradually change from an easy sentence to translate to a difficult one, and Gradual MT, which sequentially translates this chain using translations of earlier sentences as few-shot examples for the translation of subsequent ones. With this approach, we observe a substantial enhancement in the xCOMET scores of various LLMs for multiple languages, especially in low-resource languages such as Hindi(8.26), Swahili(7.10), Bengali(6.97) and Marathi(13.03). Our approach presents a practical way of enhancing LLMs' performance without extra training.

**Authors**: Md Kowsher, Md. Shohanur Islam Sobuj, Nusrat Jahan Prottasha, E. Alejandro Alanis, Ozlem Ozmen Garibay, Niloofar Yousefi

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:08:57Z

**Summary**: Time series forecasting remains a challenging task, particularly in the context of complex multiscale temporal patterns. This study presents LLM-Mixer, a framework that improves forecasting accuracy through the combination of multiscale time-series decomposition with pre-trained LLMs (Large Language Models). LLM-Mixer captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends by decomposing the data into multiple temporal resolutions and processing them with a frozen LLM, guided by a textual prompt specifically designed for time-series data. Extensive experiments conducted on multivariate and univariate datasets demonstrate that LLM-Mixer achieves competitive performance, outperforming recent state-of-the-art models across various forecasting horizons. This work highlights the potential of combining multiscale analysis and LLMs for effective and scalable time-series forecasting.

### Unlocking Structured Thinking in Language Models with Cognitive   Prompting
**Authors**: Oliver Kramer, Jill Baumann

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:08:32Z

**Summary**: We propose cognitive prompting as a novel approach to guide problem-solving in large language models (LLMs) through structured, human-like cognitive operations such as goal clarification, decomposition, filtering, abstraction, and pattern recognition. By employing systematic, step-by-step reasoning, cognitive prompting enables LLMs to efficiently tackle complex, multi-step tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive prompting on Meta's LLaMA models, comparing performance on arithmetic reasoning tasks using the GSM8K dataset and on commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Our analysis includes comparisons between models without cognitive prompting, models with a static sequence of cognitive operations, and models using reflective cognitive prompting, where the LLM dynamically self-selects the sequence of cognitive operations. The results show that cognitive prompting, particularly when dynamically adapted, significantly improves the performance of larger models, such as LLaMA3.1 70B, and enhances their ability to handle multi-step reasoning tasks. This approach also improves interpretability and flexibility, highlighting cognitive prompting as a promising strategy for general-purpose AI reasoning.

### Leaving the barn door open for Clever Hans: Simple features predict LLM   benchmark answers
**Authors**: Lorenzo Pacchiardi, Marko Tesic, Lucy G. Cheke, José Hernández-Orallo

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:05:41Z

**Summary**: The integrity of AI benchmarks is fundamental to accurately assess the capabilities of AI systems. The internal validity of these benchmarks - i.e., making sure they are free from confounding factors - is crucial for ensuring that they are measuring what they are designed to measure. In this paper, we explore a key issue related to internal validity: the possibility that AI systems can solve benchmarks in unintended ways, bypassing the capability being tested. This phenomenon, widely known in human and animal experiments, is often referred to as the 'Clever Hans' effect, where tasks are solved using spurious cues, often involving much simpler processes than those putatively assessed. Previous research suggests that language models can exhibit this behaviour as well. In several older Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks, individual $n$-grams like "not" have been found to be highly predictive of the correct labels, and supervised NLP models have been shown to exploit these patterns. In this work, we investigate the extent to which simple $n$-grams extracted from benchmark instances can be combined to predict labels in modern multiple-choice benchmarks designed for LLMs, and whether LLMs might be using such $n$-gram patterns to solve these benchmarks. We show how simple classifiers trained on these $n$-grams can achieve high scores on several benchmarks, despite lacking the capabilities being tested. Additionally, we provide evidence that modern LLMs might be using these superficial patterns to solve benchmarks. This suggests that the internal validity of these benchmarks may be compromised and caution should be exercised when interpreting LLM performance results on them.

### LLM-wrapper: Black-Box Semantic-Aware Adaptation of Vision-Language   Models for Referring Expression Comprehension
**Authors**: Amaia Cardiel, Eloi Zablocki, Elias Ramzi, Oriane Siméoni, Matthieu Cord

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:52:55Z

**Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various open-vocabulary tasks, yet their zero-shot performance lags behind task-specific finetuned models, particularly in complex tasks like Referring Expression Comprehension (REC). Fine-tuning usually requires 'white-box' access to the model's architecture and weights, which is not always feasible due to proprietary or privacy concerns. In this work, we propose LLM-wrapper, a method for 'black-box' adaptation of VLMs for the REC task using Large Language Models (LLMs). LLM-wrapper capitalizes on the reasoning abilities of LLMs, improved with a light fine-tuning, to select the most relevant bounding box matching the referring expression, from candidates generated by a zero-shot black-box VLM. Our approach offers several advantages: it enables the adaptation of closed-source models without needing access to their internal workings, it is versatile as it works with any VLM, it transfers to new VLMs, and it allows for the adaptation of an ensemble of VLMs. We evaluate LLM-wrapper on multiple datasets using different VLMs and LLMs, demonstrating significant performance improvements and highlighting the versatility of our method. While LLM-wrapper is not meant to directly compete with standard white-box fine-tuning, it offers a practical and effective alternative for black-box VLM adaptation. The code will be open-sourced.

### Retrieval Augmented Spelling Correction for E-Commerce Applications
**Authors**: Xuan Guo, Rohit Patki, Dante Everaert, Christopher Potts

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:42:18Z

**Summary**: The rapid introduction of new brand names into everyday language poses a unique challenge for e-commerce spelling correction services, which must distinguish genuine misspellings from novel brand names that use unconventional spelling. We seek to address this challenge via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). On this approach, product names are retrieved from a catalog and incorporated into the context used by a large language model (LLM) that has been fine-tuned to do contextual spelling correction. Through quantitative evaluation and qualitative error analyses, we find improvements in spelling correction utilizing the RAG framework beyond a stand-alone LLM. We also demonstrate the value of additional finetuning of the LLM to incorporate retrieved context.

### Transformer Layer Injection: A Novel Approach for Efficient Upscaling of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: James Vo

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:41:44Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we propose Transformer Layer Injection (TLI), a novel method for efficiently upscaling large language models (LLMs) while minimizing computational costs and maintaining model performance. Model scale is a key factor in enhancing the quality of machine learning models, and TLI addresses the challenge of scaling by reducing initial loss, minimizing fine-tuning requirements, and preserving model complexity. Our approach improves upon the conventional Depth Up-Scaling (DUS) technique by injecting new layers into every set of K layers, enabling hidden representations to pass through transformer blocks with minimal disruption. We compare TLI with existing approaches, including Mixture of Experts (MoE) and DUS, and validate its efficiency through experiments on small LLMs (LLama3 1B, 3B, and 8B). Results show that TLI achieves better initialization, requires fewer training steps, and delivers superior accuracy on tasks such as KoBEST and KMCQA, with models performing effectively even without additional training. TLI is demonstrated to be both data-efficient and cost-effective, significantly outperforming existing methods. Its scalability and simplicity make it a promising solution for upscaling transformer-based models, with potential applications in scaling models from 10B to 405B parameters.

### ED-ViT: Splitting Vision Transformer for Distributed Inference on Edge   Devices
**Authors**: Xiang Liu, Yijun Song, Xia Li, Yifei Sun, Huiying Lan, Zemin Liu, Linshan Jiang, Jialin Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:38:14Z

**Summary**: Deep learning models are increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices for real-time data analytics. In recent years, Vision Transformer models and their variants have demonstrated outstanding performance across various computer vision tasks. However, their high computational demands and inference latency pose significant challenges for model deployment on resource-constraint edge devices. To address this issue, we propose a novel Vision Transformer splitting framework, ED-ViT, designed to execute complex models across multiple edge devices efficiently. Specifically, we partition Vision Transformer models into several sub-models, where each sub-model is tailored to handle a specific subset of data classes. To further minimize computation overhead and inference latency, we introduce a class-wise pruning technique that reduces the size of each sub-model. We conduct extensive experiments on five datasets with three model structures, demonstrating that our approach significantly reduces inference latency on edge devices and achieves a model size reduction of up to 28.9 times and 34.1 times, respectively, while maintaining test accuracy comparable to the original Vision Transformer. Additionally, we compare ED-ViT with two state-of-the-art methods that deploy CNN and SNN models on edge devices, evaluating accuracy, inference time, and overall model size. Our comprehensive evaluation underscores the effectiveness of the proposed ED-ViT framework.

### Measuring Spiritual Values and Bias of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Songyuan Liu, Ziyang Zhang, Runze Yan, Wei Wu, Carl Yang, Jiaying Lu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:33:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral tool for users from various backgrounds. LLMs, trained on vast corpora, reflect the linguistic and cultural nuances embedded in their pre-training data. However, the values and perspectives inherent in this data can influence the behavior of LLMs, leading to potential biases. As a result, the use of LLMs in contexts involving spiritual or moral values necessitates careful consideration of these underlying biases. Our work starts with verification of our hypothesis by testing the spiritual values of popular LLMs. Experimental results show that LLMs' spiritual values are quite diverse, as opposed to the stereotype of atheists or secularists. We then investigate how different spiritual values affect LLMs in social-fairness scenarios e.g., hate speech identification). Our findings reveal that different spiritual values indeed lead to different sensitivity to different hate target groups. Furthermore, we propose to continue pre-training LLMs on spiritual texts, and empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in mitigating spiritual bias.

### Capturing Minds, Not Just Words: Enhancing Role-Playing Language Models   with Personality-Indicative Data
**Authors**: Yiting Ran, Xintao Wang, Rui Xu, Xinfeng Yuan, Jiaqing Liang, Deqing Yang, Yanghua Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:24:56Z

**Summary**: Role-playing agents (RPA) have been a popular application area for large language models (LLMs), attracting significant interest from both industry and academia.While existing RPAs well portray the characters' knowledge and tones, they face challenges in capturing their minds, especially for small role-playing language models (RPLMs). In this paper, we propose to enhance RPLMs via personality-indicative data. Specifically, we leverage questions from psychological scales and distill advanced RPAs to generate dialogues that grasp the minds of characters. Experimental results validate that RPLMs trained with our dataset exhibit advanced role-playing capabilities for both general and personality-related evaluations. Code and data are available at \href{https://github.com/alienet1109/RolePersonality}{this URL}.

**Authors**: Minbyul Jeong, Hyeon Hwang, Chanwoong Yoon, Taewhoo Lee, Jaewoo Kang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:21:54Z

**Summary**: In the medical domain, numerous scenarios necessitate the long-form generation ability of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, when addressing patients' questions, it is essential that the model's response conveys factual claims, highlighting the need for an automated method to evaluate those claims. Thus, we introduce MedLFQA, a benchmark dataset reconstructed using long-form question-answering datasets related to the biomedical domain. We use MedLFQA to facilitate a cost-effective automatic evaluations of factuality. We also propose OLAPH, a simple and novel framework that utilizes cost-effective and multifaceted automatic evaluation to construct a synthetic preference set and answers questions in our preferred manner. Our framework leads us to train LLMs step-by-step to reduce hallucinations and include crucial medical claims. We highlight that, even on evaluation metrics not used during training, LLMs trained with our OLAPH framework demonstrate significant performance improvement in factuality. Our findings reveal that a 7B LLM trained with our OLAPH framework can provide long answers comparable to the medical experts' answers in terms of factuality. We believe that our work could shed light on gauging the long-text generation ability of LLMs in the medical domain. Our code and datasets are available.

### Inducing anxiety in large language models can induce bias
**Authors**: Julian Coda-Forno, Kristin Witte, Akshay K. Jagadish, Marcel Binz, Zeynep Akata, Eric Schulz

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:20:51Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming research on machine learning while galvanizing public debates. Understanding not only when these models work well and succeed but also why they fail and misbehave is of great societal relevance. We propose to turn the lens of psychiatry, a framework used to describe and modify maladaptive behavior, to the outputs produced by these models. We focus on twelve established LLMs and subject them to a questionnaire commonly used in psychiatry. Our results show that six of the latest LLMs respond robustly to the anxiety questionnaire, producing comparable anxiety scores to humans. Moreover, the LLMs' responses can be predictably changed by using anxiety-inducing prompts. Anxiety-induction not only influences LLMs' scores on an anxiety questionnaire but also influences their behavior in a previously-established benchmark measuring biases such as racism and ageism. Importantly, greater anxiety-inducing text leads to stronger increases in biases, suggesting that how anxiously a prompt is communicated to large language models has a strong influence on their behavior in applied settings. These results demonstrate the usefulness of methods taken from psychiatry for studying the capable algorithms to which we increasingly delegate authority and autonomy.

### Fast Local Neural Regression for Low-Cost, Path Traced Lambertian Global   Illumination
**Authors**: Arturo Salmi, Szabolcs Cséfalvay, James Imber

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T14:14:06Z

**Summary**: Despite recent advances in hardware acceleration of ray tracing, real-time ray budgets remain stubbornly limited at a handful of samples per pixel (spp) on commodity hardware, placing the onus on denoising algorithms to achieve high visual quality for path traced global illumination. Neural network-based solutions give excellent result quality at the cost of increased execution time relative to hand-engineered methods, making them less suitable for deployment on resource-constrained systems. We therefore propose incorporating a neural network into a computationally-efficient local linear model-based denoiser, and demonstrate faithful single-frame reconstruction of global illumination for Lambertian scenes at very low sample counts (1spp) and for low computational cost. Other contributions include improving the quality and performance of local linear model-based denoising through a simplified mathematical treatment, and demonstration of the surprising usefulness of ambient occlusion as a guide channel. We also show how our technique is straightforwardly extensible to joint denoising and upsampling of path traced renders with reference to low-cost, rasterized guide channels.

### Agent Planning with World Knowledge Model
**Authors**: Shuofei Qiao, Runnan Fang, Ningyu Zhang, Yuqi Zhu, Xiang Chen, Shumin Deng, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Huajun Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T13:58:17Z

**Summary**: Recent endeavors towards directly using large language models (LLMs) as agent models to execute interactive planning tasks have shown commendable results. Despite their achievements, however, they still struggle with brainless trial-and-error in global planning and generating hallucinatory actions in local planning due to their poor understanding of the ``real'' physical world. Imitating humans' mental world knowledge model which provides global prior knowledge before the task and maintains local dynamic knowledge during the task, in this paper, we introduce parametric World Knowledge Model (WKM) to facilitate agent planning. Concretely, we steer the agent model to self-synthesize knowledge from both expert and sampled trajectories. Then we develop WKM, providing prior task knowledge to guide the global planning and dynamic state knowledge to assist the local planning. Experimental results on three complex real-world simulated datasets with three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, Mistral-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama-3-8B, demonstrate that our method can achieve superior performance compared to various strong baselines. Besides, we analyze to illustrate that our WKM can effectively alleviate the blind trial-and-error and hallucinatory action issues, providing strong support for the agent's understanding of the world. Other interesting findings include: 1) our instance-level task knowledge can generalize better to unseen tasks, 2) weak WKM can guide strong agent model planning, and 3) unified WKM training has promising potential for further development. The code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/WKM.

### Black-box Uncertainty Quantification Method for LLM-as-a-Judge
**Authors**: Nico Wagner, Michael Desmond, Rahul Nair, Zahra Ashktorab, Elizabeth M. Daly, Qian Pan, Martín Santillán Cooper, James M. Johnson, Werner Geyer

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T13:29:22Z

**Summary**: LLM-as-a-Judge is a widely used method for evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various tasks. We address the challenge of quantifying the uncertainty of LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. While uncertainty quantification has been well-studied in other domains, applying it effectively to LLMs poses unique challenges due to their complex decision-making capabilities and computational demands. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for quantifying uncertainty designed to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. The method quantifies uncertainty by analyzing the relationships between generated assessments and possible ratings. By cross-evaluating these relationships and constructing a confusion matrix based on token probabilities, the method derives labels of high or low uncertainty. We evaluate our method across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating a strong correlation between the accuracy of LLM evaluations and the derived uncertainty scores. Our findings suggest that this method can significantly improve the reliability and consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations.

**Summary**: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) has gained significant research attention for its ability to identify anomalous images and pinpoint the specific areas responsible for the anomaly. A key advantage of VAD is its unsupervised nature, which eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming labeled data collection. However, despite its potential for real-world applications, the literature has given limited focus to resource-efficient VAD, particularly for deployment on edge devices. This work addresses this gap by leveraging lightweight neural networks to reduce memory and computation requirements, enabling VAD deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We benchmark the major VAD algorithms within this framework and demonstrate the feasibility of edge-based VAD using the well-known MVTec dataset. Furthermore, we introduce a novel algorithm, Partially Shared Teacher-student (PaSTe), designed to address the high resource demands of the existing Student Teacher Feature Pyramid Matching (STFPM) approach. Our results show that PaSTe decreases the inference time by 25%, while reducing the training time by 33% and peak RAM usage during training by 76%. These improvements make the VAD process significantly more efficient, laying a solid foundation for real-world deployment on edge devices.

### Causal Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Knowledge Graph Approach
**Authors**: Yejin Kim, Eojin Kang, Juae Kim, H. Howie Huang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T13:24:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) typically improve performance by either retrieving semantically similar information, or enhancing reasoning abilities through structured prompts like chain-of-thought. While both strategies are considered crucial, it remains unclear which has a greater impact on model performance or whether a combination of both is necessary. This paper answers this question by proposing a knowledge graph (KG)-based random-walk reasoning approach that leverages causal relationships. We conduct experiments on the commonsense question answering task that is based on a KG. The KG inherently provides both relevant information, such as related entity keywords, and a reasoning structure through the connections between nodes. Experimental results show that the proposed KG-based random-walk reasoning method improves the reasoning ability and performance of LLMs. Interestingly, incorporating three seemingly irrelevant sentences into the query using KG-based random-walk reasoning enhances LLM performance, contrary to conventional wisdom. These findings suggest that integrating causal structures into prompts can significantly improve reasoning capabilities, providing new insights into the role of causality in optimizing LLM performance.

### Minimum Tuning to Unlock Long Output from LLMs with High Quality Data as   the Key
**Authors**: Yingda Chen, Xingjun Wang, Jintao Huang, Yunlin Mao, Daoze Zhang, Yuze Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T13:21:19Z

**Summary**: As large language models rapidly evolve to support longer context, there is a notable disparity in their capability to generate output at greater lengths. Recent study suggests that the primary cause for this imbalance may arise from the lack of data with long-output during alignment training. In light of this observation, attempts are made to re-align foundation models with data that fills the gap, which result in models capable of generating lengthy output when instructed. In this paper, we explore the impact of data-quality in tuning a model for long output, and the possibility of doing so from the starting points of human-aligned (instruct or chat) models. With careful data curation, we show that it possible to achieve similar performance improvement in our tuned models, with only a small fraction of training data instances and compute. In addition, we assess the generalizability of such approaches by applying our tuning-recipes to several models. our findings suggest that, while capacities for generating long output vary across different models out-of-the-box, our approach to tune them with high-quality data using lite compute, consistently yields notable improvement across all models we experimented on. We have made public our curated dataset for tuning long-writing capability, the implementations of model tuning and evaluation, as well as the fine-tuned models, all of which can be openly-accessed.

**Authors**: Sathya Krishnan Suresh, Wu Mengjun, Tushar Pranav, Eng Siong Chng

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:55:27Z

**Summary**: The scarcity of domain-specific dialogue datasets limits the development of dialogue systems across applications. Existing research is constrained by general or niche datasets that lack sufficient scale for training dialogue systems. To address this gap, we introduce DiaSynth - a synthetic dialogue generation framework capable of generating high-quality, contextually rich dialogues across a wide range of domains. Unlike existing frameworks, DiaSynth uses Large Language Models (LLMs) and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning to generate dynamic, domain-specific dialogues with simulated personas and diverse conversational features. We perform our experiments by generating synthetic data using different LLMs and few-shot examples from DialogSum and SAMSum. The pretrained language models fine-tuned on the synthetic data outperform the base models by 16.47% on dialogue summarization, while the comparison between models fine-tuned on in-domain data and synthetic data shows that the synthetic data is able to capture 90.48% of the performance distribution of the in-domain data on dialogue summarization. The quality of the data generated also increases as we increase the size of LLM from 3B to 8B. These results validate DiaSynth's potential as a robust alternative to traditional data collection methods. We open source the code and data generated for future research.

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:54:13Z

**Summary**: 6G networks will be highly dynamic, re-configurable, and resilient. To enable and support such features, employing AI has been suggested. Integrating AIin networks will likely require distributed AI deployments with resilient connectivity, e.g., for communication between RL agents and environment. Such approaches need to be validated in realistic network environments. In this demo, we use ContainerNet to emulate AI-capable and autonomic networks that employ the routing protocol KIRA to provide resilient connectivity and service discovery. As an example AI application, we train and infer deep RL agents learning medium access control (MAC) policies for a wireless network environment in the emulated network.

**Authors**: Shang-Ching Liu, Van Nhiem Tran, Wenkai Chen, Wei-Lun Cheng, Yen-Lin Huang, I-Bin Liao, Yung-Hui Li, Jianwei Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:53:42Z

**Summary**: Affordance understanding, the task of identifying actionable regions on 3D objects, plays a vital role in allowing robotic systems to engage with and operate within the physical world. Although Visual Language Models (VLMs) have excelled in high-level reasoning and long-horizon planning for robotic manipulation, they still fall short in grasping the nuanced physical properties required for effective human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce PAVLM (Point cloud Affordance Vision-Language Model), an innovative framework that utilizes the extensive multimodal knowledge embedded in pre-trained language models to enhance 3D affordance understanding of point cloud. PAVLM integrates a geometric-guided propagation module with hidden embeddings from large language models (LLMs) to enrich visual semantics. On the language side, we prompt Llama-3.1 models to generate refined context-aware text, augmenting the instructional input with deeper semantic cues. Experimental results on the 3D-AffordanceNet benchmark demonstrate that PAVLM outperforms baseline methods for both full and partial point clouds, particularly excelling in its generalization to novel open-world affordance tasks of 3D objects.

**Authors**: Tengfei Ma, Xuan Lin, Tianle Li, Chaoyi Li, Long Chen, Peng Zhou, Xibao Cai, Xinyu Yang, Daojian Zeng, Dongsheng Cao, Xiangxiang Zeng

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:39:20Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in general tasks across various fields. However, their effectiveness within specific domains such as drug development remains challenges. To solve these challenges, we introduce \textbf{Y-Mol}, forming a well-established LLM paradigm for the flow of drug development. Y-Mol is a multiscale biomedical knowledge-guided LLM designed to accomplish tasks across lead compound discovery, pre-clinic, and clinic prediction. By integrating millions of multiscale biomedical knowledge and using LLaMA2 as the base LLM, Y-Mol augments the reasoning capability in the biomedical domain by learning from a corpus of publications, knowledge graphs, and expert-designed synthetic data. The capability is further enriched with three types of drug-oriented instructions: description-based prompts from processed publications, semantic-based prompts for extracting associations from knowledge graphs, and template-based prompts for understanding expert knowledge from biomedical tools. Besides, Y-Mol offers a set of LLM paradigms that can autonomously execute the downstream tasks across the entire process of drug development, including virtual screening, drug design, pharmacological properties prediction, and drug-related interaction prediction. Our extensive evaluations of various biomedical sources demonstrate that Y-Mol significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs in discovering lead compounds, predicting molecular properties, and identifying drug interaction events.

### Data Quality Control in Federated Instruction-tuning of Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Yaxin Du, Rui Ye, Fengting Yuchi, Wanru Zhao, Jingjing Qu, Yanfeng Wang, Siheng Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:14:57Z

**Summary**: By leveraging massively distributed data, federated learning (FL) enables collaborative instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs) in a privacy-preserving way. While FL effectively expands the data quantity, the issue of data quality remains under-explored in the current literature on FL for LLMs. To address this gap, we propose a new framework of federated instruction tuning of LLMs with data quality control (FedDQC), which measures data quality to facilitate the subsequent filtering and hierarchical training processes. Our approach introduces an efficient metric to assess each client's instruction-response alignment (IRA), identifying potentially noisy data through single-shot inference. Low-IRA samples are potentially noisy and filtered to mitigate their negative impacts. To further utilize this IRA value, we propose a quality-aware hierarchical training paradigm, where LLM is progressively fine-tuned from high-IRA to low-IRA data, mirroring the easy-to-hard learning process. We conduct extensive experiments on 4 synthetic and a real-world dataset, and compare our method with baselines adapted from centralized setting. Results show that our method consistently and significantly improves the performance of LLMs trained on mix-quality data in FL.

### Multi-round jailbreak attack on large language models
**Authors**: Yihua Zhou, Xiaochuan Shi

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:08:14Z

**Summary**: Ensuring the safety and alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is crucial for generating responses that are beneficial to humanity. While LLMs have the capability to identify and avoid harmful queries, they remain vulnerable to "jailbreak" attacks, where carefully crafted prompts can induce the generation of toxic content. Traditional single-round jailbreak attacks, such as GCG and AutoDAN, do not alter the sensitive words in the dangerous prompts. Although they can temporarily bypass the model's safeguards through prompt engineering, their success rate drops significantly as the LLM is further fine-tuned, and they cannot effectively circumvent static rule-based filters that remove the hazardous vocabulary.   In this study, to better understand jailbreak attacks, we introduce a multi-round jailbreak approach. This method can rewrite the dangerous prompts, decomposing them into a series of less harmful sub-questions to bypass the LLM's safety checks. We first use the LLM to perform a decomposition task, breaking down a set of natural language questions into a sequence of progressive sub-questions, which are then used to fine-tune the Llama3-8B model, enabling it to decompose hazardous prompts. The fine-tuned model is then used to break down the problematic prompt, and the resulting sub-questions are sequentially asked to the victim model. If the victim model rejects a sub-question, a new decomposition is generated, and the process is repeated until the final objective is achieved. Our experimental results show a 94\% success rate on the llama2-7B and demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in circumventing static rule-based filters.

**Authors**: Christian Internò, Elena Raponi, Niki van Stein, Thomas Bäck, Markus Olhofer, Yaochu Jin, Barbara Hammer

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:06:07Z

**Summary**: The rapid proliferation of smart devices coupled with the advent of 6G networks has profoundly reshaped the domain of collaborative machine learning. Alongside growing privacy-security concerns in sensitive fields, these developments have positioned federated learning (FL) as a pivotal technology for decentralized model training. Despite its vast potential, specially in the age of complex foundation models, FL encounters challenges such as elevated communication costs, computational constraints, and the complexities of non-IID data distributions. We introduce AutoFLIP, an innovative approach that utilizes a federated loss exploration phase to drive adaptive hybrid pruning, operating in a structured and unstructured way. This innovative mechanism automatically identifies and prunes model substructure by distilling knowledge on model gradients behavior across different non-IID client losses topology, thereby optimizing computational efficiency and enhancing model performance on resource constrained scenarios. Extensive experiments on various datasets and FL tasks reveal that AutoFLIP not only efficiently accelerates global convergence, but also achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods. On average, AutoFLIP reduces computational overhead by 48.8% and communication costs by 35.5%, while improving global accuracy. By significantly reducing these overheads, AutoFLIP offer the way for efficient FL deployment in real-world applications for a scalable and broad applicability.

**Authors**: Xinjie Zhao, Moritz Blum, Rui Yang, Boming Yang, Luis Márquez Carpintero, Mónica Pina-Navarro, Tony Wang, Xin Li, Huitao Li, Yanran Fu, Rongrong Wang, Juntao Zhang, Irene Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T12:05:58Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models~(LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities across various applications but face challenges such as hallucination, limited reasoning abilities, and factual inconsistencies, especially when tackling complex, domain-specific tasks like question answering~(QA). While Knowledge Graphs~(KGs) have been shown to help mitigate these issues, research on the integration of LLMs with background KGs remains limited. In particular, user accessibility and the flexibility of the underlying KG have not been thoroughly explored. We introduce AGENTiGraph (Adaptive Generative ENgine for Task-based Interaction and Graphical Representation), a platform for knowledge management through natural language interaction. It integrates knowledge extraction, integration, and real-time visualization. AGENTiGraph employs a multi-agent architecture to dynamically interpret user intents, manage tasks, and integrate new knowledge, ensuring adaptability to evolving user requirements and data contexts. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in knowledge graph interactions, particularly for complex domain-specific tasks. Experimental results on a dataset of 3,500 test cases show AGENTiGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot baselines, achieving 95.12\% accuracy in task classification and 90.45\% success rate in task execution. User studies corroborate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To showcase versatility, we extended AGENTiGraph to legislation and healthcare domains, constructing specialized KGs capable of answering complex queries in legal and medical contexts.

**Authors**: Yusong Zhang, Dong Dong, Chi-tim Hung, Leonard Heyerdahl, Tamara Giles-Vernick, Eng-kiong Yeoh

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T11:57:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation. Advanced utilization of the knowledge embedded in LLMs for automated annotation has consistently been explored. This study proposed to develop an emotion lexicon for Cantonese, a low-resource language, through collaborative efforts between LLM and human annotators. By integrating emotion labels provided by LLM and human annotators, the study leveraged existing linguistic resources including lexicons in other languages and local forums to construct a Cantonese emotion lexicon enriched with colloquial expressions. The consistency of the proposed emotion lexicon in emotion extraction was assessed through modification and utilization of three distinct emotion text datasets. This study not only validates the efficacy of the constructed lexicon but also emphasizes that collaborative annotation between human and artificial intelligence can significantly enhance the quality of emotion labels, highlighting the potential of such partnerships in facilitating natural language processing tasks for low-resource languages.

### Leveraging LLM Embeddings for Cross Dataset Label Alignment and Zero   Shot Music Emotion Prediction
**Authors**: Renhang Liu, Abhinaba Roy, Dorien Herremans

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T11:48:31Z

**Summary**: In this work, we present a novel method for music emotion recognition that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) embeddings for label alignment across multiple datasets and zero-shot prediction on novel categories. First, we compute LLM embeddings for emotion labels and apply non-parametric clustering to group similar labels, across multiple datasets containing disjoint labels. We use these cluster centers to map music features (MERT) to the LLM embedding space. To further enhance the model, we introduce an alignment regularization that enables dissociation of MERT embeddings from different clusters. This further enhances the model's ability to better adaptation to unseen datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing zero-shot inference on a new dataset, showcasing its ability to generalize to unseen labels without additional training.

### DIRAS: Efficient LLM Annotation of Document Relevance in Retrieval   Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Jingwei Ni, Tobias Schimanski, Meihong Lin, Mrinmaya Sachan, Elliott Ash, Markus Leippold

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T11:37:04Z

**Summary**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely employed to ground responses to queries on domain-specific documents. But do RAG implementations leave out important information when answering queries that need an integrated analysis of information (e.g., Tell me good news in the stock market today.)? To address these concerns, RAG developers need to annotate information retrieval (IR) data for their domain of interest, which is challenging because (1) domain-specific queries usually need nuanced definitions of relevance beyond shallow semantic relevance; and (2) human or GPT-4 annotation is costly and cannot cover all (query, document) pairs (i.e., annotation selection bias), thus harming the effectiveness in evaluating IR recall. To address these challenges, we propose DIRAS (Domain-specific Information Retrieval Annotation with Scalability), a manual-annotation-free schema that fine-tunes open-sourced LLMs to consider nuanced relevance definition and annotate (partial) relevance labels with calibrated relevance scores. Extensive evaluation shows that DIRAS enables smaller (8B) LLMs to achieve GPT-4-level performance on annotating and ranking unseen (query, document) pairs, and is helpful for real-world RAG development. All code, LLM generations, and human annotations can be found in \url{https://github.com/EdisonNi-hku/DIRAS}.

### Are Large Language Models Strategic Decision Makers? A Study of   Performance and Bias in Two-Player Non-Zero-Sum Games
**Authors**: Nathan Herr, Fernando Acero, Roberta Raileanu, María Pérez-Ortiz, Zhibin Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T11:29:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used in real-world settings, yet their strategic decision-making abilities remain largely unexplored. To fully benefit from the potential of LLMs, it's essential to understand their ability to function in complex social scenarios. Game theory, which is already used to understand real-world interactions, provides a good framework for assessing these abilities. This work investigates the performance and merits of LLMs in canonical game-theoretic two-player non-zero-sum games, Stag Hunt and Prisoner Dilemma. Our structured evaluation of GPT-3.5, GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama-3-8B shows that these models, when making decisions in these games, are affected by at least one of the following systematic biases: positional bias, payoff bias, or behavioural bias. This indicates that LLMs do not fully rely on logical reasoning when making these strategic decisions. As a result, it was found that the LLMs' performance drops when the game configuration is misaligned with the affecting biases. When misaligned, GPT-3.5, GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama-3-8B show an average performance drop of 32\%, 25\%, 34\%, and 29\% respectively in Stag Hunt, and 28\%, 16\%, 34\%, and 24\% respectively in Prisoner's Dilemma. Surprisingly, GPT-4o (a top-performing LLM across standard benchmarks) suffers the most substantial performance drop, suggesting that newer models are not addressing these issues. Interestingly, we found that a commonly used method of improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, reduces the biases in GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and Llama-3-8B but increases the effect of the bias in GPT-4-Turbo, indicating that CoT alone cannot fully serve as a robust solution to this problem. We perform several additional experiments, which provide further insight into these observed behaviours.

### Revisiting Benchmark and Assessment: An Agent-based Exploratory Dynamic   Evaluation Framework for LLMs
**Authors**: Wanying Wang, Zeyu Ma, Pengfei Liu, Mingang Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T11:20:42Z

**Summary**: While various vertical domain large language models (LLMs) have been developed, the challenge of automatically evaluating their performance across different domains remains significant in addressing real-world user needs. Current benchmark-based evaluation methods exhibit rigid, purposeless interactions and rely on pre-collected static datasets that are costly to build, inflexible across domains, and misaligned with practical user needs. To address this, we revisit the evaluation components and introduce two definitions: **Benchmark+**, which extends traditional QA benchmarks into a more flexible ``strategy-criterion'' format; and **Assessment+**, which enhances the interaction process for greater exploration and enables both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights that capture nuanced target LLM behaviors from richer multi-turn interactions. We propose an agent-based evaluation framework called *TestAgent*, which implements these two concepts through retrieval augmented generation and reinforcement learning. Experiments on tasks ranging from building vertical domain evaluation from scratch to activating existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of *TestAgent* across various scenarios. We believe this work offers an interesting perspective on automatic evaluation for LLMs.

### CoRA: Collaborative Information Perception by Large Language Model's   Weights for Recommendation
**Authors**: Yuting Liu, Jinghao Zhang, Yizhou Dang, Yuliang Liang, Qiang Liu, Guibing Guo, Jianzhe Zhao, Xingwei Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T11:01:33Z

**Summary**: Involving collaborative information in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a promising technique for adapting LLMs for recommendation. Existing methods achieve this by concatenating collaborative features with text tokens into a unified sequence input and then fine-tuning to align these features with LLM's input space. Although effective, in this work, we identify two limitations when adapting LLMs to recommendation tasks, which hinder the integration of general knowledge and collaborative information, resulting in sub-optimal recommendation performance. (1) Fine-tuning LLM with recommendation data can undermine its inherent world knowledge and fundamental competencies, which are crucial for interpreting and inferring recommendation text. (2) Incorporating collaborative features into textual prompts disrupts the semantics of the original prompts, preventing LLM from generating appropriate outputs. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm, CoRA (an acronym for Collaborative LoRA), with a collaborative weights generator. Rather than input space alignment, this method aligns collaborative information with LLM's parameter space, representing them as incremental weights to update LLM's output. This way, LLM perceives collaborative information without altering its general knowledge and text inference capabilities. Specifically, we employ a collaborative filtering model to extract user and item embeddings, converting them into collaborative weights with low-rank properties through the collaborative weights generator. We then merge the collaborative weights into LLM's weights, enabling LLM to perceive the collaborative signals and generate personalized recommendations without fine-tuning or extra collaborative tokens in prompts. Extensive experiments confirm that CoRA effectively integrates collaborative information into LLM, enhancing recommendation performance.

### Unraveling the Mechanics of Learning-Based Demonstration Selection for   In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Hui Liu, Wenya Wang, Hao Sun, Chris Xing Tian, Chenqi Kong, Xin Dong, Haoliang Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T10:53:55Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities from few-shot demonstration exemplars. While recent learning-based demonstration selection methods have proven beneficial to ICL by choosing more useful exemplars, their underlying mechanisms are opaque, hindering efforts to address limitations such as high training costs and poor generalization across tasks. These methods generally assume the selection process captures similarities between the exemplar and the target instance, however, it remains unknown what kinds of similarities are captured and vital to performing ICL. To dive into this question, we analyze the working mechanisms of the learning-based demonstration selection methods and empirically identify two important factors related to similarity measurement: 1) The ability to integrate different levels of task-agnostic text similarities between the input of exemplars and test cases enhances generalization power across different tasks. 2) Incorporating task-specific labels when measuring the similarities significantly improves the performance on each specific task. We validate these two findings through extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses across ten datasets and various LLMs. Based on our findings, we introduce two effective yet simplified exemplar selection methods catering to task-agnostic and task-specific demands, eliminating the costly LLM inference overhead.

### Mathador-LM: A Dynamic Benchmark for Mathematical Reasoning on Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Eldar Kurtic, Amir Moeini, Dan Alistarh

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T10:35:17Z

**Summary**: We introduce Mathador-LM, a new benchmark for evaluating the mathematical reasoning on large language models (LLMs), combining ruleset interpretation, planning, and problem-solving. This benchmark is inspired by the Mathador game, where the objective is to reach a target number using basic arithmetic operations on a given set of base numbers, following a simple set of rules. We show that, across leading LLMs, we obtain stable average performance while generating benchmark instances \emph{dynamically}, following a target difficulty level. Thus, our benchmark alleviates concerns about test-set leakage into training data, an issue that often undermines popular benchmarks. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both open and closed-source state-of-the-art LLMs on Mathador-LM. Our findings reveal that contemporary models struggle with Mathador-LM, scoring significantly lower than average 3rd graders. This stands in stark contrast to their strong performance on popular mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The implementation of Mathador-LM benchmark is available at \href{https://github.com/IST-DASLab/Mathador-LM}{github.com/IST-DASLab/Mathador-LM}.

### O-Edit: Orthogonal Subspace Editing for Language Model Sequential   Editing
**Authors**: Yuchen Cai, Ding Cao

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T10:16:45Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) acquire knowledge during pre-training, but over time, this knowledge may become incorrect or outdated, necessitating updates after training. Knowledge editing techniques address this issue without the need for costly re-training. However, most existing methods are designed for single edits, and as the number of edits increases, they often cause a decline in the model's overall performance, posing significant challenges for sequential editing. To overcome this, we propose Orthogonal Subspace Editing, O-Edit. This algorithm orthogonalizes the direction of each knowledge update, minimizing interference between successive updates and reducing the impact of new updates on unrelated knowledge. Our approach does not require replaying previously edited data and processes each edit knowledge on time. It can perform thousands of edits on mainstream LLMs, achieving an average performance improvement that is 4.2 times better than existing methods while effectively preserving the model's performance on downstream tasks, all with minimal additional parameter overhead.

**Authors**: Animesh Singh Basnet, Mohamed Chahine Ghanem, Dipo Dunsin, Wiktor Sowinski-Mydlarz

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T10:10:33Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for attributing malware to specific Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups through detailed behavioural analysis. By analysing over 3500 malware samples from 12 distinct APT groups, the study utilises sophisticated tools like Cuckoo Sandbox to extract behavioural data, providing a deep insight into the operational patterns of malware. The research demonstrates that the DRL model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning approaches such as SGD, SVC, KNN, MLP, and Decision Tree Classifiers, achieving an impressive test accuracy of 89.27 %. It highlights the model capability to adeptly manage complex, variable, and elusive malware attributes. Furthermore, the paper discusses the considerable computational resources and extensive data dependencies required for deploying these advanced AI models in cybersecurity frameworks. Future research is directed towards enhancing the efficiency of DRL models, expanding the diversity of the datasets, addressing ethical concerns, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to refine reward mechanisms and optimise the DRL framework. By showcasing the transformative potential of DRL in malware attribution, this research advocates for a responsible and balanced approach to AI integration, with the goal of advancing cybersecurity through more adaptable, accurate, and robust systems.

### Logit Separability-Driven Samples and Multiple Class-Related Words   Selection for Advancing In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Zhu Zixiao, Feng Zijian, Zhou Hanzhang, Qian Junlang, Mao Kezhi

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T10:09:01Z

**Summary**: Effective organization of in-context learning (ICL) demonstrations is key to improving the quality of large language model (LLM) responses. To create better sample-label pairs that instruct LLM understanding, we introduce logit separability, a criterion to assess the clarity of both samples and class-related words at the logit level. This facilitates the optimization of sample and label selection, enhancing the precision of information provided in ICL demonstrations. Additionally, we find that incorporating multiple class-related words for each sample, rather than relying on a single class name, improves performance by offering a broader range of label information. Building on these insights, we propose LICL, a logit separability-based method that jointly organizes samples and integrates multiple class-related words into each sample-label pair. Evaluations across seven classification datasets show that this approach significantly improves ICL performance by providing clearer instructions and richer label information.

### Jigsaw Puzzles: Splitting Harmful Questions to Jailbreak Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Hao Yang, Lizhen Qu, Ehsan Shareghi, Gholamreza Haffari

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T10:07:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited outstanding performance in engaging with humans and addressing complex questions by leveraging their vast implicit knowledge and robust reasoning capabilities. However, such models are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, leading to the generation of harmful responses. Despite recent research on single-turn jailbreak strategies to facilitate the development of defence mechanisms, the challenge of revealing vulnerabilities under multi-turn setting remains relatively under-explored. In this work, we propose Jigsaw Puzzles (JSP), a straightforward yet effective multi-turn jailbreak strategy against the advanced LLMs. JSP splits questions into harmless fractions as the input of each turn, and requests LLMs to reconstruct and respond to questions under multi-turn interaction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed JSP jailbreak bypasses original safeguards against explicitly harmful content, achieving an average attack success rate of 93.76% on 189 harmful queries across 5 advanced LLMs (Gemini-1.5-Pro, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini). Moreover, JSP achieves a state-of-the-art attack success rate of 92% on GPT-4 on the harmful query benchmark, and exhibits strong resistant to defence strategies. Warning: this paper contains offensive examples.

**Authors**: Yen-Hsiang Wang, Feng-Dian Su, Tzu-Yu Yeh, Yao-Chung Fan

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T09:53:40Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a cross-lingual statutory article retrieval (SAR) dataset designed to enhance legal information retrieval in multilingual settings. Our dataset features spoken-language-style legal inquiries in English, paired with corresponding Chinese versions and relevant statutes, covering all Taiwanese civil, criminal, and administrative laws. This dataset aims to improve access to legal information for non-native speakers, particularly for foreign nationals in Taiwan. We propose several LLM-based methods as baselines for evaluating retrieval effectiveness, focusing on mitigating translation errors and improving cross-lingual retrieval performance. Our work provides a valuable resource for developing inclusive legal information retrieval systems.

### Difficult Task Yes but Simple Task No: Unveiling the Laziness in   Multimodal LLMs
**Authors**: Sihang Zhao, Youliang Yuan, Xiaoying Tang, Pinjia He

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T09:40:50Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate a strong understanding of the real world and can even handle complex tasks. However, they still fail on some straightforward visual question-answering (VQA) problems. This paper dives deeper into this issue, revealing that models tend to err when answering easy questions (e.g. Yes/No questions) about an image, even though they can correctly describe it. We refer to this model behavior discrepancy between difficult and simple questions as model laziness. To systematically investigate model laziness, we manually construct LazyBench, a benchmark that includes Yes/No, multiple choice, short answer questions, and image description tasks that are related to the same subjects in the images. Based on LazyBench, we observe that laziness widely exists in current advanced MLLMs (e.g. GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-pro, Claude 3 and LLaVA-v1.5-13B), and it is more pronounced on stronger models. We also analyze the VQA v2 (LLaVA-v1.5-13B) benchmark and find that about half of its failure cases are caused by model laziness, which further highlights the importance of ensuring that the model fully utilizes its capability. To this end, we conduct preliminary exploration on how to mitigate laziness and find that chain of thought (CoT) can effectively address this issue.

### Learning Planning-based Reasoning by Trajectories Collection and Process   Reward Synthesizing
**Authors**: Fangkai Jiao, Chengwei Qin, Zhengyuan Liu, Nancy F. Chen, Shafiq Joty

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T09:16:38Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in handling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step rationale generation. However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized process rewards. Our results on challenging logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning framework, showing that our 7B model can surpass the strong counterparts like GPT-3.5-Turbo.

### Automatic Retrieval-augmented Generation of 6G Network Specifications   for Use Cases
**Authors**: Yun Tang, Weisi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T09:13:52Z

**Summary**: 6G Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) promises to open data interfaces to enable plug-and-play service Apps, many of which are consumer and business-facing. Opening up 6G access lowers the barrier to innovation but raises the challenge that the required communication specifications are not fully known to all service designers. As such, business innovators must either be familiar with 6G standards or consult with experts. Enabling consistent, unbiased, rapid, and low-cost requirement assessment and specification generation is crucial to the O-RAN innovation ecosystem.   Here, we discuss our initiative to bridge service specification gaps between network service providers and business innovators leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). We first review the state-of-the-art and motivation in 6G plug-and-play services, capabilities, potential use cases and LLMs. We identify an ample innovation space for hybrid use cases that may require diverse and variational wireless functionalities across its operating time. We show that the network specification can be automated and present the first automatic retrieval-augmented network service specification framework for 6G use cases. To enable public acceptance and feedback, a website interface is published for the research and industrial community to experiment with the framework. We hope this review highlights the need for emerging foundation models for this area and motivates researcher engagement and contribution to the community through our framework.

### The Generation Gap: Exploring Age Bias in the Value Systems of Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Siyang Liu, Trish Maturi, Bowen Yi, Siqi Shen, Rada Mihalcea

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T09:10:09Z

**Summary**: We explore the alignment of values in Large Language Models (LLMs) with specific age groups, leveraging data from the World Value Survey across thirteen categories. Through a diverse set of prompts tailored to ensure response robustness, we find a general inclination of LLM values towards younger demographics, especially when compared to the US population. Although a general inclination can be observed, we also found that this inclination toward younger groups can be different across different value categories. Additionally, we explore the impact of incorporating age identity information in prompts and observe challenges in mitigating value discrepancies with different age cohorts. Our findings highlight the age bias in LLMs and provide insights for future work. Materials for our analysis are available at \url{ https://github.com/MichiganNLP/Age-Bias-In-LLMs}

### VidCompress: Memory-Enhanced Temporal Compression for Video   Understanding in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Xiaohan Lan, Yitian Yuan, Zequn Jie, Lin Ma

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T09:07:25Z

**Summary**: Video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) possess significant potential for video understanding tasks. However, most Video-LLMs treat videos as a sequential set of individual frames, which results in insufficient temporal-spatial interaction that hinders fine-grained comprehension and difficulty in processing longer videos due to limited visual token capacity. To address these challenges, we propose VidCompress, a novel Video-LLM featuring memory-enhanced temporal compression. VidCompress employs a dual-compressor approach: a memory-enhanced compressor captures both short-term and long-term temporal relationships in videos and compresses the visual tokens using a multiscale transformer with a memory-cache mechanism, while a text-perceived compressor generates condensed visual tokens by utilizing Q-Former and integrating temporal contexts into query embeddings with cross attention. Experiments on several VideoQA datasets and comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that VidCompress efficiently models complex temporal-spatial relations and significantly outperforms existing Video-LLMs.

### ReDeEP: Detecting Hallucination in Retrieval-Augmented Generation via   Mechanistic Interpretability
**Authors**: Zhongxiang Sun, Xiaoxue Zang, Kai Zheng, Yang Song, Jun Xu, Xiao Zhang, Weijie Yu, Yang Song, Han Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T09:02:09Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models are designed to incorporate external knowledge, reducing hallucinations caused by insufficient parametric (internal) knowledge. However, even with accurate and relevant retrieved content, RAG models can still produce hallucinations by generating outputs that conflict with the retrieved information. Detecting such hallucinations requires disentangling how Large Language Models (LLMs) utilize external and parametric knowledge. Current detection methods often focus on one of these mechanisms or without decoupling their intertwined effects, making accurate detection difficult. In this paper, we investigate the internal mechanisms behind hallucinations in RAG scenarios. We discover hallucinations occur when the Knowledge FFNs in LLMs overemphasize parametric knowledge in the residual stream, while Copying Heads fail to effectively retain or integrate external knowledge from retrieved content. Based on these findings, we propose ReDeEP, a novel method that detects hallucinations by decoupling LLM's utilization of external context and parametric knowledge. Our experiments show that ReDeEP significantly improves RAG hallucination detection accuracy. Additionally, we introduce AARF, which mitigates hallucinations by modulating the contributions of Knowledge FFNs and Copying Heads.

### Mindalogue: LLM-Powered Nonlinear Interaction for Effective Learning and   Task Exploration
**Authors**: Rui Zhang, Ziyao Zhang, Fengliang Zhu, Jiajie Zhou, Anyi Rao

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T08:56:32Z

**Summary**: Current generative AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are widely used for knowledge dissemination, task decomposition, and creative thinking. However, their linear interaction methods often force users to repeatedly compare and copy contextual information when handling complex tasks, increasing cognitive load and operational costs. Moreover, the ambiguity in model responses requires users to refine and simplify the information further. To address these issues, we developed "Mindalogue", a system using a non-linear interaction model based on "nodes + canvas" to enhance user efficiency and freedom while generating structured responses. A formative study with 11 users informed the design of Mindalogue, which was then evaluated through a study with 16 participants. The results showed that Mindalogue significantly reduced task steps and improved users' comprehension of complex information. This study highlights the potential of non-linear interaction in improving AI tool efficiency and user experience in the HCI field.

### PMMT: Preference Alignment in Multilingual Machine Translation via LLM   Distillation
**Authors**: Shuqiao Sun, Yutong Yao, Peiwen Wu, Feijun Jiang, Kaifu Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T08:54:27Z

**Summary**: Translation is important for cross-language communication, and many efforts have been made to improve its accuracy. However, less investment is conducted in aligning translations with human preferences, such as translation tones or styles. In this paper, a new method is proposed to effectively generate large-scale multilingual parallel corpora with specific translation preferences using Large Language Models (LLMs). Meanwhile, an automatic pipeline is designed to distill human preferences into smaller Machine Translation (MT) models for efficiently and economically supporting large-scale calls in online services. Experiments indicate that the proposed method takes the lead in translation tasks with aligned human preferences by a large margin. Meanwhile, on popular public benchmarks like WMT and Flores, on which our models were not trained, the proposed method also shows a competitive performance compared to SOTA works.

### MoChat: Joints-Grouped Spatio-Temporal Grounding LLM for Multi-Turn   Motion Comprehension and Description
**Authors**: Jiawei Mo, Yixuan Chen, Rifen Lin, Yongkang Ni, Min Zeng, Xiping Hu, Min Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T08:49:59Z

**Summary**: Despite continuous advancements in deep learning for understanding human motion, existing models often struggle to accurately identify action timing and specific body parts, typically supporting only single-round interaction. Such limitations in capturing fine-grained motion details reduce their effectiveness in motion understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose MoChat, a multimodal large language model capable of spatio-temporal grounding of human motion and understanding multi-turn dialogue context. To achieve these capabilities, we group the spatial information of each skeleton frame based on human anatomical structure and then apply them with Joints-Grouped Skeleton Encoder, whose outputs are combined with LLM embeddings to create spatio-aware and temporal-aware embeddings separately. Additionally, we develop a pipeline for extracting timestamps from skeleton sequences based on textual annotations, and construct multi-turn dialogues for spatially grounding. Finally, various task instructions are generated for jointly training. Experimental results demonstrate that MoChat achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics in motion understanding tasks, making it as the first model capable of fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding of human motion.

### Efficient Data Generation for Source-grounded Information-seeking   Dialogs: A Use Case for Meeting Transcripts
**Authors**: Lotem Golany, Filippo Galgani, Maya Mamo, Nimrod Parasol, Omer Vandsburger, Nadav Bar, Ido Dagan

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T08:48:03Z

**Summary**: Automating data generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly popular. In this work, we investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-based data generation in the challenging setting of source-grounded information-seeking dialogs, with response attribution, over long documents. Our source texts consist of long and noisy meeting transcripts, adding to the task complexity. Since automating attribution remains difficult, we propose a semi-automatic approach: dialog queries and responses are generated with LLMs, followed by human verification and identification of attribution spans. Using this approach, we created MISeD -- Meeting Information Seeking Dialogs dataset -- a dataset of information-seeking dialogs focused on meeting transcripts. Models finetuned with MISeD demonstrate superior performance compared to off-the-shelf models, even those of larger size. Finetuning on MISeD gives comparable response generation quality to finetuning on fully manual data, while improving attribution quality and reducing time and effort.

### GraphCLIP: Enhancing Transferability in Graph Foundation Models for   Text-Attributed Graphs
**Authors**: Yun Zhu, Haizhou Shi, Xiaotang Wang, Yongchao Liu, Yaoke Wang, Boci Peng, Chuntao Hong, Siliang Tang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T08:45:35Z

**Summary**: Recently, research on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) has gained significant attention due to the prevalence of free-text node features in real-world applications and the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that bolster TAG methodologies. However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GraphCLIP in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, while evaluations across various downstream tasks confirm the versatility of GraphCLIP.

**Authors**: Zayd Muhammad Kawakibi Zuhri, Muhammad Farid Adilazuarda, Ayu Purwarianti, Alham Fikri Aji

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T08:45:18Z

**Summary**: Auto-regressive inference of transformers benefit greatly from Key-Value (KV) caching, but can lead to major memory bottlenecks as model size, batch size, and sequence length grow at scale. We introduce Multi-Layer Key-Value (MLKV) sharing, a novel approach extending KV sharing across transformer layers to reduce memory usage beyond what was possible with Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA). Evaluations on various NLP benchmarks and inference metrics using uptrained Pythia-160M variants demonstrate that MLKV significantly reduces memory usage with minimal performance loss, reducing KV cache size down to a factor of 6x compared to MQA. These results highlight MLKV's potential for efficient deployment of transformer models at scale. We provide code at https://github.com/zaydzuhri/pythia-mlkv

### Implementing Derivations of Definite Logic Programs with Self-Attention   Networks
**Authors**: Phan Thi Thanh Thuy, Akihiro Yamamoto

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T08:39:28Z

**Summary**: In this paper we propose that a restricted version of logical inference can be implemented with self-attention networks. We are aiming at showing that LLMs (Large Language Models) constructed with transformer networks can make logical inferences. We would reveal the potential of LLMs by analyzing self-attention networks, which are main components of transformer networks. Our approach is not based on semantics of natural languages but operations of logical inference. %point of view. We show that hierarchical constructions of self-attention networks with feed forward networks (FFNs) can implement top-down derivations for a class of logical formulae. We also show bottom-up derivations are also implemented for the same class. We believe that our results show that LLMs implicitly have the power of logical inference.

### LLM2Swarm: Robot Swarms that Responsively Reason, Plan, and Collaborate   through LLMs
**Authors**: Volker Strobel, Marco Dorigo, Mario Fritz

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T08:24:05Z

**Summary**: Robot swarms are composed of many simple robots that communicate and collaborate to fulfill complex tasks. Robot controllers usually need to be specified by experts on a case-by-case basis via programming code. This process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and unable to take into account all situations that may be encountered during deployment. On the other hand, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated reasoning and planning capabilities, introduced new ways to interact with and program machines, and represent domain and commonsense knowledge. Hence, we propose to address the aforementioned challenges by integrating LLMs with robot swarms and show the potential in proofs of concept (showcases). For this integration, we explore two approaches. The first approach is 'indirect integration,' where LLMs are used to synthesize and validate the robot controllers. This approach may reduce development time and human error before deployment. Moreover, during deployment, it could be used for on-the-fly creation of new robot behaviors. The second approach is 'direct integration,' where each robot locally executes a separate LLM instance during deployment for robot-robot collaboration and human-swarm interaction. These local LLM instances enable each robot to reason, plan, and collaborate using natural language. To enable further research on our mainly conceptual contribution, we release the software and videos for our LLM2Swarm system: https://github.com/Pold87/LLM2Swarm.

### Do LLMs Have the Generalization Ability in Conducting Causal Inference?
**Authors**: Chen Wang, Dongming Zhao, Bo Wang, Ruifang He, Yuexian Hou

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T08:23:31Z

**Summary**: In causal inference, generalization capability refers to the ability to conduct causal inference methods on new data to estimate the causal-effect between unknown phenomenon, which is crucial for expanding the boundaries of knowledge. Studies have evaluated the causal inference capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) concerning known phenomena, yet the generalization capabilities of LLMs concerning unseen phenomena remain unexplored. In this paper, we selected four tasks: Causal Path Discovery (CP), Backdoor Adjustment (BA), Factual Inference (FI), and Counterfactual Inference (CI) as representatives of causal inference tasks. To generate evaluation questions about previously unseen phenomena in new data on the four tasks, we propose a benchmark generation framework, which employs randomly generated graphs and node names to formulate questions within hypothetical new causal scenarios. Based on this framework, we compile a benchmark dataset of varying levels of question complexity. We extensively tested the generalization capabilities of five leading LLMs across four tasks. Experiment results reveal that while LLMs exhibit good generalization performance in solving simple CP, FI, and complex CI questions, they encounter difficulties when tackling BA questions and face obvious performance fluctuations as the problem complexity changes. Furthermore, when the names of phenomena incorporate existing terms, even if these names are entirely novel, their generalization performance can still be hindered by interference from familiar terms.

### Survey and Evaluation of Converging Architecture in LLMs based on   Footsteps of Operations
**Authors**: Seongho Kim, Jihyun Moon, Juntaek Oh, Insu Choi, Joon-Sung Yang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T08:19:24Z

**Summary**: The advent of the Attention mechanism and Transformer architecture enables contextually natural text generation and compresses the burden of processing entire source information into singular vectors. Based on these two main ideas, model sizes gradually increases to accommodate more precise and comprehensive information, leading to the current state-of-the-art LLMs being very large, with parameters around 70 billion. As the model sizes are growing, the demand for substantial storage and computational capacity increases. This leads to the development of high-bandwidth memory and accelerators, as well as a variety of model architectures designed to meet these requirements. We note that LLM architectures have increasingly converged. This paper analyzes how these converged architectures perform in terms of layer configurations, operational mechanisms, and model sizes, considering various hyperparameter settings. In this paper, we conduct a concise survey of the history of LLMs by tracing the evolution of their operational improvements. Furthermore, we summarize the performance trends of LLMs under various hyperparameter settings using the RTX 6000, which features the state-of-the-art Ada Lovelace architecture. We conclude that even the same model can exhibit different behaviors depending on the hyperparameters or whether it is deployed in server or edge environments.

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T08:16:43Z

**Summary**: To facilitate natural and intuitive interactions with diverse user groups in real-world settings, social robots must be capable of addressing the varying requirements and expectations of these groups while adapting their behavior based on user feedback. While previous research often focuses on specific demographics, we present a novel framework for adaptive Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) that tailors interactions to different user groups and enables individual users to modulate interactions through both minor and major interruptions. Our primary contributions include the development of an adaptive, ROS-based HRI framework with an open-source code base. This framework supports natural interactions through advanced speech recognition and voice activity detection, and leverages a large language model (LLM) as a dialogue bridge. We validate the efficiency of our framework through module tests and system trials, demonstrating its high accuracy in age recognition and its robustness to repeated user inputs and plan changes.

### Achieving >97% on GSM8K: Deeply Understanding the Problems Makes LLMs   Better Solvers for Math Word Problems
**Authors**: Qihuang Zhong, Kang Wang, Ziyang Xu, Juhua Liu, Liang Ding, Bo Du

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T08:11:25Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has enhanced the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various reasoning tasks. However, CoT still falls short in dealing with complex math word problems, as it usually suffers from three pitfalls: semantic misunderstanding errors, calculation errors, and step-missing errors. Prior studies involve addressing the calculation errors and step-missing errors, but neglect the semantic misunderstanding errors, which is the major factor limiting the reasoning performance of LLMs. To this end, we propose a simple-yet-effective method, namely Deeply Understanding the Problems (DUP), to improve the LLMs' math problem-solving ability by addressing semantic misunderstanding errors. The core of our method is to encourage the LLMs to deeply understand the problems and extract the key problem-solving information used for better reasoning. Extensive experiments on 10 diverse reasoning benchmarks show that our DUP method consistently outperforms the other counterparts by a large margin. More encouragingly, DUP achieves a new SOTA result on the GSM8K benchmark, with an accuracy of 97.1% under the zero-shot setting.

### Learning from Imperfect Data: Towards Efficient Knowledge Distillation   of Autoregressive Language Models for Text-to-SQL
**Authors**: Qihuang Zhong, Kunfeng Chen, Liang Ding, Juhua Liu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T07:51:00Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in text-to-SQL, which involves translating natural language questions into SQL queries. However, current text-to-SQL LLMs are computationally expensive and challenging to deploy in real-world applications, highlighting the importance of compressing them. To achieve this goal, knowledge distillation (KD) is a common approach, which aims to distill the larger teacher model into a smaller student model. While numerous KD methods for autoregressive LLMs have emerged recently, it is still under-explored whether they work well in complex text-to-SQL scenarios. To this end, we conduct a series of analyses and reveal that these KD methods generally fall short in balancing performance and efficiency. In response to this problem, we propose to improve the KD with Imperfect Data, namely KID, which effectively boosts the performance without introducing much training budget. The core of KID is to efficiently mitigate the training-inference mismatch by simulating the cascading effect of inference in the imperfect training data. Extensive experiments on 5 text-to-SQL benchmarks show that, KID can not only achieve consistent and significant performance gains (up to +5.83% average score) across all model types and sizes, but also effectively improve the training efficiency.

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T07:50:34Z

**Summary**: Graph-structured data is prevalent in the real world. Recently, due to the powerful emergent capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in modeling graphs. The key to effectively applying LLMs on graphs is converting graph data into a format LLMs can comprehend. Graph-to-token approaches are popular in enabling LLMs to process graph information. They transform graphs into sequences of tokens and align them with text tokens through instruction tuning, where self-supervised instruction tuning helps LLMs acquire general knowledge about graphs, and supervised fine-tuning specializes LLMs for the downstream tasks on graphs. Despite their initial success, we find that existing methods have a misalignment between self-supervised tasks and supervised downstream tasks, resulting in negative transfer from self-supervised fine-tuning to downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose Graph Alignment Large Language Models (GALLM) to benefit from aligned task templates. In the self-supervised tuning stage, we introduce a novel text matching task using templates aligned with downstream tasks. In the task-specific tuning stage, we propose two category prompt methods that learn supervision information from additional explanation with further aligned templates. Experimental evaluations on four datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in supervised learning, multi-dataset generalizability, and particularly in zero-shot capability, highlighting the model's potential as a graph foundation model.

### MTL-LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation for Multi-Task Learning
**Authors**: Yaming Yang, Dilxat Muhtar, Yelong Shen, Yuefeng Zhan, Jianfeng Liu, Yujing Wang, Hao Sun, Denvy Deng, Feng Sun, Qi Zhang, Weizhu Chen, Yunhai Tong

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T07:48:55Z

**Summary**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has been widely employed for domain adaptation, with LoRA being one of the most prominent methods due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, in multi-task learning (MTL) scenarios, LoRA tends to obscure the distinction between tasks by projecting sparse high-dimensional features from different tasks into the same dense low-dimensional intrinsic space. This leads to task interference and suboptimal performance for LoRA and its variants. To tackle this challenge, we propose MTL-LoRA, which retains the advantages of low-rank adaptation while significantly enhancing multi-task learning capabilities. MTL-LoRA augments LoRA by incorporating additional task-adaptive parameters that differentiate task-specific information and effectively capture shared knowledge across various tasks within low-dimensional spaces. This approach enables large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on general corpus to adapt to different target task domains with a limited number of trainable parameters. Comprehensive experimental results, including evaluations on public academic benchmarks for natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and image-text understanding, as well as real-world industrial text Ads relevance datasets, demonstrate that MTL-LoRA outperforms LoRA and its various variants with comparable or even fewer learnable parameters in multitask learning.

### EAIRiskBench: Towards Evaluating Physical Risk Awareness for Task   Planning of Foundation Model-based Embodied AI Agents
**Authors**: Zihao Zhu, Bingzhe Wu, Zhengyou Zhang, Lei Han, Baoyuan Wu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T07:45:31Z

**Summary**: Embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) integrates advanced AI models into physical entities for real-world interaction. The emergence of foundation models as the "brain" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown promising results. However, the deployment of these agents in physical environments presents significant safety challenges. For instance, a housekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal container in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical safety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative. This study introduces EAIRiskBench, a novel framework for automated physical risk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent cooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety guidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate safety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EAIRiskDataset, comprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual and visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art foundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk rates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address these challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation strategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR, the improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness in EAI agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced safety measures in EAI systems and provide valuable insights for future research directions in developing safer embodied artificial intelligence system.

### Secure Stateful Aggregation: A Practical Protocol with Applications in   Differentially-Private Federated Learning
**Authors**: Marshall Ball, James Bell-Clark, Adria Gascon, Peter Kairouz, Sewoong Oh, Zhiye Xie

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T07:45:18Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in differentially private federated learning (DPFL) algorithms have found that using correlated noise across the rounds of federated learning (DP-FTRL) yields provably and empirically better accuracy than using independent noise (DP-SGD). While DP-SGD is well-suited to federated learning with a single untrusted central server using lightweight secure aggregation protocols, secure aggregation is not conducive to implementing modern DP-FTRL techniques without assuming a trusted central server. DP-FTRL based approaches have already seen widespread deployment in industry, albeit with a trusted central curator who provides and applies the correlated noise. To realize a fully private, single untrusted server DP-FTRL federated learning protocol, we introduce secure stateful aggregation: a simple append-only data structure that allows for the private storage of aggregate values and reading linear functions of the aggregates. Assuming Ring Learning with Errors, we provide a lightweight and scalable realization of this protocol for high-dimensional data in a new security/resource model, Federated MPC : where a powerful persistent server interacts with weak, ephemeral clients. We observe that secure stateful aggregation suffices for realizing DP-FTRL-based private federated learning: improving DPFL utility guarantees over the state of the art while maintaining privacy with an untrusted central party. Our approach has minimal overhead relative to existing techniques which do not yield comparable utility. The secure stateful aggregation primitive and the federated MPC paradigm may be of interest for other practical applications.

### Ouroboros: Generating Longer Drafts Phrase by Phrase for Faster   Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Weilin Zhao, Yuxiang Huang, Xu Han, Wang Xu, Chaojun Xiao, Xinrong Zhang, Yewei Fang, Kaihuo Zhang, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T07:43:51Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding is a widely used method that accelerates the generation process of large language models (LLMs) with no compromise in model performance. It achieves this goal by using an existing smaller model for drafting and then employing the target LLM to verify the draft in a low-cost parallel manner. Under such a drafting-verification framework, drafting efficiency has become a bottleneck in the final speedup of speculative decoding. Therefore, generating longer drafts at less cost can lead to better decoding speedup. To achieve this, we introduce Ouroboros, which can generate draft phrases to parallelize the drafting process and meanwhile lengthen drafts in a training-free manner. The experimental results on various typical text generation tasks show that Ouroboros can achieve speedups of up to $2.8\times$ over speculative decoding and $3.9\times$ over vanilla decoding, without fine-tuning draft and target models. The source code of Ouroboros is available at https://github.com/thunlp/Ouroboros.

### LargePiG: Your Large Language Model is Secretly a Pointer Generator
**Authors**: Zhongxiang Sun, Zihua Si, Xiaoxue Zang, Kai Zheng, Yang Song, Xiao Zhang, Jun Xu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T07:41:40Z

**Summary**: Recent research on query generation has focused on using Large Language Models (LLMs), which despite bringing state-of-the-art performance, also introduce issues with hallucinations in the generated queries. In this work, we introduce relevance hallucination and factuality hallucination as a new typology for hallucination problems brought by query generation based on LLMs. We propose an effective way to separate content from form in LLM-generated queries, which preserves the factual knowledge extracted and integrated from the inputs and compiles the syntactic structure, including function words, using the powerful linguistic capabilities of the LLM. Specifically, we introduce a model-agnostic and training-free method that turns the Large Language Model into a Pointer-Generator (LargePiG), where the pointer attention distribution leverages the LLM's inherent attention weights, and the copy probability is derived from the difference between the vocabulary distribution of the model's high layers and the last layer. To validate the effectiveness of LargePiG, we constructed two datasets for assessing the hallucination problems in query generation, covering both document and video scenarios. Empirical studies on various LLMs demonstrated the superiority of LargePiG on both datasets. Additional experiments also verified that LargePiG could reduce hallucination in large vision language models and improve the accuracy of document-based question-answering and factuality evaluation tasks.
