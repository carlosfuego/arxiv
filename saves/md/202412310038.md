**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to their ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

### Multi-matrix Factorization Attention
**Authors**: Jingcheng Hu, Houyi Li, Yinmin Zhang, Zili Wang, Shuigeng Zhou, Xiangyu Zhang, Heung-Yeung Shum

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T15:45:45Z

**Summary**: We propose novel attention architectures, Multi-matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) and MFA-Key-Reuse (MFA-KR). Existing variants for standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA), including SOTA methods like MLA, fail to maintain as strong performance under stringent Key-Value cache (KV cache) constraints. MFA enhances model capacity by efficiently scaling up both the number and dimension of attention heads through low-rank matrix factorization in the Query-Key (QK) circuit. Extending MFA, MFA-KR further reduces memory requirements by repurposing the key cache as value through value projection re-parameterization. MFA's design enables strong model capacity when working under tight KV cache budget, while MFA-KR is suitable for even harsher KV cache limits with minor performance trade-off. Notably, in our extensive and large-scale experiments, the proposed architecture outperforms MLA and performs comparably to MHA, while reducing KV cache usage by up to 56% and 93.7%, respectively.

### Performance Characterization and Optimizations of Traditional ML   Applications
**Authors**: Harsh Kumar, R. Govindarajan

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T04:13:52Z

**Summary**: Even in the era of Deep Learning based methods, traditional machine learning methods with large data sets continue to attract significant attention. However, we find an apparent lack of a detailed performance characterization of these methods in the context of large training datasets. In this work, we study the system's behavior of a number of traditional ML methods as implemented in popular free software libraries/modules to identify critical performance bottlenecks experienced by these applications. The performance characterization study reveals several interesting insights on the performance of these applications. Then we evaluate the performance benefits of applying some well-known optimizations at the levels of caches and the main memory. More specifically, we test the usefulness of optimizations such as (i) software prefetching to improve cache performance and (ii) data layout and computation reordering optimizations to improve locality in DRAM accesses. These optimizations are implemented as modifications to the well-known scikit-learn library, and hence can be easily leveraged by application programmers. We evaluate the impact of the proposed optimizations using a combination of simulation and execution on a real system. The software prefetching optimization results in performance benefits varying from 5.2%-27.1% on different ML applications while the data layout and computation reordering approaches yield 6.16%-28.0% performance improvement.

### XRFlux: Virtual Reality Benchmark for Edge Caching Systems
**Authors**: Nader Alfares, George Kesidis

**Updated**: 2024-12-25T18:36:21Z

**Summary**: We introduce a Unity based benchmark XRFlux for evaluating Virtual Reality (VR) delivery systems using edge-cloud caching. As VR applications and systems progress, the need to meet strict latency and Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements is increasingly evident. In the context of VR, traditional cloud architectures (e.g., remote AWS S3 for content delivery) often struggle to meet these demands, especially for users of the same application in different locations. With edge computing, resources are brought closer to users in efforts to reduce latency and improve QoEs. However, VR's dynamic nature, with changing fields of view (FoVs) and user synchronization requirements, creates various challenges for edge caching. We address the lack of suitable benchmarks and propose a framework that simulates multiuser VR scenarios while logging users' interaction with objects within their actual and predicted FoVs. The benchmark's activity log can then be played back through an edge cache to assess the resulting QoEs. This tool fills a gap by supporting research in the optimization of edge caching (and other edge-cloud functions) for VR streaming.

### Long-Range Tasks Using Short-Context LLMs: Incremental Reasoning With   Structured Memories
**Authors**: Dulhan Jayalath, James Bradley Wendt, Nicholas Monath, Sandeep Tata, Beliz Gunel

**Updated**: 2024-12-25T14:14:31Z

**Summary**: Long-range tasks require reasoning over long inputs. Existing solutions either need large compute budgets, training data, access to model weights, or use complex, task-specific approaches. We present PRISM, which alleviates these concerns by processing information as a stream of chunks, maintaining a structured in-context memory specified by a typed hierarchy schema. This approach demonstrates superior performance to baselines on diverse tasks while using at least 4x smaller contexts than long-context models. Moreover, PRISM is token-efficient. By producing short outputs and efficiently leveraging key-value (KV) caches, it achieves up to 54% cost reduction when compared to alternative short-context approaches. The method also scales down to tiny information chunks (e.g., 500 tokens) without increasing the number of tokens encoded or sacrificing quality. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to generate schemas to generalize our approach to new tasks with minimal effort.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Dual Feature Caching
**Authors**: Chang Zou, Evelyn Zhang, Runlin Guo, Haohang Xu, Conghui He, Xuming Hu, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-25T14:00:14Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the dominant methods in image and video generation yet still suffer substantial computational costs. As an effective approach for DiT acceleration, feature caching methods are designed to cache the features of DiT in previous timesteps and reuse them in the next timesteps, allowing us to skip the computation in the next timesteps. However, on the one hand, aggressively reusing all the features cached in previous timesteps leads to a severe drop in generation quality. On the other hand, conservatively caching only the features in the redundant layers or tokens but still computing the important ones successfully preserves the generation quality but results in reductions in acceleration ratios. Observing such a tradeoff between generation quality and acceleration performance, this paper begins by quantitatively studying the accumulated error from cached features. Surprisingly, we find that aggressive caching does not introduce significantly more caching errors in the caching step, and the conservative feature caching can fix the error introduced by aggressive caching. Thereby, we propose a dual caching strategy that adopts aggressive and conservative caching iteratively, leading to significant acceleration and high generation quality at the same time. Besides, we further introduce a V-caching strategy for token-wise conservative caching, which is compatible with flash attention and requires no training and calibration data.   Our codes have been released in Github: \textbf{Code: \href{https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/DuCa}{\texttt{\textcolor{cyan}{https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/DuCa}}}}

### Aspect-oriented Programming with Julia
**Authors**: Osamu Ishimura, Yoshihide Yoshimoto

**Updated**: 2024-12-25T11:59:17Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes integrating Aspect-oriented Programming (AOP) into Julia, a language widely used in scientific and High-Performance Computing (HPC). AOP enhances software modularity by encapsulating cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, caching, and parallelizing, into separate, reusable aspects. Leveraging Julia's powerful metaprogramming and abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation capabilities, we introduce AspectJulia, an AOP framework designed to operate within Julia's runtime environment as a package. AspectJulia enables developers to define and apply aspects seamlessly, leading to more modular, maintainable, and adaptable code. We detail the implementation of AspectJulia and present diverse use cases, ranging from HPC and scientific computing to business applications, demonstrating its effectiveness in managing cross-cutting concerns. This integration simplifies application development and improves the adaptability of existing Julia modules and packages, paving the way for more efficient and maintainable software systems.

### HashEvict: A Pre-Attention KV Cache Eviction Strategy using   Locality-Sensitive Hashing
**Authors**: Minghui Liu, Tahseen Rabbani, Tony O'Halloran, Ananth Sankaralingam, Mary-Anne Hartley, Brian Gravelle, Furong Huang, Cornelia Fermüller, Yiannis Aloimonos

**Updated**: 2024-12-24T13:04:45Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) use the key-value (KV) cache to significantly accelerate inference by storing the key and value embeddings of past tokens. However, this cache consumes significant GPU memory. In this work, we introduce HashEvict, an algorithm that uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to compress the KV cache. HashEvict quickly locates tokens in the cache that are cosine dissimilar to the current query token. This is achieved by computing the Hamming distance between binarized Gaussian projections of the current token query and cached token keys, with a projection length much smaller than the embedding dimension. We maintain a lightweight binary structure in GPU memory to facilitate these calculations. Unlike existing compression strategies that compute attention to determine token retention, HashEvict makes these decisions pre-attention, thereby reducing computational costs. Additionally, HashEvict is dynamic - at every decoding step, the key and value of the current token replace the embeddings of a token expected to produce the lowest attention score. We demonstrate that HashEvict can compress the KV cache by 30%-70% while maintaining high performance across reasoning, multiple-choice, long-context retrieval and summarization tasks.

### Development and Application of a Decentralized Domain Name Service
**Authors**: Guang Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-24T00:46:00Z

**Summary**: The current Domain Name System (DNS), as a core infrastructure of the internet, exhibits several shortcomings: its centralized architecture leads to censorship risks and single points of failure, making domain name resolution vulnerable to attacks. The lack of encryption in the resolution process exposes it to DNS hijacking and cache poisoning attacks. Additionally, the high operational costs limit participation and innovation among small to medium-sized users. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Decentralized Domain Name Service (DDNS) based on blockchain (Phicoin) and distributed storage (IPFS). By leveraging the immutability of blockchain and the content verification of IPFS, the system achieves decentralized storage and distribution of domain name records, eliminating the centralized dependencies of traditional DNS. With a block time of 15 seconds, the system supports rapid broadcasting of domain name updates, significantly improving resolution efficiency. The DDNS aims to serve as a complement or backup to the existing DNS system, providing a pollution-resistant, censorship-resistant, high-performance, and low-cost domain name resolution solution, offering a new technical path for the security and stability of the internet.

### Deliberation in Latent Space via Differentiable Cache Augmentation
**Authors**: Luyang Liu, Jonas Pfeiffer, Jiaxing Wu, Jun Xie, Arthur Szlam

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T18:02:25Z

**Summary**: Techniques enabling large language models (LLMs) to "think more" by generating and attending to intermediate reasoning steps have shown promise in solving complex problems. However, the standard approaches generate sequences of discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur significant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. In this work, we demonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that operates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the cache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of subsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss from the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself frozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end differentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its kv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate offline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the coprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra computation. We show experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder achieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens. Furthermore, even without any task-specific training, our experiments demonstrate that cache augmentation consistently reduces perplexity and improves performance across a range of reasoning-intensive tasks.

### A Reproducible Method for Mapping Electricity Transmission   Infrastructure for Space Weather Risk Assessment
**Authors**: Edward J. Oughton, Evan Alexander Peters, Dennies Bor, Noah Rivera, C. Trevor Gaunt, Robert Weigel

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T16:11:18Z

**Summary**: Space weather impact assessment is constrained by the lack of available asset information to undertake modeling of Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) in Extra High Voltage electricity infrastructure networks. The U.S. National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan identifies underutilized data as a central issue for improving risk assessment, motivating this research. Accurate GIC prediction is generally not possible without information on the electrical circuit, therefore we define a reproducible method based on open-source data, which enables risk analysts to collect their own substation component data. This process converts OpenStreetMap (OSM) substation locations to high-resolution, component-level mapping of electricity transmission assets by utilizing an innovative web-browser platform to facilitate component annotation. As a case study example, we convert an initial 1,313 high-voltage (>115 kV) substations to 52,273 substation components via Google Earth APIs utilizing low-altitude, satellite, and Streetview imagery. We find that a total of 41,642 substation components (79.6%) connect to the highest substation voltage levels (>345 kV) and are possibly susceptible to GIC, with a total of 7,949 transformers identified. Compared to the initial OSM baseline, we provide new detailed insights on voltage levels, line capacities, and substation configurations. Two validation workshops were undertaken to align the method and data with GIC assessment needs. The approach ensures consistency and rapid scalability, enabling users to quickly count components via a flexible web-browser application.

### Inter-Satellite Link-Enhanced Transmission Scheme Towards Aviation IoT   in SAGIN
**Authors**: Qian Chen, Chenyu Wu, Shuai Han, Weixiao Meng, Tony Q. S. Quek

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T14:40:26Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of the aviation Internet of Things (IoT) has positioned in-flight connectivity (IFC) as one of its critical applications. Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) are essential for ensuring the performance of IFC by enabling seamless and reliable connectivity. However, most existing research treats satellites merely as transparent forwarding nodes and overlooks their potential caching capabilities to enhance IFC data rates. In this article, we explore an IFC-oriented SAGIN where satellites and ground stations (GSs) work together to transmit content to airborne passengers, thereby facilitating airborne communication. By categorizing files into cached (instantly accessible via satellites) and non-cached files (available only through GSs), this article pioneers the integration of multiple inter-satellite links (ISLs) into the IFC framework, thus innovating the content delivery process for both types of files. To minimize the average delay of content delivery, we formulate the corresponding optimization problems: 1) For cached files, we propose an exact penalty-based method to determine the satellite association scheme. 2) For non-cached files, we present an efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization to jointly optimize satellite association and GS bandwidth allocation. Our proposed framework is low in complexity, paving the way for high-speed Internet connectivity for aviation passengers. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IFC framework for SAGIN.

**Authors**: Can Wang, Dianbo Sui, Bolin Zhang, Xiaoyu Liu, Jiabao Kang, Zhidong Qiao, Zhiying Tu

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T12:55:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in solving various natural language processing tasks and are now widely offered as services. LLM services enable users to accomplish tasks without requiring specialized knowledge, simply by paying service providers. However, numerous providers offer various LLM services with variations in pricing, latency, and performance. These factors are also affected by different invocation methods, such as the choice of context and the use of cache, which lead to unpredictable and uncontrollable service cost and quality. Consequently, utilizing various LLM services invocation methods to construct an effective (cost-saving, low-latency and high-performance) invocation strategy that best meets task demands becomes a pressing challenge. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of methods help LLM services to be invoked efficiently. Technically, we define the problem of constructing an effective LLM services invocation strategy, and based on this, propose a unified LLM service invocation framework. The framework classifies existing methods into four categories: input abstraction, semantic cache, solution design, and output enhancement, which can be used separately or jointly during the invocation life cycle. We discuss the methods in each category and compare them to provide valuable guidance for researchers. Finally, we emphasize the open challenges in this domain and shed light on future research.

### CALLIC: Content Adaptive Learning for Lossless Image Compression
**Authors**: Daxin Li, Yuanchao Bai, Kai Wang, Junjun Jiang, Xianming Liu, Wen Gao

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T10:41:18Z

**Summary**: Learned lossless image compression has achieved significant advancements in recent years. However, existing methods often rely on training amortized generative models on massive datasets, resulting in sub-optimal probability distribution estimation for specific testing images during encoding process. To address this challenge, we explore the connection between the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle and Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL), leading to the development of a novel content-adaptive approach for learned lossless image compression, dubbed CALLIC. Specifically, we first propose a content-aware autoregressive self-attention mechanism by leveraging convolutional gating operations, termed Masked Gated ConvFormer (MGCF), and pretrain MGCF on training dataset. Cache then Crop Inference (CCI) is proposed to accelerate the coding process. During encoding, we decompose pre-trained layers, including depth-wise convolutions, using low-rank matrices and then adapt the incremental weights on testing image by Rate-guided Progressive Fine-Tuning (RPFT). RPFT fine-tunes with gradually increasing patches that are sorted in descending order by estimated entropy, optimizing learning process and reducing adaptation time. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that CALLIC sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for learned lossless image compression.

### Fast and Live Model Auto Scaling with O(1) Host Caching
**Authors**: Dingyan Zhang, Haotian Wang, Yang Liu, Xingda Wei, Yizhou Shan, Rong Chen, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T03:38:46Z

**Summary**: Model autoscaling is the key mechanism to achieve serverless model-as-a-service, but it faces a fundamental trade-off between scaling speed and storage/memory usage to cache parameters, and cannot meet frequent scaling requirements across multiple hosts. The key problem is that data plane performance is slow, and scaled instances remain stopped while parameters are loading. We first show that data plane can be made fast with no/O(1) caching by loading parameters through the compute network between GPUs because: (1) its speed is comparable host cache and is underutilized; (2) scaling multiple instances requires no or O(1) caching with network-optimized multicast. Second, autoscaling can be made live by breaking the scaling abstraction from a coarse-grained instance-level to a fine-grained layer-level. This allows us to offload the layer computation from the overloaded serving instances to the scaled instance with cooperative execution, thus handles cases even when the compute network is not sufficiently fast. Our system BLITZSCALE reduces the serving tail latencies by up to 86% without caching, and we achieve comparable performance (or even better) to an optimal setup where all the parameters are cached at all the host for autoscaling.

### Semi-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Controllable Video-to-Music   Retrieval
**Authors**: Shanti Stewart, Gouthaman KV, Lie Lu, Andrea Fanelli

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T02:52:36Z

**Summary**: Content creators often use music to enhance their videos, from soundtracks in movies to background music in video blogs and social media content. However, identifying the best music for a video can be a difficult and time-consuming task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for automatically retrieving a matching music clip for a given video, and vice versa. Our approach leverages annotated music labels, as well as the inherent artistic correspondence between visual and music elements. Distinct from previous cross-modal music retrieval works, our method combines both self-supervised and supervised training objectives. We use self-supervised and label-supervised contrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video. We show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the supervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other music annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method enables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on self-supervised vs. label information at inference time. We evaluate the learned embeddings through a variety of video-to-music and music-to-video retrieval tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully combines self-supervised and supervised objectives and is effective for controllable music-video retrieval.

### Agile TLB Prefetching and Prediction Replacement Policy
**Authors**: Melkamu Mersha, Tsion Abay, Mingziem Bitewa, Gedare Bloom

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T00:46:53Z

**Summary**: Virtual-to-physical address translation is a critical performance bottleneck in paging-based virtual memory systems. The Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) accelerates address translation by caching frequently accessed mappings, but TLB misses lead to costly page walks. Hardware and software techniques address this challenge. Hardware approaches enhance TLB reach through system-level support, while software optimizations include TLB prefetching, replacement policies, superpages, and page size adjustments. Prefetching Page Table Entries (PTEs) for future accesses reduces bottlenecks but may incur overhead from incorrect predictions. Integrating an Agile TLB Prefetcher (ATP) with SBFP optimizes performance by leveraging page table locality and dynamically identifying essential free PTEs during page walks. Predictive replacement policies further improve TLB performance. Traditional LRU replacement is limited to near-instant references, while advanced policies like SRRIP, GHRP, SHiP, SDBP, and CHiRP enhance performance by targeting specific inefficiencies. CHiRP, tailored for L2 TLBs, surpasses other policies by leveraging control flow history to detect dead blocks, utilizing L2 TLB entries for learning instead of sampling. These integrated techniques collectively address key challenges in virtual memory management.

### MVREC: A General Few-shot Defect Classification Model Using Multi-View   Region-Context
**Authors**: Shuai Lyu, Fangjian Liao, Zeqi Ma, Rongchen Zhang, Dongmei Mo, Waikeung Wong

**Updated**: 2024-12-22T07:14:45Z

**Summary**: Few-shot defect multi-classification (FSDMC) is an emerging trend in quality control within industrial manufacturing. However, current FSDMC research often lacks generalizability due to its focus on specific datasets. Additionally, defect classification heavily relies on contextual information within images, and existing methods fall short of effectively extracting this information. To address these challenges, we propose a general FSDMC framework called MVREC, which offers two primary advantages: (1) MVREC extracts general features for defect instances by incorporating the pre-trained AlphaCLIP model. (2) It utilizes a region-context framework to enhance defect features by leveraging mask region input and multi-view context augmentation. Furthermore, Few-shot Zip-Adapter(-F) classifiers within the model are introduced to cache the visual features of the support set and perform few-shot classification. We also introduce MVTec-FS, a new FSDMC benchmark based on MVTec AD, which includes 1228 defect images with instance-level mask annotations and 46 defect types. Extensive experiments conducted on MVTec-FS and four additional datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in general defect classification and its ability to incorporate contextual information to improve classification performance.

**Authors**: Cunchen Hu, Heyang Huang, Junhao Hu, Jiang Xu, Xusheng Chen, Tao Xie, Chenxi Wang, Sa Wang, Yungang Bao, Ninghui Sun, Yizhou Shan

**Updated**: 2024-12-21T13:55:49Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) serving has transformed from stateless to stateful systems, utilizing techniques like context caching and disaggregated inference. These optimizations extend the lifespan and domain of the KV cache, necessitating a new architectural approach. We present MemServe, a unified system that integrates both inter-request and intra-request optimizations. MemServe introduces MemPool, an elastic memory pool managing distributed memory and KV caches across serving instances. Using MemPool APIs, MemServe combines context caching with disaggregated inference for the first time, supported by a global scheduler that enhances cache reuse through a global prompt tree-based locality-aware policy. Tests show that MemServe significantly improves job completion time and time-to-first-time.

### Parameterized Complexity of Caching in Networks
**Authors**: Robert Ganian, Fionn Mc Inerney, Dimitra Tsigkari

**Updated**: 2024-12-21T11:20:26Z

**Summary**: The fundamental caching problem in networks asks to find an allocation of contents to a network of caches with the aim of maximizing the cache hit rate. Despite the problem's importance to a variety of research areas -- including not only content delivery, but also edge intelligence and inference -- and the extensive body of work on empirical aspects of caching, very little is known about the exact boundaries of tractability for the problem beyond its general NP-hardness. We close this gap by performing a comprehensive complexity-theoretic analysis of the problem through the lens of the parameterized complexity paradigm, which is designed to provide more precise statements regarding algorithmic tractability than classical complexity. Our results include algorithmic lower and upper bounds which together establish the conditions under which the caching problem becomes tractable.

Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.

### SYMPHONY: Improving Memory Management for LLM Inference Workloads
**Authors**: Saurabh Agarwal, Anyong Mao, Aditya Akella, Shivaram Venkataraman

**Updated**: 2024-12-21T01:48:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in applications such as chatbots, code editors, and conversational agents. A key feature of LLMs is their ability to engage in multi-turn interactions with humans or external tools, enabling a wide range of tasks. Each new request in a multi-turn interaction depends on the intermediate state, specifically the key-value (K,V) caches, from previous requests in the ongoing interaction. Existing serving engines either recompute the K,V caches or offload them to main memory. Profiling reveals that recomputation can result in over 99% of processed tokens being redundant. On the other hand, offloading K,V caches from GPU memory makes inference serving stateful, leading to load imbalances across the cluster. To address these challenges, we developed SYMPHONY. SYMPHONY leverages the observation that multi-turn work loads provide additional hints that allow K,V caches to be migrated off the critical serving path. By utilizing these hints, SYMPHONY dynamically migrates K,V caches to enable finegrained scheduling of inference requests. Our experiments demonstrate that SYMPHONY can handle over 8x the number of requests compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with a similar latency profile.

### Multi-Strided Access Patterns to Boost Hardware Prefetching
**Authors**: Miguel O. Blom, Kristian F. D. Rietveld, Rob V. van Nieuwpoort

**Updated**: 2024-12-20T15:51:42Z

**Summary**: Important memory-bound kernels, such as linear algebra, convolutions, and stencils, rely on SIMD instructions as well as optimizations targeting improved vectorized data traversal and data re-use to attain satisfactory performance. On on temporary CPU architectures, the hardware prefetcher is of key importance for efficient utilization of the memory hierarchy. In this paper, we demonstrate that transforming a memory access pattern consisting of a single stride to one that concurrently accesses multiple strides, can boost the utilization of the hardware prefetcher, and in turn improves the performance of memory-bound kernels significantly. Using a set of micro-benchmarks, we establish that accessing memory in a multi-strided manner enables more cache lines to be concurrently brought into the cache, resulting in improved cache hit ratios and higher effective memory bandwidth without the introduction of costly software prefetch instructions. Subsequently, we show that multi-strided variants of a collection of six memory-bound dense compute kernels outperform state-of-the-art counterparts on three different micro-architectures. More specifically, for kernels among which Matrix Vector Multiplication, Convolution Stencil and kernels from PolyBench, we achieve significant speedups of up to 12.55x over Polly, 2.99x over MKL, 1.98x over OpenBLAS, 1.08x over Halide and 1.87x over OpenCV. The code transformation to take advantage of multi-strided memory access is a natural extension of the loop unroll and loop interchange techniques, allowing this method to be incorporated into compiler pipelines in the future.

### Towards Projected and Incremental Pseudo-Boolean Model Counting
**Authors**: Suwei Yang, Kuldeep S. Meel

**Updated**: 2024-12-20T15:18:44Z

**Summary**: Model counting is a fundamental task that involves determining the number of satisfying assignments to a logical formula, typically in conjunctive normal form (CNF). While CNF model counting has received extensive attention over recent decades, interest in Pseudo-Boolean (PB) model counting is just emerging partly due to the greater flexibility of PB formulas. As such, we observed feature gaps in existing PB counters such as a lack of support for projected and incremental settings, which could hinder adoption. In this work, our main contribution is the introduction of the PB model counter PBCount2, the first exact PB model counter with support for projected and incremental model counting. Our counter, PBCount2, uses our Least Occurrence Weighted Min Degree (LOW-MD) computation ordering heuristic to support projected model counting and a cache mechanism to enable incremental model counting. In our evaluations, PBCount2 completed at least 1.40x the number of benchmarks of competing methods for projected model counting and at least 1.18x of competing methods in incremental model counting.

### Don't Do RAG: When Cache-Augmented Generation is All You Need for   Knowledge Tasks
**Authors**: Brian J Chan, Chao-Ting Chen, Jui-Hung Cheng, Hen-Hsen Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-20T06:58:32Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful approach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.

### DroidSpeak: KV Cache Sharing for Cross-LLM Communication and Multi-LLM   Serving
**Authors**: Yuhan Liu, Yuyang Huang, Jiayi Yao, Zhuohan Gu, Kuntai Du, Hanchen Li, Yihua Cheng, Junchen Jiang, Shan Lu, Madan Musuvathi, Esha Choukse

**Updated**: 2024-12-19T23:52:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in complex workflows, where different LLMs and fine-tuned variants collaboratively address complex tasks. However, these systems face significant inefficiencies due to redundant context processing of the shared context. We propose DroidSpeak, a framework that optimizes context sharing between fine-tuned LLMs derived from the same foundational model. DroidSpeak identifies critical layers in the KV cache and selectively recomputes them, enabling effective reuse of intermediate data while maintaining high accuracy.   Our approach balances computational efficiency and task fidelity, significantly reducing inference latency and throughput bottlenecks. Experiments on diverse datasets and model pairs demonstrate that DroidSpeak achieves up to 3x higher throughputs and 2.6x faster prefill times with negligible accuracy loss compared to full recomputation.

### Exposing Shadow Branches
**Authors**: Chrysanthos Pepi, Bhargav Reddy Godala, Krishnam Tibrewala, Gino Chacon, Paul V. Gratz, Daniel A. Jiménez, Gilles A. Pokam, David I. August

**Updated**: 2024-12-19T22:34:37Z

**Summary**: Modern processors implement a decoupled front-end in the form of Fetch Directed Instruction Prefetching (FDIP) to avoid front-end stalls. FDIP is driven by the Branch Prediction Unit (BPU), relying on the BPU's accuracy and branch target tracking structures to speculatively fetch instructions into the Instruction Cache (L1I). As data center applications become more complex, their code footprints also grow, resulting in an increase in Branch Target Buffer (BTB) misses. FDIP can alleviate L1I cache misses, but when it encounters a BTB miss, the BPU may not identify the current instruction as a branch to FDIP. This can prevent FDIP from prefetching or cause it to speculate down the wrong path, further polluting the L1I cache. We observe that the vast majority, 75%, of BTB-missing, unidentified branches are actually present in instruction cache lines that FDIP has previously fetched but, these missing branches have not yet been decoded and inserted into the BTB. This is because the instruction line is decoded from an entry point (which is the target of the previous taken branch) till an exit point (the taken branch). Branch instructions present in the ignored portion of the cache line we call them "Shadow Branches". Here we present Skeia, a novel shadow branch decoding technique that identifies and decodes unused bytes in cache lines fetched by FDIP, inserting them into a Shadow Branch Buffer (SBB). The SBB is accessed in parallel with the BTB, allowing FDIP to speculate despite a BTB miss. With a minimal storage state of 12.25KB, Skeia delivers a geomean speedup of ~5.7% over an 8K-entry BTB (78KB) and ~2% versus adding an equal amount of state to the BTB across 16 front-end bound applications. Since many branches stored in the SBB are unique compared to those in a similarly sized BTB, we consistently observe greater performance gains with Skeia across all examined sizes until saturation.

### DynamicKV: Task-Aware Adaptive KV Cache Compression for Long Context   LLMs
**Authors**: Xiabin Zhou, Wenbin Wang, Minyan Zeng, Jiaxian Guo, Xuebo Liu, Li Shen, Min Zhang, Liang Ding

**Updated**: 2024-12-19T13:28:42Z

**Summary**: Efficient KV cache management in LLMs is crucial for long-context tasks like RAG and summarization. Existing KV cache compression methods enforce a fixed pattern, neglecting task-specific characteristics and reducing the retention of essential information. However, we observe distinct activation patterns across layers in various tasks, highlighting the need for adaptive strategies tailored to each task's unique demands. Based on this insight, we propose DynamicKV, a method that dynamically optimizes token retention by adjusting the number of tokens retained at each layer to adapt to the specific task. DynamicKV establishes global and per-layer maximum KV cache budgets, temporarily retaining the maximum budget for the current layer, and periodically updating the KV cache sizes of all preceding layers during inference. Our method retains only 1.7% of the KV cache size while achieving ~85% of the Full KV cache performance on LongBench. Notably, even under extreme compression (0.9%), DynamicKV surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 11% in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. The code will be released.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Token-wise Feature Caching
**Authors**: Chang Zou, Xuyang Liu, Ting Liu, Siteng Huang, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-19T12:38:23Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.

### Nemesis: Noise-randomized Encryption with Modular Efficiency and Secure   Integration in Machine Learning Systems
**Authors**: Dongfang Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T22:52:12Z

**Summary**: Machine learning (ML) systems that guarantee security and privacy often rely on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) as a cornerstone technique, enabling computations on encrypted data without exposing sensitive information. However, a critical limitation of FHE is its computational inefficiency, making it impractical for large-scale applications. In this work, we propose \textit{Nemesis}, a framework that accelerates FHE-based systems without compromising accuracy or security. The design of Nemesis is inspired by Rache (SIGMOD'23), which introduced a caching mechanism for encrypted integers and scalars. Nemesis extends this idea with more advanced caching techniques and mathematical tools, enabling efficient operations over multi-slot FHE schemes and overcoming Rache's limitations to support general plaintext structures. We formally prove the security of Nemesis under standard cryptographic assumptions and evaluate its performance extensively on widely used datasets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10. Experimental results show that Nemesis significantly reduces the computational overhead of FHE-based ML systems, paving the way for broader adoption of privacy-preserving technologies.

### ResQ: Mixed-Precision Quantization of Large Language Models with   Low-Rank Residuals
**Authors**: Utkarsh Saxena, Sayeh Sharify, Kaushik Roy, Xin Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T22:01:55Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) of large language models (LLMs) holds the promise in reducing the prohibitive computational cost at inference time. Quantization of all weight, activation and key-value (KV) cache tensors to 4-bit without significantly degrading generalizability is challenging, due to the high quantization error caused by extreme outliers in activations. To tackle this problem, we propose ResQ, a PTQ method that pushes further the state-of-the-art. By means of principal component analysis (PCA), it identifies a low-rank subspace (in practice 1/8 of the hidden dimension) in which activation variances are highest, and keep the coefficients within this subspace in high precision, e.g. 8-bit, while quantizing the rest to 4-bit. Within each subspace, invariant random rotation is applied to further suppress outliers. We show that this is a provably optimal mixed precision quantization scheme that minimizes error. With the Llama families of models, we demonstrate that ResQ outperforms recent uniform and mixed precision PTQ methods on a variety of benchmarks, achieving up to 33% lower perplexity on Wikitext than the next best method SpinQuant, and a 2.4x speedup over 16-bit baseline. Code is available at https://github.com/utkarsh-dmx/project-resq.

### Optimizing ML Concurrent Computation and Communication with GPU DMA   Engines
**Authors**: Anirudha Agrawal, Shaizeen Aga, Suchita Pati, Mahzabeen Islam

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T21:09:08Z

**Summary**: Concurrent computation and communication (C3) is a pervasive paradigm in ML and other domains, making its performance optimization crucial. In this paper, we carefully characterize C3 in ML on GPUs, which are most widely deployed for ML training and inference. We observe that while C3 leads to performance uplifts, the uplifts are far lower than ideal speedups (serial computation and communication versus maximum of computation or communication; all times from isolated executions). C3 on average achieves only 21% of ideal speedup, this is due to known challenges of compute and memory interference between concurrent GPU kernels (that is, sharing of GPU's compute units, caches and HBM).   To attain better performance for C3, first, we evaluate dual strategies of schedule prioritization and careful resource partitioning of compute units on GPUs to push performance attained with C3 (on average 42% of ideal speedup). We also provide heuristics that can guide a runtime while employing these strategies. To further enhance C3 performance, we propose to mitigate C3 interference by offloading communication tasks to the GPU's DMA engines. To this end, we build Concurrent Communication CoLlectives (ConCCL) proof-of-concepts that harness DMA engines for communication. We show how ConCCL considerably closes the gap between realized and ideal speedup for C3 (on average 72% of ideal speedup is realized, up to 1.67x speedup). Overall, our work makes a strong case for GPU DMA engine advancements to better support C3 on GPUs.

### MagicPIG: LSH Sampling for Efficient LLM Generation
**Authors**: Zhuoming Chen, Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Zihao Ye, Yang Zhou, Jianyu Zhang, Niklas Nolte, Yuandong Tian, Matthijs Douze, Leon Bottou, Zhihao Jia, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T17:36:36Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with long context windows have gained significant attention. However, the KV cache, stored to avoid re-computation, becomes a bottleneck. Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself suffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention is not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding throughput by up to $5\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 54ms decoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a context of 96k tokens. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/MagicPIG.

### Rehearsal-Free Continual Federated Learning with Synergistic   Regularization
**Authors**: Yichen Li, Yuying Wang, Tianzhe Xiao, Haozhao Wang, Yining Qi, Ruixuan Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T12:16:41Z

**Summary**: Continual Federated Learning (CFL) allows distributed devices to collaboratively learn novel concepts from continuously shifting training data while avoiding knowledge forgetting of previously seen tasks. To tackle this challenge, most current CFL approaches rely on extensive rehearsal of previous data. Despite effectiveness, rehearsal comes at a cost to memory, and it may also violate data privacy. Considering these, we seek to apply regularization techniques to CFL by considering their cost-efficient properties that do not require sample caching or rehearsal. Specifically, we first apply traditional regularization techniques to CFL and observe that existing regularization techniques, especially synaptic intelligence, can achieve promising results under homogeneous data distribution but fail when the data is heterogeneous. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective regularization algorithm for CFL named FedSSI, which tailors the synaptic intelligence for the CFL with heterogeneous data settings. FedSSI can not only reduce computational overhead without rehearsal but also address the data heterogeneity issue. Extensive experiments show that FedSSI achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Semantic Convergence: Harmonizing Recommender Systems via Two-Stage   Alignment and Behavioral Semantic Tokenization
**Authors**: Guanghan Li, Xun Zhang, Yufei Zhang, Yifan Yin, Guojun Yin, Wei Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T12:07:58Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs), endowed with exceptional reasoning capabilities, are adept at discerning profound user interests from historical behaviors, thereby presenting a promising avenue for the advancement of recommendation systems. However, a notable discrepancy persists between the sparse collaborative semantics typically found in recommendation systems and the dense token representations within LLMs. In our study, we propose a novel framework that harmoniously merges traditional recommendation models with the prowess of LLMs. We initiate this integration by transforming ItemIDs into sequences that align semantically with the LLMs space, through the proposed Alignment Tokenization module. Additionally, we design a series of specialized supervised learning tasks aimed at aligning collaborative signals with the subtleties of natural language semantics. To ensure practical applicability, we optimize online inference by pre-caching the top-K results for each user, reducing latency and improving effciency. Extensive experimental evidence indicates that our model markedly improves recall metrics and displays remarkable scalability of recommendation systems.

### DyCoke: Dynamic Compression of Tokens for Fast Video Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Keda Tao, Can Qin, Haoxuan You, Yang Sui, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T09:47:25Z

**Summary**: Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.

### SCOPE: Optimizing Key-Value Cache Compression in Long-context Generation
**Authors**: Jialong Wu, Zhenglin Wang, Linhai Zhang, Yilong Lai, Yulan He, Deyu Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T09:27:33Z

**Summary**: Key-Value (KV) cache has become a bottleneck of LLMs for long-context generation. Despite the numerous efforts in this area, the optimization for the decoding phase is generally ignored. However, we believe such optimization is crucial, especially for long-output generation tasks based on the following two observations: (i) Excessive compression during the prefill phase, which requires specific full context impairs the comprehension of the reasoning task; (ii) Deviation of heavy hitters occurs in the reasoning tasks with long outputs. Therefore, SCOPE, a simple yet efficient framework that separately performs KV cache optimization during the prefill and decoding phases, is introduced. Specifically, the KV cache during the prefill phase is preserved to maintain the essential information, while a novel strategy based on sliding is proposed to select essential heavy hitters for the decoding phase. Memory usage and memory transfer are further optimized using adaptive and discontinuous strategies. Extensive experiments on LongGenBench show the effectiveness and generalization of SCOPE and its compatibility as a plug-in to other prefill-only KV compression methods.

### ZipVL: Efficient Large Vision-Language Models with Dynamic Token   Sparsification
**Authors**: Yefei He, Feng Chen, Jing Liu, Wenqi Shao, Hong Zhou, Kaipeng Zhang, Bohan Zhuang

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T07:45:11Z

**Summary**: The efficiency of large vision-language models (LVLMs) is constrained by the computational bottleneck of the attention mechanism during the prefill phase and the memory bottleneck of fetching the key-value (KV) cache in the decoding phase, particularly in scenarios involving high-resolution images or videos. Visual content often exhibits substantial redundancy, resulting in highly sparse attention maps within LVLMs. This sparsity can be leveraged to accelerate attention computation or compress the KV cache through various approaches. However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these bottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity concerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an efficient inference framework designed for LVLMs through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform sparse attention mechanism solely on those important tokens, reducing the latency in the prefill phase. Tokens deemed less important will be discarded to reduce KV cache size, alleviating the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase. Our experiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by 2.3$\times$ and improve decoding throughput by 2.8$\times$, with a minimal accuracy reduction of only 0.5\% on VQAv2 benchmark over LLaVA-Next-13B model, effectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.

### Vivar: A Generative AR System for Intuitive Multi-Modal Sensor Data   Presentation
**Authors**: Yunqi Guo, Kaiyuan Hou, Heming Fu, Hongkai Chen, Zhenyu Yan, Guoliang Xing, Xiaofan Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T05:16:11Z

**Summary**: Understanding sensor data can be challenging for non-experts because of the complexity and unique semantic meanings of sensor modalities. This calls for intuitive and effective methods to present sensor information. However, creating intuitive sensor data visualizations presents three key challenges: the variability of sensor readings, gaps in domain comprehension, and the dynamic nature of sensor data. To address these issues, we develop Vivar, a novel AR system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D volumetric content for visualization. In particular, we introduce a cross-modal embedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual embedding space through barycentric interpolation. This allows for accurate and continuous integration of multi-modal sensor information. Vivar also incorporates sensor-aware AR scene generation using foundation models and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) without requiring domain expertise. In addition, Vivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR content generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system achieves 11$\times$ latency reduction without compromising quality. A user study involving over 485 participants, including domain experts, demonstrates Vivar's effectiveness in accuracy, consistency, and real-world applicability, paving the way for more intuitive sensor data visualization.

### Boosting Long-Context Management via Query-Guided Activation Refilling
**Authors**: Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang, Zhicheng Dou, Defu Lian

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T05:08:39Z

**Summary**: Processing long contexts poses a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to their inherent context-window limitations and the computational burden of extensive key-value (KV) activations, which severely impact efficiency. For information-seeking tasks, full context perception is often unnecessary, as a query's information needs can dynamically range from localized details to a global perspective, depending on its complexity. However, existing methods struggle to adapt effectively to these dynamic information needs.   In the paper, we propose a method for processing long-context information-seeking tasks via query-guided Activation Refilling (ACRE). ACRE constructs a Bi-layer KV Cache for long contexts, where the layer-1 (L1) cache compactly captures global information, and the layer-2 (L2) cache provides detailed and localized information. ACRE establishes a proxying relationship between the two caches, allowing the input query to attend to the L1 cache and dynamically refill it with relevant entries from the L2 cache. This mechanism integrates global understanding with query-specific local details, thus improving answer decoding. Experiments on a variety of long-context information-seeking datasets demonstrate ACRE's effectiveness, achieving improvements in both performance and efficiency.

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.

### Dynamic-LLaVA: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models via Dynamic   Vision-language Context Sparsification
**Authors**: Wenxuan Huang, Zijie Zhai, Yunhang Shen, Shaosheng Cao, Fei Zhao, Xiangfeng Xu, Zheyu Ye, Shaohui Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T14:45:12Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines.

**Authors**: Moritz Reuss, Jyothish Pari, Pulkit Agrawal, Rudolf Lioutikov

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T14:34:51Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Policies have become widely used in Imitation Learning, offering several appealing properties, such as generating multimodal and discontinuous behavior. As models are becoming larger to capture more complex capabilities, their computational demands increase, as shown by recent scaling laws. Therefore, continuing with the current architectures will present a computational roadblock. To address this gap, we propose Mixture-of-Denoising Experts (MoDE) as a novel policy for Imitation Learning. MoDE surpasses current state-of-the-art Transformer-based Diffusion Policies while enabling parameter-efficient scaling through sparse experts and noise-conditioned routing, reducing both active parameters by 40% and inference costs by 90% via expert caching. Our architecture combines this efficient scaling with noise-conditioned self-attention mechanism, enabling more effective denoising across different noise levels. MoDE achieves state-of-the-art performance on 134 tasks in four established imitation learning benchmarks (CALVIN and LIBERO). Notably, by pretraining MoDE on diverse robotics data, we achieve 4.01 on CALVIN ABC and 0.95 on LIBERO-90. It surpasses both CNN-based and Transformer Diffusion Policies by an average of 57% across 4 benchmarks, while using 90% fewer FLOPs and fewer active parameters compared to default Diffusion Transformer architectures. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablations on MoDE's components, providing insights for designing efficient and scalable Transformer architectures for Diffusion Policies. Code and demonstrations are available at https://mbreuss.github.io/MoDE_Diffusion_Policy/.

### ZoRI: Towards Discriminative Zero-Shot Remote Sensing Instance   Segmentation
**Authors**: Shiqi Huang, Shuting He, Bihan Wen

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T11:00:56Z

**Summary**: Instance segmentation algorithms in remote sensing are typically based on conventional methods, limiting their application to seen scenarios and closed-set predictions. In this work, we propose a novel task called zero-shot remote sensing instance segmentation, aimed at identifying aerial objects that are absent from training data. Challenges arise when classifying aerial categories with high inter-class similarity and intra-class variance. Besides, the domain gap between vision-language models' pretraining datasets and remote sensing datasets hinders the zero-shot capabilities of the pretrained model when it is directly applied to remote sensing images. To address these challenges, we propose a $\textbf{Z}$ero-Sh$\textbf{o}$t $\textbf{R}$emote Sensing $\textbf{I}$nstance Segmentation framework, dubbed $\textbf{ZoRI}$. Our approach features a discrimination-enhanced classifier that uses refined textual embeddings to increase the awareness of class disparities. Instead of direct fine-tuning, we propose a knowledge-maintained adaptation strategy that decouples semantic-related information to preserve the pretrained vision-language alignment while adjusting features to capture remote sensing domain-specific visual cues. Additionally, we introduce a prior-injected prediction with cache bank of aerial visual prototypes to supplement the semantic richness of text embeddings and seamlessly integrate aerial representations, adapting to the remote sensing domain. We establish new experimental protocols and benchmarks, and extensive experiments convincingly demonstrate that ZoRI achieves the state-of-art performance on the zero-shot remote sensing instance segmentation task. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuangShiqi128/ZoRI.

### More Tokens, Lower Precision: Towards the Optimal Token-Precision   Trade-off in KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Jiebin Zhang, Dawei Zhu, Yifan Song, Wenhao Wu, Chuqiao Kuang, Xiaoguang Li, Lifeng Shang, Qun Liu, Sujian Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T09:20:31Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) process increasing context windows, the memory usage of KV cache has become a critical bottleneck during inference. The mainstream KV compression methods, including KV pruning and KV quantization, primarily focus on either token or precision dimension and seldom explore the efficiency of their combination. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the token-precision trade-off in KV cache compression. Experiments demonstrate that storing more tokens in the KV cache with lower precision, i.e., quantized pruning, can significantly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs. Furthermore, in-depth analysis regarding token-precision trade-off from a series of key aspects exhibit that, quantized pruning achieves substantial improvements in retrieval-related tasks and consistently performs well across varying input lengths. Moreover, quantized pruning demonstrates notable stability across different KV pruning methods, quantization strategies, and model scales. These findings provide valuable insights into the token-precision trade-off in KV cache compression. We plan to release our code in the near future.

### FiRST: Finetuning Router-Selective Transformers for Input-Adaptive   Latency Reduction
**Authors**: Akriti Jain, Saransh Sharma, Koyel Mukherjee, Soumyabrata Pal

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T09:11:47Z

**Summary**: Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across different domains such as vision and language processing. However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit, and 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on tasks. Extensive experiments show that FiRST significantly reduces latency while outperforming other layer selection strategies in quality metics. It retains competitive performance to base model (without layer skipping) and in some cases, even improves upon it. FiRST is thus a promising and efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.

### TurboAttention: Efficient Attention Approximation For High Throughputs   LLMs
**Authors**: Hao Kang, Srikant Bharadwaj, James Hensman, Tushar Krishna, Victor Ruhle, Saravan Rajmohan

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T05:40:09Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) inference demands significant amount of computation and memory, especially in the key attention mechanism. While techniques, such as quantization and acceleration algorithms, like FlashAttention, have improved efficiency of the overall inference, they address different aspects of the problem: quantization focuses on weight-activation operations, while FlashAttention improves execution but requires high-precision formats. Recent Key-value (KV) cache quantization reduces memory bandwidth but still needs floating-point dequantization for attention operation.   We present TurboAttention, a comprehensive approach to enable quantized execution of attention that simultaneously addresses both memory and computational efficiency. Our solution introduces two key innovations: FlashQ, a headwise attention quantization technique that enables both compression of KV cache and quantized execution of activation-activation multiplication, and Sparsity-based Softmax Approximation (SAS), which eliminates the need for dequantization to FP32 during exponentiation operation in attention. Experimental results demonstrate that TurboAttention achieves 1.2-1.8x speedup in attention, reduces the KV cache size by over 4.4x, and enables up to 2.37x maximum throughput over the FP16 baseline while outperforming state-of-the-art quantization and compression techniques across various datasets and models.

### Personalized Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning for Heterogeneous   Edge Content Caching Networks
**Authors**: Zhen Li, Tan Li, Hai Liu, Tse-Tin Chan

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T05:09:45Z

**Summary**: Proactive caching is essential for minimizing latency and improving Quality of Experience (QoE) in multi-server edge networks. Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL) is a promising approach for developing cache policies tailored to dynamic content requests. However, FDRL faces challenges such as an expanding caching action space due to increased content numbers and difficulty in adapting global information to heterogeneous edge environments. In this paper, we propose a Personalized Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for Caching, called PF-DRL-Ca, with the aim to maximize system utility while satisfying caching capability constraints. To manage the expanding action space, we employ a new DRL algorithm, Multi-head Deep Q-Network (MH-DQN), which reshapes the action output layers of DQN into a multi-head structure where each head generates a sub-dimensional action. We next integrate the proposed MH-DQN into a personalized federated training framework, employing a layer-wise approach for training to derive a personalized model that can adapt to heterogeneous environments while exploiting the global information to accelerate learning convergence. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MH-DQN over traditional DRL algorithms on a single server, as well as the advantages of the personal federated training architecture compared to other frameworks.

### A System for Microserving of LLMs
**Authors**: Hongyi Jin, Ruihang Lai, Charlie F. Ruan, Yingcheng Wang, Todd C. Mowry, Xupeng Miao, Zhihao Jia, Tianqi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T02:44:43Z

**Summary**: The recent advances in LLMs bring a strong demand for efficient system support to improve overall serving efficiency. As LLM inference scales towards multiple GPUs and even multiple compute nodes, various coordination patterns, such as prefill-decode disaggregation and context migration, arise in serving systems. Most inference services today expose a coarse-grained request-level API with a pre-configured coordination strategy, limiting the ability to customize and dynamically reconfigure the coordination. In this paper, we propose LLM microserving, a multi-level architecture for structuring and programming LLM inference services. We introduces simple yet effective microserving APIs to support fine-grained sub-request level actions. A programmable router transforms user requests into sub-request calls, enabling the dynamic reconfiguration of serving patterns. To support diverse execution patterns, we develop a unified KV cache interface that handles various KV compute, transfer, and reuse scenarios. Our evaluation shows that LLM microserving can be reconfigured to support multiple disaggregation orchestration strategies in a few lines of Python code while maintaining state-of-the-art performance for LLM inference tasks. Additionally, it allows us to explore new strategy variants that reduce up to 47% of job completion time compared to the existing strategies.

**Authors**: Xuan Shen, Zhao Song, Yufa Zhou, Bo Chen, Yanyu Li, Yifan Gong, Kai Zhang, Hao Tan, Jason Kuen, Henghui Ding, Zhihao Shu, Wei Niu, Pu Zhao, Yanzhi Wang, Jiuxiang Gu

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T01:12:35Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the preeminent models for a wide array of generative tasks, demonstrating superior performance and efficacy across various applications. The promising results come at the cost of slow inference, as each denoising step requires running the whole transformer model with a large amount of parameters. In this paper, we show that performing the full computation of the model at each diffusion step is unnecessary, as some computations can be skipped by lazily reusing the results of previous steps. Furthermore, we show that the lower bound of similarity between outputs at consecutive steps is notably high, and this similarity can be linearly approximated using the inputs. To verify our demonstrations, we propose the \textbf{LazyDiT}, a lazy learning framework that efficiently leverages cached results from earlier steps to skip redundant computations. Specifically, we incorporate lazy learning layers into the model, effectively trained to maximize laziness, enabling dynamic skipping of redundant computations. Experimental results show that LazyDiT outperforms the DDIM sampler across multiple diffusion transformer models at various resolutions. Furthermore, we implement our method on mobile devices, achieving better performance than DDIM with similar latency.

### The Selection Problem in Multi-Query Optimization: a Comprehensive   Survey
**Authors**: Sergey Zinchenko, Denis Ponomaryov

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:49:32Z

**Summary**: View materialization, index selection, and plan caching are well-known techniques for optimization of query processing in database systems. The essence of these tasks is to select and save a subset of the most useful candidates (views/indexes/plans) for reuse within given space/time budget constraints. In this paper, based on the View Selection Problem, we propose a unified view on these problems. We identify the root causes of the complexity of these selection problems and provide a detailed analysis of techniques to cope with them. Our survey provides a modern classification of selection algorithms known in the literature, including the latest ones based on Machine Learning. We provide a ground for the reuse of the selection techniques between different optimization scenarios and highlight challenges and promising directions in the field.

### CSR:Achieving 1 Bit Key-Value Cache via Sparse Representation
**Authors**: Hongxuan Zhang, Yao Zhao, Jiaqi Zheng, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu, Guihai Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:01:53Z

**Summary**: The emergence of long-context text applications utilizing large language models (LLMs) has presented significant scalability challenges, particularly in memory footprint. The linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache responsible for storing attention keys and values to minimize redundant computations can lead to substantial increases in memory consumption, potentially causing models to fail to serve with limited memory resources. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Cache Sparse Representation (CSR), which converts the KV cache by transforming the dense Key-Value cache tensor into sparse indexes and weights, offering a more memory-efficient representation during LLM inference. Furthermore, we introduce NeuralDict, a novel neural network-based method for automatically generating the dictionary used in our sparse representation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CSR achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization algorithms while maintaining robust functionality in memory-constrained environments.

### AsymRnR: Video Diffusion Transformers Acceleration with Asymmetric   Reduction and Restoration
**Authors**: Wenhao Sun, Rong-Cheng Tu, Jingyi Liao, Zhao Jin, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:28:22Z

**Summary**: Video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated significant potential for generating high-fidelity videos but are computationally intensive. Existing acceleration methods include distillation, which requires costly retraining, and feature caching, which is highly sensitive to network architecture. Recent token reduction methods are training-free and architecture-agnostic, offering greater flexibility and wider applicability. However, they enforce the same sequence length across different components, constraining their acceleration potential. We observe that intra-sequence redundancy in video DiTs varies across features, blocks, and denoising timesteps. Building on this observation, we propose Asymmetric Reduction and Restoration (AsymRnR), a training-free approach to accelerate video DiTs. It offers a flexible and adaptive strategy that reduces the number of tokens based on their redundancy to enhance both acceleration and generation quality. We further propose matching cache to facilitate faster processing. Integrated into state-of-the-art video DiTs, AsymRnR achieves a superior speedup without compromising the quality.

### Ultra-High-Definition Dynamic Multi-Exposure Image Fusion via Infinite   Pixel Learning
**Authors**: Xingchi Chen, Zhuoran Zheng, Xuerui Li, Yuying Chen, Shu Wang, Wenqi Ren

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:55:26Z

**Summary**: With the continuous improvement of device imaging resolution, the popularity of Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) images is increasing. Unfortunately, existing methods for fusing multi-exposure images in dynamic scenes are designed for low-resolution images, which makes them inefficient for generating high-quality UHD images on a resource-constrained device. To alleviate the limitations of extremely long-sequence inputs, inspired by the Large Language Model (LLM) for processing infinitely long texts, we propose a novel learning paradigm to achieve UHD multi-exposure dynamic scene image fusion on a single consumer-grade GPU, named Infinite Pixel Learning (IPL). The design of our approach comes from three key components: The first step is to slice the input sequences to relieve the pressure generated by the model processing the data stream; Second, we develop an attention cache technique, which is similar to KV cache for infinite data stream processing; Finally, we design a method for attention cache compression to alleviate the storage burden of the cache on the device. In addition, we provide a new UHD benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experimental results show that our method maintains high-quality visual performance while fusing UHD dynamic multi-exposure images in real-time (>40fps) on a single consumer-grade GPU.

**Summary**: We propose a simple way to use large language models (LLMs) in education. Specifically, our method aims to improve individual comprehension by adding a novel feature to online videos. We combine the low threshold for interactivity in digital experiences with the benefits of rephrased and elaborated explanations typical of face-to-face interactions, thereby supporting to close knowledge gaps at scale. To demonstrate the technical feasibility of our approach, we conducted a proof-of-concept experiment and implemented a prototype which is available for testing online. Through the use case, we also show how caching can be applied in LLM-powered applications to reduce their carbon footprint.

### PULSE: Accelerating Distributed Pointer-Traversals on Disaggregated   Memory (Extended Version)
**Authors**: Yupeng Tang, Seung-seob Lee, Abhishek Bhattacharjee, Anurag Khandelwal

**Updated**: 2024-12-15T03:29:54Z

**Summary**: Caches at CPU nodes in disaggregated memory architectures amortize the high data access latency over the network. However, such caches are fundamentally unable to improve performance for workloads requiring pointer traversals across linked data structures. We argue for accelerating these pointer traversals closer to disaggregated memory in a manner that preserves expressiveness for supporting various linked structures, ensures energy efficiency and performance, and supports distributed execution. We design PULSE, a distributed pointer-traversal framework for rack-scale disaggregated memory to meet all the above requirements. Our evaluation of PULSE shows that it enables low-latency, high-throughput, and energy-efficient execution for a wide range of pointer traversal workloads on disaggregated memory that fare poorly with caching alone.

### SparseMap: Loop Mapping for Sparse CNNs on Streaming Coarse-grained   Reconfigurable Array
**Authors**: Xiaobing Ni, Mengke Ge, Jiaheng Ruan, Song Chen, Yi Kang

**Updated**: 2024-12-15T02:30:09Z

**Summary**: Streaming coarse-grained reconfgurable array (CGRA) is a promising architecture for data/computing-intensive applications because of its fexibility, high throughput and efcient memory system. However,when accelerating sparse CNNs, the irregular input data demands inside sparse CNNs would cause excessive caching operations (COPs) and multi-cycle internal dependencies (MCIDs) between operations, declining the throughput of the streaming CGRA. We propose a mapping method for sparse CNNs onto streaming CGRA, SparseMap, which incorporates an efcient I/O data management along with operation scheduling and binding, to reduce the COPs and MCIDs, thereby ensuring the optimal throughput of streaming CGRA.The experimental results show SparseMap reduces 92.5% COPs and 46.0 % MCIDs while achieves the same or even smaller initiation interval (II) compared to previous works.

### Accelerating Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Derrick Quinn, Mohammad Nouri, Neel Patel, John Salihu, Alireza Salemi, Sukhan Lee, Hamed Zamani, Mohammad Alian

**Updated**: 2024-12-14T06:47:56Z

**Summary**: An evolving solution to address hallucination and enhance accuracy in large language models (LLMs) is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which involves augmenting LLMs with information retrieved from an external knowledge source, such as the web. This paper profiles several RAG execution pipelines and demystifies the complex interplay between their retrieval and generation phases. We demonstrate that while exact retrieval schemes are expensive, they can reduce inference time compared to approximate retrieval variants because an exact retrieval model can send a smaller but more accurate list of documents to the generative model while maintaining the same end-to-end accuracy. This observation motivates the acceleration of the exact nearest neighbor search for RAG.   In this work, we design Intelligent Knowledge Store (IKS), a type-2 CXL device that implements a scale-out near-memory acceleration architecture with a novel cache-coherent interface between the host CPU and near-memory accelerators. IKS offers 13.4-27.9x faster exact nearest neighbor search over a 512GB vector database compared with executing the search on Intel Sapphire Rapids CPUs. This higher search performance translates to 1.7-26.3x lower end-to-end inference time for representative RAG applications. IKS is inherently a memory expander; its internal DRAM can be disaggregated and used for other applications running on the server to prevent DRAM, which is the most expensive component in today's servers, from being stranded.

### RMCSA Algorithm for Congestion-Aware and Service Latency Aware Dynamic   Service Provisioning in Software-Defined SDM-EONs
**Authors**: Baljinder Singh Heera, Shrinivas Petale, Yatindra Nath Singh, Suresh Subramaniam

**Updated**: 2024-12-14T05:20:50Z

**Summary**: The implementation of 5G and the future deployment of 6G necessitate the utilization of optical networks that possess substantial capacity and exhibit minimal latency. The dynamic arrival and departure of connection requests in optical networks result in particular central links experiencing more traffic and congestion than non-central links. The occurrence of congested links leads to service blocking despite the availability of resources within the network, restricting the efficient utilization of network resources. The available algorithms in the literature that aim to balance load among network links offer a trade-off between blocking performance and algorithmic complexity, thus increasing service provisioning time. This work proposes a dynamic routing-based congestion-aware routing, modulation, core, and spectrum assignment (RMCSA) algorithm for space division multiplexing elastic optical networks (SDM-EONs). The algorithm finds alternative candidate paths based on real-time link occupancy metrics to minimize blocking due to link congestion under dynamic traffic scenarios. As a result, the algorithm reduces the formation of congestion hotspots in the network owing to link-betweenness centrality. We have performed extensive simulations using two realistic network topologies to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with relevant RMCSA algorithms available in the literature. The simulation results verify the superior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to the benchmark Yen's K-shortest paths and K-Disjoint shortest paths RMCSA algorithms in connection blocking ratio and spectrum utilization efficiency. To expedite the route-finding process, we present a novel caching strategy that allows the proposed algorithm to demonstrate a much-reduced service delay time compared to the recently developed adaptive link weight-based load-balancing RMCSA algorithm.

### SCBench: A KV Cache-Centric Analysis of Long-Context Methods
**Authors**: Yucheng Li, Huiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Xufang Luo, Surin Ahn, Chengruidong Zhang, Amir H. Abdi, Dongsheng Li, Jianfeng Gao, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T17:59:52Z

**Summary**: Long-context LLMs have enabled numerous downstream applications but also introduced significant challenges related to computational and memory efficiency. To address these challenges, optimizations for long-context inference have been developed, centered around the KV cache. However, existing benchmarks often evaluate in single-request, neglecting the full lifecycle of the KV cache in real-world use. This oversight is particularly critical, as KV cache reuse has become widely adopted in LLMs inference frameworks, such as vLLM and SGLang, as well as by LLM providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic. To address this gap, we introduce SCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache generation, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache loading. Specifically, SCBench uses test examples with shared context, ranging 12 tasks with two shared context modes, covering four categories of long-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information, and multi-task. With it, we provide an extensive KV cache-centric analysis of eight categories long-context solutions, including Gated Linear RNNs, Mamba-Attention hybrids, and efficient methods such as sparse attention, KV cache dropping, quantization, retrieval, loading, and prompt compression. The evaluation is conducted on 8 long-context LLMs. Our findings show that sub-O(n) memory methods suffer in multi-turn scenarios, while sparse encoding with O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly. Dynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns, and layer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures reduces memory usage with strong performance. Additionally, we identify attention distribution shift issues in long-generation scenarios. https://aka.ms/SCBench.

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T17:37:48Z

**Summary**: We present DeepSeek-VL2, an advanced series of large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Vision-Language Models that significantly improves upon its predecessor, DeepSeek-VL, through two key major upgrades. For the vision component, we incorporate a dynamic tiling vision encoding strategy designed for processing high-resolution images with different aspect ratios. For the language component, we leverage DeepSeekMoE models with the Multi-head Latent Attention mechanism, which compresses Key-Value cache into latent vectors, to enable efficient inference and high throughput. Trained on an improved vision-language dataset, DeepSeek-VL2 demonstrates superior capabilities across various tasks, including but not limited to visual question answering, optical character recognition, document/table/chart understanding, and visual grounding. Our model series is composed of three variants: DeepSeek-VL2-Tiny, DeepSeek-VL2-Small and DeepSeek-VL2, with 1.0B, 2.8B and 4.5B activated parameters respectively. DeepSeek-VL2 achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance with similar or fewer activated parameters compared to existing open-source dense and MoE-based models. Codes and pre-trained models are publicly accessible at https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-VL2.

### OASIS-UROS: Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors -- Upgraded,   Refined, and Overhauled Software
**Authors**: Oliver Maximilian Zobel, Johannes Maierhofer, Andreas Köstler, Daniel J. Rixen

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T16:13:39Z

**Summary**: OASIS-UROS continues the previously published Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors (OASIS). While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this version improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching system and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a higher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and software-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and power supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now achieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This paper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all materials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system was validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal analysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial one in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS cannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed system can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller companies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as adaptability of the hardware and software.

### EVOS: Efficient Implicit Neural Training via EVOlutionary Selector
**Authors**: Weixiang Zhang, Shuzhao Xie, Chengwei Ren, Siyi Xie, Chen Tang, Shijia Ge, Mingzi Wang, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T14:11:42Z

**Summary**: We propose EVOlutionary Selector (EVOS), an efficient training paradigm for accelerating Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Unlike conventional INR training that feeds all samples through the neural network in each iteration, our approach restricts training to strategically selected points, reducing computational overhead by eliminating redundant forward passes. Specifically, we treat each sample as an individual in an evolutionary process, where only those fittest ones survive and merit inclusion in training, adaptively evolving with the neural network dynamics. While this is conceptually similar to Evolutionary Algorithms, their distinct objectives (selection for acceleration vs. iterative solution optimization) require a fundamental redefinition of evolutionary mechanisms for our context. In response, we design sparse fitness evaluation, frequency-guided crossover, and augmented unbiased mutation to comprise EVOS. These components respectively guide sample selection with reduced computational cost, enhance performance through frequency-domain balance, and mitigate selection bias from cached evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves approximately 48%-66% reduction in training time while ensuring superior convergence without additional cost, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.

### Optimal Offline ORAM with Perfect Security via Simple Oblivious Priority   Queues
**Authors**: Thore Thießen, Jan Vahrenhold

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T14:08:55Z

**Summary**: Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a well-researched primitive to hide the memory access pattern of a RAM computation; it has a variety of applications in trusted computing, outsourced storage, and multiparty computation. In this paper, we study the so-called offline ORAM in which the sequence of memory access locations to be hidden is known in advance. Apart from their theoretical significance, offline ORAMs can be used to construct efficient oblivious algorithms.   We obtain the first optimal offline ORAM with perfect security from oblivious priority queues via time-forward processing. For this, we present a simple construction of an oblivious priority queue with perfect security. Our construction achieves an asymptotically optimal (amortized) runtime of $\Theta(\log N)$ per operation for a capacity of $N$ elements and is of independent interest.   Building on our construction, we additionally present efficient external-memory instantiations of our oblivious, perfectly-secure construction: For the cache-aware setting, we match the optimal I/O complexity of $\Theta(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M})$ per operation (amortized), and for the cache-oblivious setting we achieve a near-optimal I/O complexity of $O(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M} \log\log_M N)$ per operation (amortized).

### Activation Sparsity Opportunities for Compressing General Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Nobel Dhar, Bobin Deng, Md Romyull Islam, Kazi Fahim Ahmad Nasif, Liang Zhao, Kun Suo

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T02:26:54Z

**Summary**: Deploying local AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to edge devices can substantially enhance devices' independent capabilities, alleviate the server's burden, and lower the response time. Owing to these tremendous potentials, many big tech companies have released several lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) to bridge this gap. However, we still have huge motivations to deploy more powerful (LLMs) AI models on edge devices and enhance their smartness level. Unlike the conventional approaches for AI model compression, we investigate activation sparsity. The activation sparsity method is orthogonal and combinable with existing techniques to maximize compression rate while maintaining great accuracy. LLMs' Feed-Forward Network (FFN) components, which typically comprise a large proportion of parameters (around 3/2), ensure that our FFN optimizations would have a better chance of achieving effective compression. Moreover, our findings are beneficial to general LLMs and are not restricted to ReLU-based models. This work systematically investigates the tradeoff between enforcing activation sparsity and perplexity (accuracy) on state-of-the-art LLMs. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that we can obtain around 50% of main memory and computing reductions for critical FFN components with negligible accuracy degradation. This extra 50% sparsity does not naturally exist in the current LLMs, which require tuning LLMs' activation outputs by injecting zero-enforcing thresholds. To obtain the benefits of activation sparsity, we provide a guideline for the system architect for LLM prediction and prefetching. The success prediction allows the system to prefetch the necessary weights while omitting the inactive ones and their successors, therefore lowering cache and memory pollution and reducing LLM execution time on resource-constrained edge devices.

**Authors**: Md Nurul Absur, Sourya Saha, Sifat Nawrin Nova, Kazi Fahim Ahmad Nasif, Md Rahat Ul Nasib

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T17:20:26Z

**Summary**: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a powerful system of distributed caching servers that aims to accelerate content delivery, like high-definition video, IoT applications, and ultra-low-latency services, efficiently and with fast velocity. This has become of paramount importance in the post-pandemic era. Challenges arise when exponential content volume growth and scalability across different geographic locations are required. This paper investigates data-driven evaluations of CDN algorithms in dynamic server selection for latency reduction, bandwidth throttling for efficient resource management, real-time Round Trip Time analysis for adaptive routing, and programmatic network delay simulation to emulate various conditions. Key performance metrics, such as round-trip time (RTT) and CPU usage, are carefully analyzed to evaluate scalability and algorithmic efficiency through two experimental setups: a constrained edge-like local system and a scalable FABRIC testbed. The statistical validation of RTT trends, alongside CPU utilization, is presented in the results. The optimization process reveals significant trade-offs between scalability and resource consumption, providing actionable insights for effectively deploying and enhancing CDN algorithms in edge and distributed computing environments.

### Unifying AI Tutor Evaluation: An Evaluation Taxonomy for Pedagogical   Ability Assessment of LLM-Powered AI Tutors
**Authors**: Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Kseniia Petukhova, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T16:24:35Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we investigate whether current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are effective as AI tutors and whether they demonstrate pedagogical abilities necessary for good AI tutoring in educational dialogues. Previous efforts towards evaluation have been limited to subjective protocols and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified evaluation taxonomy with eight pedagogical dimensions based on key learning sciences principles, which is designed to assess the pedagogical value of LLM-powered AI tutor responses grounded in student mistakes or confusion in the mathematical domain. We release MRBench -- a new evaluation benchmark containing 192 conversations and 1,596 responses from seven state-of-the-art LLM-based and human tutors, providing gold annotations for eight pedagogical dimensions. We assess reliability of the popular Prometheus2 LLM as an evaluator and analyze each tutor's pedagogical abilities, highlighting which LLMs are good tutors and which ones are more suitable as question-answering systems. We believe that the presented taxonomy, benchmark, and human-annotated labels will streamline the evaluation process and help track the progress in AI tutors' development.

### ZipCache: A DRAM/SSD Cache with Built-in Transparent Compression
**Authors**: Rui Xie, Linsen Ma, Alex Zhong, Feng Chen, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T15:39:48Z

**Summary**: As a core component in modern data centers, key-value cache provides high-throughput and low-latency services for high-speed data processing. The effectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the needed data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than commonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs, cooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential solution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by condensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not gained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical issues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write amplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost. This paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic integration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as an essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data management, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for collaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache. Our experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher throughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by up to 26.2 times.

### Unlocking FedNL: Self-Contained Compute-Optimized Implementation
**Authors**: Konstantin Burlachenko, Peter Richtárik

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T14:43:48Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that enables intelligent agents to collaboratively train Machine Learning (ML) models in a distributed manner, eliminating the need for sharing their local data. The recent work (arXiv:2106.02969) introduces a family of Federated Newton Learn (FedNL) algorithms, marking a significant step towards applying second-order methods to FL and large-scale optimization. However, the reference FedNL prototype exhibits three serious practical drawbacks: (i) It requires 4.8 hours to launch a single experiment in a sever-grade workstation; (ii) The prototype only simulates multi-node setting; (iii) Prototype integration into resource-constrained applications is challenging. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we present a self-contained implementation of FedNL, FedNL-LS, FedNL-PP for single-node and multi-node settings. Our work resolves the aforementioned issues and reduces the wall clock time by x1000. With this FedNL outperforms alternatives for training logistic regression in a single-node -- CVXPY (arXiv:1603.00943), and in a multi-node -- Apache Spark (arXiv:1505.06807), Ray/Scikit-Learn (arXiv:1712.05889). Finally, we propose two practical-orientated compressors for FedNL - adaptive TopLEK and cache-aware RandSeqK, which fulfill the theory of FedNL.

**Authors**: Zhenliang Xue, Yixin Song, Zeyu Mi, Xinrui Zheng, Yubin Xia, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T12:24:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) on smartphones enable real-time AI assistance and privacy-preserving, offline operation. However, resource constraints of smartphones limit current deployments to small language models (SLMs), significantly compromising their capabilities. This paper introduces PowerInfer-2, a smartphone-based framework that enables fast inference for LLMs exceeding the memory capacity. The key insight is decomposing matrix operations into neuron clusters as the basic processing unit, which enables flexible scheduling and efficient I/O-computation pipelining. PowerInfer-2 leverages this neuron-cluster-based design in both computation and storage. For computation, neuron clusters with dense activations are processed on NPU, while sparse clusters use CPU. The storage engine provides a fine-grained pipeline mechanism that coordinates cluster-level computation and I/O operations, enhanced by a segmented neuron cache to reduce I/O activities. PowerInfer-2 achieves up to a 27.8x speed increase compared to state-of-the-art frameworks. PowerInfer-2 is the first system to serve a 47B LLM on a smartphone, achieving 11.68 tokens/s. Notably, these performance improvements preserve model quality with negligible accuracy degradation.

### HEXA-MoE: Efficient and Heterogeneous-aware MoE Acceleration with ZERO   Computation Redundancy
**Authors**: Shuqing Luo, Jie Peng, Pingzhi Li, Tianlong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T12:03:19Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a practical approach to scale up parameters for the Transformer model to achieve better generalization while maintaining a sub-linear increase in computation overhead. Current MoE models are mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it usually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy communication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore developing a \texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \texttt{EX}pert \texttt{A}llocation framework, \textbf{\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing efficiency. It contains two components: ($1$) \textit{Expert-Specific Operators}. We replace the typical general matrix multiplication or grouped matrix multiplication interfaces with our operators, which allows the computing to be performed in an in-place manner with \textbf{ZERO} redundancy. ($2$) \textit{Adaptive Data- and Model-Centric Configurations} for different workload scales. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline-shared cache on each device to tackle the heavy memory consumption in the existing data-centric MoE library. Comprehensive experiments on the Swin-MoE benchmark consistently reveal the effectiveness of our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} framework, i.e., reducing $10\%\sim48\%$ memory consumption and achieving $0.5\sim4.3\times$ speed up compared to current state-of-the-art MoE libraries. Furthermore, we examine our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} with heterogeneous devices for both data- and model-centric settings. Promising results show that employing optimal parallel configuration with \texttt{HEXA-MoE} on heterogeneous devices can substantially minimize overall latency. Codes are available at https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/HEXA-MoE.

**Authors**: A. B. Batrakov, S. Yu. Karelin, O. M. Lebedenko, V. S. Mukhin, I. N. Onishchenko, O. L. Rak, V. G. Sinitsin, M. V. Volovenko

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T10:07:17Z

**Summary**: Experimental data and results of numerical simulations are presented, concerning excitation of narrowband gigahertz-range wave trains in coaxial guiding structures that are partially filled with ferromagnetic material and may involve periodically arranged metal inserts. The experiments performed confirm the possibility of exciting weakly damped electromagnetic waves by feeding high voltage, unilateral electromagnetic pulses of short duration into the line. The coax line was of outer diameter 50.5 mm, filled with an isotropic dielectric (relative dielectric constant {\epsilon} = 2.25) and a set of ferrite rings with {\epsilon}=16 and saturated-state {\mu} about 4 to 5. With a peak voltage of the primary pulse close to 160 kV and a magnetizing field of 17.5 kA/m, the parameters of the waves excited reached magnitudes as: frequency 1.89 GHz to 2.1 GHz; bandwidth 16%; VHF power at the output about 20 MW.

### PhishIntel: Toward Practical Deployment of Reference-based Phishing   Detection
**Authors**: Yuexin Li, Hiok Kuek Tan, Qiaoran Meng, Mei Lin Lock, Tri Cao, Shumin Deng, Nay Oo, Hoon Wei Lim, Bryan Hooi

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T08:33:39Z

**Summary**: Phishing is a critical cyber threat, exploiting deceptive tactics to compromise victims and cause significant financial losses. While reference-based phishing detectors (RBPDs) achieve high precision by analyzing brand-domain consistency, their real-world deployment is hindered by challenges such as high latency and inefficiency in URL analysis. To address these limitations, we present PhishIntel, an end-to-end phishing detection system for real-world deployment. PhishIntel intelligently determines whether a URL can be processed immediately or not, segmenting the detection process into two distinct tasks: a fast task that checks against local blacklists and result cache, and a slow task that conducts online blacklist verification, URL crawling, and webpage analysis using an RBPD. This fast-slow task system architecture ensures low response latency while retaining the robust detection capabilities of RBPDs for zero-day phishing threats. Furthermore, we develop two downstream applications based on PhishIntel: a phishing intelligence platform and a phishing email detection plugin for Microsoft Outlook, demonstrating its practical efficacy and utility.

### ZigZagkv: Dynamic KV Cache Compression for Long-context Modeling based   on Layer Uncertainty
**Authors**: Meizhi Zhong, Xikai Liu, Chen Zhang, Yikun Lei, Yan Gao, Yao Hu, Kehai Chen, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T07:52:56Z

**Summary**: Large Language models (LLMs) have become a research hotspot. To accelerate the inference of LLMs, storing computed caches in memory has become the standard technique. However, as the inference length increases, growing KV caches might lead to out-of-memory issues. Many existing methods address this issue through KV cache compression, primarily by preserving key tokens throughout all layers to reduce information loss. Most of them allocate a uniform budget size for each layer to retain. However, we observe that the minimum budget sizes needed to retain essential information vary across layers and models based on the perspectives of attention and hidden state output. Building on this observation, this paper proposes a simple yet effective KV cache compression method that leverages layer uncertainty to allocate budget size for each layer. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce memory usage of the KV caches to only $\sim$20\% when compared to Full KV inference while achieving nearly lossless performance.

### Forecasting GPU Performance for Deep Learning Training and Inference
**Authors**: Seonho Lee, Amar Phanishayee, Divya Mahajan

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T03:21:13Z

**Summary**: Deep learning kernels exhibit predictable memory accesses and compute patterns, making GPUs' parallel architecture well-suited for their execution. Software and runtime systems for GPUs are optimized to better utilize the stream multiprocessors, on-chip cache, and off-chip high-bandwidth memory. As deep learning models and GPUs evolve, access to newer GPUs is often limited, raising questions about the performance of new model architectures on existing GPUs, existing models on new GPUs, and new model architectures on new GPUs. To address these questions, we introduce NeuSight, a framework to predict the performance of various deep learning models, for both training and inference, on unseen GPUs without requiring actual execution. The framework leverages both GPU hardware behavior and software library optimizations to estimate end-to-end performance. Previous work uses regression models that capture linear trends or multilayer perceptrons to predict the overall latency of deep learning kernels on GPUs. These approaches suffer from higher error percentages when forecasting performance on unseen models and new GPUs. Instead, NeuSight decomposes the prediction problem into smaller problems, bounding the prediction through fundamental performance laws. NeuSight decomposes a single deep learning kernel prediction into smaller working sets called tiles, which are executed independently on the GPU. Tile-granularity predictions are determined using a machine learning approach and aggregated to estimate end-to-end latency. NeuSight outperforms prior work across various deep learning workloads and the latest GPUs. It reduces the percentage error from 121.4% and 30.8% to 2.3% in predicting the latency of GPT3 model for training and inference on H100, compared to state-of-the-art prior work, where both GPT3 and H100 were not used to train the framework.

### Lexico: Extreme KV Cache Compression via Sparse Coding over Universal   Dictionaries
**Authors**: Junhyuck Kim, Jongho Park, Jaewoong Cho, Dimitris Papailiopoulos

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T03:00:29Z

**Summary**: We introduce Lexico, a novel KV cache compression method that leverages sparse coding with a universal dictionary. Our key finding is that key-value cache in modern LLMs can be accurately approximated using sparse linear combination from a small, input-agnostic dictionary of ~4k atoms, enabling efficient compression across different input prompts, tasks and models. Using orthogonal matching pursuit for sparse approximation, Lexico achieves flexible compression ratios through direct sparsity control. On GSM8K, across multiple model families (Mistral, Llama 3, Qwen2.5), Lexico maintains 90-95% of the original performance while using only 15-25% of the full KV-cache memory, outperforming both quantization and token eviction methods. Notably, Lexico remains effective in low memory regimes where 2-bit quantization fails, achieving up to 1.7x better compression on LongBench and GSM8K while maintaining high accuracy.

### EMS: Adaptive Evict-then-Merge Strategy for Head-wise KV Cache   Compression Based on Global-Local Importance
**Authors**: Yingxin Li, Ye Li, Yuan Meng, Xinzhu Ma, Zihan Geng, Shutao Xia, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-11T16:35:13Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the demand for higher quality and faster processing of long contexts across various applications is growing. KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and value tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference. However, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient compression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods perform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and designing compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce biased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated attention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the sparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in preserving the most effective information at the head level. To this end, we propose EMS to overcome these limitations, while achieving better KV cache compression under extreme compression ratios. Specifically, we introduce a Global-Local score that combines accumulated attention scores from both global and local KV tokens to better identify the token importance. For the compression strategy, we design an adaptive and unified Evict-then-Merge framework that accounts for the sparsity and redundancy of KV tokens across different heads. Additionally, we implement the head-wise parallel compression through a zero-class mechanism to enhance efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate our SOTA performance even under extreme compression ratios. EMS consistently achieves the lowest perplexity, improves scores by over 1.28 points across four LLMs on LongBench under a 256 cache budget, and preserves 95% retrieval accuracy with a cache budget less than 2% of the context length in the Needle-in-a-Haystack task.

### Pushing the Limits of In-Network Caching for Key-Value Stores
**Authors**: Gyuyeong Kim

**Updated**: 2024-12-11T12:03:40Z

**Summary**: We present OrbitCache, a new in-network caching architecture that can cache variable-length items to balance a wide range of key-value workloads. Unlike existing works, OrbitCache does not cache hot items in the switch memory. Instead, we make hot items revisit the switch data plane continuously by exploiting packet recirculation. Our approach keeps cached key-value pairs in the switch data plane while freeing them from item size limitations caused by hardware constraints. We implement an OrbitCache prototype on an Intel Tofino switch. Our experimental results show that OrbitCache can balance highly skewed workloads and is robust to various system conditions.

### TextRefiner: Internal Visual Feature as Efficient Refiner for   Vision-Language Models Prompt Tuning
**Authors**: Jingjing Xie, Yuxin Zhang, Jun Peng, Zhaohong Huang, Liujuan Cao

**Updated**: 2024-12-11T08:07:12Z

**Summary**: Despite the efficiency of prompt learning in transferring vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks, existing methods mainly learn the prompts in a coarse-grained manner where the learned prompt vectors are shared across all categories. Consequently, the tailored prompts often fail to discern class-specific visual concepts, thereby hindering the transferred performance for classes that share similar or complex visual attributes. Recent advances mitigate this challenge by leveraging external knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) to furnish class descriptions, yet incurring notable inference costs. In this paper, we introduce TextRefiner, a plug-and-play method to refine the text prompts of existing methods by leveraging the internal knowledge of VLMs. Particularly, TextRefiner builds a novel local cache module to encapsulate fine-grained visual concepts derivedfrom local tokens within the image branch. By aggregating and aligning the cached visual descriptions with the original output of the text branch, TextRefiner can efficiently refine and enrich the learned prompts from existing methods without relying on any external expertise. For example, it improves the performance of CoOp from 71.66 % to 76.94 % on 11 benchmarks, surpassing CoCoOp which introduces instance-wise features for text prompts. Equipped with TextRefiner, PromptKD achieves state-of-the-art performance and is efficient in inference. Our code is relesed at https://github.com/xjjxmu/TextRefiner

### ContextModule: Improving Code Completion via Repository-level Contextual   Information
**Authors**: Zhanming Guan, Junlin Liu, Jierui Liu, Chao Peng, Dexin Liu, Ningyuan Sun, Bo Jiang, Wenchao Li, Jie Liu, Hang Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-12-11T03:15:49Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code completion tasks, where they assist developers by predicting and generating new code in real-time. However, existing LLM-based code completion systems primarily rely on the immediate context of the file being edited, often missing valuable repository-level information, user behaviour and edit history that could improve suggestion accuracy. Additionally, challenges such as efficiently retrieving relevant code snippets from large repositories, incorporating user behavior, and balancing accuracy with low-latency requirements in production environments remain unresolved. In this paper, we propose ContextModule, a framework designed to enhance LLM-based code completion by retrieving and integrating three types of contextual information from the repository: user behavior-based code, similar code snippets, and critical symbol definitions. By capturing user interactions across files and leveraging repository-wide static analysis, ContextModule improves the relevance and precision of generated code. We implement performance optimizations, such as index caching, to ensure the system meets the latency constraints of real-world coding environments. Experimental results and industrial practise demonstrate that ContextModule significantly improves code completion accuracy and user acceptance rates.

### Just Shift It: Test-Time Prototype Shifting for Zero-Shot Generalization   with Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Elaine Sui, Xiaohan Wang, Serena Yeung-Levy

**Updated**: 2024-12-10T22:53:16Z

**Summary**: Advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have propelled the field of computer vision, particularly in the zero-shot learning setting. Despite their promise, the effectiveness of these models often diminishes due to domain shifts in test environments. To address this, we introduce the Test-Time Prototype Shifting (TPS) framework, a pioneering approach designed to adapt VLMs to test datasets using unlabeled test inputs. Our method is based on the notion of modulating per-class prototypes in the shared embedding space. By pre-computing and caching prototypes generated with the pre-trained text encoder, TPS not only facilitates optimization-free prototype reuse for subsequent predictions but also enables seamless integration with current advancements in prompt engineering. At test-time, TPS dynamically learns shift vectors for each prototype based solely on the given test sample, effectively bridging the domain gap and enhancing classification accuracy. A notable aspect of our framework is its significantly reduced memory and computational demands when compared to conventional text-prompt tuning methods. Extensive evaluations across 15 image classification datasets involving natural distribution shifts and cross-dataset generalization, as well as in context-dependent visual reasoning, demonstrate TPS's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results while reducing resource requirements.

### From Slow Bidirectional to Fast Causal Video Generators
**Authors**: Tianwei Yin, Qiang Zhang, Richard Zhang, William T. Freeman, Fredo Durand, Eli Shechtman, Xun Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-10T18:59:50Z

**Summary**: Current video diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but struggle in interactive applications due to bidirectional attention dependencies. The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to a causal transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model supports fast streaming generation of high quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner. We will release the code based on an open-source model in the future.

### FlashRNN: Optimizing Traditional RNNs on Modern Hardware
**Authors**: Korbinian Pöppel, Maximilian Beck, Sepp Hochreiter

**Updated**: 2024-12-10T18:50:37Z

**Summary**: While Transformers and other sequence-parallelizable neural network architectures seem like the current state of the art in sequence modeling, they specifically lack state-tracking capabilities. These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: \url{https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn}

### ACDiT: Interpolating Autoregressive Conditional Modeling and Diffusion   Transformer
**Authors**: Jinyi Hu, Shengding Hu, Yuxuan Song, Yufei Huang, Mingxuan Wang, Hao Zhou, Zhiyuan Liu, Wei-Ying Ma, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2024-12-10T18:13:20Z

**Summary**: The recent surge of interest in comprehensive multimodal models has necessitated the unification of diverse modalities. However, the unification suffers from disparate methodologies. Continuous visual generation necessitates the full-sequence diffusion-based approach, despite its divergence from the autoregressive modeling in the text domain. We posit that autoregressive modeling, i.e., predicting the future based on past deterministic experience, remains crucial in developing both a visual generation model and a potential unified multimodal model. In this paper, we explore an interpolation between the autoregressive modeling and full-parameters diffusion to model visual information. At its core, we present ACDiT, an Autoregressive blockwise Conditional Diffusion Transformer, where the block size of diffusion, i.e., the size of autoregressive units, can be flexibly adjusted to interpolate between token-wise autoregression and full-sequence diffusion. ACDiT is easy to implement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) during training. During inference, the process iterates between diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding that can make full use of KV-Cache. We verify the effectiveness of ACDiT on image and video generation tasks. We also demonstrate that benefitted from autoregressive modeling, ACDiT can be seamlessly used in visual understanding tasks despite being trained on the diffusion objective. The analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive modeling and diffusion demonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in long-horizon visual generation tasks. These strengths make it promising as the backbone of future unified models.

### Video-XL: Extra-Long Vision Language Model for Hour-Scale Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Yan Shu, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang, Minghao Qin, Junjie Zhou, Zhengyang Liang, Tiejun Huang, Bo Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-12-10T12:45:31Z

**Summary**: Long video understanding poses a significant challenge for current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Notably, the MLLMs are constrained by their limited context lengths and the substantial costs while processing long videos. Although several existing methods attempt to reduce visual tokens, their strategies encounter severe bottleneck, restricting MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose Video-XL, a novel approach that leverages MLLMs' inherent key-value (KV) sparsification capacity to condense the visual input. Specifically, we introduce a new special token, the Visual Summarization Token (VST), for each interval of the video, which summarizes the visual information within the interval as its associated KV. The VST module is trained by instruction fine-tuning, where two optimizing strategies are offered. 1.Curriculum learning, where VST learns to make small (easy) and large compression (hard) progressively. 2. Composite data curation, which integrates single-image, multi-image, and synthetic data to overcome the scarcity of long-video instruction data. The compression quality is further improved by dynamic compression, which customizes compression granularity based on the information density of different video intervals. Video-XL's effectiveness is verified from three aspects. First, it achieves a superior long-video understanding capability, outperforming state-of-the-art models of comparable sizes across multiple popular benchmarks. Second, it effectively preserves video information, with minimal compression loss even at 16x compression ratio. Third, it realizes outstanding cost-effectiveness, enabling high-quality processing of thousands of frames on a single A100 GPU.

### GPT Semantic Cache: Reducing LLM Costs and Latency via Semantic   Embedding Caching
**Authors**: Sajal Regmi, Chetan Phakami Pun

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T01:44:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling nuanced understanding and generation of human-like text across a wide range of applications. However, the high computational and financial costs associated with frequent API calls to these models present a substantial bottleneck, especially for applications like customer service chatbots that handle repetitive queries. In this paper, we introduce GPT Semantic Cache, a method that leverages semantic caching of query embeddings in in-memory storage (Redis). By storing embeddings of user queries, our approach efficiently identifies semantically similar questions, allowing for the retrieval of pre-generated responses without redundant API calls to the LLM. This technique achieves a notable reduction in operational costs while significantly enhancing response times, making it a robust solution for optimizing LLM-powered applications. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT Semantic Cache reduces API calls by up to 68.8% across various query categories, with cache hit rates ranging from 61.6% to 68.8%. Additionally, the system achieves high accuracy, with positive hit rates exceeding 97%, confirming the reliability of cached responses. This technique not only reduces operational costs, but also improves response times, enhancing the efficiency of LLM-powered applications.

### A Survey on Privacy-Preserving Caching at Network Edge: Classification,   Solutions, and Challenges
**Authors**: Xianzhi Zhang, Yipeng Zhou, Di Wu, Quan Z. Sheng, Shazia Riaz, Miao Hu, Linchang Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T01:39:15Z

**Summary**: Caching content at the edge network is a popular and effective technique widely deployed to alleviate the burden of network backhaul, shorten service delay and improve service quality. However, there has been some controversy over privacy violations in caching content at the edge network. On the one hand, the multi-access open edge network provides an ideal entrance or interface for external attackers to obtain private data from edge caches by extracting sensitive information. On the other hand, privacy can be infringed on by curious edge caching providers through caching trace analysis targeting the achievement of better caching performance or higher profits. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of privacy issues in edge caching networks is vital and indispensable for creating a privacy-preserving caching service at the edge network. In this article, we are among the first to fill this gap by examining privacy-preserving techniques for caching content at the edge network. Firstly, we provide an introduction to the background of privacy-preserving edge caching (PPEC). Next, we summarize the key privacy issues and present a taxonomy for caching at the edge network from the perspective of private information. Additionally, we conduct a retrospective review of the state-of-the-art countermeasures against privacy leakage from content caching at the edge network. Finally, we conclude the survey and envision challenges for future research.

### XKV: Personalized KV Cache Memory Reduction for Long-Context LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Weizhuo Li, Zhigang Wang, Yu Gu, Ge Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-08T11:32:08Z

**Summary**: Recently the generative Large Language Model (LLM) has achieved remarkable success in numerous applications. Notably its inference generates output tokens one-by-one, leading to many redundant computations. The widely-used KV-Cache framework makes a compromise between time and space complexities. However, caching data generates the increasingly growing memory demand, that can quickly exhaust the limited memory capacity of the modern accelerator like GPUs, particularly in long-context inference tasks. Existing studies reduce memory consumption by evicting some of cached data that have less important impact on inference accuracy. But the benefit in practice is far from ideal due to the static cache allocation across different LLM network layers. This paper observes that the layer-specific cached data have very different impacts on accuracy. We quantify this difference, and give experimental and theoretical validation. We accordingly make a formal analysis and shows that customizing the cache size for each layer in a personalized manner can yield a significant memory reduction, while still providing comparable accuracy. We simulate the cache allocation as a combinatorial optimization problem and give a global optimal solution. In particular, we devise a mini- and sampling-based inference over a lightweight variant of the LLM model, so as to quickly capture the difference and then feed it into the personalized algorithms. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposals can reduce KV cache memory consumption by 61.6% on average, improve computational efficiency by 2.1x and then increase the throughput by up to 5.5x.

### Ultrafast lattice and electron dynamics induced in a PbSe crystal by an   intense terahertz pulse
**Authors**: A. A. Melnikov, Yu. G. Selivanov, D. G. Poydashev, S. V. Chekalin

**Updated**: 2024-12-07T17:22:14Z

**Summary**: We have studied the ultrafast optical response of a PbSe crystal to an intense picosecond terahertz pulse with a peak electric field strength of up to $\sim$ 500 kV/cm. The reflectivity anisotropy signal contains oscillations at the fundamental frequency of the resonant infrared-active phonon mode as well as its second, third, and fourth harmonics. The effect is ascribed to coherent anharmonic phonons resonantly excited by the strong terahertz field. Pump terahertz pulses also induce an almost instantaneous Kerr effect and a long-lived optical anisotropy of the crystal with a characteristic decay time of $\gtrsim$ 100 ps. We consider lattice distortion and phonon-assisted side valley population as possible origins of this metastable state.

### Batch-Max: Higher LLM Throughput using Larger Batch Sizes and KV Cache   Compression
**Authors**: Michael R. Metel, Boxing Chen, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh

**Updated**: 2024-12-07T16:41:54Z

**Summary**: Several works have developed eviction policies to remove key-value (KV) pairs from the KV cache for more efficient inference. The focus has been on compressing the KV cache after the input prompt has been processed for faster token generation. In settings with limited GPU memory, and when the input context is longer than the generation length, we show that by also compressing the KV cache during the input processing phase, larger batch sizes can be used resulting in significantly higher throughput while still maintaining the original model's accuracy.

### DHA: Learning Decoupled-Head Attention from Transformer Checkpoints via   Adaptive Heads Fusion
**Authors**: Yilong Chen, Linhao Zhang, Junyuan Shang, Zhenyu Zhang, Tingwen Liu, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun

**Updated**: 2024-12-07T13:23:39Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters demonstrate impressive performance. However, the widely used Multi-Head Attention (MHA) in LLMs incurs substantial computational and memory costs during inference. While some efforts have optimized attention mechanisms by pruning heads or sharing parameters among heads, these methods often lead to performance degradation or necessitate substantial continued pre-training costs to restore performance. Based on the analysis of attention redundancy, we design a Decoupled-Head Attention (DHA) mechanism. DHA adaptively configures group sharing for key heads and value heads across various layers, achieving a better balance between performance and efficiency. Inspired by the observation of clustering similar heads, we propose to progressively transform the MHA checkpoint into the DHA model through linear fusion of similar head parameters step by step, retaining the parametric knowledge of the MHA checkpoint. We construct DHA models by transforming various scales of MHA checkpoints given target head budgets. Our experiments show that DHA remarkably requires a mere 0.25\% of the original model's pre-training budgets to achieve 97.6\% of performance while saving 75\% of KV cache. Compared to Group-Query Attention (GQA), DHA achieves a 5$\times$ training acceleration, a maximum of 13.93\% performance improvement under 0.01\% pre-training budget, and 4\% relative improvement under 0.05\% pre-training budget.

### PrefixKV: Adaptive Prefix KV Cache is What Vision Instruction-Following   Models Need for Efficient Generation
**Authors**: Ao Wang, Hui Chen, Jianchao Tan, Kefeng Zhang, Xunliang Cai, Zijia Lin, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding

**Updated**: 2024-12-07T13:23:39Z

**Summary**: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity for their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal inputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory overhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in practical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/THU-MIG/PrefixKV}.

### Spineless Traversal for Layout Invalidation
**Authors**: Marisa Kirisame, Tiezhi Wang, Pavel Panchekha

**Updated**: 2024-12-07T04:08:56Z

**Summary**: Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

### Effect of electric field on excitons in wide quantum wells
**Authors**: Shiming Zheng, E. S. Khramtsov, I. V. Ignatiev

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T19:35:52Z

**Summary**: A microscopic model of a heterostructure with a quantum well (QW) is proposed to study the exciton behavior in an external electric field. The effect of an electric field ranging from 0 to 6 kV/cm applied to the GaAs/AlGaAs QW structure in the growth direction is studied for several QWs of various widths up to 100 nm. The three-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation (SE) of exciton is numerically solved using the finite difference method. Wave functions and energies for several states of the heavy-hole and light-hole excitons are calculated. Dependencies of the exciton state energy, the binding energy, the radiative broadening, and the static dipole moment on the applied electric fields are determined. The threshold of exciton dissociation for the 100-nm QW is also determined. In addition, we found the electric-field-induced shift of the center of mass of the heavy-hole and light-hole exciton in the QWs. Finally, we have modeled reflection spectra of heterostructures with the GaAs/AlGaAs QWs in the electric field using the calculated energies and radiative broadenings of excitons.

### MC3: Memory Contention based Covert Channel Communication on Shared DRAM   System-on-Chips
**Authors**: Ismet Dagli, James Crea, Soner Seckiner, Yuanchao Xu, Selçuk Köse, Mehmet E. Belviranli

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T17:58:57Z

**Summary**: Shared-memory system-on-chips (SM-SoC) are ubiquitously employed by a wide-range of mobile computing platforms, including edge/IoT devices, autonomous systems and smartphones. In SM-SoCs, system-wide shared physical memory enables a convenient and financially-feasible way to make data accessible by dozens of processing units (PUs), such as CPU cores and domain specific accelerators. In this study, we investigate vulnerabilities that stem from the shared use of physical memory in such systems. Due to the diverse computational characteristics of the PUs they embed, SM-SoCs often do not employ a shared last level cache (LLC). While the literature proposes covert channel attacks for shared memory systems, high-throughput communication is currently possible by either relying on an LLC or privileged/physical access to the shared memory subsystem.   In this study, we introduce a new memory-contention based covert communication attack, MC3, which specifically targets the shared system memory in mobile SoCs. Different from existing attacks, our approach achieves high throughput communication between applications running on CPU and GPU without the need for an LLC or elevated access to the system. We extensively explore the effectiveness of our methodology by demonstrating the trade-off between the channel transmission rate and the robustness of the communication. We demonstrate the utility of MC3 on NVIDIA Orin AGX, Orin NX, and Orin Nano up to a transmit rate of 6.4 kbps with less than 1% error rate.

### SwiftDiffusion: Efficient Diffusion Model Serving with Add-on Modules
**Authors**: Suyi Li, Lingyun Yang, Xiaoxiao Jiang, Hanfeng Lu, Dakai An, Zhipeng Di, Weiyi Lu, Jiawei Chen, Kan Liu, Yinghao Yu, Tao Lan, Guodong Yang, Lin Qu, Liping Zhang, Wei Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T11:47:06Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) generation using diffusion models has become a blockbuster service in today's AI cloud. A production T2I service typically involves a serving workflow where a base diffusion model is augmented with various "add-on" modules, notably ControlNet and LoRA, to enhance image generation control. Compared to serving the base model alone, these add-on modules introduce significant loading and computational overhead, resulting in increased latency. In this paper, we present SwiftDiffusion, a system that efficiently serves a T2I workflow through a holistic approach. SwiftDiffusion decouples ControNet from the base model and deploys it as a separate, independently scaled service on dedicated GPUs, enabling ControlNet caching, parallelization, and sharing. To mitigate the high loading overhead of LoRA serving, SwiftDiffusion employs a bounded asynchronous LoRA loading (BAL) technique, allowing LoRA loading to overlap with the initial base model execution by up to k steps without compromising image quality. Furthermore, SwiftDiffusion optimizes base model execution with a novel latent parallelism technique. Collectively, these designs enable SwiftDiffusion to outperform the state-of-the-art T2I serving systems, achieving up to 7.8x latency reduction and 1.6x throughput improvement in serving SDXL models on H800 GPUs, without sacrificing image quality.

### Ltri-LLM: Streaming Long Context Inference for LLMs with Training-Free   Dynamic Triangular Attention Pattern
**Authors**: Hongyin Tang, Di Xiu, Lanrui Wang, Xiurui Geng, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T03:46:06Z

**Summary**: The quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism in current Large Language Models (LLMs) renders inference with long contexts prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, various approaches aim to retain critical portions of the context to optimally approximate Full Attention (FA) through Key-Value (KV) compression or Sparse Attention (SA), enabling the processing of virtually unlimited text lengths in a streaming manner. However, these methods struggle to achieve performance levels comparable to FA, particularly in retrieval tasks. In this paper, our analysis of attention head patterns reveals that LLMs' attention distributions show strong local correlations, naturally reflecting a chunking mechanism for input context. We propose Ltri-LLM framework, which divides KVs into spans, stores them in an offline index, and retrieves the relevant KVs into memory for various queries. Experimental results on popular long text benchmarks show that Ltri-LLM can achieve performance close to FA while maintaining efficient, streaming-based inference.

### One-Hop Sub-Query Result Caches for Graph Database Systems
**Authors**: Hieu Nguyen, Jun Li, Shahram Ghandeharizadeh

**Updated**: 2024-12-06T01:20:47Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a novel one-hop sub-query result cache for processing graph read transactions, gR-Txs, in a graph database system. The one-hop navigation is from a vertex using either its in-coming or out-going edges with selection predicates that filter edges and vertices. Its cache entry identifies a unique one-hop sub-query (key) and its result set consisting of immutable vertex ids (value). When processing a gR-Tx, the query processor identifies its sequence of individual one-hop sub-queries and looks up their results in the cache. A cache hit fetches less data from the storage manager and eliminates the requirement to process the one-hop sub-query. A cache miss populates the cache asynchronously and in a transactional manner, maintaining the separation of read and write paths of our transactional storage manager. A graph read and write transaction, gRW-Tx, identifies the impacted cache entries and either deletes or updates them. Our implementation of the cache is inside the graph query processing engine and transparent to a user application. We evaluate the cache using our eCommerce production workload and with rules that re-write graph queries to maximize the performance enhancements observed with the cache. Obtained results show the cache enhances 95th and 99th percentile of query response times by at least 2x and 1.63x, respectively. When combined with query re-writing, the enhancements are at least 2.33x and 4.48x, respectively. An interesting result is the significant performance enhancement observed by the indirect beneficiaries of the cache, gRW-Txs and gR-Txs that do not reference one-hop sub-queries. The cache frees system resources to expedite their processing significantly.

### Cross-Self KV Cache Pruning for Efficient Vision-Language Inference
**Authors**: Xiaohuan Pei, Tao Huang, Chang Xu

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T22:47:17Z

**Summary**: KV cache pruning has emerged as a promising technique for reducing memory and computation costs in long-context auto-regressive generation. Existing methods for vision-language models (VLMs) typically rely on self-attention scores from large language models (LLMs) to identify and prune irrelevant tokens. However, these approaches overlook the inherent distributional discrepancies between modalities, often leading to inaccurate token importance estimation and the over-pruning of critical visual tokens. To address this, we propose decomposing attention scores into intra-modality attention (within the same modality) and inter-modality attention (across modalities), enabling more precise KV cache pruning by independently managing these distinct attention types. Additionally, we introduce an n-softmax function to counteract distribution shifts caused by pruning, preserving the original smoothness of attention scores and ensuring stable performance. Our final training-free method, \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{S}elf \textbf{P}runing (CSP), achieves competitive performance compared to models with full KV caches while significantly outperforming previous pruning methods. Extensive evaluations on MileBench, a benchmark encompassing 29 multimodal datasets, demonstrate CSP's effectiveness, achieving up to a 41\% performance improvement on challenging tasks like conversational embodied dialogue while reducing the KV cache budget by 13.6\%.

### Neural Two-Level Monte Carlo Real-Time Rendering
**Authors**: Mikhail Dereviannykh, Dmitrii Klepikov, Johannes Hanika, Carsten Dachsbacher

**Updated**: 2024-12-05T22:06:23Z

**Summary**: We introduce an efficient Two-Level Monte Carlo (subset of Multi-Level Monte Carlo, MLMC) estimator for real-time rendering of scenes with global illumination. Using MLMC we split the shading integral into two parts: the radiance cache integral and the residual error integral that compensates for the bias of the first one. For the first part, we developed the Neural Incident Radiance Cache (NIRC) leveraging the power of fully-fused tiny neural networks as a building block, which is trained on the fly. The cache is designed to provide a fast and reasonable approximation of the incident radiance: an evaluation takes 2-25x less compute time than a path tracing sample. This enables us to estimate the radiance cache integral with a high number of samples and by this achieve faster convergence. For the residual error integral, we compute the difference between the NIRC predictions and the unbiased path tracing simulation. Our method makes no assumptions about the geometry, materials, or lighting of a scene and has only few intuitive hyper-parameters. We provide a comprehensive comparative analysis in different experimental scenarios. Since the algorithm is trained in an on-line fashion, it demonstrates significant noise level reduction even for dynamic scenes and can easily be combined with other importance sampling schemes and noise reduction techniques.

 ### Generalized Grade-of-Membership Estimation for High-dimensional Locally   Dependent Data
**Authors**: Ling Chen, Chengzhu Huang, Yuqi Gu

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T18:51:15Z

**Summary**: This work focuses on the mixed membership models for multivariate categorical data widely used for analyzing survey responses and population genetics data. These grade of membership (GoM) models offer rich modeling power but present significant estimation challenges for high-dimensional polytomous data. Popular existing approaches, such as Bayesian MCMC inference, are not scalable and lack theoretical guarantees in high-dimensional settings. To address this, we first observe that data from this model can be reformulated as a three-way (quasi-)tensor, with many subjects responding to many items with varying numbers of categories. We introduce a novel and simple approach that flattens the three-way quasi-tensor into a "fat" matrix, and then perform a singular value decomposition of it to estimate parameters by exploiting the singular subspace geometry. Our fast spectral method can accommodate a broad range of data distributions with arbitrarily locally dependent noise, which we formalize as the generalized-GoM models. We establish finite-sample entrywise error bounds for the generalized-GoM model parameters. This is supported by a new sharp two-to-infinity singular subspace perturbation theory for locally dependent and flexibly distributed noise, a contribution of independent interest. Simulations and applications to data in political surveys, population genetics, and single-cell sequencing demonstrate our method's superior performance.

### InfAlign: Inference-aware language model alignment
**Authors**: Ananth Balashankar, Ziteng Sun, Jonathan Berant, Jacob Eisenstein, Michael Collins, Adrian Hutter, Jong Lee, Chirag Nagpal, Flavien Prost, Aradhana Sinha, and Ananda Theertha Suresh, Ahmad Beirami

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T18:45:36Z

**Summary**: Language model alignment has become a critical step in training modern generative language models. The goal of alignment is to finetune a reference model such that the win rate of a sample from the aligned model over a sample from the reference model is high, subject to a KL divergence constraint. Today, we are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N, controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than standard sampling. However, the alignment objective does not capture such inference-time decoding procedures. We show that the existing alignment framework is sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. We then modify the alignment objective and propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (IAPO). We prove that for any inference-time decoding algorithm, the optimal solution that optimizes the inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the reference policy is the solution to the typical RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the KL-regularized calibrate-and-transform RL (CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. We particularize our study to two important inference-time strategies: best-of-N sampling and best-of-N jailbreaking, where N responses are sampled from the model and the one with the highest or lowest reward is selected. We propose specific transformations for these strategies and demonstrate that our framework offers significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods for language model alignment. Empirically, we outperform baselines that are designed without taking inference-time decoding into consideration by 8-12% and 4-9% on inference-time win rates over the Anthropic helpfulness and harmlessness dialog benchmark datasets.

### Reasoning over Uncertain Text by Generative Large Language Models
**Authors**: Aliakbar Nafar, Kristen Brent Venable, Parisa Kordjamshidi

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T18:43:59Z

**Summary**: This paper considers the challenges Large Language Models (LLMs) face when reasoning over text that includes information involving uncertainty explicitly quantified via probability values. This type of reasoning is relevant to a variety of contexts ranging from everyday conversations to medical decision-making. Despite improvements in the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, they still exhibit significant difficulties when it comes to probabilistic reasoning. To deal with this problem, we introduce the Bayesian Linguistic Inference Dataset (BLInD), a new dataset specifically designed to test the probabilistic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We use BLInD to find out the limitations of LLMs for tasks involving probabilistic reasoning. In addition, we present several prompting strategies that map the problem to different formal representations, including Python code, probabilistic algorithms, and probabilistic logical programming. We conclude by providing an evaluation of our methods on BLInD and an adaptation of a causal reasoning question-answering dataset. Our empirical results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed strategies for multiple LLMs.

### Enhancing Whisper's Accuracy and Speed for Indian Languages through   Prompt-Tuning and Tokenization
**Authors**: Kumud Tripathi, Raj Gothi, Pankaj Wasnik

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T18:32:24Z

**Summary**: Automatic speech recognition has recently seen a significant advancement with large foundational models such as Whisper. However, these models often struggle to perform well in low-resource languages, such as Indian languages. This paper explores two novel approaches to enhance Whisper's multilingual speech recognition performance in Indian languages. First, we propose prompt-tuning with language family information, which enhances Whisper's accuracy in linguistically similar languages. Second, we introduce a novel tokenizer that reduces the number of generated tokens, thereby accelerating Whisper's inference speed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the tokenizer significantly reduces inference time, while prompt-tuning enhances accuracy across various Whisper model sizes, including Small, Medium, and Large. Together, these techniques achieve a balance between optimal WER and inference speed.

### Can AI Help with Your Personal Finances?
**Authors**: Oudom Hean, Utsha Saha, Binita Saha

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T18:25:27Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative development in artificial intelligence (AI), drawing significant attention from industry and academia. Trained on vast datasets, these sophisticated AI systems exhibit impressive natural language processing and content generation capabilities. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to address key challenges in personal finance, focusing on the United States. We evaluate several leading LLMs, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's Llama, to assess their effectiveness in providing accurate financial advice on topics such as mortgages, taxes, loans, and investments. Our findings show that while these models achieve an average accuracy rate of approximately 70%, they also display notable limitations in certain areas. Specifically, LLMs struggle to provide accurate responses for complex financial queries, with performance varying significantly across different topics. Despite these limitations, the analysis reveals notable improvements in newer versions of these models, highlighting their growing utility for individuals and financial advisors. As these AI systems continue to evolve, their potential for advancing AI-driven applications in personal finance becomes increasingly promising.

### DAG-aware Transformer for Causal Effect Estimation
**Authors**: Manqing Liu, David R. Bellamy, Andrew L. Beam

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T18:16:12Z

**Summary**: Causal inference is a critical task across fields such as healthcare, economics, and the social sciences. While recent advances in machine learning, especially those based on the deep-learning architectures, have shown potential in estimating causal effects, existing approaches often fall short in handling complex causal structures and lack adaptability across various causal scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel transformer-based method for causal inference that overcomes these challenges. The core innovation of our model lies in its integration of causal Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) directly into the attention mechanism, enabling it to accurately model the underlying causal structure. This allows for flexible estimation of both average treatment effects (ATE) and conditional average treatment effects (CATE). Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing methods in estimating causal effects across a wide range of scenarios. The flexibility and robustness of our model make it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners tackling complex causal inference problems.

### Fortran2CPP: Automating Fortran-to-C++ Migration using LLMs via   Multi-Turn Dialogue and Dual-Agent Integration
**Authors**: Le Chen, Bin Lei, Dunzhi Zhou, Pei-Hung Lin, Chunhua Liao, Caiwen Ding, Ali Jannesari

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T18:06:25Z

**Summary**: Migrating Fortran code to C++ is a common task for many scientific computing teams, driven by the need to leverage modern programming paradigms, enhance cross-platform compatibility, and improve maintainability. Automating this translation process using large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, but the lack of high-quality, specialized datasets has hindered their effectiveness. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel multi-turn dialogue dataset, Fortran2CPP, specifically designed for Fortran-to-C++ code migration. Our dataset, significantly larger than existing alternatives, is generated using a unique LLM-driven, dual-agent pipeline incorporating iterative compilation, execution, and code repair to ensure high quality and functional correctness. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset, we fine-tuned several open-weight LLMs on Fortran2CPP and evaluated their performance on two independent benchmarks. Fine-tuning on our dataset led to remarkable gains, with models achieving up to a 3.31x increase in CodeBLEU score and a 92\% improvement in compilation success rate. This highlights the dataset's ability to enhance both the syntactic accuracy and compilability of the translated C++ code. Our dataset and model have been open-sourced and are available on our public GitHub repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/HPC-Fortran2CPP/Fortran2Cpp}}.

### CHESS: Optimizing LLM Inference via Channel-Wise Thresholding and   Selective Sparsification
**Authors**: Junhui He, Shangyu Wu, Weidong Wen, Chun Jason Xue, Qingan Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T17:49:34Z

**Summary**: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices presents significant challenges due to the substantial computational overhead and memory requirements. Activation sparsification can mitigate these resource challenges by reducing the number of activated neurons during inference. Existing methods typically employ thresholding-based sparsification based on the statistics of activation tensors. However, they do not model the impact of activation sparsification on performance, resulting in suboptimal performance degradation. To address the limitations, this paper reformulates the activation sparsification problem to explicitly capture the relationship between activation sparsity and model performance. Then, this paper proposes CHESS, a general activation sparsification approach via CHannel-wise thrEsholding and Selective Sparsification. First, channel-wise thresholding assigns a unique threshold to each activation channel in the feed-forward network (FFN) layers. Then, selective sparsification involves applying thresholding-based activation sparsification to specific layers within the attention modules. Finally, we detail the implementation of sparse kernels to accelerate LLM inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CHESS achieves lower performance degradation over eight downstream tasks while activating fewer parameters than existing methods, thus speeding up the LLM inference by up to 1.27x.

### "Did my figure do justice to the answer?" : Towards Multimodal Short   Answer Grading with Feedback (MMSAF)
**Authors**: Pritam Sil, Bhaskaran Raman, Pushpak Bhattacharyya

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T17:33:39Z

**Summary**: Personalized feedback plays a vital role in a student's learning process. While existing systems are adept at providing feedback over MCQ-based evaluation, this work focuses more on subjective and open-ended questions, which is similar to the problem of Automatic Short Answer Grading (ASAG) with feedback. Additionally, we introduce the Multimodal Short Answer grading with Feedback (MMSAF) problem over the traditional ASAG feedback problem to address the scenario where the student answer and reference answer might contain images. Moreover, we introduce the MMSAF dataset with 2197 data points along with an automated framework for generating such data sets. Our evaluations on existing LLMs over this dataset achieved an overall accuracy of 55\% on Level of Correctness labels, 75\% on Image Relevance labels and a score of 4.27 out of 5 in correctness level of LLM generated feedback as rated by experts. As per experts, Pixtral achieved a rating of above 4 out of all metrics, indicating that it is more aligned to human judgement, and that it is the best solution for assisting students.

### Learning to Forget: Bayesian Time Series Forecasting using Recurrent   Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes
**Authors**: Csaba Tóth, Masaki Adachi, Michael A. Osborne, Harald Oberhauser

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T16:31:09Z

**Summary**: The signature kernel is a kernel between time series of arbitrary length and comes with strong theoretical guarantees from stochastic analysis. It has found applications in machine learning such as covariance functions for Gaussian processes. A strength of the underlying signature features is that they provide a structured global description of a time series. However, this property can quickly become a curse when local information is essential and forgetting is required; so far this has only been addressed with ad-hoc methods such as slicing the time series into subsegments. To overcome this, we propose a principled, data-driven approach by introducing a novel forgetting mechanism for signatures. This allows the model to dynamically adapt its context length to focus on more recent information. To achieve this, we revisit the recently introduced Random Fourier Signature Features, and develop Random Fourier Decayed Signature Features (RFDSF) with Gaussian processes (GPs). This results in a Bayesian time series forecasting algorithm with variational inference, that offers a scalable probabilistic algorithm that processes and transforms a time series into a joint predictive distribution over time steps in one pass using recurrence. For example, processing a sequence of length $10^4$ steps in $\approx 10^{-2}$ seconds and in $< 1\text{GB}$ of GPU memory. We demonstrate that it outperforms other GP-based alternatives and competes with state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting algorithms.

### Can Large Language Models Adapt to Other Agents In-Context?
**Authors**: Matthew Riemer, Zahra Ashktorab, Djallel Bouneffouf, Payel Das, Miao Liu, Justin D. Weisz, Murray Campbell

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T16:30:12Z

**Summary**: As the research community aims to build better AI assistants that are more dynamic and personalized to the diversity of humans that they interact with, there is increased interest in evaluating the theory of mind capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Indeed, several recent studies suggest that LLM theory of mind capabilities are quite impressive, approximating human-level performance. Our paper aims to rebuke this narrative and argues instead that past studies were not directly measuring agent performance, potentially leading to findings that are illusory in nature as a result. We draw a strong distinction between what we call literal theory of mind i.e. measuring the agent's ability to predict the behavior of others and functional theory of mind i.e. adapting to agents in-context based on a rational response to predictions of their behavior. We find that top performing open source LLMs may display strong capabilities in literal theory of mind, depending on how they are prompted, but seem to struggle with functional theory of mind -- even when partner policies are exceedingly simple. Our work serves to highlight the double sided nature of inductive bias in LLMs when adapting to new situations. While this bias can lead to strong performance over limited horizons, it often hinders convergence to optimal long-term behavior.

### Gradient Alignment Improves Test-Time Adaptation for Medical Image   Segmentation
**Authors**: Ziyang Chen, Yiwen Ye, Yongsheng Pan, Yong Xia

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T16:29:25Z

**Summary**: Although recent years have witnessed significant advancements in medical image segmentation, the pervasive issue of domain shift among medical images from diverse centres hinders the effective deployment of pre-trained models. Many Test-time Adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to address this issue by fine-tuning pre-trained models with test data during inference. These methods, however, often suffer from less-satisfactory optimization due to suboptimal optimization direction (dictated by the gradient) and fixed step-size (predicated on the learning rate). In this paper, we propose the Gradient alignment-based Test-time adaptation (GraTa) method to improve both the gradient direction and learning rate in the optimization procedure. Unlike conventional TTA methods, which primarily optimize the pseudo gradient derived from a self-supervised objective, our method incorporates an auxiliary gradient with the pseudo one to facilitate gradient alignment. Such gradient alignment enables the model to excavate the similarities between different gradients and correct the gradient direction to approximate the empirical gradient related to the current segmentation task. Additionally, we design a dynamic learning rate based on the cosine similarity between the pseudo and auxiliary gradients, thereby empowering the adaptive fine-tuning of pre-trained models on diverse test data. Extensive experiments establish the effectiveness of the proposed gradient alignment and dynamic learning rate and substantiate the superiority of our GraTa method over other state-of-the-art TTA methods on a benchmark medical image segmentation task. The code and weights of pre-trained source models are available at https://github.com/Chen-Ziyang/GraTa.

### Toward Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models with Thought Rollback
**Authors**: Sijia Chen, Baochun Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T16:02:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been routinely used to solve various tasks using step-by-step reasoning. However, the structure of intermediate reasoning steps, or thoughts, is rigid and unidirectional, such as chains, trees, or acyclic-directed graphs. Consequently, the resulting inflexible and forward-only reasoning may not address challenging tasks and fail when the LLM frequently gives false responses, i.e., ``hallucinations''. This paper proposes a new reasoning framework, called Thought Rollback (TR), allowing LLMs to adaptively build thought structure while maintaining effective reasoning toward problem-solving under ``hallucinations''. The core mechanism of TR is rolling back thoughts, which allows LLMs to perform error analysis on thoughts, and thus roll back to any previously mistaken thought for revision. Subsequently, by including such trial-and-error in the prompt to guide the LLM, each rollback leads to one more reliable reasoning path. Therefore, starting with a simple prompt without human annotations, LLM with TR adaptively and gradually explores thoughts for a correct solution. Comprehensive experiments on mathematical problems and multi-task reasoning demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TR in terms of problem-solving rate and interaction cost. For instance, the solving rate of GPT-4 with TR outperforms the current best by $9\%$ on the MATH dataset.

### RUBIES: JWST/NIRSpec Confirmation of an Infrared-luminous, Broad-line   Little Red Dot with an Ionized Outflow

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T15:37:01Z

**Summary**: The JWST discovery of ``little red dots'' (LRDs) is reshaping our picture of the early Universe, yet the physical mechanisms driving their compact size and UV-optical colors remain elusive. Here we report an unusually bright LRD ($z=3.1$) observed as part of the RUBIES program. This LRD exhibits broad emission lines (FWHM $\sim4000$km/s), a blue UV continuum, a clear Balmer break and a red continuum sampled out to rest 4 $\mu$m with MIRI. We develop a new joint galaxy and AGN model within the Prospector Bayesian inference framework and perform spectrophotometric modeling using NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/Prism observations. Our fiducial model reveals a $M_*\sim 10^9M_\odot$ galaxy alongside a dust-reddened AGN driving the optical emission. Explaining the rest-frame optical color as a reddened AGN requires $A_{\rm v}\gtrsim3$, suggesting that a great majority of the accretion disk energy is re-radiated as dust emission. Yet despite clear AGN signatures, we find a surprising lack of hot torus emission, which implies that either the dust emission in this object must be cold, or the red continuum must instead be driven by a massive, evolved stellar population of the host galaxy -- seemingly inconsistent with the high EW broad lines (H$\alpha$ EW $\sim800$\AA). The widths and luminosities of Pa$\beta$, Pa$\delta$, Pa$\gamma$, and H$\alpha$ imply a modest black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^8M_\odot$. Additionally, we identify a narrow blue-shifted HeI absorption in G395M spectra, signaling an ionized outflow with kinetic energy up to $\sim1$\% the luminosity of the AGN. The low redshift of RUBIES-BLAGN-1 combined with the depth and richness of the JWST imaging and spectroscopic observations provide a unique opportunity to build a physical model for these so-far mysterious LRDs, which may prove to be a crucial phase in the early formation of massive galaxies and their supermassive black holes.

### Context-aware Inductive Knowledge Graph Completion with Latent Type   Constraints and Subgraph Reasoning
**Authors**: Muzhi Li, Cehao Yang, Chengjin Xu, Zixing Song, Xuhui Jiang, Jian Guo, Ho-fung Leung, Irwin King

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T15:32:01Z

**Summary**: Inductive knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples with unseen entities. Recent works focus on modeling reasoning paths between the head and tail entity as direct supporting evidence. However, these methods depend heavily on the existence and quality of reasoning paths, which limits their general applicability in different scenarios. In addition, we observe that latent type constraints and neighboring facts inherent in KGs are also vital in inferring missing triples. To effectively utilize all useful information in KGs, we introduce CATS, a novel context-aware inductive KGC solution. With sufficient guidance from proper prompts and supervised fine-tuning, CATS activates the strong semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models to assess the existence of query triples, which consist of two modules. First, the type-aware reasoning module evaluates whether the candidate entity matches the latent entity type as required by the query relation. Then, the subgraph reasoning module selects relevant reasoning paths and neighboring facts, and evaluates their correlation to the query triple. Experiment results on three widely used datasets demonstrate that CATS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 16 out of 18 transductive, inductive, and few-shot settings with an average absolute MRR improvement of 7.2%.

### A Hybrid Technique for Plant Disease Identification and Localisation in   Real-time
**Authors**: Mahendra Kumar Gohil, Anirudha Bhattacharjee, Rwik Rana, Kishan Lal, Samir Kumar Biswas, Nachiketa Tiwari, Bishakh Bhattacharya

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T15:20:45Z

**Summary**: Over the past decade, several image-processing methods and algorithms have been proposed for identifying plant diseases based on visual data. DNN (Deep Neural Networks) have recently become popular for this task. Both traditional image processing and DNN-based methods encounter significant performance issues in real-time detection owing to computational limitations and a broad spectrum of plant disease features. This article proposes a novel technique for identifying and localising plant disease based on the Quad-Tree decomposition of an image and feature learning simultaneously. The proposed algorithm significantly improves accuracy and faster convergence in high-resolution images with relatively low computational load. Hence it is ideal for deploying the algorithm in a standalone processor in a remotely operated image acquisition and disease detection system, ideally mounted on drones and robots working on large agricultural fields. The technique proposed in this article is hybrid as it exploits the advantages of traditional image processing methods and DNN-based models at different scales, resulting in faster inference. The F1 score is approximately 0.80 for four disease classes corresponding to potato and tomato crops.

### Intertwining CP and NLP: The Generation of Unreasonably Constrained   Sentences
**Authors**: Alexandre Bonlarron, Jean-Charles Régin

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T14:56:10Z

**Summary**: Constrained text generation remains a challenging task, particularly when dealing with hard constraints. Traditional NLP approaches prioritize generating meaningful and coherent output. Also, the current state-of-the-art methods often lack the expressiveness and constraint satisfaction capabilities to handle such tasks effectively. Recently, an approach for generating constrained sentences in CP has been proposed in (Bonlarron et al, 2023). This ad-hoc model to solve the sentences generation problem under MNREAD rules proved neithertheless to be computationaly and structuraly unsuitable to deal with other more constrained problems. In this paper, a novel more generic approach is introduced to tackle many of these previously untractable problems, and illustrated here with the quite untractable sentences generation problem following RADNER rules.   More precisely, this paper presents the CPTextGen Framework. This framework considers a constrained text generation problem as a discrete combinatorial optimization problem. It is solved by a constraint programming method that combines linguistic properties (e.g., n-grams or language level) with other more classical constraints (e.g., the number of characters, syllables). Eventually, a curation phase allows for selecting the best-generated sentences according to perplexity using an LLM.   The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by tackling a new, more tediously constrained text generation problem: the iconic RADNER sentences problem. This problem aims to generate sentences respecting a set of quite strict rules defined by their use in vision and clinical research. Thanks to our CP-based approach, many new strongly constrained sentences have been successfully generated. This highlights our approach's potential to handle unreasonably constrained text generation scenarios.

### Lusifer: LLM-based User SImulated Feedback Environment for online   Recommender systems
**Authors**: Danial Ebrat, Eli Paradalis, Luis Rueda

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T14:44:30Z

**Summary**: Training reinforcement learning-based recommender systems is often hindered by the lack of dynamic and realistic user interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce Lusifer, a novel environment leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate simulated user feedback. Lusifer synthesizes user profiles and interaction histories to simulate responses and behaviors toward recommended items, with profiles updated after each rating to reflect evolving user characteristics. Utilizing the MovieLens dataset as a proof of concept, we limited our implementation to the last 40 interactions for each user, representing approximately 39% and 22% of the training sets, to focus on recent user behavior. For consistency and to gain insights into the performance of traditional methods with limited data, we implemented baseline approaches using the same data subset. Our results demonstrate that Lusifer accurately emulates user behavior and preferences, even with reduced training data having an RMSE of 1.3 across various test sets. This paper presents Lusifer's operational pipeline, including prompt generation and iterative user profile updates, and compares its performance against baseline methods. The findings validate Lusifer's ability to produce realistic dynamic feedback and suggest that it offers a scalable and adjustable framework for user simulation in online reinforcement learning recommender systems for future studies, particularly when training data is limited.

### Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$α$ and H$β$ active   galactic nuclei using radius--luminosity relations involving monochromatic   and broad H$α$ luminosities
**Authors**: Shulei Cao, Amit Kumar Mandal, Michal Zajaček, Bożena Czerny, Bharat Ratra

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T14:23:31Z

**Summary**: We test the standardizability of a homogeneous sample of 41 lower-redshift ($0.00415\leq z \leq 0.474$) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reverberation-mapped (RM) using the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. We find that these sources can be standardized using four radius$-$luminosity ($R-L$) relations incorporating H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ time delays and monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities. Although the $R-L$ relation parameters are well constrained and independent of the six cosmological models considered, the resulting cosmological constraints are weak. The measured $R-L$ relations exhibit slightly steeper slopes than predicted by a simple photoionization model and steeper than those from previous higher-redshift H$\beta$ analyses based on larger datasets. These differences likely reflect the absence of high-accreting sources in our smaller, lower-redshift sample, which primarily comprises lower-accreting AGNs. The inferred cosmological parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ (or better) with those from better-established cosmological probes. This contrasts with our earlier findings using a larger, heterogeneous sample of 118 H$\beta$ AGNs, which yielded cosmological constraints differing by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ from better-established cosmological probes. Our analysis demonstrates that sample homogeneity$-$specifically, the use of a consistent time-lag determination method$-$is crucial for developing RM AGNs as a cosmological probe.

### CAD-GPT: Synthesising CAD Construction Sequence with Spatial   Reasoning-Enhanced Multimodal LLMs
**Authors**: Siyu Wang, Cailian Chen, Xinyi Le, Qimin Xu, Lei Xu, Yanzhou Zhang, Jie Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T14:19:36Z

**Summary**: Computer-aided design (CAD) significantly enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and innovation of design processes by enabling precise 2D and 3D modeling, extensive analysis, and optimization. Existing methods for creating CAD models rely on latent vectors or point clouds, which are difficult to obtain and costly to store. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have inspired researchers to use natural language instructions and images for CAD model construction. However, these models still struggle with inferring accurate 3D spatial location and orientation, leading to inaccuracies in determining the spatial 3D starting points and extrusion directions for constructing geometries. This work introduces CAD-GPT, a CAD synthesis method with spatial reasoning-enhanced MLLM that takes either a single image or a textual description as input. To achieve precise spatial inference, our approach introduces a 3D Modeling Spatial Mechanism. This method maps 3D spatial positions and 3D sketch plane rotation angles into a 1D linguistic feature space using a specialized spatial unfolding mechanism, while discretizing 2D sketch coordinates into an appropriate planar space to enable precise determination of spatial starting position, sketch orientation, and 2D sketch coordinate translations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAD-GPT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in CAD model synthesis, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

### Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents
**Authors**: Haishuo Fang, Xiaodan Zhu, Iryna Gurevych

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T14:17:05Z

**Summary**: Deploying LLM-based agents in real-life applications often faces a critical challenge: the misalignment between agents' behavior and user intent. Such misalignment may lead agents to unintentionally execute critical actions that carry negative outcomes (e.g., accidentally triggering a "buy-now" in web shopping), resulting in undesirable or even irreversible consequences. Although addressing these issues is crucial, the preemptive detection and correction of misaligned actions remains relatively underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce InferAct, a novel approach that leverages the belief reasoning ability of LLMs, grounded in Theory-of-Mind, to detect misaligned actions before execution. Once the misalignment is detected, InferAct alerts users for timely correction, preventing adverse outcomes and enhancing the reliability of LLM agents' decision-making processes. Experiments on three widely used tasks demonstrate that InferAct achieves up to 20% improvements on Marco-F1 against baselines in misaligned action detection. An in-depth evaluation of misalignment correction further highlights InferAct's effectiveness in improving agent alignment.

### Non-separable Spatio-temporal Graph Kernels via SPDEs
**Authors**: Alexander Nikitin, ST John, Arno Solin, Samuel Kaski

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T14:08:01Z

**Summary**: Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a principled and direct approach for inference and learning on graphs. However, the lack of justified graph kernels for spatio-temporal modelling has held back their use in graph problems. We leverage an explicit link between stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and GPs on graphs, introduce a framework for deriving graph kernels via SPDEs, and derive non-separable spatio-temporal graph kernels that capture interaction across space and time. We formulate the graph kernels for the stochastic heat equation and wave equation. We show that by providing novel tools for spatio-temporal GP modelling on graphs, we outperform pre-existing graph kernels in real-world applications that feature diffusion, oscillation, and other complicated interactions.

### FreStega: A Plug-and-Play Method for Boosting Imperceptibility and   Capacity in Generative Linguistic Steganography for Real-World Scenarios
**Authors**: Kaiyi Pang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T13:56:51Z

**Summary**: Linguistic steganography embeds secret information in seemingly innocent texts, safeguarding privacy in surveillance environments. Generative linguistic steganography leverages the probability distribution of language models (LMs) and applies steganographic algorithms to generate stego tokens, gaining attention with recent Large Language Model (LLM) advancements. To enhance security, researchers develop distribution-preserving stego algorithms to minimize the gap between stego sampling and LM sampling. However, the reliance on language model distributions, coupled with deviations from real-world cover texts, results in insufficient imperceptibility when facing steganalysis detectors in real-world scenarios. Moreover, LLM distributions tend to be more deterministic, resulting in reduced entropy and, consequently, lower embedding capacity. In this paper, we propose FreStega, a plug-and-play method to reconstruct the distribution of language models used for generative linguistic steganography. FreStega dynamically adjusts token probabilities from the language model at each step of stegotext auto-regressive generation, leveraging both sequential and spatial dimensions. In sequential adjustment, the temperature is dynamically adjusted based on instantaneous entropy, enhancing the diversity of stego texts and boosting embedding capacity. In the spatial dimension, the distribution is aligned with guidance from the target domain corpus, closely mimicking real cover text in the target domain. By reforming the distribution, FreStega enhances the imperceptibility of stego text in practical scenarios and improves steganographic capacity by 15.41\%, all without compromising the quality of the generated text. FreStega serves as a plug-and-play remedy to enhance the imperceptibility and embedding capacity of existing distribution-preserving steganography methods in real-world scenarios.

### Evaluating Software Development Agents: Patch Patterns, Code Quality,   and Issue Complexity in Real-World GitHub Scenarios
**Authors**: Zhi Chen, Lingxiao Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T13:52:05Z

**Summary**: In recent years, AI-based software engineering has progressed from pre-trained models to advanced agentic workflows, with Software Development Agents representing the next major leap. These agents, capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with external environments, offer promising solutions to complex software engineering tasks. However, while much research has evaluated code generated by large language models (LLMs), comprehensive studies on agent-generated patches, particularly in real-world settings, are lacking. This study addresses that gap by evaluating 4,892 patches from 10 top-ranked agents on 500 real-world GitHub issues from SWE-Bench Verified, focusing on their impact on code quality. Our analysis shows no single agent dominated, with 170 issues unresolved, indicating room for improvement. Even for patches that passed unit tests and resolved issues, agents made different file and function modifications compared to the gold patches from repository developers, revealing limitations in the benchmark's test case coverage. Most agents maintained code reliability and security, avoiding new bugs or vulnerabilities; while some agents increased code complexity, many reduced code duplication and minimized code smells. Finally, agents performed better on simpler codebases, suggesting that breaking complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks could improve effectiveness. This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of agent-generated patches on real-world GitHub issues, offering insights to advance AI-driven software development.

### ReNeg: Learning Negative Embedding with Reward Guidance
**Authors**: Xiaomin Li, Yixuan Liu, Takashi Isobe, Xu Jia, Qinpeng Cui, Dong Zhou, Dong Li, You He, Huchuan Lu, Zhongdao Wang, Emad Barsoum

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T13:31:55Z

**Summary**: In text-to-image (T2I) generation applications, negative embeddings have proven to be a simple yet effective approach for enhancing generation quality. Typically, these negative embeddings are derived from user-defined negative prompts, which, while being functional, are not necessarily optimal. In this paper, we introduce ReNeg, an end-to-end method designed to learn improved Negative embeddings guided by a Reward model. We employ a reward feedback learning framework and integrate classifier-free guidance (CFG) into the training process, which was previously utilized only during inference, thus enabling the effective learning of negative embeddings. We also propose two strategies for learning both global and per-sample negative embeddings. Extensive experiments show that the learned negative embedding significantly outperforms null-text and handcrafted counterparts, achieving substantial improvements in human preference alignment. Additionally, the negative embedding learned within the same text embedding space exhibits strong generalization capabilities. For example, using the same CLIP text encoder, the negative embedding learned on SD1.5 can be seamlessly transferred to text-to-image or even text-to-video models such as ControlNet, ZeroScope, and VideoCrafter2, resulting in consistent performance improvements across the board.

**Authors**: Fatma Yasmine Loumachi, Mohamed Chahine Ghanem, Mohamed Amine Ferrag

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T13:29:14Z

**Summary**: Cyber timeline analysis, or forensic timeline analysis, is crucial in Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). It examines artefacts and events particularly timestamps and metadata to detect anomalies, establish correlations, and reconstruct incident timelines. Traditional methods rely on structured artefacts, such as logs and filesystem metadata, using specialised tools for evidence identification and feature extraction. This paper introduces GenDFIR, a framework leveraging large language models (LLMs), specifically Llama 3.1 8B in zero shot mode, integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent. Incident data is preprocessed into a structured knowledge base, enabling the RAG agent to retrieve relevant events based on user prompts. The LLM interprets this context, offering semantic enrichment. Tested on synthetic data in a controlled environment, results demonstrate GenDFIR's reliability and robustness, showcasing LLMs potential to automate timeline analysis and advance threat detection.

### IMTP: Search-based Code Generation for In-memory Tensor Programs
**Authors**: Yongwon Shin, Dookyung Kang, Hyojin Sung

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T13:19:35Z

**Summary**: Processing-in-DRAM (DRAM-PIM) has emerged as a promising technology for accelerating memory-intensive operations in modern applications, such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its potential, current software stacks for DRAM-PIM face significant challenges, including reliance on hand-tuned libraries that hinder programmability, limited support for high-level abstractions, and the lack of systematic optimization frameworks. To address these limitations, we present IMTP, a search-based optimizing tensor compiler for UPMEM. Key features of IMTP include: (1) automated searches of the joint search space for host and kernel tensor programs, (2) PIM-aware optimizations for efficiently handling boundary conditions, and (3) improved search algorithms for the expanded search space of UPMEM systems. Our experimental results on UPMEM hardware demonstrate performance gains of up to 8.21x for various UPMEM benchmark kernels and 5.33x for GPT-J layers. To the best of our knowledge, IMTP is the first tensor compiler to provide fully automated, autotuning-integrated code generation support for a DRAM-PIM system. By bridging the gap between high-level tensor computation abstractions and low-level hardware-specific requirements, IMTP establishes a foundation for advancing DRAM-PIM programmability and enabling streamlined optimization.

### Signatures of prediction during natural listening in MEG data?
**Authors**: Sahel Azizpour, Britta U. Westner, Jakub Szewczyk, Umut Güçlü, Linda Geerligs

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T12:49:03Z

**Summary**: The brain uses contextual information and prior knowledge to anticipate upcoming content during language comprehension. Recent research has shown predictive signals can be revealed in pre-onset ECoG activity during naturalistic narrative listening, by building encoding models based on word embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs). Similarly, evidence for long-range predictive encoding has been observed in fMRI data, where incorporating embeddings for multiple upcoming words in a narrative improves alignment with brain activity. This study examines whether similar predictive information can be detected in MEG, a technique with higher temporal resolution than fMRI but a lower signal-to-noise ratio than ECoG. Our findings indicate that MEG captures pre-onset representations up to 1 second before word onset, consistent with ECoG results. However, unlike fMRI findings, incorporating future word embeddings did not enhance MEG encoding, even for one word into the future, which suggests that the pre-onset encoding may not reflect predictive processing. This work demonstrates that MEG combined with LLMs is a valuable approach for studying language processing in naturalistic narratives and highlights the need to study further what constitutes evidence for prediction during natural listening.

### Gradient Weight-normalized Low-rank Projection for Efficient LLM   Training
**Authors**: Jia-Hong Huang, Yixian Shen, Hongyi Zhu, Stevan Rudinac, Evangelos Kanoulas

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T12:23:39Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various tasks, but the escalating demands on computational resources pose significant challenges, particularly in the extensive utilization of full fine-tuning for downstream tasks. To address this, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been developed, but they often underperform compared to full fine-tuning and struggle with memory efficiency. In this work, we introduce Gradient Weight-Normalized Low-Rank Projection (GradNormLoRP), a novel approach that enhances both parameter and memory efficiency while maintaining comparable performance to full fine-tuning. GradNormLoRP normalizes the weight matrix to improve gradient conditioning, facilitating better convergence during optimization. Additionally, it applies low-rank approximations to the weight and gradient matrices, significantly reducing memory usage during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 8-bit GradNormLoRP reduces optimizer memory usage by up to 89.5% and enables the pre-training of large LLMs, such as LLaMA 7B, on consumer-level GPUs like the NVIDIA RTX 4090, without additional inference costs. Moreover, GradNormLoRP outperforms existing low-rank methods in fine-tuning tasks. For instance, when fine-tuning the RoBERTa model on all GLUE tasks with a rank of 8, GradNormLoRP achieves an average score of 80.65, surpassing LoRA's score of 79.23. These results underscore GradNormLoRP as a promising alternative for efficient LLM pre-training and fine-tuning.

### Machine Generated Product Advertisements: Benchmarking LLMs Against   Human Performance
**Authors**: Sanjukta Ghosh

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T12:11:50Z

**Summary**: This study compares the performance of AI-generated and human-written product descriptions using a multifaceted evaluation model. We analyze descriptions for 100 products generated by four AI models (Gemma 2B, LLAMA, GPT2, and ChatGPT 4) with and without sample descriptions, against human-written descriptions. Our evaluation metrics include sentiment, readability, persuasiveness, Search Engine Optimization(SEO), clarity, emotional appeal, and call-to-action effectiveness. The results indicate that ChatGPT 4 performs the best. In contrast, other models demonstrate significant shortcomings, producing incoherent and illogical output that lacks logical structure and contextual relevance. These models struggle to maintain focus on the product being described, resulting in disjointed sentences that do not convey meaningful information. This research provides insights into the current capabilities and limitations of AI in the creation of content for e-Commerce.

### SocRATES: Towards Automated Scenario-based Testing of Social Navigation   Algorithms
**Authors**: Shashank Rao Marpally, Pranav Goyal, Harold Soh

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T11:33:19Z

**Summary**: Current social navigation methods and benchmarks primarily focus on proxemics and task efficiency. While these factors are important, qualitative aspects such as perceptions of a robot's social competence are equally crucial for successful adoption and integration into human environments. We propose a more comprehensive evaluation of social navigation through scenario-based testing, where specific human-robot interaction scenarios can reveal key robot behaviors. However, creating such scenarios is often labor-intensive and complex. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a pipeline that automates the generation of context-, and location-appropriate social navigation scenarios, ready for simulation. Our pipeline transforms simple scenario metadata into detailed textual scenarios, infers pedestrian and robot trajectories, and simulates pedestrian behaviors, which enables more controlled evaluation. We leverage the social reasoning and code-generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline scenario generation and translation. Our experiments show that our pipeline produces realistic scenarios and significantly improves scenario translation over naive LLM prompting. Additionally, we present initial feedback from a usability study with social navigation experts and a case-study demonstrating a scenario-based evaluation of three navigation algorithms.

### Goal-oriented Communications based on Recursive Early Exit Neural   Networks
**Authors**: Jary Pomponi, Mattia Merluzzi, Alessio Devoto, Mateus Pontes Mota, Paolo Di Lorenzo, Simone Scardapane

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T11:14:11Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a novel framework for goal-oriented semantic communications leveraging recursive early exit models. The proposed approach is built on two key components. First, we introduce an innovative early exit strategy that dynamically partitions computations, enabling samples to be offloaded to a server based on layer-wise recursive prediction dynamics that detect samples for which the confidence is not increasing fast enough over layers. Second, we develop a Reinforcement Learning-based online optimization framework that jointly determines early exit points, computation splitting, and offloading strategies, while accounting for wireless conditions, inference accuracy, and resource costs. Numerical evaluations in an edge inference scenario demonstrate the method's adaptability and effectiveness in striking an excellent trade-off between performance, latency, and resource efficiency.

### Impact of phylogeny on the inference of functional sectors from protein   sequence data
**Authors**: Nicola Dietler, Alia Abbara, Subham Choudhury, Anne-Florence Bitbol

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T10:50:33Z

**Summary**: Statistical analysis of multiple sequence alignments of homologous proteins has revealed groups of coevolving amino acids called sectors. These groups of amino-acid sites feature collective correlations in their amino-acid usage, and they are associated to functional properties. Modeling showed that nonlinear selection on an additive functional trait of a protein is generically expected to give rise to a functional sector. These modeling results motivated a principled method, called ICOD, which is designed to identify functional sectors, as well as mutational effects, from sequence data. However, a challenge for all methods aiming to identify sectors from multiple sequence alignments is that correlations in amino-acid usage can also arise from the mere fact that homologous sequences share common ancestry, i.e. from phylogeny. Here, we generate controlled synthetic data from a minimal model comprising both phylogeny and functional sectors. We use this data to dissect the impact of phylogeny on sector identification and on mutational effect inference by different methods. We find that ICOD is most robust to phylogeny, but that conservation is also quite robust. Next, we consider natural multiple sequence alignments of protein families for which deep mutational scan experimental data is available. We show that in this natural data, conservation and ICOD best identify sites with strong functional roles, in agreement with our results on synthetic data. Importantly, these two methods have different premises, since they respectively focus on conservation and on correlations. Thus, their joint use can reveal complementary information.

### Hybrid Population Monte Carlo
**Authors**: Ali Mousavi, Víctor Elvira

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T10:46:13Z

**Summary**: Importance sampling (IS) is a powerful Monte Carlo (MC) technique for approximating intractable integrals, for instance in Bayesian inference. The performance of IS relies heavily on the appropriate choice of the so-called proposal distribution. Adaptive IS (AIS) methods iteratively improve target estimates by adapting the proposal distribution. Recent AIS research focuses on enhancing proposal adaptation for high-dimensional problems, while addressing the challenge of multi-modal targets. In this paper, a new class of AIS methods is presented, utilizing a hybrid approach that incorporates weighted samples and proposal distributions to enhance performance. This approach belongs to the family of population Monte Carlo (PMC) algorithms, where a population of proposals is adapted to better approximate the target distribution. The proposed hybrid population Monte Carlo (HPMC) implements a novel two-step adaptation mechanism. In the first step, a hybrid method is used to generate the population of the preliminary proposal locations based on both weighted samples and location parameters. We use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to generate the preliminary proposal locations. HMC has a good exploratory behavior, especially in high dimension scenarios. In the second step, the novel cooperation algorithms are performing to find the final proposals for the next iteration. HPMC achieves a significant performance improvement in high-dimensional problems when compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. We discuss the statistical properties of HPMC and show its high performance in two challenging benchmarks.

### Official-NV: An LLM-Generated News Video Dataset for Multimodal Fake   News Detection
**Authors**: Yihao Wang, Lizhi Chen, Zhong Qian, Peifeng Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T10:34:15Z

**Summary**: News media, especially video news media, have penetrated into every aspect of daily life, which also brings the risk of fake news. Therefore, multimodal fake news detection has recently garnered increased attention. However, the existing datasets are comprised of user-uploaded videos and contain an excess amounts of superfluous data, which introduces noise into the model training process. To address this issue, we construct a dataset named Official-NV, comprising officially published news videos. The crawl officially published videos are augmented through the use of LLMs-based generation and manual verification, thereby expanding the dataset. We also propose a new baseline model called OFNVD, which captures key information from multimodal features through a GLU attention mechanism and performs feature enhancement and modal aggregation via a cross-modal Transformer. Benchmarking the dataset and baselines demonstrates the effectiveness of our model in multimodal news detection.

### The Current Challenges of Software Engineering in the Era of Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Cuiyun Gao, Xing Hu, Shan Gao, Xin Xia, Zhi Jin

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T10:17:12Z

**Summary**: With the advent of large language models (LLMs) in the artificial intelligence (AI) area, the field of software engineering (SE) has also witnessed a paradigm shift. These models, by leveraging the power of deep learning and massive amounts of data, have demonstrated an unprecedented capacity to understand, generate, and operate programming languages. They can assist developers in completing a broad spectrum of software development activities, encompassing software design, automated programming, and maintenance, which potentially reduces huge human efforts. Integrating LLMs within the SE landscape (LLM4SE) has become a burgeoning trend, necessitating exploring this emergent landscape's challenges and opportunities.   The paper aims at revisiting the software development life cycle (SDLC) under LLMs, and highlighting challenges and opportunities of the new paradigm. The paper first summarizes the overall process of LLM4SE, and then elaborates on the current challenges based on a through discussion. The discussion was held among more than 20 participants from academia and industry, specializing in fields such as software engineering and artificial intelligence. Specifically, we achieve 26 key challenges from seven aspects, including software requirement & design, coding assistance, testing code generation, code review, code maintenance, software vulnerability management, and data, training, and evaluation. We hope the achieved challenges would benefit future research in the LLM4SE field.

### Agent-OM: Leveraging LLM Agents for Ontology Matching
**Authors**: Zhangcheng Qiang, Weiqing Wang, Kerry Taylor

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T10:12:28Z

**Summary**: Ontology matching (OM) enables semantic interoperability between different ontologies and resolves their conceptual heterogeneity by aligning related entities. OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems. While large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents have revolutionised data engineering and have been applied creatively in many domains, their potential for OM remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With consideration of several specific challenges in leveraging LLM agents for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM (Agent for Ontology Matching), consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve results very close to the long-standing best performance on simple OM tasks and can significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks.

### Hindsight Planner: A Closed-Loop Few-Shot Planner for Embodied   Instruction Following
**Authors**: Yuxiao Yang, Shenao Zhang, Zhihan Liu, Huaxiu Yao, Zhaoran Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T10:05:45Z

**Summary**: This work focuses on building a task planner for Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) using Large Language Models (LLMs). Previous works typically train a planner to imitate expert trajectories, treating this as a supervised task. While these methods achieve competitive performance, they often lack sufficient robustness. When a suboptimal action is taken, the planner may encounter an out-of-distribution state, which can lead to task failure. In contrast, we frame the task as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and aim to develop a robust planner under a few-shot assumption. Thus, we propose a closed-loop planner with an adaptation module and a novel hindsight method, aiming to use as much information as possible to assist the planner. Our experiments on the ALFRED dataset indicate that our planner achieves competitive performance under a few-shot assumption. For the first time, our few-shot agent's performance approaches and even surpasses that of the full-shot supervised agent.

### Filtered data based estimators for stochastic processes driven by   colored noise
**Authors**: Grigorios A. Pavliotis, Sebastian Reich, Andrea Zanoni

**Summary**: We consider the problem of estimating unknown parameters in stochastic differential equations driven by colored noise, which we model as a sequence of Gaussian stationary processes with decreasing correlation time. We aim to infer parameters in the limit equation, driven by white noise, given observations of the colored noise dynamics. We consider both the maximum likelihood and the stochastic gradient descent in continuous time estimators, and we propose to modify them by including filtered data. We provide a convergence analysis for our estimators showing their asymptotic unbiasedness in a general setting and asymptotic normality under a simplified scenario.

### SurgiTrack: Fine-Grained Multi-Class Multi-Tool Tracking in Surgical   Videos
**Authors**: Chinedu Innocent Nwoye, Nicolas Padoy

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T09:24:45Z

**Summary**: Accurate tool tracking is essential for the success of computer-assisted intervention. Previous efforts often modeled tool trajectories rigidly, overlooking the dynamic nature of surgical procedures, especially tracking scenarios like out-of-body and out-of-camera views. Addressing this limitation, the new CholecTrack20 dataset provides detailed labels that account for multiple tool trajectories in three perspectives: (1) intraoperative, (2) intracorporeal, and (3) visibility, representing the different types of temporal duration of tool tracks. These fine-grained labels enhance tracking flexibility but also increase the task complexity. Re-identifying tools after occlusion or re-insertion into the body remains challenging due to high visual similarity, especially among tools of the same category. This work recognizes the critical role of the tool operators in distinguishing tool track instances, especially those belonging to the same tool category. The operators' information are however not explicitly captured in surgical videos. We therefore propose SurgiTrack, a novel deep learning method that leverages YOLOv7 for precise tool detection and employs an attention mechanism to model the originating direction of the tools, as a proxy to their operators, for tool re-identification. To handle diverse tool trajectory perspectives, SurgiTrack employs a harmonizing bipartite matching graph, minimizing conflicts and ensuring accurate tool identity association. Experimental results on CholecTrack20 demonstrate SurgiTrack's effectiveness, outperforming baselines and state-of-the-art methods with real-time inference capability. This work sets a new standard in surgical tool tracking, providing dynamic trajectories for more adaptable and precise assistance in minimally invasive surgeries.

### StyleRWKV: High-Quality and High-Efficiency Style Transfer with   RWKV-like Architecture
**Authors**: Miaomiao Dai, Qianyu Zhou, Lizhuang Ma

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T09:01:15Z

**Summary**: Style transfer aims to generate a new image preserving the content but with the artistic representation of the style source. Most of the existing methods are based on Transformers or diffusion models, however, they suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high inference time. RWKV, as an emerging deep sequence models, has shown immense potential for long-context sequence modeling in NLP tasks. In this work, we present a novel framework StyleRWKV, to achieve high-quality style transfer with limited memory usage and linear time complexity. Specifically, we propose a Recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism, which incorporates bidirectional attention to establish a global receptive field. Additionally, we develop a Deformable Shifting (Deform-Shifting) layer that introduces learnable offsets to the sampling grid of the convolution kernel, allowing tokens to shift flexibly and adaptively from the region of interest, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture local dependencies. Finally, we propose a Skip Scanning (S-Scanning) method that effectively establishes global contextual dependencies. Extensive experiments with analysis including qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of stylization quality, model complexity, and inference efficiency.

### Boost UAV-based Ojbect Detection via Scale-Invariant Feature   Disentanglement and Adversarial Learning
**Authors**: Fan Liu, Liang Yao, Chuanyi Zhang, Ting Wu, Xinlei Zhang, Xiruo Jiang, Jun Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T08:57:26Z

**Summary**: Detecting objects from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is often hindered by a large number of small objects, resulting in low detection accuracy. To address this issue, mainstream approaches typically utilize multi-stage inferences. Despite their remarkable detecting accuracies, real-time efficiency is sacrificed, making them less practical to handle real applications. To this end, we propose to improve the single-stage inference accuracy through learning scale-invariant features. Specifically, a Scale-Invariant Feature Disentangling module is designed to disentangle scale-related and scale-invariant features. Then an Adversarial Feature Learning scheme is employed to enhance disentanglement. Finally, scale-invariant features are leveraged for robust UAV-based object detection. Furthermore, we construct a multi-modal UAV object detection dataset, State-Air, which incorporates annotated UAV state parameters. We apply our approach to three lightweight detection frameworks on two benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can effectively improve model accuracy and achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on two datasets. Our code and dataset will be publicly available once the paper is accepted.

### From Commands to Prompts: LLM-based Semantic File System for AIOS
**Authors**: Zeru Shi, Kai Mei, Yongye Su, Chaoji Zuo, Wenyue Hua, Wujiang Xu, Yujie Ren, Zirui Liu, Mengnan Du, Dong Deng, Yongfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T08:32:38Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the development of intelligent applications and systems such as LLM-based agents and agent operating systems (AIOS). However, when these applications and systems interact with the underlying file system, the file system still remains the traditional paradigm: reliant on manual navigation through precise commands. This paradigm poses a bottleneck to the usability of these systems as users are required to navigate complex folder hierarchies and remember cryptic file names. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based semantic file system ( LSFS ) for prompt-driven file management. Unlike conventional approaches, LSFS incorporates LLMs to enable users or agents to interact with files through natural language prompts, facilitating semantic file management. At the macro-level, we develop a comprehensive API set to achieve semantic file management functionalities, such as semantic file retrieval, file update monitoring and summarization, and semantic file rollback). At the micro-level, we store files by constructing semantic indexes for them, design and implement syscalls of different semantic operations (e.g., CRUD, group by, join) powered by vector database. Our experiments show that LSFS offers significant improvements over traditional file systems in terms of user convenience, the diversity of supported functions, and the accuracy and efficiency of file operations. Additionally, with the integration of LLM, our system enables more intelligent file management tasks, such as content summarization and version comparison, further enhancing its capabilities.

### PLN and NARS Often Yield Similar strength $\times$ confidence Given   Highly Uncertain Term Probabilities
**Authors**: Ben Goertzel

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T08:31:19Z

**Summary**: We provide a comparative analysis of the deduction, induction, and abduction formulas used in Probabilistic Logic Networks (PLN) and the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS), two uncertain reasoning frameworks aimed at AGI. One difference between the two systems is that, at the level of individual inference rules, PLN directly leverages both term and relationship probabilities, whereas NARS only leverages relationship frequencies and has no simple analogue of term probabilities. Thus we focus here on scenarios where there is high uncertainty about term probabilities, and explore how this uncertainty influences the comparative inferential conclusions of the two systems. We compare the product of strength and confidence ($s\times c$) in PLN against the product of frequency and confidence ($f\times c$) in NARS (quantities we refer to as measuring the "power" of an uncertain statement) in cases of high term probability uncertainty, using heuristic analyses and elementary numerical computations. We find that in many practical situations with high term probability uncertainty, PLN and NARS formulas give very similar results for the power of an inference conclusion, even though they sometimes come to these similar numbers in quite different ways.

**Authors**: Jiaqi Li, Pingfan Jia, Jiaxing Chen, Jiaxi Liu, Lei He, Keqiang Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T08:13:12Z

**Summary**: Local map construction is a vital component of intelligent driving perception, offering necessary reference for vehicle positioning and planning. Standard Definition map (SDMap), known for its low cost, accessibility, and versatility, has significant potential as prior information for local map perception. This paper mainly reviews the local map construction methods with SDMap, including definitions, general processing flow, and datasets. Besides, this paper analyzes multimodal data representation and fusion methods in SDMap-based local map construction. This paper also discusses key challenges and future directions, such as optimizing SDMap processing, enhancing spatial alignment with real-time data, and incorporating richer environmental information. At last, the review looks forward to future research focusing on enhancing road topology inference and multimodal data fusion to improve the robustness and scalability of local map perception.

### Confidence v.s. Critique: A Decomposition of Self-Correction Capability   for LLMs
**Authors**: Zhe Yang, Yichang Zhang, Yudong Wang, Ziyao Xu, Junyang Lin, Zhifang Sui

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T08:09:11Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can correct their self-generated responses, but a decline in accuracy after self-correction is also witnessed. To have a deeper understanding of self-correction, we endeavor to decompose, evaluate, and analyze the self-correction behaviors of LLMs. By enumerating and analyzing answer correctness before and after self-correction, we decompose the self-correction capability into confidence (being confident to correct answers) and critique (turning wrong answers to correct) capabilities, and propose two metrics from a probabilistic perspective to measure these 2 capabilities, along with another metric for overall self-correction capability evaluation. Based on our decomposition and evaluation metrics, we conduct extensive experiments and draw some empirical conclusions. For example, we find different models can exhibit distinct behaviors: some models are confident while others are more critical. We also find the trade-off between the two capabilities (i.e. improving one can lead to a decline in the other) when manipulating model self-correction behavior by prompts or in-context learning. Further, we find a simple yet efficient strategy to improve self-correction capability by transforming Supervision Fine-Tuning (SFT) data format, and our strategy outperforms vanilla SFT in both capabilities and achieves much higher accuracy after self-correction. Our code will be publicly available on GitHub.

### Safeguard Fine-Tuned LLMs Through Pre- and Post-Tuning Model Merging
**Authors**: Hua Farn, Hsuan Su, Shachi H Kumar, Saurav Sahay, Shang-Tse Chen, Hung-yi Lee

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T08:03:22Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks is a widely adopted approach, but it often leads to safety degradation in safety-aligned LLMs. Currently, many solutions address this issue by incorporating additional safety data, which can be impractical in many cases. In this paper, we address the question: How can we improve downstream task performance while preserving safety in LLMs without relying on additional safety data? We propose a simple and effective method that maintains the inherent safety of LLMs while enhancing their downstream task performance: merging the weights of pre- and post-fine-tuned safety-aligned models. Experimental results across various downstream tasks, models, and merging methods demonstrate that this approach effectively mitigates safety degradation while improving downstream task performance, offering a practical solution for adapting safety-aligned LLMs.

### MBQ: Modality-Balanced Quantization for Large Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Shiyao Li, Yingchun Hu, Xuefei Ning, Xihui Liu, Ke Hong, Xiaotao Jia, Xiuhong Li, Yaqi Yan, Pei Ran, Guohao Dai, Shengen Yan, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T07:55:36Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled a variety of real-world applications. The large parameter size of VLMs brings large memory and computation overhead which poses significant challenges for deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective technique to reduce the memory and computation overhead. Existing PTQ methods mainly focus on large language models (LLMs), without considering the differences across other modalities. In this paper, we discover that there is a significant difference in sensitivity between language and vision tokens in large VLMs. Therefore, treating tokens from different modalities equally, as in existing PTQ methods, may over-emphasize the insensitive modalities, leading to significant accuracy loss. To deal with the above issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, Modality-Balanced Quantization (MBQ), for large VLMs. Specifically, MBQ incorporates the different sensitivities across modalities during the calibration process to minimize the reconstruction loss for better quantization parameters. Extensive experiments show that MBQ can significantly improve task accuracy by up to 4.4% and 11.6% under W3 and W4A8 quantization for 7B to 70B VLMs, compared to SOTA baselines. Additionally, we implement a W3 GPU kernel that fuses the dequantization and GEMV operators, achieving a 1.4x speedup on LLaVA-onevision-7B on the RTX 4090. The code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/MBQ.

### Hybrid Local Causal Discovery
**Authors**: Zhaolong Ling, Honghui Peng, Yiwen Zhang, Peng Zhou, Xingyu Wu, Kui Yu, Xindong Wu

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T07:53:59Z

**Summary**: Local causal discovery aims to learn and distinguish the direct causes and effects of a target variable from observed data. Existing constraint-based local causal discovery methods use AND or OR rules in constructing the local causal skeleton, but using either rule alone is prone to produce cascading errors in the learned local causal skeleton, and thus impacting the inference of local causal relationships. On the other hand, directly applying score-based global causal discovery methods to local causal discovery may randomly return incorrect results due to the existence of local equivalence classes. To address the above issues, we propose a Hybrid Local Causal Discovery algorithm, called HLCD. Specifically, HLCD initially utilizes a constraint-based approach combined with the OR rule to obtain a candidate skeleton and then employs a score-based method to eliminate redundant portions in the candidate skeleton. Furthermore, during the local causal orientation phase, HLCD distinguishes between V-structures and equivalence classes by comparing the local structure scores between the two, thereby avoiding orientation interference caused by local equivalence classes. We conducted extensive experiments with seven state-of-the-art competitors on 14 benchmark Bayesian network datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that HLCD significantly outperforms existing local causal discovery algorithms.

**Authors**: Zexun Jiang, Yafang Shi, Maoxu Li, Hongjiang Xiao, Yunxiao Qin, Qinglan Wei, Ye Wang, Yuan Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T07:33:49Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent simulation framework Casevo (Cognitive Agents and Social Evolution Simulator), that integrates large language models (LLMs) to simulate complex social phenomena and decision-making processes. Casevo is designed as a discrete-event simulator driven by agents with features such as Chain of Thoughts (CoT), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Customizable Memory Mechanism. Casevo enables dynamic social modeling, which can support various scenarios such as social network analysis, public opinion dynamics, and behavior prediction in complex social systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Casevo, we utilize one of the U.S. 2020 midterm election TV debates as a simulation example. Our results show that Casevo facilitates more realistic and flexible agent interactions, improving the quality of dynamic social phenomena simulation. This work contributes to the field by providing a robust system for studying large-scale, high-fidelity social behaviors with advanced LLM-driven agents, expanding the capabilities of traditional agent-based modeling (ABM). The open-source code repository address of casevo is https://github.com/rgCASS/casevo.

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T07:29:19Z

**Summary**: This technical report presents our initial attempt to build a spoken large language model (LLM) for Taiwanese Mandarin, specifically tailored to enable real-time, speech-to-speech interaction in multi-turn conversations. Our end-to-end model incorporates a decoder-only transformer architecture and aims to achieve seamless interaction while preserving the conversational flow, including full-duplex capabilities allowing simultaneous speaking and listening. The paper also details the training process, including data preparation with synthesized dialogues and adjustments for real-time interaction. We also developed a platform to evaluate conversational fluency and response coherence in multi-turn dialogues. We hope the release of the report can contribute to the future development of spoken LLMs in Taiwanese Mandarin.

### Do LLMs Really Think Step-by-step In Implicit Reasoning?
**Authors**: Yijiong Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T07:04:19Z

**Summary**: It has been well-known that Chain-of-Thought can remarkably enhance LLMs' performance on complex tasks. However, because it also introduces slower inference speeds and higher computational costs, many researches have attempted to use implicit CoT, which does not need LLMs to explicitly generate the intermediate steps. However, the invisible reasoning process leaves us a doubt that, can implicit CoT really be equal to explicit CoT? Therefore, in this study, we address this question through experiments. We probe the information of intermediate steps from the model's hidden states when it is either trained or prompted to perform implicit CoT. The results surprisingly indicate that when prompted, LLMs hardly think about intermediate steps, suggesting they may just rely on experience rather than strict step-by-step reasoning. But when trained, they indeed calculate intermediate steps. Moreover, in both situations, we find the effect of using implicit CoT is susceptible to the format of the problem, reaffirming the current deficiency of implicit CoT.

**Authors**: Wenyi Hong, Weihan Wang, Qingsong Lv, Jiazheng Xu, Wenmeng Yu, Junhui Ji, Yan Wang, Zihan Wang, Yuxuan Zhang, Juanzi Li, Bin Xu, Yuxiao Dong, Ming Ding, Jie Tang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T06:56:18Z

**Summary**: People are spending an enormous amount of time on digital devices through graphical user interfaces (GUIs), e.g., computer or smartphone screens. Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can assist people in tasks like writing emails, but struggle to understand and interact with GUIs, thus limiting their potential to increase automation levels. In this paper, we introduce CogAgent, an 18-billion-parameter visual language model (VLM) specializing in GUI understanding and navigation. By utilizing both low-resolution and high-resolution image encoders, CogAgent supports input at a resolution of 1120*1120, enabling it to recognize tiny page elements and text. As a generalist visual language model, CogAgent achieves the state of the art on five text-rich and four general VQA benchmarks, including VQAv2, OK-VQA, Text-VQA, ST-VQA, ChartQA, infoVQA, DocVQA, MM-Vet, and POPE. CogAgent, using only screenshots as input, outperforms LLM-based methods that consume extracted HTML text on both PC and Android GUI navigation tasks -- Mind2Web and AITW, advancing the state of the art. The model and codes are available at https://github.com/THUDM/CogVLM, with a new version of CogAgent-9B-20241220 available at https://github.com/THUDM/CogAgent.

### Exploiting Dynamic Sparsity for Near-Field Spatial Non-Stationary   XL-MIMO Channel Tracking
**Authors**: Wenkang Xu amd An Liu, Min-jian Zhao, Giuseppe Caire, Yik-Chung Wu

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T06:00:30Z

**Summary**: This work considers a spatial non-stationary channel tracking problem in broadband extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems. In the case of spatial non-stationary, each scatterer has a certain visibility region (VR) over antennas and power change may occur among visible antennas. Concentrating on the temporal correlation of XL-MIMO channels, we design a three-layer Markov prior model and hierarchical two-dimensional (2D) Markov model to exploit the dynamic sparsity of sparse channel vectors and VRs, respectively. Then, we formulate the channel tracking problem as a bilinear measurement process, and a novel dynamic alternating maximum a posteriori (DA-MAP) framework is developed to solve the problem. The DA-MAP contains four basic modules: channel estimation module, VR detection module, grid update module, and temporal correlated module. Specifically, the first module is an inverse-free variational Bayesian inference (IF-VBI) estimator that avoids computational intensive matrix inverse each iteration; the second module is a turbo compressive sensing (Turbo-CS) algorithm that only needs small-scale matrix operations in a parallel fashion; the third module refines the polar-delay domain grid; and the fourth module can process the temporal prior information to ensure high-efficiency channel tracking. Simulations show that the proposed method can achieve a significant channel tracking performance while achieving low computational overhead.

### Feasibility Study of a Diffusion-Based Model for Cross-Modal Generation   of Knee MRI from X-ray: Integrating Radiographic Feature Information
**Authors**: Zhe Wang, Yung Hsin Chen, Aladine Chetouani, Fabian Bauer, Yuhua Ru, Fang Chen, Liping Zhang, Rachid Jennane, Mohamed Jarraya

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T06:00:28Z

**Summary**: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder, often diagnosed using X-rays due to its cost-effectiveness. While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides superior soft tissue visualization and serves as a valuable supplementary diagnostic tool, its high cost and limited accessibility significantly restrict its widespread use. To explore the feasibility of bridging this imaging gap, we conducted a feasibility study leveraging a diffusion-based model that uses an X-ray image as conditional input, alongside target depth and additional patient-specific feature information, to generate corresponding MRI sequences. Our findings demonstrate that the MRI volumes generated by our approach is visually closer to real MRI scans. Moreover, increasing inference steps enhances the continuity and smoothness of the synthesized MRI sequences. Through ablation studies, we further validate that integrating supplementary patient-specific information, beyond what X-rays alone can provide, enhances the accuracy and clinical relevance of the generated MRI, which underscores the potential of leveraging external patient-specific information to improve the MRI generation. This study is available at https://zwang78.github.io/.

### Learning Human-Aware Robot Policies for Adaptive Assistance
**Authors**: Jason Qin, Shikun Ban, Wentao Zhu, Yizhou Wang, Dimitris Samaras

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T05:56:51Z

**Summary**: Developing robots that can assist humans efficiently, safely, and adaptively is crucial for real-world applications such as healthcare. While previous work often assumes a centralized system for co-optimizing human-robot interactions, we argue that real-world scenarios are much more complicated, as humans have individual preferences regarding how tasks are performed. Robots typically lack direct access to these implicit preferences. However, to provide effective assistance, robots must still be able to recognize and adapt to the individual needs and preferences of different users. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework in which robots infer human intentions and reason about human utilities through interaction. Our approach features two critical modules: the anticipation module is a motion predictor that captures the spatial-temporal relationship between the robot agent and user agent, which contributes to predicting human behavior; the utility module infers the underlying human utility functions through progressive task demonstration sampling. Extensive experiments across various robot types and assistive tasks demonstrate that the proposed framework not only enhances task success and efficiency but also significantly improves user satisfaction, paving the way for more personalized and adaptive assistive robotic systems. Code and demos are available at https://asonin.github.io/Human-Aware-Assistance/.

### A Text is Worth Several Tokens: Text Embedding from LLMs Secretly Aligns   Well with The Key Tokens
**Authors**: Zhijie Nie, Richong Zhang, Zhanyu Wu

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T05:56:37Z

**Summary**: Text embeddings from large language models (LLMs) have achieved excellent results in tasks such as information retrieval, semantic textual similarity, etc. In this work, we show an interesting finding: when feeding a text into the LLM-based embedder, the obtained text embedding will be able to be aligned with the key tokens in the input text. We first fully analyze this phenomenon on eight LLM-based embedders and show that this phenomenon is universal and is not affected by model architecture, training strategy, and embedding method. With a deeper analysis, we find that the main change in embedding space between these embedders and their LLM backbones is in the first principal component. By adjusting the first principal component, we can align text embedding with the key tokens. Finally, we give several examples to demonstrate the vast application potential of this finding: (1) we propose a simple and practical sparse retrieval method based on the aligned tokens, which can achieve 80% of the dense retrieval effect of the same model while reducing the computation significantly; (2) we show that our findings provide a novel perspective to help understand novel technologies (e.g., instruction-following embedding) and fuzzy concepts (e.g., semantic relatedness vs. similarity) in this field.

### Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Mixture of Products of Multinomial   Distributions: Applications to Survey Data with Potentially Missing Values
**Authors**: Chayut Wongkamthong

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T05:51:50Z

**Summary**: In social science research, understanding latent structures in populations through survey data with categorical responses is a common and important task. Traditional methods like Factor Analysis and Latent Class Analysis have limitations, particularly in handling categorical data and accommodating mixed memberships in latent structures, respectively. Moreover, choosing the number of factors or latent classes is often subjective and can be challenging in the presence of missing values. This study introduces a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Mixture of Products of Multinomial Distributions (HDPMPM) model, which leverages the flexibility of nonparametric Bayesian methods to address these limitations. The HDPMPM model allows for multiple latent classes within individuals and avoids fixing the number of mixture components at an arbitrary number. Additionally, it incorporates missing data imputation directly into the model's Gibbs sampling process. By applying a truncated stick-breaking representation of the Dirichlet process, we can derive a Gibbs sampling scheme for posterior inference. An application of the HDPMPM model to the 2016 American National Election Study (ANES) data demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying political profiles and handling missing data scenarios, including those that are missing at random (MAR) and missing completely at random (MCAR). The results show that the HDPMPM model successfully recovers dominant profiles and manages complex latent structures in survey data, providing an alternative tool for social science researchers in dealing with categorical data with missing values.

### FedMoE-DA: Federated Mixture of Experts via Domain Aware Fine-grained   Aggregation
**Authors**: Ziwei Zhan, Wenkuan Zhao, Yuanqing Li, Weijie Liu, Xiaoxi Zhang, Chee Wei Tan, Chuan Wu, Deke Guo, Xu Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T05:48:14Z

**Summary**: Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning approach that enables multiple clients to train models without sharing their private data. With the rise of deep learning, large-scale models have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional performance. However, a key challenge in FL is the limitation imposed by clients with constrained computational and communication resources, which hampers the deployment of these large models. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture addresses this challenge with its sparse activation property, which reduces computational workload and communication demands during inference and updates. Additionally, MoE facilitates better personalization by allowing each expert to specialize in different subsets of the data distribution. To alleviate the communication burdens between the server and clients, we propose FedMoE-DA, a new FL model training framework that leverages the MoE architecture and incorporates a novel domain-aware, fine-grained aggregation strategy to enhance the robustness, personalizability, and communication efficiency simultaneously. Specifically, the correlation between both intra-client expert models and inter-client data heterogeneity is exploited. Moreover, we utilize peer-to-peer (P2P) communication between clients for selective expert model synchronization, thus significantly reducing the server-client transmissions. Experiments demonstrate that our FedMoE-DA achieves excellent performance while reducing the communication pressure on the server.

**Authors**: Zefang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T05:32:11Z

**Summary**: Incident response (IR) is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, requiring rapid decision-making and coordinated efforts to address cyberattacks effectively. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) as intelligent agents offers a novel approach to enhancing collaboration and efficiency in IR scenarios. This paper explores the application of LLM-based multi-agent collaboration using the Backdoors & Breaches framework, a tabletop game designed for cybersecurity training. We simulate real-world IR dynamics through various team structures, including centralized, decentralized, and hybrid configurations. By analyzing agent interactions and performance across these setups, we provide insights into optimizing multi-agent collaboration for incident response. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to enhance decision-making, improve adaptability, and streamline IR processes, paving the way for more effective and coordinated responses to cyber threats.

### Exploring Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Techniques for Code Generation   with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Martin Weyssow, Xin Zhou, Kisub Kim, David Lo, Houari Sahraoui

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T05:30:00Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities to generate accurate code snippets given natural language intents in a zero-shot manner, i.e., without the need for specific fine-tuning. While prior studies have highlighted the advantages of fine-tuning LLMs, this process incurs high computational costs, making it impractical in resource-scarce environments, particularly for models with billions of parameters. To address these challenges, previous research explored in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as strategies to guide the LLM generative process with task-specific prompt examples. However, ICL and RAG introduce inconveniences, such as the need for designing contextually relevant prompts and the absence of learning task-specific parameters, thereby limiting downstream task performance. In this context, we foresee parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) as a promising approach to efficiently specialize LLMs to task-specific data while maintaining reasonable resource consumption. In this paper, we deliver a comprehensive study of PEFT techniques for LLMs in the context of automated code generation. Our comprehensive investigation of PEFT techniques for LLMs reveals their superiority and potential over ICL and RAG across a diverse set of LLMs and three representative Python code generation datasets: Conala, CodeAlpacaPy, and APPS. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential for tuning larger LLMs and significant reductions in memory usage by combining PEFT with quantization. Therefore, this study opens opportunities for broader applications of PEFT in software engineering scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/martin-wey/peft-llm-code/.

### CodeUltraFeedback: An LLM-as-a-Judge Dataset for Aligning Large Language   Models to Coding Preferences
**Authors**: Martin Weyssow, Aton Kamanda, Xin Zhou, Houari Sahraoui

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T05:13:23Z

**Summary**: Evaluating the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with user-defined coding preferences is a challenging endeavour that requires a deep assessment of LLMs' outputs. Existing methods and benchmarks rely primarily on automated metrics and static analysis tools, which often fail to capture the nuances of user instructions and LLM outputs. To address this gap, we propose using the LLM-as-a-Judge methodology to evaluate the alignment of LLMs with coding preferences. Based on this approach, we present CodeUltraFeedback, a comprehensive dataset designed to facilitate the evaluation and improvement of LLM alignment. CodeUltraFeedback consists of 10,000 coding instructions, each annotated with four responses generated from a diverse pool of 14 LLMs. These responses are ranked based on five distinct coding preferences using GPT-3.5 as a judge, providing both numerical scores and detailed textual feedback. Our analysis of CodeUltraFeedback reveals that responses from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are generally preferred over those from open-weight LLMs, highlighting significant differences in alignment between closed and open-weight models. In turn, we explore the usage of CodeUltraFeedback as feedback data to fine-tune and align CodeLlama-7B-Instruct using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) with direct preference optimization (DPO). The resulting aligned CodeLlama-7B-Instruct model outperforms larger LLMs in terms of alignment with coding preferences and shows improved functional correctness on the HumanEval+ benchmark compared to the original instruct model. Therefore, our contributions bridge the gap in preference tuning of LLMs for code and set the stage for further advancements in model alignment and RLAIF in automated software engineering.

### Find the Intention of Instruction: Comprehensive Evaluation of   Instruction Understanding for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Hyeonseok Moon, Jaehyung Seo, Seungyoon Lee, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T04:37:39Z

**Summary**: One of the key strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to interact with humans by generating appropriate responses to given instructions. This ability, known as instruction-following capability, has established a foundation for the use of LLMs across various fields and serves as a crucial metric for evaluating their performance. While numerous evaluation benchmarks have been developed, most focus solely on clear and coherent instructions. However, we have noted that LLMs can become easily distracted by instruction-formatted statements, which may lead to an oversight of their instruction comprehension skills. To address this issue, we introduce the Intention of Instruction (IoInst) benchmark. This benchmark evaluates LLMs' capacity to remain focused and understand instructions without being misled by extraneous instructions. The primary objective of this benchmark is to identify the appropriate instruction that accurately guides the generation of a given context. Our findings suggest that even recently introduced state-of-the-art models still lack instruction understanding capability. Along with the proposition of IoInst in this study, we also present broad analyses of the several strategies potentially applicable to IoInst.

**Authors**: Haoyang Li, Yiming Li, Anxin Tian, Tianhao Tang, Zhanchao Xu, Xuejia Chen, Nicole Hu, Wei Dong, Qing Li, Lei Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T04:17:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to their ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. The curated paper list for KV cache management is in: \href{https://github.com/TreeAI-Lab/Awesome-KV-Cache-Management}{https://github.com/TreeAI-Lab/Awesome-KV-Cache-Management}.

**Summary**: We present DeepSeek-V3, a strong Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model with 671B total parameters with 37B activated for each token. To achieve efficient inference and cost-effective training, DeepSeek-V3 adopts Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE architectures, which were thoroughly validated in DeepSeek-V2. Furthermore, DeepSeek-V3 pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and sets a multi-token prediction training objective for stronger performance. We pre-train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages to fully harness its capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that DeepSeek-V3 outperforms other open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models. Despite its excellent performance, DeepSeek-V3 requires only 2.788M H800 GPU hours for its full training. In addition, its training process is remarkably stable. Throughout the entire training process, we did not experience any irrecoverable loss spikes or perform any rollbacks. The model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.

### Temporal Context Consistency Above All: Enhancing Long-Term Anticipation   by Learning and Enforcing Temporal Constraints
**Authors**: Alberto Maté, Mariella Dimiccoli

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T03:29:10Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a method for long-term action anticipation (LTA), the task of predicting action labels and their duration in a video given the observation of an initial untrimmed video interval. We build on an encoder-decoder architecture with parallel decoding and make two key contributions. First, we introduce a bi-directional action context regularizer module on the top of the decoder that ensures temporal context coherence in temporally adjacent segments. Second, we learn from classified segments a transition matrix that models the probability of transitioning from one action to another and the sequence is optimized globally over the full prediction interval. In addition, we use a specialized encoder for the task of action segmentation to increase the quality of the predictions in the observation interval at inference time, leading to a better understanding of the past. We validate our methods on four benchmark datasets for LTA, the EpicKitchen-55, EGTEA+, 50Salads and Breakfast demonstrating superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods, including probabilistic models and also those based on Large Language Models, that assume trimmed video as input. The code will be released upon acceptance.

### Revisiting PCA for time series reduction in temporal dimension
**Authors**: Jiaxin Gao, Wenbo Hu, Yuntian Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T03:17:26Z

**Summary**: Revisiting PCA for Time Series Reduction in Temporal Dimension; Jiaxin Gao, Wenbo Hu, Yuntian Chen; Deep learning has significantly advanced time series analysis (TSA), enabling the extraction of complex patterns for tasks like classification, forecasting, and regression. Although dimensionality reduction has traditionally focused on the variable space-achieving notable success in minimizing data redundancy and computational complexity-less attention has been paid to reducing the temporal dimension. In this study, we revisit Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a classical dimensionality reduction technique, to explore its utility in temporal dimension reduction for time series data. It is generally thought that applying PCA to the temporal dimension would disrupt temporal dependencies, leading to limited exploration in this area. However, our theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that applying PCA to sliding series windows not only maintains model performance, but also enhances computational efficiency. In auto-regressive forecasting, the temporal structure is partially preserved through windowing, and PCA is applied within these windows to denoise the time series while retaining their statistical information. By preprocessing time-series data with PCA, we reduce the temporal dimensionality before feeding it into TSA models such as Linear, Transformer, CNN, and RNN architectures. This approach accelerates training and inference and reduces resource consumption. Notably, PCA improves Informer training and inference speed by up to 40% and decreases GPU memory usage of TimesNet by 30%, without sacrificing model accuracy. Comparative analysis against other reduction methods further highlights the effectiveness of PCA in improving the efficiency of TSA models.

### Cracking the Code of Hallucination in LVLMs with Vision-aware Head   Divergence
**Authors**: Jinghan He, Kuan Zhu, Haiyun Guo, Junfeng Fang, Zhenglin Hua, Yuheng Jia, Ming Tang, Tat-Seng Chua, Jinqiao Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T03:00:19Z

**Summary**: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress in integrating large language models (LLMs) with visual inputs, enabling advanced multimodal reasoning. Despite their success, a persistent challenge is hallucination-where generated text fails to accurately reflect visual content-undermining both accuracy and reliability. Existing methods focus on alignment training or decoding refinements but primarily address symptoms at the generation stage without probing the underlying causes. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms driving hallucination in LVLMs, with an emphasis on the multi-head attention module. Specifically, we introduce Vision-aware Head Divergence (VHD), a metric that quantifies the sensitivity of attention head outputs to visual context. Based on this, our findings reveal the presence of vision-aware attention heads that are more attuned to visual information; however, the model's overreliance on its prior language patterns is closely related to hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose Vision-aware Head Reinforcement (VHR), a training-free approach to mitigate hallucination by enhancing the role of vision-aware attention heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining high efficiency with negligible additional time overhead.

### PreNeT: Leveraging Computational Features to Predict Deep Neural Network   Training Time
**Authors**: Alireza Pourali, Arian Boukani, Hamzeh Khazaei

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T02:48:04Z

**Summary**: Training deep learning models, particularly Transformer-based architectures such as Large Language Models (LLMs), demands substantial computational resources and extended training periods. While optimal configuration and infrastructure selection can significantly reduce associated costs, this optimization requires preliminary analysis tools. This paper introduces PreNeT, a novel predictive framework designed to address this optimization challenge. PreNeT facilitates training optimization by integrating comprehensive computational metrics, including layer-specific parameters, arithmetic operations and memory utilization. A key feature of PreNeT is its capacity to accurately predict training duration on previously unexamined hardware infrastructures, including novel accelerator architectures. This framework employs a sophisticated approach to capture and analyze the distinct characteristics of various neural network layers, thereby enhancing existing prediction methodologies. Through proactive implementation of PreNeT, researchers and practitioners can determine optimal configurations, parameter settings, and hardware specifications to maximize cost-efficiency and minimize training duration. Experimental results demonstrate that PreNeT achieves up to 72% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to contemporary state-of-the-art frameworks.

### Merging White Dwarf Binaries Produce Type Ia Supernovae in Elliptical   Galaxies
**Authors**: Michael A. Tucker

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T02:37:36Z

**Summary**: I find that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with bimodal nebular emission profiles occur almost exclusively in massive ($M_\star \gtrsim 10^{11}~M_\odot$) galaxies with low star-formation rates (SFR~$\lesssim 0.5~M_\odot$/yr). The bimodal profiles are likely produced by two white dwarfs that exploded during a merger or collision, supported by a correlation between the peak-to-peak velocity separation ($v_{\rm sep}$) and the SN Ia peak luminosity ($M_V$) which arises naturally from more massive white dwarf binaries synthesizing more $^{56}$Ni during the explosion. The quiescent hosts are consistent with the long delay times required to form double white dwarf binaries. The distributions of SNe Ia with and without bimodal nebular lines differ in host mass, SFR, and specific SFR with K-S test probabilities of $3.1\%$, $0.03\%$, and $0.02\%$, respectively. Viewing angle effects can fully explain the SNe Ia in quiescent hosts without bimodal emission profiles and the dearth of merger/collision driven SNe Ia in star-forming hosts requires at least two distinct progenitor channels for normal SNe Ia. $30-40\%$ of all SNe Ia originate from mergers or collisions depending on how cleanly host environment distinguishes progenitor scenarios. The bimodal SNe Ia share some characteristics with the underluminous 91bg-like SNe Ia that also prefer older populations, but there is no unambiguous connection between the two classifications. This may suggest separate processes or multiple axes of ejecta (a)symmetry. Existing models for white dwarf mergers and collisions broadly reproduce the $v_{\rm sep} - M_V$ correlation and future analyses may be able to infer the masses/mass-ratios of merging white dwarfs in external galaxies.

### MECD: Unlocking Multi-Event Causal Discovery in Video Reasoning
**Authors**: Tieyuan Chen, Huabin Liu, Tianyao He, Yihang Chen, Chaofan Gan, Xiao Ma, Cheng Zhong, Yang Zhang, Yingxue Wang, Hui Lin, Weiyao Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T02:20:36Z

**Summary**: Video causal reasoning aims to achieve a high-level understanding of video content from a causal perspective. However, current video reasoning tasks are limited in scope, primarily executed in a question-answering paradigm and focusing on short videos containing only a single event and simple causal relationships, lacking comprehensive and structured causality analysis for videos with multiple events. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task and dataset, Multi-Event Causal Discovery (MECD). It aims to uncover the causal relationships between events distributed chronologically across long videos. Given visual segments and textual descriptions of events, MECD requires identifying the causal associations between these events to derive a comprehensive, structured event-level video causal diagram explaining why and how the final result event occurred. To address MECD, we devise a novel framework inspired by the Granger Causality method, using an efficient mask-based event prediction model to perform an Event Granger Test, which estimates causality by comparing the predicted result event when premise events are masked versus unmasked. Furthermore, we integrate causal inference techniques such as front-door adjustment and counterfactual inference to address challenges in MECD like causality confounding and illusory causality. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework in providing causal relationships in multi-event videos, outperforming GPT-4o and VideoLLaVA by 5.7% and 4.1%, respectively.

### An Engorgio Prompt Makes Large Language Model Babble on
**Authors**: Jianshuo Dong, Ziyuan Zhang, Qingjie Zhang, Han Qiu, Tianwei Zhang, Hao Wang, Hewu Li, Qi Li, Chao Zhang, Ke Xu

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T01:00:23Z

**Summary**: Auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) have yielded impressive performance in many real-world tasks. However, the new paradigm of these LLMs also exposes novel threats. In this paper, we explore their vulnerability to inference cost attacks, where a malicious user crafts Engorgio prompts to intentionally increase the computation cost and latency of the inference process. We design Engorgio, a novel methodology, to efficiently generate adversarial Engorgio prompts to affect the target LLM's service availability. Engorgio has the following two technical contributions. (1) We employ a parameterized distribution to track LLMs' prediction trajectory. (2) Targeting the auto-regressive nature of LLMs' inference process, we propose novel loss functions to stably suppress the appearance of the <EOS> token, whose occurrence will interrupt the LLM's generation process. We conduct extensive experiments on 13 open-sourced LLMs with parameters ranging from 125M to 30B. The results show that Engorgio prompts can successfully induce LLMs to generate abnormally long outputs (i.e., roughly 2-13$\times$ longer to reach 90%+ of the output length limit) in a white-box scenario and our real-world experiment demonstrates Engergio's threat to LLM service with limited computing resources. The code is accessible at https://github.com/jianshuod/Engorgio-prompt.

### Reconstruction of non-trivial magnetization textures from magnetic field   images using neural networks
**Authors**: David A. Broadway, Mykhailo Flaks, Adrien E. E. Dubois, Patrick Maletinsky

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T23:50:02Z

**Summary**: Spatial imaging of magnetic stray fields from magnetic materials is a useful tool for identifying the underlying magnetic configurations of the material. However, transforming the magnetic image into a magnetization image is an ill-poised problem, which can result in artefacts that limit the inferences that can be made on the material under investigation. In this work, we develop a neural network fitting approach that approximates this transformation, reducing these artefacts. Additionally, we demonstrate that this approach allows the inclusion of additional models and bounds that are not possible with traditional reconstruction methods. These advantages allow for the reconstruction of non-trivial magnetization textures with varying magnetization directions in thin-film magnets, which was not possible previously. We demonstrate this new capability by performing magnetization reconstructions on a variety of topological spin textures.

### Large Language Models for Market Research: A Data-augmentation Approach
**Authors**: Mengxin Wang, Dennis J. Zhang, Heng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T22:06:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by excelling in complex natural language processing tasks. Their ability to generate human-like text has opened new possibilities for market research, particularly in conjoint analysis, where understanding consumer preferences is essential but often resource-intensive. Traditional survey-based methods face limitations in scalability and cost, making LLM-generated data a promising alternative. However, while LLMs have the potential to simulate real consumer behavior, recent studies highlight a significant gap between LLM-generated and human data, with biases introduced when substituting between the two. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a novel statistical data augmentation approach that efficiently integrates LLM-generated data with real data in conjoint analysis. Our method leverages transfer learning principles to debias the LLM-generated data using a small amount of human data. This results in statistically robust estimators with consistent and asymptotically normal properties, in contrast to naive approaches that simply substitute human data with LLM-generated data, which can exacerbate bias. We validate our framework through an empirical study on COVID-19 vaccine preferences, demonstrating its superior ability to reduce estimation error and save data and costs by 24.9\% to 79.8\%. In contrast, naive approaches fail to save data due to the inherent biases in LLM-generated data compared to human data. Another empirical study on sports car choices validates the robustness of our results. Our findings suggest that while LLM-generated data is not a direct substitute for human responses, it can serve as a valuable complement when used within a robust statistical framework.

### Dynamic Skill Adaptation for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jiaao Chen, Diyi Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T22:04:23Z

**Summary**: We present Dynamic Skill Adaptation (DSA), an adaptive and dynamic framework to adapt novel and complex skills to Large Language Models (LLMs). Compared with previous work which learns from human-curated and static data in random orders, we propose to first automatically generate and organize the training data by mimicking the learning pathways of human and then dynamically tailor the training data based on the training dynamics. Specifically, inspired by the learning structures and teaching strategies in the human education system, we first construct a skill graph by decomposing complex skills into sub-skills and arranging them based on their dependencies in human syllables. For every skill, we utilize LLMs to generate both textbook-like data which contains detailed descriptions of skills for pre-training and exercise-like data which targets at explicitly utilizing the skills to solve problems for instruction-tuning. Furthermore, during the instruction-tuning, we dynamically update the training data which down-weight easy-to-learn examples, generate more complex examples, and filter out data with errors. Experiments on large language models such as LLAMA and Mistral demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in adapting math reasoning skills and social study skills.

### Solving High-dimensional Inverse Problems Using Amortized   Likelihood-free Inference with Noisy and Incomplete Data
**Authors**: Jice Zeng, Yuanzhe Wang, Alexandre M. Tartakovsky, David Barajas-Solano

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T21:57:29Z

**Summary**: We present a likelihood-free probabilistic inversion method based on normalizing flows for high-dimensional inverse problems. The proposed method is composed of two complementary networks: a summary network for data compression and an inference network for parameter estimation. The summary network encodes raw observations into a fixed-size vector of summary features, while the inference network generates samples of the approximate posterior distribution of the model parameters based on these summary features. The posterior samples are produced in a deep generative fashion by sampling from a latent Gaussian distribution and passing these samples through an invertible transformation. We construct this invertible transformation by sequentially alternating conditional invertible neural network and conditional neural spline flow layers. The summary and inference networks are trained simultaneously. We apply the proposed method to an inversion problem in groundwater hydrology to estimate the posterior distribution of the log-conductivity field conditioned on spatially sparse time-series observations of the system's hydraulic head responses.The conductivity field is represented with 706 degrees of freedom in the considered problem.The comparison with the likelihood-based iterative ensemble smoother PEST-IES method demonstrates that the proposed method accurately estimates the parameter posterior distribution and the observations' predictive posterior distribution at a fraction of the inference time of PEST-IES.

### ETTA: Elucidating the Design Space of Text-to-Audio Models
**Authors**: Sang-gil Lee, Zhifeng Kong, Arushi Goel, Sungwon Kim, Rafael Valle, Bryan Catanzaro

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T21:13:12Z

**Summary**: Recent years have seen significant progress in Text-To-Audio (TTA) synthesis, enabling users to enrich their creative workflows with synthetic audio generated from natural language prompts. Despite this progress, the effects of data, model architecture, training objective functions, and sampling strategies on target benchmarks are not well understood. With the purpose of providing a holistic understanding of the design space of TTA models, we set up a large-scale empirical experiment focused on diffusion and flow matching models. Our contributions include: 1) AF-Synthetic, a large dataset of high quality synthetic captions obtained from an audio understanding model; 2) a systematic comparison of different architectural, training, and inference design choices for TTA models; 3) an analysis of sampling methods and their Pareto curves with respect to generation quality and inference speed. We leverage the knowledge obtained from this extensive analysis to propose our best model dubbed Elucidated Text-To-Audio (ETTA). When evaluated on AudioCaps and MusicCaps, ETTA provides improvements over the baselines trained on publicly available data, while being competitive with models trained on proprietary data. Finally, we show ETTA's improved ability to generate creative audio following complex and imaginative captions -- a task that is more challenging than current benchmarks.

### On the Expressiveness and Length Generalization of Selective State-Space   Models on Regular Languages
**Authors**: Aleksandar Terzić, Michael Hersche, Giacomo Camposampiero, Thomas Hofmann, Abu Sebastian, Abbas Rahimi

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T20:53:04Z

**Summary**: Selective state-space models (SSMs) are an emerging alternative to the Transformer, offering the unique advantage of parallel training and sequential inference. Although these models have shown promising performance on a variety of tasks, their formal expressiveness and length generalization properties remain underexplored. In this work, we provide insight into the workings of selective SSMs by analyzing their expressiveness and length generalization performance on regular language tasks, i.e., finite-state automaton (FSA) emulation. We address certain limitations of modern SSM-based architectures by introducing the Selective Dense State-Space Model (SD-SSM), the first selective SSM that exhibits perfect length generalization on a set of various regular language tasks using a single layer. It utilizes a dictionary of dense transition matrices, a softmax selection mechanism that creates a convex combination of dictionary matrices at each time step, and a readout consisting of layer normalization followed by a linear map. We then proceed to evaluate variants of diagonal selective SSMs by considering their empirical performance on commutative and non-commutative automata. We explain the experimental results with theoretical considerations. Our code is available at https://github.com/IBM/selective-dense-state-space-model.

### Towards A Holistic Landscape of Situated Theory of Mind in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Ziqiao Ma, Jacob Sansom, Run Peng, Joyce Chai

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T20:04:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated considerable interest and debate regarding their potential emergence of Theory of Mind (ToM). Several recent inquiries reveal a lack of robust ToM in these models and pose a pressing demand to develop new benchmarks, as current ones primarily focus on different aspects of ToM and are prone to shortcuts and data leakage. In this position paper, we seek to answer two road-blocking questions: (1) How can we taxonomize a holistic landscape of machine ToM? (2) What is a more effective evaluation protocol for machine ToM? Following psychological studies, we taxonomize machine ToM into 7 mental state categories and delineate existing benchmarks to identify under-explored aspects of ToM. We argue for a holistic and situated evaluation of ToM to break ToM into individual components and treat LLMs as an agent who is physically situated in environments and socially situated in interactions with humans. Such situated evaluation provides a more comprehensive assessment of mental states and potentially mitigates the risk of shortcuts and data leakage. We further present a pilot study in a grid world setup as a proof of concept. We hope this position paper can facilitate future research to integrate ToM with LLMs and offer an intuitive means for researchers to better position their work in the landscape of ToM.

### Deep learning and whole-brain networks for biomarker discovery: modeling   the dynamics of brain fluctuations in resting-state and cognitive tasks
**Authors**: Facundo Roffet, Gustavo Deco, Claudio Delrieux, Gustavo Patow

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T18:58:38Z

**Summary**: Background: Brain network models offer insights into brain dynamics, but the utility of model-derived bifurcation parameters as biomarkers remains underexplored. Objective: This study evaluates bifurcation parameters from a whole-brain network model as biomarkers for distinguishing brain states associated with resting-state and task-based cognitive conditions. Methods: Synthetic BOLD signals were generated using a supercritical Hopf brain network model to train deep learning models for bifurcation parameter prediction. Inference was performed on Human Connectome Project data, including both resting-state and task-based conditions. Statistical analyses assessed the separability of brain states based on bifurcation parameter distributions. Results: Bifurcation parameter distributions differed significantly across task and resting-state conditions ($p < 0.0001$ for all but one comparison). Task-based brain states exhibited higher bifurcation values compared to rest. Conclusion: Bifurcation parameters effectively differentiate cognitive and resting states, warranting further investigation as biomarkers for brain state characterization and neurological disorder assessment.

### LMFusion: Adapting Pretrained Language Models for Multimodal Generation
**Authors**: Weijia Shi, Xiaochuang Han, Chunting Zhou, Weixin Liang, Xi Victoria Lin, Luke Zettlemoyer, Lili Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T18:56:18Z

**Summary**: We present LMFusion, a framework for empowering pretrained text-only large language models (LLMs) with multimodal generative capabilities, enabling them to understand and generate both text and images in arbitrary sequences. LMFusion leverages existing Llama-3's weights for processing texts autoregressively while introducing additional and parallel transformer modules for processing images with diffusion. During training, the data from each modality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward layers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each modality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow interactions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific modules and only training the image-specific modules, LMFusion preserves the language capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual understanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain multimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that, LMFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6% using only 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities. We also demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language models with multimodal generation ability. Overall, this framework not only leverages existing computational investments in text-only LLMs but also enables the parallel development of language and vision capabilities, presenting a promising direction for efficient multimodal model development.

### LLMs for Knowledge Graph Construction and Reasoning: Recent Capabilities   and Future Opportunities
**Authors**: Yuqi Zhu, Xiaohan Wang, Jing Chen, Shuofei Qiao, Yixin Ou, Yunzhi Yao, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T18:54:53Z

**Summary**: This paper presents an exhaustive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Knowledge Graph (KG) construction and reasoning. We engage in experiments across eight diverse datasets, focusing on four representative tasks encompassing entity and relation extraction, event extraction, link prediction, and question-answering, thereby thoroughly exploring LLMs' performance in the domain of construction and inference. Empirically, our findings suggest that LLMs, represented by GPT-4, are more suited as inference assistants rather than few-shot information extractors. Specifically, while GPT-4 exhibits good performance in tasks related to KG construction, it excels further in reasoning tasks, surpassing fine-tuned models in certain cases. Moreover, our investigation extends to the potential generalization ability of LLMs for information extraction, leading to the proposition of a Virtual Knowledge Extraction task and the development of the corresponding VINE dataset. Based on these empirical findings, we further propose AutoKG, a multi-agent-based approach employing LLMs and external sources for KG construction and reasoning. We anticipate that this research can provide invaluable insights for future undertakings in the field of knowledge graphs. The code and datasets are in https://github.com/zjunlp/AutoKG.

### Performance Control in Early Exiting to Deploy Large Models at the Same   Cost of Smaller Ones
**Authors**: Mehrnaz Mofakhami, Reza Bayat, Ioannis Mitliagkas, Joao Monteiro, Valentina Zantedeschi

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T18:54:32Z

**Summary**: Early Exiting (EE) is a promising technique for speeding up inference by adaptively allocating compute resources to data points based on their difficulty. The approach enables predictions to exit at earlier layers for simpler samples while reserving more computation for challenging ones. In this study, we first present a novel perspective on the EE approach, showing that larger models deployed with EE can achieve higher performance than smaller models while maintaining similar computational costs. As existing EE approaches rely on confidence estimation at each exit point, we further study the impact of overconfidence on the controllability of the compute-performance trade-off. We introduce Performance Control Early Exiting (PCEE), a method that enables accuracy thresholding by basing decisions not on a data point's confidence but on the average accuracy of samples with similar confidence levels from a held-out validation set. In our experiments, we show that PCEE offers a simple yet computationally efficient approach that provides better control over performance than standard confidence-based approaches, and allows us to scale up model sizes to yield performance gain while reducing the computational cost.

### Adaptive Conformal Inference by Betting
**Authors**: Aleksandr Podkopaev, Darren Xu, Kuang-Chih Lee

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T18:42:08Z

**Summary**: Conformal prediction is a valuable tool for quantifying predictive uncertainty of machine learning models. However, its applicability relies on the assumption of data exchangeability, a condition which is often not met in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider the problem of adaptive conformal inference without any assumptions about the data generating process. Existing approaches for adaptive conformal inference are based on optimizing the pinball loss using variants of online gradient descent. A notable shortcoming of such approaches is in their explicit dependence on and sensitivity to the choice of the learning rates. In this paper, we propose a different approach for adaptive conformal inference that leverages parameter-free online convex optimization techniques. We prove that our method controls long-term miscoverage frequency at a nominal level and demonstrate its convincing empirical performance without any need of performing cumbersome parameter tuning.

### From Interets to Insights: An LLM Approach to Course Recommendations   Using Natural Language Queries
**Authors**: Hugh Van Deventer, Mark Mills, August Evrard

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T18:19:53Z

**Summary**: Most universities in the United States encourage their students to explore academic areas before declaring a major and to acquire academic breadth by satisfying a variety of requirements. Each term, students must choose among many thousands of offerings, spanning dozens of subject areas, a handful of courses to take. The curricular environment is also dynamic, and poor communication and search functions on campus can limit a student's ability to discover new courses of interest. To support both students and their advisers in such a setting, we explore a novel Large Language Model (LLM) course recommendation system that applies a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method to the corpus of course descriptions. The system first generates an 'ideal' course description based on the user's query. This description is converted into a search vector using embeddings, which is then used to find actual courses with similar content by comparing embedding similarities. We describe the method and assess the quality and fairness of some example prompts. Steps to deploy a pilot system on campus are discussed.

### Perceive, Query & Reason: Enhancing Video QA with Question-Guided   Temporal Queries
**Authors**: Roberto Amoroso, Gengyuan Zhang, Rajat Koner, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara, Volker Tresp

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T17:53:14Z

**Summary**: Video Question Answering (Video QA) is a challenging video understanding task that requires models to comprehend entire videos, identify the most relevant information based on contextual cues from a given question, and reason accurately to provide answers. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed video QA by leveraging their exceptional commonsense reasoning capabilities. This progress is largely driven by the effective alignment between visual data and the language space of MLLMs. However, for video QA, an additional space-time alignment poses a considerable challenge for extracting question-relevant information across frames. In this work, we investigate diverse temporal modeling techniques to integrate with MLLMs, aiming to achieve question-guided temporal modeling that leverages pre-trained visual and textual alignment in MLLMs. We propose T-Former, a novel temporal modeling method that creates a question-guided temporal bridge between frame-wise visual perception and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our evaluation across multiple video QA benchmarks demonstrates that T-Former competes favorably with existing temporal modeling approaches and aligns with recent advancements in video QA.

### RAG with Differential Privacy
**Authors**: Nicolas Grislain

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T17:34:26Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant technique to provide *Large Language Models* (LLM) with fresh and relevant context, mitigating the risk of hallucinations and improving the overall quality of responses in environments with large and fast moving knowledge bases. However, the integration of external documents into the generation process raises significant privacy concerns. Indeed, when added to a prompt, it is not possible to guarantee a response will not inadvertently expose confidential data, leading to potential breaches of privacy and ethical dilemmas. This paper explores a practical solution to this problem suitable to general knowledge extraction from personal data. It shows *differentially private token generation* is a viable approach to private RAG.

### SRLM: Human-in-Loop Interactive Social Robot Navigation with Large   Language Model and Deep Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Weizheng Wang, Ike Obi, Byung-Cheol Min

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T17:00:51Z

**Summary**: An interactive social robotic assistant must provide services in complex and crowded spaces while adapting its behavior based on real-time human language commands or feedback. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach called Social Robot Planner (SRLM), which integrates Large Language Models (LLM) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to navigate through human-filled public spaces and provide multiple social services. SRLM infers global planning from human-in-loop commands in real-time, and encodes social information into a LLM-based large navigation model (LNM) for low-level motion execution. Moreover, a DRL-based planner is designed to maintain benchmarking performance, which is blended with LNM by a large feedback model (LFM) to address the instability of current text and LLM-driven LNM. Finally, SRLM demonstrates outstanding performance in extensive experiments. More details about this work are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/navi-srlm

### MEDEC: A Benchmark for Medical Error Detection and Correction in   Clinical Notes
**Authors**: Asma Ben Abacha, Wen-wai Yim, Yujuan Fu, Zhaoyi Sun, Meliha Yetisgen, Fei Xia, Thomas Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T15:54:10Z

**Summary**: Several studies showed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can answer medical questions correctly, even outperforming the average human score in some medical exams. However, to our knowledge, no study has been conducted to assess the ability of language models to validate existing or generated medical text for correctness and consistency. In this paper, we introduce MEDEC (https://github.com/abachaa/MEDEC), the first publicly available benchmark for medical error detection and correction in clinical notes, covering five types of errors (Diagnosis, Management, Treatment, Pharmacotherapy, and Causal Organism). MEDEC consists of 3,848 clinical texts, including 488 clinical notes from three US hospital systems that were not previously seen by any LLM. The dataset has been used for the MEDIQA-CORR shared task to evaluate seventeen participating systems [Ben Abacha et al., 2024]. In this paper, we describe the data creation methods and we evaluate recent LLMs (e.g., o1-preview, GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for the tasks of detecting and correcting medical errors requiring both medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We also conducted a comparative study where two medical doctors performed the same task on the MEDEC test set. The results showed that MEDEC is a sufficiently challenging benchmark to assess the ability of models to validate existing or generated notes and to correct medical errors. We also found that although recent LLMs have a good performance in error detection and correction, they are still outperformed by medical doctors in these tasks. We discuss the potential factors behind this gap, the insights from our experiments, the limitations of current evaluation metrics, and share potential pointers for future research.

### Which Viewpoint Shows it Best? Language for Weakly Supervising View   Selection in Multi-view Videos
**Authors**: Sagnik Majumder, Tushar Nagarajan, Ziad Al-Halah, Reina Pradhan, Kristen Grauman

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T15:49:20Z

**Summary**: Given a multi-view video, which viewpoint is most informative for a human observer? Existing methods rely on heuristics or expensive "best-view" supervision to answer this question, limiting their applicability. We propose a weakly supervised approach that leverages language accompanying an instructional multi-view video as a means to recover its most informative viewpoint(s). Our key hypothesis is that the more accurately an individual view can predict a view-agnostic text summary, the more informative it is. To put this into action, we propose a framework that uses the relative accuracy of view-dependent caption predictions as a proxy for best view pseudo-labels. Then, those pseudo-labels are used to train a view selector, together with an auxiliary camera pose predictor that enhances view-sensitivity. During inference, our model takes as input only a multi-view video--no language or camera poses--and returns the best viewpoint to watch at each timestep. On two challenging datasets comprised of diverse multi-camera setups and how-to activities, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, both with quantitative metrics and human evaluation.

**Authors**: Ramón Nartallo-Kaluarachchi, Malbor Asllani, Gustavo Deco, Morten L. Kringelbach, Alain Goriely, Renaud Lambiotte

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T15:18:54Z

**Summary**: The structure of a complex network plays a crucial role in determining its dynamical properties. In this work, we show that the the degree to which a network is directed and hierarchically organised is closely associated with the degree to which its dynamics break detailed balance and produce entropy. We consider a range of dynamical processes and show how different directed network features affect their entropy production rate. We begin with an analytical treatment of a 2-node network followed by numerical simulations of synthetic networks using the preferential attachment and Erd\"os-Renyi algorithms. Next, we analyse a collection of 97 empirical networks to determine the effect of complex real-world topologies. Finally, we present a simple method for inferring broken detailed balance and directed network structure from multivariate time-series and apply our method to identify non-equilibrium dynamics and hierarchical organisation in both human neuroimaging and financial time-series. Overall, our results shed light on the consequences of directed network structure on non-equilibrium dynamics and highlight the importance and ubiquity of hierarchical organisation and non-equilibrium dynamics in real-world systems.

### Sentiment trading with large language models
**Authors**: Kemal Kirtac, Guido Germano

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T15:01:24Z

**Summary**: We investigate the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in sentiment analysis of U.S. financial news and their potential in predicting stock market returns. We analyze a dataset comprising 965,375 news articles that span from January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2023; we focus on the performance of various LLMs, including BERT, OPT, FINBERT, and the traditional Loughran-McDonald dictionary model, which has been a dominant methodology in the finance literature. The study documents a significant association between LLM scores and subsequent daily stock returns. Specifically, OPT, which is a GPT-3 based LLM, shows the highest accuracy in sentiment prediction with an accuracy of 74.4%, slightly ahead of BERT (72.5%) and FINBERT (72.2%). In contrast, the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model demonstrates considerably lower effectiveness with only 50.1% accuracy. Regression analyses highlight a robust positive impact of OPT model scores on next-day stock returns, with coefficients of 0.274 and 0.254 in different model specifications. BERT and FINBERT also exhibit predictive relevance, though to a lesser extent. Notably, we do not observe a significant relationship between the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model scores and stock returns, challenging the efficacy of this traditional method in the current financial context. In portfolio performance, the long-short OPT strategy excels with a Sharpe ratio of 3.05, compared to 2.11 for BERT and 2.07 for FINBERT long-short strategies. Strategies based on the Loughran-McDonald dictionary yield the lowest Sharpe ratio of 1.23. Our findings emphasize the superior performance of advanced LLMs, especially OPT, in financial market prediction and portfolio management, marking a significant shift in the landscape of financial analysis tools with implications to financial regulation and policy analysis.

### Latenrgy: Model Agnostic Latency and Energy Consumption Prediction for   Binary Classifiers
**Authors**: Jason M. Pittman

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T14:51:24Z

**Summary**: Machine learning systems increasingly drive innovation across scientific fields and industry, yet challenges in compute overhead, specifically during inference, limit their scalability and sustainability. Responsible AI guardrails, essential for ensuring fairness, transparency, and privacy, further exacerbate these computational demands. This study addresses critical gaps in the literature, chiefly the lack of generalized predictive techniques for latency and energy consumption, limited cross-comparisons of classifiers, and unquantified impacts of RAI guardrails on inference performance. Using Theory Construction Methodology, this work constructed a model-agnostic theoretical framework for predicting latency and energy consumption in binary classification models during inference. The framework synthesizes classifier characteristics, dataset properties, and RAI guardrails into a unified analytical instrument. Two predictive equations are derived that capture the interplay between these factors while offering generalizability across diverse classifiers. The proposed framework provides foundational insights for designing efficient, responsible ML systems. It enables researchers to benchmark and optimize inference performance and assists practitioners in deploying scalable solutions. Finally, this work establishes a theoretical foundation for balancing computational efficiency with ethical AI principles, paving the way for future empirical validation and broader applications.

### AutoDroid-V2: Boosting SLM-based GUI Agents via Code Generation
**Authors**: Hao Wen, Shizuo Tian, Borislav Pavlov, Wenjie Du, Yixuan Li, Ge Chang, Shanhui Zhao, Jiacheng Liu, Yunxin Liu, Ya-Qin Zhang, Yuanchun Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T13:52:48Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have brought exciting new advances to mobile UI agents, a long-standing research field that aims to complete arbitrary natural language tasks through mobile UI interactions. However, existing UI agents usually demand high reasoning capabilities of powerful large models that are difficult to be deployed locally on end-users' devices, which raises huge concerns about user privacy and centralized serving cost. One way to reduce the required model size is to customize a smaller domain-specific model with high-quality training data, e.g. large-scale human demonstrations of diverse types of apps and tasks, while such datasets are extremely difficult to obtain. Inspired by the remarkable coding abilities of recent small language models (SLMs), we propose to convert the UI task automation problem to a code generation problem, which can be effectively solved by an on-device SLM and efficiently executed with an on-device code interpreter. Unlike normal coding tasks that can be extensively pretrained with public datasets, generating UI automation code is challenging due to the diversity, complexity, and variability of target apps. Therefore, we adopt a document-centered approach that automatically builds fine-grained API documentation for each app and generates diverse task samples based on this documentation. By guiding the agent with the synthetic documents and task samples, it learns to generate precise and efficient scripts to complete unseen tasks. Based on detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art mobile UI agents, our approach effectively improves the mobile task automation with significantly higher success rates and lower latency/token consumption. Code will be open-sourced.

### Dynamic Bayesian Learning for Spatiotemporal Mechanistic Models
**Authors**: Sudipto Banerjee, Xiang Chen, Ian Frankenburg, Daniel Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T13:40:43Z

**Summary**: We develop an approach for Bayesian learning of spatiotemporal dynamical mechanistic models. Such learning consists of statistical emulation of the mechanistic system that can efficiently interpolate the output of the system from arbitrary inputs. The emulated learner can then be used to train the system from noisy data achieved by melding information from observed data with the emulated mechanistic system. This joint melding of mechanistic systems employ hierarchical state-space models with Gaussian process regression. Assuming the dynamical system is controlled by a finite collection of inputs, Gaussian process regression learns the effect of these parameters through a number of training runs, driving the stochastic innovations of the spatiotemporal state-space component. This enables efficient modeling of the dynamics over space and time. This article details exact inference with analytically accessible posterior distributions in hierarchical matrix-variate Normal and Wishart models in designing the emulator. This step obviates expensive iterative algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo or variational approximations. We also show how emulation is applicable to large-scale emulation by designing a dynamic Bayesian transfer learning framework. Inference on $\bm \eta$ proceeds using Markov chain Monte Carlo as a post-emulation step using the emulator as a regression component. We demonstrate this framework through solving inverse problems arising in the analysis of ordinary and partial nonlinear differential equations and, in addition, to a black-box computer model generating spatiotemporal dynamics across a graphical model.

### Large Language Models Meet Graph Neural Networks: A Perspective of Graph   Mining
**Authors**: Yuxin You, Zhen Liu, Xiangchao Wen, Yongtao Zhang, Wei Ai

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T13:21:09Z

**Summary**: Graph mining is an important area in data mining and machine learning that involves extracting valuable information from graph-structured data. In recent years, significant progress has been made in this field through the development of graph neural networks (GNNs). However, GNNs are still deficient in generalizing to diverse graph data. Aiming to this issue, Large Language Models (LLMs) could provide new solutions for graph mining tasks with their superior semantic understanding. In this review, we systematically review the combination and application techniques of LLMs and GNNs and present a novel taxonomy for research in this interdisciplinary field, which involves three main categories: GNN-driving-LLM, LLM-driving-GNN, and GNN-LLM-co-driving. Within this framework, we reveal the capabilities of LLMs in enhancing graph feature extraction as well as improving the effectiveness of downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and community detection. Although LLMs have demonstrated their great potential in handling graph-structured data, their high computational requirements and complexity remain challenges. Future research needs to continue to explore how to efficiently fuse LLMs and GNNs to achieve more powerful graph learning and reasoning capabilities and provide new impetus for the development of graph mining techniques.

**Authors**: Zekang Yang, Wang Zeng, Sheng Jin, Chen Qian, Ping Luo, Wentao Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T13:14:16Z

**Summary**: Automated machine learning (AutoML) is a collection of techniques designed to automate the machine learning development process. While traditional AutoML approaches have been successfully applied in several critical steps of model development (e.g. hyperparameter optimization), there lacks a AutoML system that automates the entire end-to-end model production workflow for computer vision. To fill this blank, we propose a novel request-to-model task, which involves understanding the user's natural language request and execute the entire workflow to output production-ready models. This empowers non-expert individuals to easily build task-specific models via a user-friendly language interface. To facilitate development and evaluation, we develop a new experimental platform called AutoMMLab and a new benchmark called LAMP for studying key components in the end-to-end request-to-model pipeline. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is one of the most important components for AutoML. Traditional approaches mostly rely on trial-and-error, leading to inefficient parameter search. To solve this problem, we propose a novel LLM-based HPO algorithm, called HPO-LLaMA. Equipped with extensive knowledge and experience in model hyperparameter tuning, HPO-LLaMA achieves significant improvement of HPO efficiency. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/yang-ze-kang/AutoMMLab.

### NADER: Neural Architecture Design via Multi-Agent Collaboration
**Authors**: Zekang Yang, Wang Zeng, Sheng Jin, Chen Qian, Ping Luo, Wentao Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T13:07:03Z

**Summary**: Designing effective neural architectures poses a significant challenge in deep learning. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates the search for optimal architectures, existing methods are often constrained by predetermined search spaces and may miss critical neural architectures. In this paper, we introduce NADER (Neural Architecture Design via multi-agEnt collaboRation), a novel framework that formulates neural architecture design (NAD) as a LLM-based multi-agent collaboration problem. NADER employs a team of specialized agents to enhance a base architecture through iterative modification. Current LLM-based NAD methods typically operate independently, lacking the ability to learn from past experiences, which results in repeated mistakes and inefficient exploration. To address this issue, we propose the Reflector, which effectively learns from immediate feedback and long-term experiences. Additionally, unlike previous LLM-based methods that use code to represent neural architectures, we utilize a graph-based representation. This approach allows agents to focus on design aspects without being distracted by coding. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NADER in discovering high-performing architectures beyond predetermined search spaces through extensive experiments on benchmark tasks, showcasing its advantages over state-of-the-art methods. The codes will be released soon.

**Authors**: Ashutosh Baheti, Debanjana Chakraborty, Faeze Brahman, Ronan Le Bras, Ximing Lu, Nouha Dziri, Yejin Choi, Mark Riedl, Maarten Sap

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T12:36:39Z

**Summary**: Obeying precise constraints on top of multiple external attributes is a common computational problem underlying seemingly different domains, from controlled text generation to protein engineering. Existing language model (LM) controllability methods for multi-attribute constraint satisfaction often rely on specialized architectures or gradient-based classifiers, limiting their flexibility to work with arbitrary black-box evaluators and pretrained models. Current general-purpose large language models, while capable, cannot achieve fine-grained multi-attribute control over external attributes. Thus, we create Multi-Attribute Constraint Satisfaction (MACS), a generalized method capable of finetuning language models on any sequential domain to satisfy user-specified constraints on multiple external real-value attributes. Our method trains LMs as editors by sampling diverse multi-attribute edit pairs from an initial set of paraphrased outputs. During inference, LM iteratively improves upon its previous solution to satisfy constraints for all attributes by leveraging our designed constraint satisfaction reward. We additionally experiment with reward-weighted behavior cloning to further improve the constraint satisfaction rate of LMs. To evaluate our approach, we present a new Fine-grained Constraint Satisfaction (FineCS) benchmark, featuring two challenging tasks: (1) Text Style Transfer, where the goal is to simultaneously modify the sentiment and complexity of reviews, and (2) Protein Design, focusing on modulating fluorescence and stability of Green Fluorescent Proteins (GFP). Our empirical results show that MACS achieves the highest threshold satisfaction in both FineCS tasks, outperforming strong domain-specific baselines. Our work opens new avenues for generalized and real-value multi-attribute control, with implications for diverse applications spanning NLP and bioinformatics.

**Authors**: Haonan He, Yuchen Ren, Yining Tang, Ziyang Xu, Junxian Li, Minghao Yang, Di Zhang, Dong Yuan, Tao Chen, Shufei Zhang, Yuqiang Li, Nanqing Dong, Wanli Ouyang, Dongzhan Zhou, Peng Ye

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T12:12:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models have already demonstrated their formidable capabilities in general domains, ushering in a revolutionary transformation. However, exploring and exploiting the extensive knowledge of these models to comprehend multi-omics biology remains underexplored. To fill this research gap, we first introduce Biology-Instructions, the first large-scale multi-omics biological sequences-related instruction-tuning dataset including DNA, RNA, proteins, and multi-molecules, designed to bridge the gap between large language models (LLMs) and complex biological sequences-related tasks. This dataset can enhance the versatility of LLMs by integrating diverse biological sequenced-based prediction tasks with advanced reasoning capabilities, while maintaining conversational fluency. Additionally, we reveal significant performance limitations in even state-of-the-art LLMs on biological sequence-related multi-omics tasks without specialized pre-training and instruction-tuning. We further develop a strong baseline called ChatMultiOmics with a novel three-stage training pipeline, demonstrating the powerful ability to understand biology by using Biology-Instructions. Biology-Instructions and ChatMultiOmics are publicly available and crucial resources for enabling more effective integration of LLMs with multi-omics sequence analysis.

 ### Reasoning over Uncertain Text by Generative Large Language Models
**Authors**: Aliakbar Nafar, Kristen Brent Venable, Parisa Kordjamshidi

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T18:43:59Z

**Summary**: This paper considers the challenges Large Language Models (LLMs) face when reasoning over text that includes information involving uncertainty explicitly quantified via probability values. This type of reasoning is relevant to a variety of contexts ranging from everyday conversations to medical decision-making. Despite improvements in the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, they still exhibit significant difficulties when it comes to probabilistic reasoning. To deal with this problem, we introduce the Bayesian Linguistic Inference Dataset (BLInD), a new dataset specifically designed to test the probabilistic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We use BLInD to find out the limitations of LLMs for tasks involving probabilistic reasoning. In addition, we present several prompting strategies that map the problem to different formal representations, including Python code, probabilistic algorithms, and probabilistic logical programming. We conclude by providing an evaluation of our methods on BLInD and an adaptation of a causal reasoning question-answering dataset. Our empirical results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed strategies for multiple LLMs.

### Can AI Help with Your Personal Finances?
**Authors**: Oudom Hean, Utsha Saha, Binita Saha

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T18:25:27Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative development in artificial intelligence (AI), drawing significant attention from industry and academia. Trained on vast datasets, these sophisticated AI systems exhibit impressive natural language processing and content generation capabilities. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to address key challenges in personal finance, focusing on the United States. We evaluate several leading LLMs, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's Llama, to assess their effectiveness in providing accurate financial advice on topics such as mortgages, taxes, loans, and investments. Our findings show that while these models achieve an average accuracy rate of approximately 70%, they also display notable limitations in certain areas. Specifically, LLMs struggle to provide accurate responses for complex financial queries, with performance varying significantly across different topics. Despite these limitations, the analysis reveals notable improvements in newer versions of these models, highlighting their growing utility for individuals and financial advisors. As these AI systems continue to evolve, their potential for advancing AI-driven applications in personal finance becomes increasingly promising.

### Fortran2CPP: Automating Fortran-to-C++ Migration using LLMs via   Multi-Turn Dialogue and Dual-Agent Integration
**Authors**: Le Chen, Bin Lei, Dunzhi Zhou, Pei-Hung Lin, Chunhua Liao, Caiwen Ding, Ali Jannesari

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T18:06:25Z

**Summary**: Migrating Fortran code to C++ is a common task for many scientific computing teams, driven by the need to leverage modern programming paradigms, enhance cross-platform compatibility, and improve maintainability. Automating this translation process using large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, but the lack of high-quality, specialized datasets has hindered their effectiveness. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel multi-turn dialogue dataset, Fortran2CPP, specifically designed for Fortran-to-C++ code migration. Our dataset, significantly larger than existing alternatives, is generated using a unique LLM-driven, dual-agent pipeline incorporating iterative compilation, execution, and code repair to ensure high quality and functional correctness. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset, we fine-tuned several open-weight LLMs on Fortran2CPP and evaluated their performance on two independent benchmarks. Fine-tuning on our dataset led to remarkable gains, with models achieving up to a 3.31x increase in CodeBLEU score and a 92\% improvement in compilation success rate. This highlights the dataset's ability to enhance both the syntactic accuracy and compilability of the translated C++ code. Our dataset and model have been open-sourced and are available on our public GitHub repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/HPC-Fortran2CPP/Fortran2Cpp}}.

### CHESS: Optimizing LLM Inference via Channel-Wise Thresholding and   Selective Sparsification
**Authors**: Junhui He, Shangyu Wu, Weidong Wen, Chun Jason Xue, Qingan Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T17:49:34Z

**Summary**: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices presents significant challenges due to the substantial computational overhead and memory requirements. Activation sparsification can mitigate these resource challenges by reducing the number of activated neurons during inference. Existing methods typically employ thresholding-based sparsification based on the statistics of activation tensors. However, they do not model the impact of activation sparsification on performance, resulting in suboptimal performance degradation. To address the limitations, this paper reformulates the activation sparsification problem to explicitly capture the relationship between activation sparsity and model performance. Then, this paper proposes CHESS, a general activation sparsification approach via CHannel-wise thrEsholding and Selective Sparsification. First, channel-wise thresholding assigns a unique threshold to each activation channel in the feed-forward network (FFN) layers. Then, selective sparsification involves applying thresholding-based activation sparsification to specific layers within the attention modules. Finally, we detail the implementation of sparse kernels to accelerate LLM inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CHESS achieves lower performance degradation over eight downstream tasks while activating fewer parameters than existing methods, thus speeding up the LLM inference by up to 1.27x.

### "Did my figure do justice to the answer?" : Towards Multimodal Short   Answer Grading with Feedback (MMSAF)
**Authors**: Pritam Sil, Bhaskaran Raman, Pushpak Bhattacharyya

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T17:33:39Z

**Summary**: Personalized feedback plays a vital role in a student's learning process. While existing systems are adept at providing feedback over MCQ-based evaluation, this work focuses more on subjective and open-ended questions, which is similar to the problem of Automatic Short Answer Grading (ASAG) with feedback. Additionally, we introduce the Multimodal Short Answer grading with Feedback (MMSAF) problem over the traditional ASAG feedback problem to address the scenario where the student answer and reference answer might contain images. Moreover, we introduce the MMSAF dataset with 2197 data points along with an automated framework for generating such data sets. Our evaluations on existing LLMs over this dataset achieved an overall accuracy of 55\% on Level of Correctness labels, 75\% on Image Relevance labels and a score of 4.27 out of 5 in correctness level of LLM generated feedback as rated by experts. As per experts, Pixtral achieved a rating of above 4 out of all metrics, indicating that it is more aligned to human judgement, and that it is the best solution for assisting students.

### Can Large Language Models Adapt to Other Agents In-Context?
**Authors**: Matthew Riemer, Zahra Ashktorab, Djallel Bouneffouf, Payel Das, Miao Liu, Justin D. Weisz, Murray Campbell

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T16:30:12Z

**Summary**: As the research community aims to build better AI assistants that are more dynamic and personalized to the diversity of humans that they interact with, there is increased interest in evaluating the theory of mind capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Indeed, several recent studies suggest that LLM theory of mind capabilities are quite impressive, approximating human-level performance. Our paper aims to rebuke this narrative and argues instead that past studies were not directly measuring agent performance, potentially leading to findings that are illusory in nature as a result. We draw a strong distinction between what we call literal theory of mind i.e. measuring the agent's ability to predict the behavior of others and functional theory of mind i.e. adapting to agents in-context based on a rational response to predictions of their behavior. We find that top performing open source LLMs may display strong capabilities in literal theory of mind, depending on how they are prompted, but seem to struggle with functional theory of mind -- even when partner policies are exceedingly simple. Our work serves to highlight the double sided nature of inductive bias in LLMs when adapting to new situations. While this bias can lead to strong performance over limited horizons, it often hinders convergence to optimal long-term behavior.

### Gradient Alignment Improves Test-Time Adaptation for Medical Image   Segmentation
**Authors**: Ziyang Chen, Yiwen Ye, Yongsheng Pan, Yong Xia

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T16:29:25Z

**Summary**: Although recent years have witnessed significant advancements in medical image segmentation, the pervasive issue of domain shift among medical images from diverse centres hinders the effective deployment of pre-trained models. Many Test-time Adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to address this issue by fine-tuning pre-trained models with test data during inference. These methods, however, often suffer from less-satisfactory optimization due to suboptimal optimization direction (dictated by the gradient) and fixed step-size (predicated on the learning rate). In this paper, we propose the Gradient alignment-based Test-time adaptation (GraTa) method to improve both the gradient direction and learning rate in the optimization procedure. Unlike conventional TTA methods, which primarily optimize the pseudo gradient derived from a self-supervised objective, our method incorporates an auxiliary gradient with the pseudo one to facilitate gradient alignment. Such gradient alignment enables the model to excavate the similarities between different gradients and correct the gradient direction to approximate the empirical gradient related to the current segmentation task. Additionally, we design a dynamic learning rate based on the cosine similarity between the pseudo and auxiliary gradients, thereby empowering the adaptive fine-tuning of pre-trained models on diverse test data. Extensive experiments establish the effectiveness of the proposed gradient alignment and dynamic learning rate and substantiate the superiority of our GraTa method over other state-of-the-art TTA methods on a benchmark medical image segmentation task. The code and weights of pre-trained source models are available at https://github.com/Chen-Ziyang/GraTa.

### Trading Off Energy Storage and Payload -- An Analytical Model for   Freight Train Configuration
**Authors**: Max T. M. Ng, Adrian Hernandez, Pablo L. Durango-Cohen, Hani S. Mahmassani

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T16:18:35Z

**Summary**: To support planning of alternative fuel technology (e.g., battery-electric locomotives) deployment for decarbonizing non-electrified freight rail, we develop a convex optimization formulation with a closed-form solution to determine the optimal number of energy storage tender cars in a train. The formulation shares a similar structure to an Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model. For given market characteristics, cost forecasts, and technology parameters, our model captures the trade-offs between inventory carrying costs associated with trip times (including delays due to charging/refueling) and ordering costs associated with train dispatch and operation (energy, amortized equipment, and labor costs). To illustrate the framework, we find the optimal number of battery-electric energy tender cars in 22,501 freight markets (origin-destination pairs and commodities) for U.S. Class I railroads. The results display heterogeneity in optimal configurations with lighter, yet more time-sensitive shipments (e.g., intermodal) utilizing more battery tender cars. For heavier commodities (e.g., coal) with lower holding costs, single battery tender car configurations are generally optimal. The results also show that the optimal train configurations are sensitive to delays associated with recharging or swapping tender cars.

### Toward Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models with Thought Rollback
**Authors**: Sijia Chen, Baochun Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T16:02:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been routinely used to solve various tasks using step-by-step reasoning. However, the structure of intermediate reasoning steps, or thoughts, is rigid and unidirectional, such as chains, trees, or acyclic-directed graphs. Consequently, the resulting inflexible and forward-only reasoning may not address challenging tasks and fail when the LLM frequently gives false responses, i.e., ``hallucinations''. This paper proposes a new reasoning framework, called Thought Rollback (TR), allowing LLMs to adaptively build thought structure while maintaining effective reasoning toward problem-solving under ``hallucinations''. The core mechanism of TR is rolling back thoughts, which allows LLMs to perform error analysis on thoughts, and thus roll back to any previously mistaken thought for revision. Subsequently, by including such trial-and-error in the prompt to guide the LLM, each rollback leads to one more reliable reasoning path. Therefore, starting with a simple prompt without human annotations, LLM with TR adaptively and gradually explores thoughts for a correct solution. Comprehensive experiments on mathematical problems and multi-task reasoning demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TR in terms of problem-solving rate and interaction cost. For instance, the solving rate of GPT-4 with TR outperforms the current best by $9\%$ on the MATH dataset.

### Electric Vehicle Charging Network Design under Congestion
**Authors**: Antoine Deza, Kai Huang, Carlos Aníbal Suárez

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T15:33:14Z

**Summary**: This paper presents an extension of a recently introduced multistage stochastic integer model designed for optimizing the deployment of charging stations under uncertainty. A key contribution of this work is incorporating additional constraints accounting for congestion management at charging stations. The solution approach combines a greedy heuristic with a branch-and-price algorithm, enabling the efficient handling of medium instances. In the branch-and-price algorithm, when the solution to the restricted master problem is not integer, a greedy heuristic and a local search procedure are conducted to obtain feasible solutions. Computational experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

### Intertwining CP and NLP: The Generation of Unreasonably Constrained   Sentences
**Authors**: Alexandre Bonlarron, Jean-Charles Régin

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T14:56:10Z

**Summary**: Constrained text generation remains a challenging task, particularly when dealing with hard constraints. Traditional NLP approaches prioritize generating meaningful and coherent output. Also, the current state-of-the-art methods often lack the expressiveness and constraint satisfaction capabilities to handle such tasks effectively. Recently, an approach for generating constrained sentences in CP has been proposed in (Bonlarron et al, 2023). This ad-hoc model to solve the sentences generation problem under MNREAD rules proved neithertheless to be computationaly and structuraly unsuitable to deal with other more constrained problems. In this paper, a novel more generic approach is introduced to tackle many of these previously untractable problems, and illustrated here with the quite untractable sentences generation problem following RADNER rules.   More precisely, this paper presents the CPTextGen Framework. This framework considers a constrained text generation problem as a discrete combinatorial optimization problem. It is solved by a constraint programming method that combines linguistic properties (e.g., n-grams or language level) with other more classical constraints (e.g., the number of characters, syllables). Eventually, a curation phase allows for selecting the best-generated sentences according to perplexity using an LLM.   The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by tackling a new, more tediously constrained text generation problem: the iconic RADNER sentences problem. This problem aims to generate sentences respecting a set of quite strict rules defined by their use in vision and clinical research. Thanks to our CP-based approach, many new strongly constrained sentences have been successfully generated. This highlights our approach's potential to handle unreasonably constrained text generation scenarios.

### Lusifer: LLM-based User SImulated Feedback Environment for online   Recommender systems
**Authors**: Danial Ebrat, Eli Paradalis, Luis Rueda

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T14:44:30Z

**Summary**: Training reinforcement learning-based recommender systems is often hindered by the lack of dynamic and realistic user interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce Lusifer, a novel environment leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate simulated user feedback. Lusifer synthesizes user profiles and interaction histories to simulate responses and behaviors toward recommended items, with profiles updated after each rating to reflect evolving user characteristics. Utilizing the MovieLens dataset as a proof of concept, we limited our implementation to the last 40 interactions for each user, representing approximately 39% and 22% of the training sets, to focus on recent user behavior. For consistency and to gain insights into the performance of traditional methods with limited data, we implemented baseline approaches using the same data subset. Our results demonstrate that Lusifer accurately emulates user behavior and preferences, even with reduced training data having an RMSE of 1.3 across various test sets. This paper presents Lusifer's operational pipeline, including prompt generation and iterative user profile updates, and compares its performance against baseline methods. The findings validate Lusifer's ability to produce realistic dynamic feedback and suggest that it offers a scalable and adjustable framework for user simulation in online reinforcement learning recommender systems for future studies, particularly when training data is limited.

### Toward Scalable Multirobot Control: Fast Policy Learning in Distributed   MPC
**Authors**: Xinglong Zhang, Wei Pan, Cong Li, Xin Xu, Xiangke Wang, Ronghua Zhang, Dewen Hu

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T14:31:52Z

**Summary**: Distributed model predictive control (DMPC) is promising in achieving optimal cooperative control in multirobot systems (MRS). However, real-time DMPC implementation relies on numerical optimization tools to periodically calculate local control sequences online. This process is computationally demanding and lacks scalability for large-scale, nonlinear MRS. This article proposes a novel distributed learning-based predictive control (DLPC) framework for scalable multirobot control. Unlike conventional DMPC methods that calculate open-loop control sequences, our approach centers around a computationally fast and efficient distributed policy learning algorithm that generates explicit closed-loop DMPC policies for MRS without using numerical solvers. The policy learning is executed incrementally and forward in time in each prediction interval through an online distributed actor-critic implementation. The control policies are successively updated in a receding-horizon manner, enabling fast and efficient policy learning with the closed-loop stability guarantee. The learned control policies could be deployed online to MRS with varying robot scales, enhancing scalability and transferability for large-scale MRS. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to address the multirobot safe learning challenge through a force field-inspired policy learning approach. We validate our approach's effectiveness, scalability, and efficiency through extensive experiments on cooperative tasks of large-scale wheeled robots and multirotor drones. Our results demonstrate the rapid learning and deployment of DMPC policies for MRS with scales up to 10,000 units.

### CAD-GPT: Synthesising CAD Construction Sequence with Spatial   Reasoning-Enhanced Multimodal LLMs
**Authors**: Siyu Wang, Cailian Chen, Xinyi Le, Qimin Xu, Lei Xu, Yanzhou Zhang, Jie Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T14:19:36Z

**Summary**: Computer-aided design (CAD) significantly enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and innovation of design processes by enabling precise 2D and 3D modeling, extensive analysis, and optimization. Existing methods for creating CAD models rely on latent vectors or point clouds, which are difficult to obtain and costly to store. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have inspired researchers to use natural language instructions and images for CAD model construction. However, these models still struggle with inferring accurate 3D spatial location and orientation, leading to inaccuracies in determining the spatial 3D starting points and extrusion directions for constructing geometries. This work introduces CAD-GPT, a CAD synthesis method with spatial reasoning-enhanced MLLM that takes either a single image or a textual description as input. To achieve precise spatial inference, our approach introduces a 3D Modeling Spatial Mechanism. This method maps 3D spatial positions and 3D sketch plane rotation angles into a 1D linguistic feature space using a specialized spatial unfolding mechanism, while discretizing 2D sketch coordinates into an appropriate planar space to enable precise determination of spatial starting position, sketch orientation, and 2D sketch coordinate translations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAD-GPT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in CAD model synthesis, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

### Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents
**Authors**: Haishuo Fang, Xiaodan Zhu, Iryna Gurevych

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T14:17:05Z

**Summary**: Deploying LLM-based agents in real-life applications often faces a critical challenge: the misalignment between agents' behavior and user intent. Such misalignment may lead agents to unintentionally execute critical actions that carry negative outcomes (e.g., accidentally triggering a "buy-now" in web shopping), resulting in undesirable or even irreversible consequences. Although addressing these issues is crucial, the preemptive detection and correction of misaligned actions remains relatively underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce InferAct, a novel approach that leverages the belief reasoning ability of LLMs, grounded in Theory-of-Mind, to detect misaligned actions before execution. Once the misalignment is detected, InferAct alerts users for timely correction, preventing adverse outcomes and enhancing the reliability of LLM agents' decision-making processes. Experiments on three widely used tasks demonstrate that InferAct achieves up to 20% improvements on Marco-F1 against baselines in misaligned action detection. An in-depth evaluation of misalignment correction further highlights InferAct's effectiveness in improving agent alignment.

### FreStega: A Plug-and-Play Method for Boosting Imperceptibility and   Capacity in Generative Linguistic Steganography for Real-World Scenarios
**Authors**: Kaiyi Pang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T13:56:51Z

**Summary**: Linguistic steganography embeds secret information in seemingly innocent texts, safeguarding privacy in surveillance environments. Generative linguistic steganography leverages the probability distribution of language models (LMs) and applies steganographic algorithms to generate stego tokens, gaining attention with recent Large Language Model (LLM) advancements. To enhance security, researchers develop distribution-preserving stego algorithms to minimize the gap between stego sampling and LM sampling. However, the reliance on language model distributions, coupled with deviations from real-world cover texts, results in insufficient imperceptibility when facing steganalysis detectors in real-world scenarios. Moreover, LLM distributions tend to be more deterministic, resulting in reduced entropy and, consequently, lower embedding capacity. In this paper, we propose FreStega, a plug-and-play method to reconstruct the distribution of language models used for generative linguistic steganography. FreStega dynamically adjusts token probabilities from the language model at each step of stegotext auto-regressive generation, leveraging both sequential and spatial dimensions. In sequential adjustment, the temperature is dynamically adjusted based on instantaneous entropy, enhancing the diversity of stego texts and boosting embedding capacity. In the spatial dimension, the distribution is aligned with guidance from the target domain corpus, closely mimicking real cover text in the target domain. By reforming the distribution, FreStega enhances the imperceptibility of stego text in practical scenarios and improves steganographic capacity by 15.41\%, all without compromising the quality of the generated text. FreStega serves as a plug-and-play remedy to enhance the imperceptibility and embedding capacity of existing distribution-preserving steganography methods in real-world scenarios.

### Evaluating Software Development Agents: Patch Patterns, Code Quality,   and Issue Complexity in Real-World GitHub Scenarios
**Authors**: Zhi Chen, Lingxiao Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T13:52:05Z

**Summary**: In recent years, AI-based software engineering has progressed from pre-trained models to advanced agentic workflows, with Software Development Agents representing the next major leap. These agents, capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with external environments, offer promising solutions to complex software engineering tasks. However, while much research has evaluated code generated by large language models (LLMs), comprehensive studies on agent-generated patches, particularly in real-world settings, are lacking. This study addresses that gap by evaluating 4,892 patches from 10 top-ranked agents on 500 real-world GitHub issues from SWE-Bench Verified, focusing on their impact on code quality. Our analysis shows no single agent dominated, with 170 issues unresolved, indicating room for improvement. Even for patches that passed unit tests and resolved issues, agents made different file and function modifications compared to the gold patches from repository developers, revealing limitations in the benchmark's test case coverage. Most agents maintained code reliability and security, avoiding new bugs or vulnerabilities; while some agents increased code complexity, many reduced code duplication and minimized code smells. Finally, agents performed better on simpler codebases, suggesting that breaking complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks could improve effectiveness. This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of agent-generated patches on real-world GitHub issues, offering insights to advance AI-driven software development.

### GenDFIR: Advancing Cyber Incident Timeline Analysis Through Retrieval   Augmented Generation and Large Language Models
**Authors**: Fatma Yasmine Loumachi, Mohamed Chahine Ghanem, Mohamed Amine Ferrag

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T13:29:14Z

**Summary**: Cyber timeline analysis, or forensic timeline analysis, is crucial in Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). It examines artefacts and events particularly timestamps and metadata to detect anomalies, establish correlations, and reconstruct incident timelines. Traditional methods rely on structured artefacts, such as logs and filesystem metadata, using specialised tools for evidence identification and feature extraction. This paper introduces GenDFIR, a framework leveraging large language models (LLMs), specifically Llama 3.1 8B in zero shot mode, integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent. Incident data is preprocessed into a structured knowledge base, enabling the RAG agent to retrieve relevant events based on user prompts. The LLM interprets this context, offering semantic enrichment. Tested on synthetic data in a controlled environment, results demonstrate GenDFIR's reliability and robustness, showcasing LLMs potential to automate timeline analysis and advance threat detection.

### IMTP: Search-based Code Generation for In-memory Tensor Programs
**Authors**: Yongwon Shin, Dookyung Kang, Hyojin Sung

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T13:19:35Z

**Summary**: Processing-in-DRAM (DRAM-PIM) has emerged as a promising technology for accelerating memory-intensive operations in modern applications, such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its potential, current software stacks for DRAM-PIM face significant challenges, including reliance on hand-tuned libraries that hinder programmability, limited support for high-level abstractions, and the lack of systematic optimization frameworks. To address these limitations, we present IMTP, a search-based optimizing tensor compiler for UPMEM. Key features of IMTP include: (1) automated searches of the joint search space for host and kernel tensor programs, (2) PIM-aware optimizations for efficiently handling boundary conditions, and (3) improved search algorithms for the expanded search space of UPMEM systems. Our experimental results on UPMEM hardware demonstrate performance gains of up to 8.21x for various UPMEM benchmark kernels and 5.33x for GPT-J layers. To the best of our knowledge, IMTP is the first tensor compiler to provide fully automated, autotuning-integrated code generation support for a DRAM-PIM system. By bridging the gap between high-level tensor computation abstractions and low-level hardware-specific requirements, IMTP establishes a foundation for advancing DRAM-PIM programmability and enabling streamlined optimization.

### Signatures of prediction during natural listening in MEG data?
**Authors**: Sahel Azizpour, Britta U. Westner, Jakub Szewczyk, Umut Güçlü, Linda Geerligs

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T12:49:03Z

**Summary**: The brain uses contextual information and prior knowledge to anticipate upcoming content during language comprehension. Recent research has shown predictive signals can be revealed in pre-onset ECoG activity during naturalistic narrative listening, by building encoding models based on word embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs). Similarly, evidence for long-range predictive encoding has been observed in fMRI data, where incorporating embeddings for multiple upcoming words in a narrative improves alignment with brain activity. This study examines whether similar predictive information can be detected in MEG, a technique with higher temporal resolution than fMRI but a lower signal-to-noise ratio than ECoG. Our findings indicate that MEG captures pre-onset representations up to 1 second before word onset, consistent with ECoG results. However, unlike fMRI findings, incorporating future word embeddings did not enhance MEG encoding, even for one word into the future, which suggests that the pre-onset encoding may not reflect predictive processing. This work demonstrates that MEG combined with LLMs is a valuable approach for studying language processing in naturalistic narratives and highlights the need to study further what constitutes evidence for prediction during natural listening.

### Gradient Weight-normalized Low-rank Projection for Efficient LLM   Training
**Authors**: Jia-Hong Huang, Yixian Shen, Hongyi Zhu, Stevan Rudinac, Evangelos Kanoulas

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T12:23:39Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various tasks, but the escalating demands on computational resources pose significant challenges, particularly in the extensive utilization of full fine-tuning for downstream tasks. To address this, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been developed, but they often underperform compared to full fine-tuning and struggle with memory efficiency. In this work, we introduce Gradient Weight-Normalized Low-Rank Projection (GradNormLoRP), a novel approach that enhances both parameter and memory efficiency while maintaining comparable performance to full fine-tuning. GradNormLoRP normalizes the weight matrix to improve gradient conditioning, facilitating better convergence during optimization. Additionally, it applies low-rank approximations to the weight and gradient matrices, significantly reducing memory usage during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 8-bit GradNormLoRP reduces optimizer memory usage by up to 89.5% and enables the pre-training of large LLMs, such as LLaMA 7B, on consumer-level GPUs like the NVIDIA RTX 4090, without additional inference costs. Moreover, GradNormLoRP outperforms existing low-rank methods in fine-tuning tasks. For instance, when fine-tuning the RoBERTa model on all GLUE tasks with a rank of 8, GradNormLoRP achieves an average score of 80.65, surpassing LoRA's score of 79.23. These results underscore GradNormLoRP as a promising alternative for efficient LLM pre-training and fine-tuning.

### Machine Generated Product Advertisements: Benchmarking LLMs Against   Human Performance
**Authors**: Sanjukta Ghosh

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T12:11:50Z

**Summary**: This study compares the performance of AI-generated and human-written product descriptions using a multifaceted evaluation model. We analyze descriptions for 100 products generated by four AI models (Gemma 2B, LLAMA, GPT2, and ChatGPT 4) with and without sample descriptions, against human-written descriptions. Our evaluation metrics include sentiment, readability, persuasiveness, Search Engine Optimization(SEO), clarity, emotional appeal, and call-to-action effectiveness. The results indicate that ChatGPT 4 performs the best. In contrast, other models demonstrate significant shortcomings, producing incoherent and illogical output that lacks logical structure and contextual relevance. These models struggle to maintain focus on the product being described, resulting in disjointed sentences that do not convey meaningful information. This research provides insights into the current capabilities and limitations of AI in the creation of content for e-Commerce.

### Photonic classification on a single diffractive layer
**Authors**: Anil J. Pekgöz, Emre Yüce

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T12:09:28Z

**Summary**: Photonic computation started to shape the future of fast, efficient and accessible computation. The advantages brought by light based Diffractive Deep Neural Networks (D2NN), are shown to be overwhelmingly advantageous especially in targeting classification problems. However, cost and complexity of multi-layer systems are the main challenges that reduce the deployment of this technology. In this study, we develop a simple yet extremely efficient way to achieve optical classification using a single diffractive optical layer. A spatial light modulator is used not only to emulate the classifying system but also the input medium for the objects to be classified by the system. Using our approach, we classify road traffic signs which has a direct application on daily life and safety. We perform classification of road signs under the effect of noise and show that we can successfully classify road signs with more than 75% accuracy under 20% noise/imperfection.

### SocRATES: Towards Automated Scenario-based Testing of Social Navigation   Algorithms
**Authors**: Shashank Rao Marpally, Pranav Goyal, Harold Soh

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T11:33:19Z

**Summary**: Current social navigation methods and benchmarks primarily focus on proxemics and task efficiency. While these factors are important, qualitative aspects such as perceptions of a robot's social competence are equally crucial for successful adoption and integration into human environments. We propose a more comprehensive evaluation of social navigation through scenario-based testing, where specific human-robot interaction scenarios can reveal key robot behaviors. However, creating such scenarios is often labor-intensive and complex. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a pipeline that automates the generation of context-, and location-appropriate social navigation scenarios, ready for simulation. Our pipeline transforms simple scenario metadata into detailed textual scenarios, infers pedestrian and robot trajectories, and simulates pedestrian behaviors, which enables more controlled evaluation. We leverage the social reasoning and code-generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline scenario generation and translation. Our experiments show that our pipeline produces realistic scenarios and significantly improves scenario translation over naive LLM prompting. Additionally, we present initial feedback from a usability study with social navigation experts and a case-study demonstrating a scenario-based evaluation of three navigation algorithms.

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T11:03:26Z

**Summary**: The growing complexity of radar signals demands responsive and accurate detection systems that can operate efficiently on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing models, while effective, often rely on substantial computational resources and large datasets, making them impractical for edge deployment. In this work, we propose an ultralight hybrid neural network optimized for edge applications, delivering robust performance across unfavorable signal-to-noise ratios (mean accuracy of 96.3% at 0 dB) using less than 100 samples per class, and significantly reducing computational overhead.

### An Actionable Hierarchical Scene Representation Enhancing Autonomous   Inspection Missions in Unknown Environments
**Authors**: Vignesh Kottayam Viswanathan, Mario Alberto Valdes Saucedo, Sumeet Gajanan Satpute, Christoforos Kanellakis, George Nikolakopoulos

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T10:57:17Z

**Summary**: In this article, we present the Layered Semantic Graphs (LSG), a novel actionable hierarchical scene graph, fully integrated with a multi-modal mission planner, the FLIE: A First-Look based Inspection and Exploration planner. The novelty of this work stems from aiming to address the task of maintaining an intuitive and multi-resolution scene representation, while simultaneously offering a tractable foundation for planning and scene understanding during an ongoing inspection mission of apriori unknown targets-of-interest in an unknown environment. The proposed LSG scheme is composed of locally nested hierarchical graphs, at multiple layers of abstraction, with the abstract concepts grounded on the functionality of the integrated FLIE planner. Furthermore, LSG encapsulates real-time semantic segmentation models that offer extraction and localization of desired semantic elements within the hierarchical representation. This extends the capability of the inspection planner, which can then leverage LSG to make an informed decision to inspect a particular semantic of interest. We also emphasize the hierarchical and semantic path-planning capabilities of LSG, which can extend inspection missions by improving situational awareness for human operators in an unknown environment. The validity of the proposed scheme is proven through extensive evaluations of the proposed architecture in simulations, as well as experimental field deployments on a Boston Dynamics Spot quadruped robot in urban outdoor environment settings.

### Official-NV: An LLM-Generated News Video Dataset for Multimodal Fake   News Detection
**Authors**: Yihao Wang, Lizhi Chen, Zhong Qian, Peifeng Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T10:34:15Z

**Summary**: News media, especially video news media, have penetrated into every aspect of daily life, which also brings the risk of fake news. Therefore, multimodal fake news detection has recently garnered increased attention. However, the existing datasets are comprised of user-uploaded videos and contain an excess amounts of superfluous data, which introduces noise into the model training process. To address this issue, we construct a dataset named Official-NV, comprising officially published news videos. The crawl officially published videos are augmented through the use of LLMs-based generation and manual verification, thereby expanding the dataset. We also propose a new baseline model called OFNVD, which captures key information from multimodal features through a GLU attention mechanism and performs feature enhancement and modal aggregation via a cross-modal Transformer. Benchmarking the dataset and baselines demonstrates the effectiveness of our model in multimodal news detection.

### The Current Challenges of Software Engineering in the Era of Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Cuiyun Gao, Xing Hu, Shan Gao, Xin Xia, Zhi Jin

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T10:17:12Z

**Summary**: With the advent of large language models (LLMs) in the artificial intelligence (AI) area, the field of software engineering (SE) has also witnessed a paradigm shift. These models, by leveraging the power of deep learning and massive amounts of data, have demonstrated an unprecedented capacity to understand, generate, and operate programming languages. They can assist developers in completing a broad spectrum of software development activities, encompassing software design, automated programming, and maintenance, which potentially reduces huge human efforts. Integrating LLMs within the SE landscape (LLM4SE) has become a burgeoning trend, necessitating exploring this emergent landscape's challenges and opportunities.   The paper aims at revisiting the software development life cycle (SDLC) under LLMs, and highlighting challenges and opportunities of the new paradigm. The paper first summarizes the overall process of LLM4SE, and then elaborates on the current challenges based on a through discussion. The discussion was held among more than 20 participants from academia and industry, specializing in fields such as software engineering and artificial intelligence. Specifically, we achieve 26 key challenges from seven aspects, including software requirement & design, coding assistance, testing code generation, code review, code maintenance, software vulnerability management, and data, training, and evaluation. We hope the achieved challenges would benefit future research in the LLM4SE field.

### Agent-OM: Leveraging LLM Agents for Ontology Matching
**Authors**: Zhangcheng Qiang, Weiqing Wang, Kerry Taylor

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T10:12:28Z

**Summary**: Ontology matching (OM) enables semantic interoperability between different ontologies and resolves their conceptual heterogeneity by aligning related entities. OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems. While large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents have revolutionised data engineering and have been applied creatively in many domains, their potential for OM remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With consideration of several specific challenges in leveraging LLM agents for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM (Agent for Ontology Matching), consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve results very close to the long-standing best performance on simple OM tasks and can significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks.

### Hindsight Planner: A Closed-Loop Few-Shot Planner for Embodied   Instruction Following
**Authors**: Yuxiao Yang, Shenao Zhang, Zhihan Liu, Huaxiu Yao, Zhaoran Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T10:05:45Z

**Summary**: This work focuses on building a task planner for Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) using Large Language Models (LLMs). Previous works typically train a planner to imitate expert trajectories, treating this as a supervised task. While these methods achieve competitive performance, they often lack sufficient robustness. When a suboptimal action is taken, the planner may encounter an out-of-distribution state, which can lead to task failure. In contrast, we frame the task as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and aim to develop a robust planner under a few-shot assumption. Thus, we propose a closed-loop planner with an adaptation module and a novel hindsight method, aiming to use as much information as possible to assist the planner. Our experiments on the ALFRED dataset indicate that our planner achieves competitive performance under a few-shot assumption. For the first time, our few-shot agent's performance approaches and even surpasses that of the full-shot supervised agent.

### From Commands to Prompts: LLM-based Semantic File System for AIOS
**Authors**: Zeru Shi, Kai Mei, Yongye Su, Chaoji Zuo, Wenyue Hua, Wujiang Xu, Yujie Ren, Zirui Liu, Mengnan Du, Dong Deng, Yongfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T08:32:38Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the development of intelligent applications and systems such as LLM-based agents and agent operating systems (AIOS). However, when these applications and systems interact with the underlying file system, the file system still remains the traditional paradigm: reliant on manual navigation through precise commands. This paradigm poses a bottleneck to the usability of these systems as users are required to navigate complex folder hierarchies and remember cryptic file names. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based semantic file system ( LSFS ) for prompt-driven file management. Unlike conventional approaches, LSFS incorporates LLMs to enable users or agents to interact with files through natural language prompts, facilitating semantic file management. At the macro-level, we develop a comprehensive API set to achieve semantic file management functionalities, such as semantic file retrieval, file update monitoring and summarization, and semantic file rollback). At the micro-level, we store files by constructing semantic indexes for them, design and implement syscalls of different semantic operations (e.g., CRUD, group by, join) powered by vector database. Our experiments show that LSFS offers significant improvements over traditional file systems in terms of user convenience, the diversity of supported functions, and the accuracy and efficiency of file operations. Additionally, with the integration of LLM, our system enables more intelligent file management tasks, such as content summarization and version comparison, further enhancing its capabilities.

### Real-time classification of EEG signals using Machine Learning   deployment
**Authors**: Swati Chowdhuri, Satadip Saha, Samadrita Karmakar, Ankur Chanda

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T08:14:28Z

**Summary**: The prevailing educational methods predominantly rely on traditional classroom instruction or online delivery, often limiting the teachers' ability to engage effectively with all the students simultaneously. A more intrinsic method of evaluating student attentiveness during lectures can enable the educators to tailor the course materials and their teaching styles in order to better meet the students' needs. The aim of this paper is to enhance teaching quality in real time, thereby fostering a higher student engagement in the classroom activities. By monitoring the students' electroencephalography (EEG) signals and employing machine learning algorithms, this study proposes a comprehensive solution for addressing this challenge. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for simplifying the analysis of complex variables, enabling the effective assessment of the students' concentration levels based on specific parameters. However, the real-time impact of machine learning models necessitates a careful consideration as their deployment is concerned. This study proposes a machine learning-based approach for predicting the level of students' comprehension with regard to a certain topic. A browser interface was introduced that accesses the values of the system's parameters to determine a student's level of concentration on a chosen topic. The deployment of the proposed system made it necessary to address the real-time challenges faced by the students, consider the system's cost, and establish trust in its efficacy. This paper presents the efforts made for approaching this pertinent issue through the implementation of innovative technologies and provides a framework for addressing key considerations for future research directions.

### Confidence v.s. Critique: A Decomposition of Self-Correction Capability   for LLMs
**Authors**: Zhe Yang, Yichang Zhang, Yudong Wang, Ziyao Xu, Junyang Lin, Zhifang Sui

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T08:09:11Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can correct their self-generated responses, but a decline in accuracy after self-correction is also witnessed. To have a deeper understanding of self-correction, we endeavor to decompose, evaluate, and analyze the self-correction behaviors of LLMs. By enumerating and analyzing answer correctness before and after self-correction, we decompose the self-correction capability into confidence (being confident to correct answers) and critique (turning wrong answers to correct) capabilities, and propose two metrics from a probabilistic perspective to measure these 2 capabilities, along with another metric for overall self-correction capability evaluation. Based on our decomposition and evaluation metrics, we conduct extensive experiments and draw some empirical conclusions. For example, we find different models can exhibit distinct behaviors: some models are confident while others are more critical. We also find the trade-off between the two capabilities (i.e. improving one can lead to a decline in the other) when manipulating model self-correction behavior by prompts or in-context learning. Further, we find a simple yet efficient strategy to improve self-correction capability by transforming Supervision Fine-Tuning (SFT) data format, and our strategy outperforms vanilla SFT in both capabilities and achieves much higher accuracy after self-correction. Our code will be publicly available on GitHub.

### Safeguard Fine-Tuned LLMs Through Pre- and Post-Tuning Model Merging
**Authors**: Hua Farn, Hsuan Su, Shachi H Kumar, Saurav Sahay, Shang-Tse Chen, Hung-yi Lee

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T08:03:22Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks is a widely adopted approach, but it often leads to safety degradation in safety-aligned LLMs. Currently, many solutions address this issue by incorporating additional safety data, which can be impractical in many cases. In this paper, we address the question: How can we improve downstream task performance while preserving safety in LLMs without relying on additional safety data? We propose a simple and effective method that maintains the inherent safety of LLMs while enhancing their downstream task performance: merging the weights of pre- and post-fine-tuned safety-aligned models. Experimental results across various downstream tasks, models, and merging methods demonstrate that this approach effectively mitigates safety degradation while improving downstream task performance, offering a practical solution for adapting safety-aligned LLMs.

### MBQ: Modality-Balanced Quantization for Large Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Shiyao Li, Yingchun Hu, Xuefei Ning, Xihui Liu, Ke Hong, Xiaotao Jia, Xiuhong Li, Yaqi Yan, Pei Ran, Guohao Dai, Shengen Yan, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T07:55:36Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled a variety of real-world applications. The large parameter size of VLMs brings large memory and computation overhead which poses significant challenges for deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective technique to reduce the memory and computation overhead. Existing PTQ methods mainly focus on large language models (LLMs), without considering the differences across other modalities. In this paper, we discover that there is a significant difference in sensitivity between language and vision tokens in large VLMs. Therefore, treating tokens from different modalities equally, as in existing PTQ methods, may over-emphasize the insensitive modalities, leading to significant accuracy loss. To deal with the above issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, Modality-Balanced Quantization (MBQ), for large VLMs. Specifically, MBQ incorporates the different sensitivities across modalities during the calibration process to minimize the reconstruction loss for better quantization parameters. Extensive experiments show that MBQ can significantly improve task accuracy by up to 4.4% and 11.6% under W3 and W4A8 quantization for 7B to 70B VLMs, compared to SOTA baselines. Additionally, we implement a W3 GPU kernel that fuses the dequantization and GEMV operators, achieving a 1.4x speedup on LLaVA-onevision-7B on the RTX 4090. The code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/MBQ.

### Casevo: A Cognitive Agents and Social Evolution Simulator
**Authors**: Zexun Jiang, Yafang Shi, Maoxu Li, Hongjiang Xiao, Yunxiao Qin, Qinglan Wei, Ye Wang, Yuan Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T07:33:49Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent simulation framework Casevo (Cognitive Agents and Social Evolution Simulator), that integrates large language models (LLMs) to simulate complex social phenomena and decision-making processes. Casevo is designed as a discrete-event simulator driven by agents with features such as Chain of Thoughts (CoT), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Customizable Memory Mechanism. Casevo enables dynamic social modeling, which can support various scenarios such as social network analysis, public opinion dynamics, and behavior prediction in complex social systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Casevo, we utilize one of the U.S. 2020 midterm election TV debates as a simulation example. Our results show that Casevo facilitates more realistic and flexible agent interactions, improving the quality of dynamic social phenomena simulation. This work contributes to the field by providing a robust system for studying large-scale, high-fidelity social behaviors with advanced LLM-driven agents, expanding the capabilities of traditional agent-based modeling (ABM). The open-source code repository address of casevo is https://github.com/rgCASS/casevo.

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T07:29:19Z

**Summary**: This technical report presents our initial attempt to build a spoken large language model (LLM) for Taiwanese Mandarin, specifically tailored to enable real-time, speech-to-speech interaction in multi-turn conversations. Our end-to-end model incorporates a decoder-only transformer architecture and aims to achieve seamless interaction while preserving the conversational flow, including full-duplex capabilities allowing simultaneous speaking and listening. The paper also details the training process, including data preparation with synthesized dialogues and adjustments for real-time interaction. We also developed a platform to evaluate conversational fluency and response coherence in multi-turn dialogues. We hope the release of the report can contribute to the future development of spoken LLMs in Taiwanese Mandarin.

### Do LLMs Really Think Step-by-step In Implicit Reasoning?
**Authors**: Yijiong Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T07:04:19Z

**Summary**: It has been well-known that Chain-of-Thought can remarkably enhance LLMs' performance on complex tasks. However, because it also introduces slower inference speeds and higher computational costs, many researches have attempted to use implicit CoT, which does not need LLMs to explicitly generate the intermediate steps. However, the invisible reasoning process leaves us a doubt that, can implicit CoT really be equal to explicit CoT? Therefore, in this study, we address this question through experiments. We probe the information of intermediate steps from the model's hidden states when it is either trained or prompted to perform implicit CoT. The results surprisingly indicate that when prompted, LLMs hardly think about intermediate steps, suggesting they may just rely on experience rather than strict step-by-step reasoning. But when trained, they indeed calculate intermediate steps. Moreover, in both situations, we find the effect of using implicit CoT is susceptible to the format of the problem, reaffirming the current deficiency of implicit CoT.

**Authors**: Wenyi Hong, Weihan Wang, Qingsong Lv, Jiazheng Xu, Wenmeng Yu, Junhui Ji, Yan Wang, Zihan Wang, Yuxuan Zhang, Juanzi Li, Bin Xu, Yuxiao Dong, Ming Ding, Jie Tang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T06:56:18Z

**Summary**: People are spending an enormous amount of time on digital devices through graphical user interfaces (GUIs), e.g., computer or smartphone screens. Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can assist people in tasks like writing emails, but struggle to understand and interact with GUIs, thus limiting their potential to increase automation levels. In this paper, we introduce CogAgent, an 18-billion-parameter visual language model (VLM) specializing in GUI understanding and navigation. By utilizing both low-resolution and high-resolution image encoders, CogAgent supports input at a resolution of 1120*1120, enabling it to recognize tiny page elements and text. As a generalist visual language model, CogAgent achieves the state of the art on five text-rich and four general VQA benchmarks, including VQAv2, OK-VQA, Text-VQA, ST-VQA, ChartQA, infoVQA, DocVQA, MM-Vet, and POPE. CogAgent, using only screenshots as input, outperforms LLM-based methods that consume extracted HTML text on both PC and Android GUI navigation tasks -- Mind2Web and AITW, advancing the state of the art. The model and codes are available at https://github.com/THUDM/CogVLM, with a new version of CogAgent-9B-20241220 available at https://github.com/THUDM/CogAgent.

### A Text is Worth Several Tokens: Text Embedding from LLMs Secretly Aligns   Well with The Key Tokens
**Authors**: Zhijie Nie, Richong Zhang, Zhanyu Wu

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T05:56:37Z

**Summary**: Text embeddings from large language models (LLMs) have achieved excellent results in tasks such as information retrieval, semantic textual similarity, etc. In this work, we show an interesting finding: when feeding a text into the LLM-based embedder, the obtained text embedding will be able to be aligned with the key tokens in the input text. We first fully analyze this phenomenon on eight LLM-based embedders and show that this phenomenon is universal and is not affected by model architecture, training strategy, and embedding method. With a deeper analysis, we find that the main change in embedding space between these embedders and their LLM backbones is in the first principal component. By adjusting the first principal component, we can align text embedding with the key tokens. Finally, we give several examples to demonstrate the vast application potential of this finding: (1) we propose a simple and practical sparse retrieval method based on the aligned tokens, which can achieve 80% of the dense retrieval effect of the same model while reducing the computation significantly; (2) we show that our findings provide a novel perspective to help understand novel technologies (e.g., instruction-following embedding) and fuzzy concepts (e.g., semantic relatedness vs. similarity) in this field.

### FedMoE-DA: Federated Mixture of Experts via Domain Aware Fine-grained   Aggregation
**Authors**: Ziwei Zhan, Wenkuan Zhao, Yuanqing Li, Weijie Liu, Xiaoxi Zhang, Chee Wei Tan, Chuan Wu, Deke Guo, Xu Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T05:48:14Z

**Summary**: Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning approach that enables multiple clients to train models without sharing their private data. With the rise of deep learning, large-scale models have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional performance. However, a key challenge in FL is the limitation imposed by clients with constrained computational and communication resources, which hampers the deployment of these large models. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture addresses this challenge with its sparse activation property, which reduces computational workload and communication demands during inference and updates. Additionally, MoE facilitates better personalization by allowing each expert to specialize in different subsets of the data distribution. To alleviate the communication burdens between the server and clients, we propose FedMoE-DA, a new FL model training framework that leverages the MoE architecture and incorporates a novel domain-aware, fine-grained aggregation strategy to enhance the robustness, personalizability, and communication efficiency simultaneously. Specifically, the correlation between both intra-client expert models and inter-client data heterogeneity is exploited. Moreover, we utilize peer-to-peer (P2P) communication between clients for selective expert model synchronization, thus significantly reducing the server-client transmissions. Experiments demonstrate that our FedMoE-DA achieves excellent performance while reducing the communication pressure on the server.

**Authors**: Zefang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T05:32:11Z

**Summary**: Incident response (IR) is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, requiring rapid decision-making and coordinated efforts to address cyberattacks effectively. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) as intelligent agents offers a novel approach to enhancing collaboration and efficiency in IR scenarios. This paper explores the application of LLM-based multi-agent collaboration using the Backdoors & Breaches framework, a tabletop game designed for cybersecurity training. We simulate real-world IR dynamics through various team structures, including centralized, decentralized, and hybrid configurations. By analyzing agent interactions and performance across these setups, we provide insights into optimizing multi-agent collaboration for incident response. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to enhance decision-making, improve adaptability, and streamline IR processes, paving the way for more effective and coordinated responses to cyber threats.

### Exploring Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Techniques for Code Generation   with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Martin Weyssow, Xin Zhou, Kisub Kim, David Lo, Houari Sahraoui

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T05:30:00Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities to generate accurate code snippets given natural language intents in a zero-shot manner, i.e., without the need for specific fine-tuning. While prior studies have highlighted the advantages of fine-tuning LLMs, this process incurs high computational costs, making it impractical in resource-scarce environments, particularly for models with billions of parameters. To address these challenges, previous research explored in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as strategies to guide the LLM generative process with task-specific prompt examples. However, ICL and RAG introduce inconveniences, such as the need for designing contextually relevant prompts and the absence of learning task-specific parameters, thereby limiting downstream task performance. In this context, we foresee parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) as a promising approach to efficiently specialize LLMs to task-specific data while maintaining reasonable resource consumption. In this paper, we deliver a comprehensive study of PEFT techniques for LLMs in the context of automated code generation. Our comprehensive investigation of PEFT techniques for LLMs reveals their superiority and potential over ICL and RAG across a diverse set of LLMs and three representative Python code generation datasets: Conala, CodeAlpacaPy, and APPS. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential for tuning larger LLMs and significant reductions in memory usage by combining PEFT with quantization. Therefore, this study opens opportunities for broader applications of PEFT in software engineering scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/martin-wey/peft-llm-code/.

### CodeUltraFeedback: An LLM-as-a-Judge Dataset for Aligning Large Language   Models to Coding Preferences
**Authors**: Martin Weyssow, Aton Kamanda, Xin Zhou, Houari Sahraoui

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T05:13:23Z

**Summary**: Evaluating the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with user-defined coding preferences is a challenging endeavour that requires a deep assessment of LLMs' outputs. Existing methods and benchmarks rely primarily on automated metrics and static analysis tools, which often fail to capture the nuances of user instructions and LLM outputs. To address this gap, we propose using the LLM-as-a-Judge methodology to evaluate the alignment of LLMs with coding preferences. Based on this approach, we present CodeUltraFeedback, a comprehensive dataset designed to facilitate the evaluation and improvement of LLM alignment. CodeUltraFeedback consists of 10,000 coding instructions, each annotated with four responses generated from a diverse pool of 14 LLMs. These responses are ranked based on five distinct coding preferences using GPT-3.5 as a judge, providing both numerical scores and detailed textual feedback. Our analysis of CodeUltraFeedback reveals that responses from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are generally preferred over those from open-weight LLMs, highlighting significant differences in alignment between closed and open-weight models. In turn, we explore the usage of CodeUltraFeedback as feedback data to fine-tune and align CodeLlama-7B-Instruct using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) with direct preference optimization (DPO). The resulting aligned CodeLlama-7B-Instruct model outperforms larger LLMs in terms of alignment with coding preferences and shows improved functional correctness on the HumanEval+ benchmark compared to the original instruct model. Therefore, our contributions bridge the gap in preference tuning of LLMs for code and set the stage for further advancements in model alignment and RLAIF in automated software engineering.

**Authors**: Tergel Molom-Ochir, Brady Taylor, Hai Li, Yiran Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T04:54:02Z

**Summary**: While the tree-based machine learning (TBML) models exhibit superior performance compared to neural networks on tabular data and hold promise for energy-efficient acceleration using aCAM arrays, their ideal deployment on hardware with explicit exploitation of TBML structure and aCAM circuitry remains a challenging task. In this work, we present MonoSparse-CAM, a new CAM-based optimization technique that exploits TBML sparsity and monotonicity in CAM circuitry to further advance processing performance. Our results indicate that MonoSparse-CAM reduces energy consumption by upto to 28.56x compared to raw processing and by 18.51x compared to state-of-the-art techniques, while improving the efficiency of computation by at least 1.68x.

### Find the Intention of Instruction: Comprehensive Evaluation of   Instruction Understanding for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Hyeonseok Moon, Jaehyung Seo, Seungyoon Lee, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T04:37:39Z

**Summary**: One of the key strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to interact with humans by generating appropriate responses to given instructions. This ability, known as instruction-following capability, has established a foundation for the use of LLMs across various fields and serves as a crucial metric for evaluating their performance. While numerous evaluation benchmarks have been developed, most focus solely on clear and coherent instructions. However, we have noted that LLMs can become easily distracted by instruction-formatted statements, which may lead to an oversight of their instruction comprehension skills. To address this issue, we introduce the Intention of Instruction (IoInst) benchmark. This benchmark evaluates LLMs' capacity to remain focused and understand instructions without being misled by extraneous instructions. The primary objective of this benchmark is to identify the appropriate instruction that accurately guides the generation of a given context. Our findings suggest that even recently introduced state-of-the-art models still lack instruction understanding capability. Along with the proposition of IoInst in this study, we also present broad analyses of the several strategies potentially applicable to IoInst.

### Feature Alignment-Based Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Compression   of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shuo Wang, Chihang Wang, Jia Gao, Zhen Qi, Hongye Zheng, Xiaoxuan Liao

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T04:37:06Z

**Summary**: This study proposes a knowledge distillation algorithm based on large language models and feature alignment, aiming to effectively transfer the knowledge of large pre-trained models into lightweight student models, thereby reducing computational costs while maintaining high model performance. Different from the traditional soft label distillation method, this method introduces a multi-layer feature alignment strategy to deeply align the intermediate features and attention mechanisms of the teacher model and the student model, maximally retaining the semantic expression ability and context modeling ability of the teacher model. In terms of method design, a multi-task loss function is constructed, including feature matching loss, attention alignment loss, and output distribution matching loss, to ensure multi-level information transfer through joint optimization. The experiments were comprehensively evaluated on the GLUE data set and various natural language processing tasks. The results show that the proposed model performs very close to the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model in terms of evaluation indicators such as perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, and CER. At the same time, it far exceeds baseline models such as DeBERTa, XLNet, and GPT-3, showing significant performance improvements and computing efficiency advantages. Research results show that the feature alignment distillation strategy is an effective model compression method that can significantly reduce computational overhead and storage requirements while maintaining model capabilities. Future research can be further expanded in the directions of self-supervised learning, cross-modal feature alignment, and multi-task transfer learning to provide more flexible and efficient solutions for the deployment and optimization of deep learning models.

**Authors**: Haoyang Li, Yiming Li, Anxin Tian, Tianhao Tang, Zhanchao Xu, Xuejia Chen, Nicole Hu, Wei Dong, Qing Li, Lei Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T04:17:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to their ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. The curated paper list for KV cache management is in: \href{https://github.com/TreeAI-Lab/Awesome-KV-Cache-Management}{https://github.com/TreeAI-Lab/Awesome-KV-Cache-Management}.

### Cracking the Code of Hallucination in LVLMs with Vision-aware Head   Divergence
**Authors**: Jinghan He, Kuan Zhu, Haiyun Guo, Junfeng Fang, Zhenglin Hua, Yuheng Jia, Ming Tang, Tat-Seng Chua, Jinqiao Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T03:00:19Z

**Summary**: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress in integrating large language models (LLMs) with visual inputs, enabling advanced multimodal reasoning. Despite their success, a persistent challenge is hallucination-where generated text fails to accurately reflect visual content-undermining both accuracy and reliability. Existing methods focus on alignment training or decoding refinements but primarily address symptoms at the generation stage without probing the underlying causes. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms driving hallucination in LVLMs, with an emphasis on the multi-head attention module. Specifically, we introduce Vision-aware Head Divergence (VHD), a metric that quantifies the sensitivity of attention head outputs to visual context. Based on this, our findings reveal the presence of vision-aware attention heads that are more attuned to visual information; however, the model's overreliance on its prior language patterns is closely related to hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose Vision-aware Head Reinforcement (VHR), a training-free approach to mitigate hallucination by enhancing the role of vision-aware attention heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining high efficiency with negligible additional time overhead.

### PreNeT: Leveraging Computational Features to Predict Deep Neural Network   Training Time
**Authors**: Alireza Pourali, Arian Boukani, Hamzeh Khazaei

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T02:48:04Z

**Summary**: Training deep learning models, particularly Transformer-based architectures such as Large Language Models (LLMs), demands substantial computational resources and extended training periods. While optimal configuration and infrastructure selection can significantly reduce associated costs, this optimization requires preliminary analysis tools. This paper introduces PreNeT, a novel predictive framework designed to address this optimization challenge. PreNeT facilitates training optimization by integrating comprehensive computational metrics, including layer-specific parameters, arithmetic operations and memory utilization. A key feature of PreNeT is its capacity to accurately predict training duration on previously unexamined hardware infrastructures, including novel accelerator architectures. This framework employs a sophisticated approach to capture and analyze the distinct characteristics of various neural network layers, thereby enhancing existing prediction methodologies. Through proactive implementation of PreNeT, researchers and practitioners can determine optimal configurations, parameter settings, and hardware specifications to maximize cost-efficiency and minimize training duration. Experimental results demonstrate that PreNeT achieves up to 72% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to contemporary state-of-the-art frameworks.

**Authors**: Jiao Chen, Jiayi He, Fangfang Chen, Zuohong Lv, Jianhua Tang, Weihua Li, Zuozhu Liu, Howard H. Yang, Guangjie Han

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T01:23:05Z

**Summary**: Industrial AI is transitioning from traditional deep learning models to large-scale transformer-based architectures, with the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) playing a pivotal role. IIoT evolves from a simple data pipeline to an intelligent infrastructure, enabling and enhancing these advanced AI systems. This survey explores the integration of IIoT with large models (LMs) and their potential applications in industrial environments. We focus on four primary types of industrial LMs: language-based, vision-based, time-series, and multimodal models. The lifecycle of LMs is segmented into four critical phases: data foundation, model training, model connectivity, and continuous evolution. First, we analyze how IIoT provides abundant and diverse data resources, supporting the training and fine-tuning of LMs. Second, we discuss how IIoT offers an efficient training infrastructure in low-latency and bandwidth-optimized environments. Third, we highlight the deployment advantages of LMs within IIoT, emphasizing IIoT's role as a connectivity nexus fostering emergent intelligence through modular design, dynamic routing, and model merging to enhance system scalability and adaptability. Finally, we demonstrate how IIoT supports continual learning mechanisms, enabling LMs to adapt to dynamic industrial conditions and ensure long-term effectiveness. This paper underscores IIoT's critical role in the evolution of industrial intelligence with large models, offering a theoretical framework and actionable insights for future research.

### Asymmetric protocols for mode pairing quantum key distribution with   finite-key analysis
**Authors**: Zhenhua Li, Tianqi Dou, Yuheng Xie, Weiwen Kong, Yang Liu, Haiqiang Ma, Jianjun Tang

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T01:20:51Z

**Summary**: The mode pairing quantum key distribution (MP-QKD) protocol has attracted considerable attention for its capability to ensure high secure key rates over long distances without requiring global phase locking. However, ensuring symmetric channels for the MP-QKD protocol is challenging in practical quantum communication networks. Previous studies on the asymmetric MP-QKD protocol have relied on ideal decoy state assumptions and infinite-key analysis, which are unattainable for real-world deployment. In this paper, we conduct a security analysis of asymmetric MP-QKD protocol with the finite-key analysis, where we discard the previously impractical assumptions made in the decoy-state method. Combined with statistical fluctuation analysis, we globally optimized the 12 independent parameters in the asymmetric MP-QKD protocol by employing our modified particle swarm optimization. The simulation results demonstrate that our work can achieve significantly enhanced secure key rates and transmission distances compared to the original strategy with adding extra attenuation. We further investigate the relationship between the intensities and probabilities of signal, decoy, and vacuum states with transmission distance, facilitating its more efficient deployment in future quantum networks.

### An Engorgio Prompt Makes Large Language Model Babble on
**Authors**: Jianshuo Dong, Ziyuan Zhang, Qingjie Zhang, Han Qiu, Tianwei Zhang, Hao Wang, Hewu Li, Qi Li, Chao Zhang, Ke Xu

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T01:00:23Z

**Summary**: Auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) have yielded impressive performance in many real-world tasks. However, the new paradigm of these LLMs also exposes novel threats. In this paper, we explore their vulnerability to inference cost attacks, where a malicious user crafts Engorgio prompts to intentionally increase the computation cost and latency of the inference process. We design Engorgio, a novel methodology, to efficiently generate adversarial Engorgio prompts to affect the target LLM's service availability. Engorgio has the following two technical contributions. (1) We employ a parameterized distribution to track LLMs' prediction trajectory. (2) Targeting the auto-regressive nature of LLMs' inference process, we propose novel loss functions to stably suppress the appearance of the <EOS> token, whose occurrence will interrupt the LLM's generation process. We conduct extensive experiments on 13 open-sourced LLMs with parameters ranging from 125M to 30B. The results show that Engorgio prompts can successfully induce LLMs to generate abnormally long outputs (i.e., roughly 2-13$\times$ longer to reach 90%+ of the output length limit) in a white-box scenario and our real-world experiment demonstrates Engergio's threat to LLM service with limited computing resources. The code is accessible at https://github.com/jianshuod/Engorgio-prompt.

**Summary**: Quantum Communications is a field that promises advances in cryptography, quantum computing and clock synchronisation, among other potential applications. However, communication based on quantum phenomena requires an extreme level of isolation from external disturbances, making the transmission of quantum signals together with classical ones difficult. A range of techniques has been tested to introduce quantum communications in already deployed optical networks which also carry legacy traffic. This comes with challenges, not only at the physical layer but also at the operations and management layer. To achieve a broad acceptance among network operators, the joint management and operation of quantum and classical resources, compliance with standards, and quality and legal assurance need to be addressed. This article presents a detailed account of solutions to the above issues, deployed and evaluated in the MadQCI (Madrid Quantum Communication Infrastructure) testbed. This network is designed to integrate quantum communications in the telecommunications ecosystem by installing quantum-key-distribution modules from multiple providers in production nodes of two different operators. The modules were connected through an optical-switched network with more than 130 km of deployed optical fibre. The tests were done in compliance with strict service level agreements that protected the legacy traffic of the pre-existing classical network. The goal was to achieve full quantum-classical compatibility at all levels, while limiting the modifications of optical transport and encryption and complying with as many standards as possible. This effort was intended to serve as a blueprint, which can be used as the foundation of large-scale quantum network deployments. To demonstrate the capabilities of MadQCI, end-to-end encryption services were deployed and a variety of use-cases were showcased.

### Large Language Models for Market Research: A Data-augmentation Approach
**Authors**: Mengxin Wang, Dennis J. Zhang, Heng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T22:06:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by excelling in complex natural language processing tasks. Their ability to generate human-like text has opened new possibilities for market research, particularly in conjoint analysis, where understanding consumer preferences is essential but often resource-intensive. Traditional survey-based methods face limitations in scalability and cost, making LLM-generated data a promising alternative. However, while LLMs have the potential to simulate real consumer behavior, recent studies highlight a significant gap between LLM-generated and human data, with biases introduced when substituting between the two. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a novel statistical data augmentation approach that efficiently integrates LLM-generated data with real data in conjoint analysis. Our method leverages transfer learning principles to debias the LLM-generated data using a small amount of human data. This results in statistically robust estimators with consistent and asymptotically normal properties, in contrast to naive approaches that simply substitute human data with LLM-generated data, which can exacerbate bias. We validate our framework through an empirical study on COVID-19 vaccine preferences, demonstrating its superior ability to reduce estimation error and save data and costs by 24.9\% to 79.8\%. In contrast, naive approaches fail to save data due to the inherent biases in LLM-generated data compared to human data. Another empirical study on sports car choices validates the robustness of our results. Our findings suggest that while LLM-generated data is not a direct substitute for human responses, it can serve as a valuable complement when used within a robust statistical framework.

### Dynamic Skill Adaptation for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jiaao Chen, Diyi Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T22:04:23Z

**Summary**: We present Dynamic Skill Adaptation (DSA), an adaptive and dynamic framework to adapt novel and complex skills to Large Language Models (LLMs). Compared with previous work which learns from human-curated and static data in random orders, we propose to first automatically generate and organize the training data by mimicking the learning pathways of human and then dynamically tailor the training data based on the training dynamics. Specifically, inspired by the learning structures and teaching strategies in the human education system, we first construct a skill graph by decomposing complex skills into sub-skills and arranging them based on their dependencies in human syllables. For every skill, we utilize LLMs to generate both textbook-like data which contains detailed descriptions of skills for pre-training and exercise-like data which targets at explicitly utilizing the skills to solve problems for instruction-tuning. Furthermore, during the instruction-tuning, we dynamically update the training data which down-weight easy-to-learn examples, generate more complex examples, and filter out data with errors. Experiments on large language models such as LLAMA and Mistral demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in adapting math reasoning skills and social study skills.

### Federated Hybrid Training and Self-Adversarial Distillation: Towards   Robust Edge Networks
**Authors**: Yu Qiao, Apurba Adhikary, Kitae Kim, Eui-Nam Huh, Zhu Han, Choong Seon Hong

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T21:32:08Z

**Summary**: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed training technology that enhances data privacy in mobile edge networks by allowing data owners to collaborate without transmitting raw data to the edge server. However, data heterogeneity and adversarial attacks pose challenges to develop an unbiased and robust global model for edge deployment. To address this, we propose Federated hyBrid Adversarial training and self-adversarial disTillation (FedBAT), a new framework designed to improve both robustness and generalization of the global model. FedBAT seamlessly integrates hybrid adversarial training and self-adversarial distillation into the conventional FL framework from data augmentation and feature distillation perspectives. From a data augmentation perspective, we propose hybrid adversarial training to defend against adversarial attacks by balancing accuracy and robustness through a weighted combination of standard and adversarial training. From a feature distillation perspective, we introduce a novel augmentation-invariant adversarial distillation method that aligns local adversarial features of augmented images with their corresponding unbiased global clean features. This alignment can effectively mitigate bias from data heterogeneity while enhancing both the robustness and generalization of the global model. Extensive experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that FedBAT yields comparable or superior performance gains in improving robustness while maintaining accuracy compared to several baselines.

### Progressive Compression with Universally Quantized Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Yibo Yang, Justus C. Will, Stephan Mandt

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T21:12:31Z

**Summary**: Diffusion probabilistic models have achieved mainstream success in many generative modeling tasks, from image generation to inverse problem solving. A distinct feature of these models is that they correspond to deep hierarchical latent variable models optimizing a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) on the data likelihood. Drawing on a basic connection between likelihood modeling and compression, we explore the potential of diffusion models for progressive coding, resulting in a sequence of bits that can be incrementally transmitted and decoded with progressively improving reconstruction quality. Unlike prior work based on Gaussian diffusion or conditional diffusion models, we propose a new form of diffusion model with uniform noise in the forward process, whose negative ELBO corresponds to the end-to-end compression cost using universal quantization. We obtain promising first results on image compression, achieving competitive rate-distortion and rate-realism results on a wide range of bit-rates with a single model, bringing neural codecs a step closer to practical deployment.

### Towards A Holistic Landscape of Situated Theory of Mind in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Ziqiao Ma, Jacob Sansom, Run Peng, Joyce Chai

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T20:04:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated considerable interest and debate regarding their potential emergence of Theory of Mind (ToM). Several recent inquiries reveal a lack of robust ToM in these models and pose a pressing demand to develop new benchmarks, as current ones primarily focus on different aspects of ToM and are prone to shortcuts and data leakage. In this position paper, we seek to answer two road-blocking questions: (1) How can we taxonomize a holistic landscape of machine ToM? (2) What is a more effective evaluation protocol for machine ToM? Following psychological studies, we taxonomize machine ToM into 7 mental state categories and delineate existing benchmarks to identify under-explored aspects of ToM. We argue for a holistic and situated evaluation of ToM to break ToM into individual components and treat LLMs as an agent who is physically situated in environments and socially situated in interactions with humans. Such situated evaluation provides a more comprehensive assessment of mental states and potentially mitigates the risk of shortcuts and data leakage. We further present a pilot study in a grid world setup as a proof of concept. We hope this position paper can facilitate future research to integrate ToM with LLMs and offer an intuitive means for researchers to better position their work in the landscape of ToM.

### LMFusion: Adapting Pretrained Language Models for Multimodal Generation
**Authors**: Weijia Shi, Xiaochuang Han, Chunting Zhou, Weixin Liang, Xi Victoria Lin, Luke Zettlemoyer, Lili Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T18:56:18Z

**Summary**: We present LMFusion, a framework for empowering pretrained text-only large language models (LLMs) with multimodal generative capabilities, enabling them to understand and generate both text and images in arbitrary sequences. LMFusion leverages existing Llama-3's weights for processing texts autoregressively while introducing additional and parallel transformer modules for processing images with diffusion. During training, the data from each modality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward layers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each modality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow interactions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific modules and only training the image-specific modules, LMFusion preserves the language capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual understanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain multimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that, LMFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6% using only 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities. We also demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language models with multimodal generation ability. Overall, this framework not only leverages existing computational investments in text-only LLMs but also enables the parallel development of language and vision capabilities, presenting a promising direction for efficient multimodal model development.

### LLMs for Knowledge Graph Construction and Reasoning: Recent Capabilities   and Future Opportunities
**Authors**: Yuqi Zhu, Xiaohan Wang, Jing Chen, Shuofei Qiao, Yixin Ou, Yunzhi Yao, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T18:54:53Z

**Summary**: This paper presents an exhaustive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Knowledge Graph (KG) construction and reasoning. We engage in experiments across eight diverse datasets, focusing on four representative tasks encompassing entity and relation extraction, event extraction, link prediction, and question-answering, thereby thoroughly exploring LLMs' performance in the domain of construction and inference. Empirically, our findings suggest that LLMs, represented by GPT-4, are more suited as inference assistants rather than few-shot information extractors. Specifically, while GPT-4 exhibits good performance in tasks related to KG construction, it excels further in reasoning tasks, surpassing fine-tuned models in certain cases. Moreover, our investigation extends to the potential generalization ability of LLMs for information extraction, leading to the proposition of a Virtual Knowledge Extraction task and the development of the corresponding VINE dataset. Based on these empirical findings, we further propose AutoKG, a multi-agent-based approach employing LLMs and external sources for KG construction and reasoning. We anticipate that this research can provide invaluable insights for future undertakings in the field of knowledge graphs. The code and datasets are in https://github.com/zjunlp/AutoKG.

### From Interets to Insights: An LLM Approach to Course Recommendations   Using Natural Language Queries
**Authors**: Hugh Van Deventer, Mark Mills, August Evrard

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T18:19:53Z

**Summary**: Most universities in the United States encourage their students to explore academic areas before declaring a major and to acquire academic breadth by satisfying a variety of requirements. Each term, students must choose among many thousands of offerings, spanning dozens of subject areas, a handful of courses to take. The curricular environment is also dynamic, and poor communication and search functions on campus can limit a student's ability to discover new courses of interest. To support both students and their advisers in such a setting, we explore a novel Large Language Model (LLM) course recommendation system that applies a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method to the corpus of course descriptions. The system first generates an 'ideal' course description based on the user's query. This description is converted into a search vector using embeddings, which is then used to find actual courses with similar content by comparing embedding similarities. We describe the method and assess the quality and fairness of some example prompts. Steps to deploy a pilot system on campus are discussed.

### xSRL: Safety-Aware Explainable Reinforcement Learning -- Safety as a   Product of Explainability
**Authors**: Risal Shahriar Shefin, Md Asifur Rahman, Thai Le, Sarra Alqahtani

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T18:19:04Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise in simulated environments, such as games, where failures have minimal consequences. However, the deployment of RL agents in real-world systems such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, UAVs, and medical devices demands a higher level of safety and transparency, particularly when facing adversarial threats. Safe RL algorithms have been developed to address these concerns by optimizing both task performance and safety constraints. However, errors are inevitable, and when they occur, it is essential that the RL agents can also explain their actions to human operators. This makes trust in the safety mechanisms of RL systems crucial for effective deployment. Explainability plays a key role in building this trust by providing clear, actionable insights into the agent's decision-making process, ensuring that safety-critical decisions are well understood. While machine learning (ML) has seen significant advances in interpretability and visualization, explainability methods for RL remain limited. Current tools fail to address the dynamic, sequential nature of RL and its needs to balance task performance with safety constraints over time. The re-purposing of traditional ML methods, such as saliency maps, is inadequate for safety-critical RL applications where mistakes can result in severe consequences. To bridge this gap, we propose xSRL, a framework that integrates both local and global explanations to provide a comprehensive understanding of RL agents' behavior. xSRL also enables developers to identify policy vulnerabilities through adversarial attacks, offering tools to debug and patch agents without retraining. Our experiments and user studies demonstrate xSRL's effectiveness in increasing safety in RL systems, making them more reliable and trustworthy for real-world deployment. Code is available at https://github.com/risal-shefin/xSRL.

### Perceive, Query & Reason: Enhancing Video QA with Question-Guided   Temporal Queries
**Authors**: Roberto Amoroso, Gengyuan Zhang, Rajat Koner, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara, Volker Tresp

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T17:53:14Z

**Summary**: Video Question Answering (Video QA) is a challenging video understanding task that requires models to comprehend entire videos, identify the most relevant information based on contextual cues from a given question, and reason accurately to provide answers. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed video QA by leveraging their exceptional commonsense reasoning capabilities. This progress is largely driven by the effective alignment between visual data and the language space of MLLMs. However, for video QA, an additional space-time alignment poses a considerable challenge for extracting question-relevant information across frames. In this work, we investigate diverse temporal modeling techniques to integrate with MLLMs, aiming to achieve question-guided temporal modeling that leverages pre-trained visual and textual alignment in MLLMs. We propose T-Former, a novel temporal modeling method that creates a question-guided temporal bridge between frame-wise visual perception and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our evaluation across multiple video QA benchmarks demonstrates that T-Former competes favorably with existing temporal modeling approaches and aligns with recent advancements in video QA.

### RAG with Differential Privacy
**Authors**: Nicolas Grislain

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T17:34:26Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant technique to provide *Large Language Models* (LLM) with fresh and relevant context, mitigating the risk of hallucinations and improving the overall quality of responses in environments with large and fast moving knowledge bases. However, the integration of external documents into the generation process raises significant privacy concerns. Indeed, when added to a prompt, it is not possible to guarantee a response will not inadvertently expose confidential data, leading to potential breaches of privacy and ethical dilemmas. This paper explores a practical solution to this problem suitable to general knowledge extraction from personal data. It shows *differentially private token generation* is a viable approach to private RAG.

### SRLM: Human-in-Loop Interactive Social Robot Navigation with Large   Language Model and Deep Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Weizheng Wang, Ike Obi, Byung-Cheol Min

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T17:00:51Z

**Summary**: An interactive social robotic assistant must provide services in complex and crowded spaces while adapting its behavior based on real-time human language commands or feedback. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach called Social Robot Planner (SRLM), which integrates Large Language Models (LLM) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to navigate through human-filled public spaces and provide multiple social services. SRLM infers global planning from human-in-loop commands in real-time, and encodes social information into a LLM-based large navigation model (LNM) for low-level motion execution. Moreover, a DRL-based planner is designed to maintain benchmarking performance, which is blended with LNM by a large feedback model (LFM) to address the instability of current text and LLM-driven LNM. Finally, SRLM demonstrates outstanding performance in extensive experiments. More details about this work are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/navi-srlm

### MEDEC: A Benchmark for Medical Error Detection and Correction in   Clinical Notes
**Authors**: Asma Ben Abacha, Wen-wai Yim, Yujuan Fu, Zhaoyi Sun, Meliha Yetisgen, Fei Xia, Thomas Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T15:54:10Z

**Summary**: Several studies showed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can answer medical questions correctly, even outperforming the average human score in some medical exams. However, to our knowledge, no study has been conducted to assess the ability of language models to validate existing or generated medical text for correctness and consistency. In this paper, we introduce MEDEC (https://github.com/abachaa/MEDEC), the first publicly available benchmark for medical error detection and correction in clinical notes, covering five types of errors (Diagnosis, Management, Treatment, Pharmacotherapy, and Causal Organism). MEDEC consists of 3,848 clinical texts, including 488 clinical notes from three US hospital systems that were not previously seen by any LLM. The dataset has been used for the MEDIQA-CORR shared task to evaluate seventeen participating systems [Ben Abacha et al., 2024]. In this paper, we describe the data creation methods and we evaluate recent LLMs (e.g., o1-preview, GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for the tasks of detecting and correcting medical errors requiring both medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We also conducted a comparative study where two medical doctors performed the same task on the MEDEC test set. The results showed that MEDEC is a sufficiently challenging benchmark to assess the ability of models to validate existing or generated notes and to correct medical errors. We also found that although recent LLMs have a good performance in error detection and correction, they are still outperformed by medical doctors in these tasks. We discuss the potential factors behind this gap, the insights from our experiments, the limitations of current evaluation metrics, and share potential pointers for future research.

### Sentiment trading with large language models
**Authors**: Kemal Kirtac, Guido Germano

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T15:01:24Z

**Summary**: We investigate the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in sentiment analysis of U.S. financial news and their potential in predicting stock market returns. We analyze a dataset comprising 965,375 news articles that span from January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2023; we focus on the performance of various LLMs, including BERT, OPT, FINBERT, and the traditional Loughran-McDonald dictionary model, which has been a dominant methodology in the finance literature. The study documents a significant association between LLM scores and subsequent daily stock returns. Specifically, OPT, which is a GPT-3 based LLM, shows the highest accuracy in sentiment prediction with an accuracy of 74.4%, slightly ahead of BERT (72.5%) and FINBERT (72.2%). In contrast, the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model demonstrates considerably lower effectiveness with only 50.1% accuracy. Regression analyses highlight a robust positive impact of OPT model scores on next-day stock returns, with coefficients of 0.274 and 0.254 in different model specifications. BERT and FINBERT also exhibit predictive relevance, though to a lesser extent. Notably, we do not observe a significant relationship between the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model scores and stock returns, challenging the efficacy of this traditional method in the current financial context. In portfolio performance, the long-short OPT strategy excels with a Sharpe ratio of 3.05, compared to 2.11 for BERT and 2.07 for FINBERT long-short strategies. Strategies based on the Loughran-McDonald dictionary yield the lowest Sharpe ratio of 1.23. Our findings emphasize the superior performance of advanced LLMs, especially OPT, in financial market prediction and portfolio management, marking a significant shift in the landscape of financial analysis tools with implications to financial regulation and policy analysis.

### SeaMo: A Multi-Seasonal and Multimodal Remote Sensing Foundation Model
**Authors**: Xuyang Li, Danfeng Hong, Chenyu Li, Jocelyn Chanussot

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T14:40:38Z

**Summary**: Remote Sensing (RS) data contains a wealth of multi-dimensional information crucial for Earth observation. Owing to its vast volume, diverse sources, and temporal properties, RS data is highly suitable for the development of large Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). VFMs act as robust feature extractors, learning from extensive RS data, and are subsequently fine-tuned for deployment in various geoscientific tasks. However, current VFMs in the RS domain are predominantly pretrained and tailored exclusively for specific characteristics of RS imagery, neglecting the potential of utilizing the multi-dimensional properties of RS data. Therefore, in this work, we propose SeaMo, a pioneering visual foundation model that integrates multi-seasonal and multimodal information in the RS field. SeaMo is designed to harness multiple properties of RS data. Within the masked image modeling framework, we employ non-aligned cropping techniques to extract spatial properties, use multi-source inputs for multimodal integration, and incorporate temporal-multimodal fusion blocks for effective assimilation of multi-seasonal data. SeaMo explicitly models the multi-dimensional properties of RS data, making the model more comprehensive, robust, and versatile. We applied SeaMo to several downstream geoscience tasks, which demonstrated exceptional performance. Extensive ablation studies were conducted to validate the model's superiority.

**Authors**: Hao Wen, Shizuo Tian, Borislav Pavlov, Wenjie Du, Yixuan Li, Ge Chang, Shanhui Zhao, Jiacheng Liu, Yunxin Liu, Ya-Qin Zhang, Yuanchun Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T13:52:48Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have brought exciting new advances to mobile UI agents, a long-standing research field that aims to complete arbitrary natural language tasks through mobile UI interactions. However, existing UI agents usually demand high reasoning capabilities of powerful large models that are difficult to be deployed locally on end-users' devices, which raises huge concerns about user privacy and centralized serving cost. One way to reduce the required model size is to customize a smaller domain-specific model with high-quality training data, e.g. large-scale human demonstrations of diverse types of apps and tasks, while such datasets are extremely difficult to obtain. Inspired by the remarkable coding abilities of recent small language models (SLMs), we propose to convert the UI task automation problem to a code generation problem, which can be effectively solved by an on-device SLM and efficiently executed with an on-device code interpreter. Unlike normal coding tasks that can be extensively pretrained with public datasets, generating UI automation code is challenging due to the diversity, complexity, and variability of target apps. Therefore, we adopt a document-centered approach that automatically builds fine-grained API documentation for each app and generates diverse task samples based on this documentation. By guiding the agent with the synthetic documents and task samples, it learns to generate precise and efficient scripts to complete unseen tasks. Based on detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art mobile UI agents, our approach effectively improves the mobile task automation with significantly higher success rates and lower latency/token consumption. Code will be open-sourced.

### Large Language Models Meet Graph Neural Networks: A Perspective of Graph   Mining
**Authors**: Yuxin You, Zhen Liu, Xiangchao Wen, Yongtao Zhang, Wei Ai

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T13:21:09Z

**Summary**: Graph mining is an important area in data mining and machine learning that involves extracting valuable information from graph-structured data. In recent years, significant progress has been made in this field through the development of graph neural networks (GNNs). However, GNNs are still deficient in generalizing to diverse graph data. Aiming to this issue, Large Language Models (LLMs) could provide new solutions for graph mining tasks with their superior semantic understanding. In this review, we systematically review the combination and application techniques of LLMs and GNNs and present a novel taxonomy for research in this interdisciplinary field, which involves three main categories: GNN-driving-LLM, LLM-driving-GNN, and GNN-LLM-co-driving. Within this framework, we reveal the capabilities of LLMs in enhancing graph feature extraction as well as improving the effectiveness of downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and community detection. Although LLMs have demonstrated their great potential in handling graph-structured data, their high computational requirements and complexity remain challenges. Future research needs to continue to explore how to efficiently fuse LLMs and GNNs to achieve more powerful graph learning and reasoning capabilities and provide new impetus for the development of graph mining techniques.

### AutoMMLab: Automatically Generating Deployable Models from Language   Instructions for Computer Vision Tasks
**Authors**: Zekang Yang, Wang Zeng, Sheng Jin, Chen Qian, Ping Luo, Wentao Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T13:14:16Z

**Summary**: Automated machine learning (AutoML) is a collection of techniques designed to automate the machine learning development process. While traditional AutoML approaches have been successfully applied in several critical steps of model development (e.g. hyperparameter optimization), there lacks a AutoML system that automates the entire end-to-end model production workflow for computer vision. To fill this blank, we propose a novel request-to-model task, which involves understanding the user's natural language request and execute the entire workflow to output production-ready models. This empowers non-expert individuals to easily build task-specific models via a user-friendly language interface. To facilitate development and evaluation, we develop a new experimental platform called AutoMMLab and a new benchmark called LAMP for studying key components in the end-to-end request-to-model pipeline. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is one of the most important components for AutoML. Traditional approaches mostly rely on trial-and-error, leading to inefficient parameter search. To solve this problem, we propose a novel LLM-based HPO algorithm, called HPO-LLaMA. Equipped with extensive knowledge and experience in model hyperparameter tuning, HPO-LLaMA achieves significant improvement of HPO efficiency. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/yang-ze-kang/AutoMMLab.

### NADER: Neural Architecture Design via Multi-Agent Collaboration
**Authors**: Zekang Yang, Wang Zeng, Sheng Jin, Chen Qian, Ping Luo, Wentao Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T13:07:03Z

**Summary**: Designing effective neural architectures poses a significant challenge in deep learning. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates the search for optimal architectures, existing methods are often constrained by predetermined search spaces and may miss critical neural architectures. In this paper, we introduce NADER (Neural Architecture Design via multi-agEnt collaboRation), a novel framework that formulates neural architecture design (NAD) as a LLM-based multi-agent collaboration problem. NADER employs a team of specialized agents to enhance a base architecture through iterative modification. Current LLM-based NAD methods typically operate independently, lacking the ability to learn from past experiences, which results in repeated mistakes and inefficient exploration. To address this issue, we propose the Reflector, which effectively learns from immediate feedback and long-term experiences. Additionally, unlike previous LLM-based methods that use code to represent neural architectures, we utilize a graph-based representation. This approach allows agents to focus on design aspects without being distracted by coding. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NADER in discovering high-performing architectures beyond predetermined search spaces through extensive experiments on benchmark tasks, showcasing its advantages over state-of-the-art methods. The codes will be released soon.

### Differential privacy enables fair and accurate AI-based analysis of   speech disorders while protecting patient data
**Authors**: Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh, Mahshad Lotfinia, Paula Andrea Perez-Toro, Tomas Arias-Vergara, Mahtab Ranji, Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave, Maria Schuster, Andreas Maier, Seung Hee Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T12:56:59Z

**Summary**: Speech pathology has impacts on communication abilities and quality of life. While deep learning-based models have shown potential in diagnosing these disorders, the use of sensitive data raises critical privacy concerns. Although differential privacy (DP) has been explored in the medical imaging domain, its application in pathological speech analysis remains largely unexplored despite the equally critical privacy concerns. This study is the first to investigate DP's impact on pathological speech data, focusing on the trade-offs between privacy, diagnostic accuracy, and fairness. Using a large, real-world dataset of 200 hours of recordings from 2,839 German-speaking participants, we observed a maximum accuracy reduction of 3.85% when training with DP with high privacy levels. To highlight real-world privacy risks, we demonstrated the vulnerability of non-private models to explicit gradient inversion attacks, reconstructing identifiable speech samples and showcasing DP's effectiveness in mitigating these risks. To generalize our findings across languages and disorders, we validated our approach on a dataset of Spanish-speaking Parkinson's disease patients, leveraging pretrained models from healthy English-speaking datasets, and demonstrated that careful pretraining on large-scale task-specific datasets can maintain favorable accuracy under DP constraints. A comprehensive fairness analysis revealed minimal gender bias at reasonable privacy levels but underscored the need for addressing age-related disparities. Our results establish that DP can balance privacy and utility in speech disorder detection, while highlighting unique challenges in privacy-fairness trade-offs for speech data. This provides a foundation for refining DP methodologies and improving fairness across diverse patient groups in real-world deployments.

### Biology Instructions: A Dataset and Benchmark for Multi-Omics Sequence   Understanding Capability of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Haonan He, Yuchen Ren, Yining Tang, Ziyang Xu, Junxian Li, Minghao Yang, Di Zhang, Dong Yuan, Tao Chen, Shufei Zhang, Yuqiang Li, Nanqing Dong, Wanli Ouyang, Dongzhan Zhou, Peng Ye

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T12:12:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models have already demonstrated their formidable capabilities in general domains, ushering in a revolutionary transformation. However, exploring and exploiting the extensive knowledge of these models to comprehend multi-omics biology remains underexplored. To fill this research gap, we first introduce Biology-Instructions, the first large-scale multi-omics biological sequences-related instruction-tuning dataset including DNA, RNA, proteins, and multi-molecules, designed to bridge the gap between large language models (LLMs) and complex biological sequences-related tasks. This dataset can enhance the versatility of LLMs by integrating diverse biological sequenced-based prediction tasks with advanced reasoning capabilities, while maintaining conversational fluency. Additionally, we reveal significant performance limitations in even state-of-the-art LLMs on biological sequence-related multi-omics tasks without specialized pre-training and instruction-tuning. We further develop a strong baseline called ChatMultiOmics with a novel three-stage training pipeline, demonstrating the powerful ability to understand biology by using Biology-Instructions.

### Human-centric Reward Optimization for Reinforcement Learning-based   Automated Driving using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ziqi Zhou, Jingyue Zhang, Jingyuan Zhang, Yangfan He, Boyue Wang, Tianyu Shi, Alaa Khamis

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T11:55:16Z

**Summary**: One of the key challenges in current Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Automated Driving (AD) agents is achieving flexible, precise, and human-like behavior cost-effectively. This paper introduces an innovative approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to intuitively and effectively optimize RL reward functions in a human-centric way. We developed a framework where instructions and dynamic environment descriptions are input into the LLM. The LLM then utilizes this information to assist in generating rewards, thereby steering the behavior of RL agents towards patterns that more closely resemble human driving. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only makes RL agents more anthropomorphic but also achieves better performance. Additionally, various strategies for reward-proxy and reward-shaping are investigated, revealing the significant impact of prompt design on shaping an AD vehicle's behavior. These findings offer a promising direction for the development of more advanced, human-like automated driving systems. Our experimental data and source code can be found here

### LLMsAgainstHate @ NLU of Devanagari Script Languages 2025: Hate Speech   Detection and Target Identification in Devanagari Languages via Parameter   Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs
**Authors**: Rushendra Sidibomma, Pransh Patwa, Parth Patwa, Aman Chadha, Vinija Jain, Amitava Das

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T11:43:37Z

**Summary**: The detection of hate speech has become increasingly important in combating online hostility and its real-world consequences. Despite recent advancements, there is limited research addressing hate speech detection in Devanagari-scripted languages, where resources and tools are scarce. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in language-related tasks, traditional fine-tuning approaches are often infeasible given the size of the models. In this paper, we propose a Parameter Efficient Fine tuning (PEFT) based solution for hate speech detection and target identification. We evaluate multiple LLMs on the Devanagari dataset provided by (Thapa et al., 2025), which contains annotated instances in 2 languages - Hindi and Nepali. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in handling Devanagari-scripted content.

### CAAP: Context-Aware Action Planning Prompting to Solve Computer Tasks   with Front-End UI Only
**Authors**: Junhee Cho, Jihoon Kim, Daseul Bae, Jinho Choo, Youngjune Gwon, Yeong-Dae Kwon

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T11:02:28Z

**Summary**: Software robots have long been used in Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to automate mundane and repetitive computer tasks. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their advanced reasoning capabilities, these agents are now able to handle more complex or previously unseen tasks. However, LLM-based automation techniques in recent literature frequently rely on HTML source code for input or application-specific API calls for actions, limiting their applicability to specific environments. We propose an LLM-based agent that mimics human behavior in solving computer tasks. It perceives its environment solely through screenshot images, which are then converted into text for an LLM to process. By leveraging the reasoning capability of the LLM, we eliminate the need for large-scale human demonstration data typically required for model training. The agent only executes keyboard and mouse operations on Graphical User Interface (GUI), removing the need for pre-provided APIs to function. To further enhance the agent's performance in this setting, we propose a novel prompting strategy called Context-Aware Action Planning (CAAP) prompting, which enables the agent to thoroughly examine the task context from multiple perspectives. Our agent achieves an average success rate of 94.5% on MiniWoB++ and an average task score of 62.3 on WebShop, outperforming all previous studies of agents that rely solely on screen images. This method demonstrates potential for broader applications, particularly for tasks requiring coordination across multiple applications on desktops or smartphones, marking a significant advancement in the field of automation agents. Codes and models are accessible at https://github.com/caap-agent/caap-agent.

### PlanLLM: Video Procedure Planning with Refinable Large Language Models
**Authors**: Dejie Yang, Zijing Zhao, YangLiu

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T09:51:05Z

**Summary**: Video procedure planning, i.e., planning a sequence of action steps given the video frames of start and goal states, is an essential ability for embodied AI. Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.

### SketchFill: Sketch-Guided Code Generation for Imputing Derived Missing   Values
**Authors**: Yunfan Zhang, Changlun Li, Yuyu Luo, Nan Tang

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T08:13:34Z

**Summary**: Missing value is a critical issue in data science, significantly impacting the reliability of analyses and predictions. Missing value imputation (MVI) is a longstanding problem because it highly relies on domain knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for data cleaning, including MVI for tabular data, offering advanced capabilities for understanding and generating content. However, despite their promise, existing LLM techniques such as in-context learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) often fall short in guiding LLMs to perform complex reasoning for MVI, particularly when imputing derived missing values, which require mathematical formulas and data relationships across rows and columns. This gap underscores the need for further advancements in LLM methodologies to enhance their reasoning capabilities for more reliable imputation outcomes. To fill this gap, we propose SketchFill, a novel sketch-based method to guide LLMs in generating accurate formulas to impute missing numerical values. Our experimental results demonstrate that SketchFill significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 56.2% higher accuracy than CoT-based methods and 78.8% higher accuracy than MetaGPT. This sets a new standard for automated data cleaning and advances the field of MVI for numerical values.

### "I've Heard of You!": Generate Spoken Named Entity Recognition Data for   Unseen Entities
**Authors**: Jiawei Yu, Xiang Geng, Yuang Li, Mengxin Ren, Wei Tang, Jiahuan Li, Zhibin Lan, Min Zhang, Hao Yang, Shujian Huang, Jinsong Su

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T07:43:18Z

**Summary**: Spoken named entity recognition (NER) aims to identify named entities from speech, playing an important role in speech processing. New named entities appear every day, however, annotating their Spoken NER data is costly. In this paper, we demonstrate that existing Spoken NER systems perform poorly when dealing with previously unseen named entities. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method for generating Spoken NER data based on a named entity dictionary (NED) to reduce costs. Specifically, we first use a large language model (LLM) to generate sentences from the sampled named entities and then use a text-to-speech (TTS) system to generate the speech. Furthermore, we introduce a noise metric to filter out noisy data. To evaluate our approach, we release a novel Spoken NER benchmark along with a corresponding NED containing 8,853 entities. Experiment results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the in-domain, zero-shot domain adaptation, and fully zero-shot settings. Our data will be available at https://github.com/DeepLearnXMU/HeardU.

### Effective Random Test Generation for Deep Learning Compilers
**Authors**: Luyao Ren, ZiHeng Wang, Yingfei Xiong, Li Zhang, Guoyue Jiang, Tao Xie

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T07:34:35Z

**Summary**: Deep learning compilers help address the difficulties of deploying deep learning models on diverse types of hardware. Testing deep learning compilers is highly crucial, because they are impacting countless AI applications that use them for model optimization and deployment. To test deep learning compilers, random testing, the testing method popularly used for compiler testing practices, faces the challenge of generating semantically valid test inputs, i.e., deep learning models that satisfy the semantic model specifications (in short as semantic specifications). To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel approach named Isra, including a domain-specific constraint solver that resolves the constraints from the semantic specifications without backtracking. We implement and apply our approach to three popular real-world deep learning compilers including TVM, Glow, and a commercial compiler named SophGo. The evaluation results show that Isra is more effective than the state-of-the-art approaches and the baseline approaches on constructing valid test inputs for compiler-bug detection, and Isra successfully finds 24 previously unknown bugs in released versions of the three compilers. These results indicate Isra's effectiveness and practical value.

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T07:03:55Z

**Summary**: While new technologies emerge, human errors always looming. Software supply chain is increasingly complex and intertwined, the security of a service has become paramount to ensuring the integrity of products, safeguarding data privacy, and maintaining operational continuity. In this work, we conducted experiments on the promising open Large Language Models (LLMs) into two main software security challenges: source code language errors and deprecated code, with a focus on their potential to replace conventional static and dynamic security scanners that rely on predefined rules and patterns. Our findings suggest that while LLMs present some unexpected results, they also encounter significant limitations, particularly in memory complexity and the management of new and unfamiliar data patterns. Despite these challenges, the proactive application of LLMs, coupled with extensive security databases and continuous updates, holds the potential to fortify Software Supply Chain (SSC) processes against emerging threats.

### MDD-5k: A New Diagnostic Conversation Dataset for Mental Disorders   Synthesized via Neuro-Symbolic LLM Agents
**Authors**: Congchi Yin, Feng Li, Shu Zhang, Zike Wang, Jun Shao, Piji Li, Jianhua Chen, Xun Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T06:39:38Z

**Summary**: The clinical diagnosis of most mental disorders primarily relies on the conversations between psychiatrist and patient. The creation of such diagnostic conversation datasets is promising to boost the AI mental healthcare community. However, directly collecting the conversations in real diagnosis scenarios is near impossible due to stringent privacy and ethical considerations. To address this issue, we seek to synthesize diagnostic conversation by exploiting anonymized patient cases that are easier to access. Specifically, we design a neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for synthesizing the diagnostic conversation of mental disorders with large language models. It takes patient case as input and is capable of generating multiple diverse conversations with one single patient case. The framework basically involves the interaction between a doctor agent and a patient agent, and generates conversations under symbolic control via a dynamic diagnosis tree. By applying the proposed framework, we develop the largest Chinese mental disorders diagnosis dataset MDD-5k. This dataset is built upon 1000 real, anonymized patient cases by cooperating with Shanghai Mental Health Center and comprises 5000 high-quality long conversations with diagnosis results and treatment opinions as labels. To the best of our knowledge, it's also the first labeled dataset for Chinese mental disorders diagnosis. Human evaluation demonstrates the proposed MDD-5k dataset successfully simulates human-like diagnostic process of mental disorders.

### Falcon: Faster and Parallel Inference of Large Language Models through   Enhanced Semi-Autoregressive Drafting and Custom-Designed Decoding Tree
**Authors**: Xiangxiang Gao, Weisheng Xie, Yiwei Xiang, Feng Ji

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T06:20:21Z

**Summary**: Striking an optimal balance between minimal drafting latency and high speculation accuracy to enhance the inference speed of Large Language Models remains a significant challenge in speculative decoding. In this paper, we introduce Falcon, an innovative semi-autoregressive speculative decoding framework fashioned to augment both the drafter's parallelism and output quality. Falcon incorporates the Coupled Sequential Glancing Distillation technique, which fortifies inter-token dependencies within the same block, leading to increased speculation accuracy. We offer a comprehensive theoretical analysis to illuminate the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce a Custom-Designed Decoding Tree, which permits the drafter to generate multiple tokens in a single forward pass and accommodates multiple forward passes as needed, thereby boosting the number of drafted tokens and significantly improving the overall acceptance rate. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets such as MT-Bench, HumanEval, and GSM8K demonstrate Falcon's superior acceleration capabilities. The framework achieves a lossless speedup ratio ranging from 2.91x to 3.51x when tested on the Vicuna and LLaMA2-Chat model series. These results outstrip existing speculative decoding methods for LLMs, including Eagle, Medusa, Lookahead, SPS, and PLD, while maintaining a compact drafter architecture equivalent to merely two Transformer layers.

### Agent Hospital: A Simulacrum of Hospital with Evolvable Medical Agents
**Authors**: Junkai Li, Siyu Wang, Meng Zhang, Weitao Li, Yunghwei Lai, Xinhui Kang, Weizhi Ma, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T06:02:38Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a simulacrum of hospital called Agent Hospital that simulates the entire process of treating illness. All patients, nurses, and doctors are autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). Our central goal is to enable a doctor agent to learn how to treat illness within the simulacrum. To do so, we propose a method called MedAgent-Zero. As the simulacrum can simulate disease onset and progression based on knowledge bases and LLMs, doctor agents can keep accumulating experience from both successful and unsuccessful cases. Simulation experiments show that the treatment performance of doctor agents consistently improves on various tasks. More interestingly, the knowledge the doctor agents have acquired in Agent Hospital is applicable to real-world medicare benchmarks. After treating around ten thousand patients (real-world doctors may take over two years), the evolved doctor agent achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 93.06% on a subset of the MedQA dataset that covers major respiratory diseases. This work paves the way for advancing the applications of LLM-powered agent techniques in medical scenarios.

### The Mamba in the Llama: Distilling and Accelerating Hybrid Models
**Authors**: Junxiong Wang, Daniele Paliotta, Avner May, Alexander M. Rush, Tri Dao

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T05:27:51Z

**Summary**: Linear RNN architectures, like Mamba, can be competitive with Transformer models in language modeling while having advantageous deployment characteristics. Given the focus on training large-scale Transformer models, we consider the challenge of converting these pretrained models for deployment. We demonstrate that it is feasible to distill large Transformers into linear RNNs by reusing the linear projection weights from attention layers with academic GPU resources. The resulting hybrid model, which incorporates a quarter of the attention layers, achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer in chat benchmarks and outperforms open-source hybrid Mamba models trained from scratch with trillions of tokens in both chat benchmarks and general benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates the inference speed of Mamba and hybrid models. Overall we show how, with limited computation resources, we can remove many of the original attention layers and generate from the resulting model more efficiently. Our top-performing model, distilled from Llama3-8B-Instruct, achieves a 29.61 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 against GPT-4 and 7.35 on MT-Bench, surpassing the best 8B scale instruction-tuned linear RNN model. We also find that the distilled model has natural length extrapolation, showing almost perfect accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack test at 20x the distillation length. Code and pre-trained checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/jxiw/MambaInLlama and https://github.com/itsdaniele/speculative_mamba.

### CS-Eval: A Comprehensive Large Language Model Benchmark for   CyberSecurity
**Authors**: Zhengmin Yu, Jiutian Zeng, Siyi Chen, Wenhan Xu, Dandan Xu, Xiangyu Liu, Zonghao Ying, Nan Wang, Yuan Zhang, Min Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T04:46:58Z

**Summary**: Over the past year, there has been a notable rise in the use of large language models (LLMs) for academic research and industrial practices within the cybersecurity field. However, it remains a lack of comprehensive and publicly accessible benchmarks to evaluate the performance of LLMs on cybersecurity tasks. To address this gap, we introduce CS-Eval, a publicly accessible, comprehensive and bilingual LLM benchmark specifically designed for cybersecurity. CS-Eval synthesizes the research hotspots from academia and practical applications from industry, curating a diverse set of high-quality questions across 42 categories within cybersecurity, systematically organized into three cognitive levels: knowledge, ability, and application. Through an extensive evaluation of a wide range of LLMs using CS-Eval, we have uncovered valuable insights. For instance, while GPT-4 generally excels overall, other models may outperform it in certain specific subcategories. Additionally, by conducting evaluations over several months, we observed significant improvements in many LLMs' abilities to solve cybersecurity tasks. The benchmarks are now publicly available at https://github.com/CS-EVAL/CS-Eval.

### Sim911: Towards Effective and Equitable 9-1-1 Dispatcher Training with   an LLM-Enabled Simulation
**Authors**: Zirong Chen, Elizabeth Chason, Noah Mladenovski, Erin Wilson, Kristin Mullen, Stephen Martini, Meiyi Ma

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T04:41:11Z

**Summary**: Emergency response services are vital for enhancing public safety by safeguarding the environment, property, and human lives. As frontline members of these services, 9-1-1 dispatchers have a direct impact on response times and the overall effectiveness of emergency operations. However, traditional dispatcher training methods, which rely on role-playing by experienced personnel, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often neglect the specific needs of underserved communities. To address these challenges, we introduce Sim911, the first training simulation for 9-1-1 dispatchers powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Sim911 enhances training through three key technical innovations: (1) knowledge construction, which utilizes archived 9-1-1 call data to generate simulations that closely mirror real-world scenarios; (2) context-aware controlled generation, which employs dynamic prompts and vector bases to ensure that LLM behavior aligns with training objectives; and (3) validation with looped correction, which filters out low-quality responses and refines the system performance.

### Jasper and Stella: distillation of SOTA embedding models
**Authors**: Dun Zhang, FulongWang

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T04:05:28Z

**Summary**: A crucial component of many deep learning applications (such as FAQ and RAG) is dense retrieval, in which embedding models are used to convert raw text to numerical vectors and then get the most similar text by MIPS (Maximum Inner Product Search). Some text embedding benchmarks (e.g. MTEB, BEIR, and AIR-Bench) have been established to evaluate embedding models accurately. Thanks to these benchmarks, we can use SOTA models; however, the deployment and application of these models in industry were hampered by their large vector dimensions and numerous parameters. To alleviate this problem, 1) we present a distillation technique that can enable a smaller student model to achieve good performance. 2) Inspired by MRL we present a training approach of reducing the vector dimensions based on its own vectors or its teacher vectors. 3) We do simple yet effective alignment training between images and text to make our model a multimodal encoder. We trained Stella and Jasper models using the technologies above and achieved high scores on the MTEB leaderboard. We release the model and data at Hugging Face Hub (https://huggingface.co/infgrad/jasper_en_vision_language_v1) and the training logs are at https://api.wandb.ai/links/dunnzhang0/z8jqoqpb.

### PrivacyRestore: Privacy-Preserving Inference in Large Language Models   via Privacy Removal and Restoration
**Authors**: Ziqian Zeng, Jianwei Wang, Junyao Yang, Zhengdong Lu, Huiping Zhuang, Cen Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T03:49:34Z

**Summary**: The widespread usage of online Large Language Models (LLMs) inference services has raised significant privacy concerns about the potential exposure of private information in user inputs to malicious eavesdroppers. Existing privacy protection methods for LLMs suffer from either insufficient privacy protection, performance degradation, or large inference time overhead. To address these limitations, we propose PrivacyRestore, a plug-and-play method to protect the privacy of user inputs during LLM inference. The server first trains restoration vectors for each privacy span and then release to clients. Privacy span is defined as a contiguous sequence of tokens within a text that contain private information. The client then aggregate restoration vectors of all privacy spans in the input into a single meta restoration vector which is later sent to the server side along with the input without privacy spans.The private information is restored via activation steering during inference. Furthermore, we prove that PrivacyRestore inherently prevents the linear growth of the privacy budget.We create three datasets, covering medical and legal domains, to evaluate the effectiveness of privacy preserving methods. The experimental results show that PrivacyRestore effectively protects private information and maintain acceptable levels of performance and inference overhead.

### PhotoBot: Reference-Guided Interactive Photography via Natural Language
**Authors**: Oliver Limoyo, Jimmy Li, Dmitriy Rivkin, Jonathan Kelly, Gregory Dudek

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T03:38:10Z

**Summary**: We introduce PhotoBot, a framework for fully automated photo acquisition based on an interplay between high-level human language guidance and a robot photographer. We propose to communicate photography suggestions to the user via reference images that are selected from a curated gallery. We leverage a visual language model (VLM) and an object detector to characterize the reference images via textual descriptions and then use a large language model (LLM) to retrieve relevant reference images based on a user's language query through text-based reasoning. To correspond the reference image and the observed scene, we exploit pre-trained features from a vision transformer capable of capturing semantic similarity across marked appearance variations. Using these features, we compute suggested pose adjustments for an RGB-D camera by solving a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem. We demonstrate our approach using a manipulator equipped with a wrist camera. Our user studies show that photos taken by PhotoBot are often more aesthetically pleasing than those taken by users themselves, as measured by human feedback. We also show that PhotoBot can generalize to other reference sources such as paintings.

### KunServe: Elastic and Efficient Large Language Model Serving with   Parameter-centric Memory Management
**Authors**: Rongxin Cheng, Yifan Peng, Yuxin Lai, Xingda Wei, Rong Chen, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T03:28:03Z

**Summary**: The stateful nature of large language model (LLM) servingcan easily throttle precious GPU memory under load burstor long-generation requests like chain-of-thought reasoning,causing latency spikes due to queuing incoming requests. However, state-of-the-art KVCache centric approaches handleload spikes by dropping, migrating, or swapping KVCache,which faces an essential tradeoff between the performance ofongoing vs. incoming requests and thus still severely violatesSLO.This paper makes a key observation such that model param-eters are independent of the requests and are replicated acrossGPUs, and thus proposes a parameter-centric approach byselectively dropping replicated parameters to leave preciousmemory for requests. However, LLM requires KVCache tobe saved in bound with model parameters and thus droppingparameters can cause either huge computation waste or longnetwork delay, affecting all ongoing requests. Based on the ob-servation that attention operators can be decoupled from otheroperators, this paper further proposes a novel remote attentionmechanism through pipeline parallelism so as to serve up-coming requests with the additional memory borrowed fromparameters on remote GPUs. This paper further addresses sev-eral other challenges including lively exchanging KVCachewith incomplete parameters, generating an appropriate planthat balances memory requirements with cooperative exe-cution overhead, and seamlessly restoring parameters whenthe throttling has gone. Evaluations show thatKUNSERVEreduces the tail TTFT of requests under throttling by up to 27.3x compared to the state-of-the-art.

### CL-attack: Textual Backdoor Attacks via Cross-Lingual Triggers
**Authors**: Jingyi Zheng, Tianyi Hu, Tianshuo Cong, Xinlei He

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T03:13:03Z

**Summary**: Backdoor attacks significantly compromise the security of large language models by triggering them to output specific and controlled content. Currently, triggers for textual backdoor attacks fall into two categories: fixed-token triggers and sentence-pattern triggers. However, the former are typically easy to identify and filter, while the latter, such as syntax and style, do not apply to all original samples and may lead to semantic shifts. In this paper, inspired by cross-lingual (CL) prompts of LLMs in real-world scenarios, we propose a higher-dimensional trigger method at the paragraph level, namely CL-attack. CL-attack injects the backdoor by using texts with specific structures that incorporate multiple languages, thereby offering greater stealthiness and universality compared to existing backdoor attack techniques. Extensive experiments on different tasks and model architectures demonstrate that CL-attack can achieve nearly 100% attack success rate with a low poisoning rate in both classification and generation tasks. We also empirically show that the CL-attack is more robust against current major defense methods compared to baseline backdoor attacks. Additionally, to mitigate CL-attack, we further develop a new defense called TranslateDefense, which can partially mitigate the impact of CL-attack.

### LEARN: Knowledge Adaptation from Large Language Model to Recommendation   for Practical Industrial Application
**Authors**: Jian Jia, Yipei Wang, Yan Li, Honggang Chen, Xuehan Bai, Zhaocheng Liu, Jian Liang, Quan Chen, Han Li, Peng Jiang, Kun Gai

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T03:03:30Z

**Summary**: Contemporary recommendation systems predominantly rely on ID embedding to capture latent associations among users and items. However, this approach overlooks the wealth of semantic information embedded within textual descriptions of items, leading to suboptimal performance and poor generalizations. Leveraging the capability of large language models to comprehend and reason about textual content presents a promising avenue for advancing recommendation systems. To achieve this, we propose an Llm-driven knowlEdge Adaptive RecommeNdation (LEARN) framework that synergizes open-world knowledge with collaborative knowledge. We address computational complexity concerns by utilizing pretrained LLMs as item encoders and freezing LLM parameters to avoid catastrophic forgetting and preserve open-world knowledge. To bridge the gap between the open-world and collaborative domains, we design a twin-tower structure supervised by the recommendation task and tailored for practical industrial application. Through experiments on the real large-scale industrial dataset and online A/B tests, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in industry application. We also achieve state-of-the-art performance on six Amazon Review datasets to verify the superiority of our method.

### Repository Structure-Aware Training Makes SLMs Better Issue Resolver
**Authors**: Zexiong Ma, Shengnan An, Zeqi Lin, Yanzhen Zou, Bing Xie

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T03:01:32Z

**Summary**: Language models have been applied to various software development tasks, but the performance varies according to the scale of the models. Large Language Models (LLMs) outperform Small Language Models (SLMs) in complex tasks like repository-level issue resolving, but raise concerns about privacy and cost. In contrast, SLMs are more accessible but under-perform in complex tasks. In this paper, we introduce ReSAT (Repository Structure-Aware Training), construct training data based on a large number of issues and corresponding pull requests from open-source communities to enhance the model's understanding of repository structure and issue resolving ability. We construct two types of training data: (1) localization training data, a multi-level progressive localization data to improve code understanding and localization capability; (2) code edit training data, which improves context-based code editing capability. The evaluation results on SWE-Bench-verified and RepoQA demonstrate that ReSAT effectively enhances SLMs' issue-resolving and repository-level long-context understanding capabilities.

**Authors**: Shan Zhong, Jiahao Zeng, Yongxin Yu, Bohong Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T02:47:15Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a Clustering, Labeling, then Augmenting framework that significantly enhances performance in Semi-Supervised Text Classification (SSTC) tasks, effectively addressing the challenge of vast datasets with limited labeled examples. Unlike traditional SSTC approaches that rely on a predefined small set of labeled data to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data, this framework innovatively employs clustering to select representative "landmarks" for labeling. These landmarks subsequently act as intermediaries in an ensemble of augmentation techniques, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Model (LLMs)-based rewriting, and synonym substitution, to generate synthetic labeled data without making pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data. Empirical results show that even in complex text document classification scenarios involving over 100 categories, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracies of 95.41% on the Reuters dataset and 82.43% on the Web of Science dataset. Our approach significantly reduces the reliance on human labeling efforts and the associated expenses, while simultaneously ensuring high data quality and minimizing privacy risks. The finetuning results further show the efficiency of fine-tuning LLMs for text classification tasks, highlighting a robust solution for leveraging limited labeled data.

### PoTable: Programming Standardly on Table-based Reasoning Like a Human   Analyst
**Authors**: Qingyang Mao, Qi Liu, Zhi Li, Mingyue Cheng, Zheng Zhang, Rui Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T02:24:52Z

**Summary**: Table-based reasoning has garnered substantial research interest, particularly in its integration with Large Language Model (LLM) which has revolutionized the general reasoning paradigm. Numerous LLM-based studies introduce symbolic tools (e.g., databases, Python) as assistants to extend human-like abilities in structured table understanding and complex arithmetic computations. However, these studies can be improved better in simulating human cognitive behavior when using symbolic tools, as they still suffer from limitations of non-standard logical splits and constrained operation pools. In this study, we propose PoTable as a novel table-based reasoning method that simulates a human tabular analyst, which integrates a Python interpreter as the real-time executor accompanied by an LLM-based operation planner and code generator. Specifically, PoTable follows a human-like logical stage split and extends the operation pool into an open-world space without any constraints. Through planning and executing in each distinct stage, PoTable standardly completes the entire reasoning process and produces superior reasoning results along with highly accurate, steply commented and completely executable programs. Accordingly, the effectiveness and explainability of PoTable are fully demonstrated. Extensive experiments over three evaluation datasets from two public benchmarks on two backbones show the outstanding performance of our approach. In particular, GPT-based PoTable achieves over 4% higher absolute accuracy than runner-ups on all evaluation datasets.

### Large Language Model as a Catalyst: A Paradigm Shift in Base Station   Siting Optimization
**Authors**: Yanhu Wang, Muhammad Muzammil Afzal, Zhengyang Li, Jie Zhou, Chenyuan Feng, Shuaishuai Guo, Tony Q. S. Quek

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T02:14:28Z

**Summary**: Traditional base station siting (BSS) methods rely heavily on drive testing and user feedback, which are laborious and require extensive expertise in communication, networking, and optimization. As large language models (LLMs) and their associated technologies advance, particularly in the realms of prompt engineering and agent engineering, network optimization will witness a revolutionary approach. This approach entails the strategic use of well-crafted prompts to infuse human experience and knowledge into these sophisticated LLMs, and the deployment of autonomous agents as a communication bridge to seamlessly connect the machine language based LLMs with human users using natural language. Furthermore, our proposed framework incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance the system's ability to acquire domain-specific knowledge and generate solutions, thereby enabling the customization and optimization of the BSS process. This integration represents the future paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) as a service and AI for more ease. This research first develops a novel LLM-empowered BSS optimization framework, and heuristically proposes three different potential implementations: the strategies based on Prompt-optimized LLM (PoL), LLM-empowered autonomous BSS agent (LaBa), and Cooperative multiple LLM-based autonomous BSS agents (CLaBa). Through evaluation on real-world data, the experiments demonstrate that prompt-assisted LLMs and LLM-based agents can generate more efficient and reliable network deployments, noticeably enhancing the efficiency of BSS optimization and reducing trivial manual participation.
