**Authors**: Utkarsh Saxena, Gobinda Saha, Sakshi Choudhary, Kaushik Roy

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:29:33Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the domain of natural language processing due to their impressive reasoning abilities. Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the context lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex tasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new bottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen Attention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby reducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we demonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache sizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop in performance.

**Authors**: Ilias Bournias, Lukas Cavigelli, Georgios Zacharopoulos

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T13:24:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference on large-scale systems is expected to dominate future cloud infrastructures. Efficient LLM inference in cloud environments with numerous AI accelerators is challenging, necessitating extensive optimizations for optimal performance. Current systems batch prefill and decoding to boost throughput but encounter latency issues, while others disaggregate these phases, leading to resource underutilization. We propose AcceLLM, a novel method addressing latency and load balancing, inspired by the cache data management. It strategically utilizes redundant data to enhance inference via load balancing and optimal hardware use. Simulated evaluations on Nvidia H100 GPU and Huawei Ascend 910B2 show AcceLLM surpasses state-of-the-art systems up to 30% in latency and efficiency, handling diverse workloads effectively.

### GPT Semantic Cache: Reducing LLM Costs and Latency via Semantic   Embedding Caching
**Authors**: Sajal Regmi, Chetan Phakami Pun

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T02:21:19Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT (Radford et al., 2019), have significantly advanced artificial intelligence by enabling sophisticated natural language understanding and generation. However, the high computational and financial costs associated with frequent API calls to these models present a substantial bottleneck, especially for applications like customer service chatbots that handle repetitive queries. In this paper, we introduce GPT Semantic Cache, a method that leverages semantic caching of query embeddings in in-memory storage (Redis). By storing embeddings of user queries, our approach efficiently identifies semantically similar questions, allowing for the retrieval of pre-generated responses without redundant API calls to the LLM. This technique reduces operational costs and improves response times, enhancing the efficiency of LLM-powered applications.

### Loki: Low-rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention
**Authors**: Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, Soheil Feizi, Abhinav Bhatele

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T18:58:50Z

**Summary**: Inference on large language models (LLMs) can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in LLM inference contributes significantly to these costs, which has sparked an interest in approximating the self-attention computation to reduce such costs. In this work, we propose to approximate self-attention by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to speed up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs while maintaining the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.

**Authors**: Hongyu Wang, Shuming Ma, Furu Wei

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T18:41:50Z

**Summary**: Recent research on the 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BitNet b1.58, presents a promising direction for reducing the inference cost of LLMs while maintaining their performance. In this work, we introduce BitNet a4.8, enabling 4-bit activations for 1-bit LLMs. BitNet a4.8 employs a hybrid quantization and sparsification strategy to mitigate the quantization errors introduced by the outlier channels. Specifically, we utilize 4-bit activations for inputs to the attention and feed-forward network layers, while sparsifying intermediate states followed with 8-bit quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BitNet a4.8 achieves performance comparable to BitNet b1.58 with equivalent training costs, while being faster in inference with enabling 4-bit (INT4/FP4) kernels. Additionally, BitNet a4.8 activates only 55% of parameters and supports 3-bit KV cache, further enhancing the efficiency of large-scale LLM deployment and inference.

**Authors**: Kumara Kahatapitiya, Haozhe Liu, Sen He, Ding Liu, Menglin Jia, Chenyang Zhang, Michael S. Ryoo, Tian Xie

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T17:06:32Z

**Summary**: Generating temporally-consistent high-fidelity videos can be computationally expensive, especially over longer temporal spans. More-recent Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) -- despite making significant headway in this context -- have only heightened such challenges as they rely on larger models and heavier attention mechanisms, resulting in slower inference speeds. In this paper, we introduce a training-free method to accelerate video DiTs, termed Adaptive Caching (AdaCache), which is motivated by the fact that "not all videos are created equal": meaning, some videos require fewer denoising steps to attain a reasonable quality than others. Building on this, we not only cache computations through the diffusion process, but also devise a caching schedule tailored to each video generation, maximizing the quality-latency trade-off. We further introduce a Motion Regularization (MoReg) scheme to utilize video information within AdaCache, essentially controlling the compute allocation based on motion content. Altogether, our plug-and-play contributions grant significant inference speedups (e.g. up to 4.7x on Open-Sora 720p - 2s video generation) without sacrificing the generation quality, across multiple video DiT baselines.

**Authors**: Geng Sun, Jiaxu Wu, Long He, Jiacheng Wang, Dusit Niyato, Abbas Jamalipour, Shiwen Mao

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T14:59:44Z

**Summary**: In the era of the sixth generation (6G) and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), an industrial cyber-physical system (ICPS) drives the proliferation of sensor devices and computing-intensive tasks. To address the limited resources of IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and cost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs). However, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and computation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges, including the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources, stringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board energy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative aerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing capabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a service delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP). Since the SDMOP is proved to be an NP-hard problem, we propose a joint computation offloading, caching, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control approach (JC5A). Specifically, JC5A consists of a block successive upper bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUMM) for computation offloading and service caching, a convex optimization-based method for communication and computation resource allocation, and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method for UAV trajectory control. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence and polynomial complexity of JC5A. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior system performance compared to the benchmark approaches and algorithms.

**Authors**: Qijie Wang, Guandu Liu, Bin Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T09:33:40Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in vision-language foundational models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated significant strides in zero-shot classification. However, the extensive parameterization of models like CLIP necessitates a resource-intensive fine-tuning process. In response, TIP-Adapter and SuS-X have introduced training-free methods aimed at bolstering the efficacy of downstream tasks. While these approaches incorporate support sets to maintain data distribution consistency between knowledge cache and test sets, they often fall short in terms of generalization on the test set, particularly when faced with test data exhibiting substantial distributional variations. In this work, we present CapS-Adapter, an innovative method that employs a caption-based support set, effectively harnessing both image and caption features to exceed existing state-of-the-art techniques in training-free scenarios. CapS-Adapter adeptly constructs support sets that closely mirror target distributions, utilizing instance-level distribution features extracted from multimodal large models. By leveraging CLIP's single and cross-modal strengths, CapS-Adapter enhances predictive accuracy through the use of multimodal support sets. Our method achieves outstanding zero-shot classification results across 19 benchmark datasets, improving accuracy by 2.19\% over the previous leading method. Our contributions are substantiated through extensive validation on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance and robust generalization capabilities. Our code is made publicly available at https://github.com/WLuLi/CapS-Adapter.

### HEXA-MoE: Efficient and Heterogeneous-aware MoE Acceleration with ZERO   Computation Redundancy
**Authors**: Shuqing Luo, Jie Peng, Pingzhi Li, Tianlong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T06:40:40Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a practical approach to scale up parameters for the Transformer model to achieve better generalization while maintaining a sub-linear increase in computation overhead. Current MoE models are mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it usually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy communication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore developing a \texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \texttt{EX}pert \texttt{A}llocation framework, \textbf{\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing efficiency. It contains two components: ($1$) \textit{Expert-Specific Operators}. We replace the typical general matrix multiplication or grouped matrix multiplication interfaces with our operators, which allows the computing to be performed in an in-place manner with \textbf{ZERO} redundancy. ($2$) \textit{Adaptive Data- and Model-Centric Configurations} for different workload scales. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline-shared cache on each device to tackle the heavy memory consumption in the existing data-centric MoE library. Comprehensive experiments on the Swin-MoE benchmark consistently reveal the effectiveness of our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} framework, i.e., reducing $10\%\sim48\%$ memory consumption and achieving $0.5\sim4.3\times$ speed up compared to current state-of-the-art MoE libraries. Furthermore, we examine our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} with heterogeneous devices for both data- and model-centric settings. Promising results show that employing optimal parallel configuration with \texttt{HEXA-MoE} on heterogeneous devices can substantially minimize overall latency. Codes are available at https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/HEXA-MoE.

**Updated**: 2024-11-06T09:15:27Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce Hunyuan-Large, which is currently the largest open-source Transformer-based mixture of experts model, with a total of 389 billion parameters and 52 billion activation parameters, capable of handling up to 256K tokens. We conduct a thorough evaluation of Hunyuan-Large's superior performance across various benchmarks including language understanding and generation, logical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, coding, long-context, and aggregated tasks, where it outperforms LLama3.1-70B and exhibits comparable performance when compared to the significantly larger LLama3.1-405B model. Key practice of Hunyuan-Large include large-scale synthetic data that is orders larger than in previous literature, a mixed expert routing strategy, a key-value cache compression technique, and an expert-specific learning rate strategy. Additionally, we also investigate the scaling laws and learning rate schedule of mixture of experts models, providing valuable insights and guidances for future model development and optimization. The code and checkpoints of Hunyuan-Large are released to facilitate future innovations and applications.

### Reducing Hyperparameter Tuning Costs in ML, Vision and Language Model   Training Pipelines via Memoization-Awareness
**Authors**: Abdelmajid Essofi, Ridwan Salahuddeen, Munachiso Nwadike, Elnura Zhalieva, Kun Zhang, Eric Xing, Willie Neiswanger, Qirong Ho

**Updated**: 2024-11-06T07:53:04Z

**Summary**: The training or fine-tuning of machine learning, vision, and language models is often implemented as a pipeline: a sequence of stages encompassing data preparation, model training and evaluation. In this paper, we exploit pipeline structures to reduce the cost of hyperparameter tuning for model training/fine-tuning, which is particularly valuable for language models given their high costs in GPU-days. We propose a "memoization-aware" Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm, EEIPU, that works in tandem with a pipeline caching system, allowing it to evaluate significantly more hyperparameter candidates per GPU-day than other tuning algorithms. The result is better-quality hyperparameters in the same amount of search time, or equivalently, reduced search time to reach the same hyperparameter quality. In our benchmarks on machine learning (model ensembles), vision (convolutional architecture) and language (T5 architecture) pipelines, we compare EEIPU against recent BO algorithms: EEIPU produces an average of $103\%$ more hyperparameter candidates (within the same budget), and increases the validation metric by an average of $108\%$ more than other algorithms (where the increase is measured starting from the end of warm-up iterations).

### The Early Bird Catches the Leak: Unveiling Timing Side Channels in LLM   Serving Systems
**Authors**: Linke Song, Zixuan Pang, Wenhao Wang, Zihao Wang, XiaoFeng Wang, Hongbo Chen, Wei Song, Yier Jin, Dan Meng, Rui Hou

**Updated**: 2024-11-06T07:12:55Z

**Summary**: The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.

### HOBBIT: A Mixed Precision Expert Offloading System for Fast MoE   Inference
**Authors**: Peng Tang, Jiacheng Liu, Xiaofeng Hou, Yifei Pu, Jing Wang, Pheng-Ann Heng, Chao Li, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-11-06T01:49:45Z

**Summary**: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has demonstrated significant advantages in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), offering enhanced capabilities with reduced inference costs. However, deploying MoE-based LLMs on memoryconstrained edge devices remains challenging due to their substantial memory requirements. While existing expertoffloading methods alleviate the memory requirements, they often incur significant expert-loading costs or compromise model accuracy. We present HOBBIT, a mixed precision expert offloading system to enable flexible and efficient MoE inference. Our key insight is that dynamically replacing less critical cache-miss experts with low precision versions can substantially reduce expert-loading latency while preserving model accuracy. HOBBIT introduces three innovative techniques that map the natural hierarchy of MoE computation: (1) a token-level dynamic expert loading mechanism, (2) a layer-level adaptive expert prefetching technique, and (3) a sequence-level multidimensional expert caching policy. These innovations fully leverage the benefits of mixedprecision expert inference. By implementing HOBBIT on top of the renowned LLM inference framework Llama.cpp, we evaluate its performance across different edge devices with representative MoE models. The results demonstrate that HOBBIT achieves up to a 9.93x speedup in decoding compared to state-of-the-art MoE offloading systems.

### ZipCache: A DRAM/SSD Cache with Built-in Transparent Compression
**Authors**: Rui Xie, Linsen Ma, Alex Zhong, Feng Chen, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-05T15:22:11Z

**Summary**: As a core component in modern data centers, key-value cache provides high-throughput and low-latency services for high-speed data processing. The effectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the needed data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than commonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs, cooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential solution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by condensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not gained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical issues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write amplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost. This paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic integration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as an essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data management, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for collaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache. Our experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher throughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by up to 26.2 times.

### Wireless Edge Content Broadcast via Integrated Terrestrial and   Non-terrestrial Networks
**Authors**: Feng Wang, Giovanni Geraci, Lingxiang Li, Peng Wang, Tony Q. S. Quek

**Updated**: 2024-11-05T08:34:44Z

**Summary**: Non-terrestrial networks (NTN) have emerged as a transformative solution to bridge the digital divide and deliver essential services to remote and underserved areas. In this context, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations offer remarkable potential for efficient cache content broadcast in remote regions, thereby extending the reach of digital services. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN. Despite wide coverage, the varying NTN transmission capabilities must be carefully aligned with each content placement to maximize broadcast efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN, positioning NTN as a complement to TN for achieving optimal content broadcasting. Specifically, we dynamically select content for placement via NTN links. This selection is based on popularity and suitability for delivery through NTN, while considering the orbital motion of LEO satellites. Our system-level case studies, based on a practical LEO constellation, demonstrate the significant improvement in placement speed compared to existing methods, which neglect network mobility. We also demonstrate that NTN links significantly outperform standalone wireless TN solutions, particularly in the early stages of content delivery. This advantage is amplified when there is a higher correlation of content popularity across geographical regions.

### TokenSelect: Efficient Long-Context Inference and Length Extrapolation   for LLMs via Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection
**Authors**: Wei Wu, Zhuoshi Pan, Chao Wang, Liyi Chen, Yunchu Bai, Kun Fu, Zheng Wang, Hui Xiong

**Updated**: 2024-11-05T07:56:24Z

**Summary**: With the development of large language models (LLMs), the ability to handle longer contexts has become a key capability for Web applications such as cross-document understanding and LLM-powered search systems. However, this progress faces two major challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues hinder the application of LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a model-agnostic, training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using Query-Key dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a small number of critical KV cache tokens in the attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we designed the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented efficient dot product kernel, significantly reducing the overhead of token selection. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to 23.84x speedup in attention computation and up to 2.28x acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.

### DroidSpeak: Enhancing Cross-LLM Communication
**Authors**: Yuhan Liu, Esha Choukse, Shan Lu, Junchen Jiang, Madan Musuvathi

**Updated**: 2024-11-05T05:41:41Z

**Summary**: In multi-agent systems utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), communication between agents traditionally relies on natural language. This communication often includes the full context of the query so far, which can introduce significant prefill-phase latency, especially with long contexts.   We introduce DroidSpeak, a novel framework to target this cross-LLM communication by leveraging the reuse of intermediate data, such as input embeddings (E-cache) and key-value caches (KV-cache). We efficiently bypass the need to reprocess entire contexts for fine-tuned versions of the same foundational model. This approach allows faster context integration while maintaining the quality of task performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate DroidSpeak's ability to significantly accelerate inter-agent communication, achieving up to a 2.78x speedup in prefill latency with negligible loss in accuracy. Our findings underscore the potential to create more efficient and scalable multi-agent systems.

### Kilovolt Pyroelectric Voltage Generation and Electrostatic Actuation   With Fluidic Heating
**Authors**: Di Ni, Ved Gund, Landon Ivy, Amit Lal

**Updated**: 2024-11-04T17:21:58Z

**Summary**: Integrated micro power generators are crucial components for micro robotic platforms to demonstrate untethered operation and to achieve autonomy. Current micro robotic electrostatic actuators typically require hundreds to thousands of voltages to output sufficient work. Pyroelectricity is one such source of high voltages that can be scaled to small form factors. This paper demonstrates a distributed pyroelectric high voltage generation mechanism to power kV actuators using alternating exposure of crystals to hot and cold water (300C to 900C water temperature). Using this fluidic temperature control, a pyroelectrically generated voltage of 2470 V was delivered to a 2 pF storage capacitor yielding a 6.10 {\mu}J stored energy. A maximum energy of 17.46 {\mu}J was delivered to a 47 pF capacitor at 861 V. The recirculating water can be used to heat a distributed array of converters to generate electricity in distant robotic actuator sections. The development of this distributed system would enable untethered micro-robot to be operated with a flexible body and free of battery recharging, which advances its applications in the real world.

### TME-Box: Scalable In-Process Isolation through Intel TME-MK Memory   Encryption
**Authors**: Martin Unterguggenberger, Lukas Lamster, David Schrammel, Martin Schwarzl, Stefan Mangard

**Updated**: 2024-11-04T12:14:07Z

**Summary**: Efficient cloud computing relies on in-process isolation to optimize performance by running workloads within a single process. Without heavy-weight process isolation, memory safety errors pose a significant security threat by allowing an adversary to extract or corrupt the private data of other co-located tenants. Existing in-process isolation mechanisms are not suitable for modern cloud requirements, e.g., MPK's 16 protection domains are insufficient to isolate thousands of cloud workers per process. Consequently, cloud service providers have a strong need for lightweight in-process isolation on commodity x86 machines.   This paper presents TME-Box, a novel isolation technique that enables fine-grained and scalable sandboxing on commodity x86 CPUs. By repurposing Intel TME-MK, which is intended for the encryption of virtual machines, TME-Box offers lightweight and efficient in-process isolation. TME-Box enforces that sandboxes use their designated encryption keys for memory interactions through compiler instrumentation. This cryptographic isolation enables fine-grained access control, from single cache lines to full pages, and supports flexible data relocation. In addition, the design of TME-Box allows the efficient isolation of up to 32K concurrent sandboxes. We present a performance-optimized TME-Box prototype, utilizing x86 segment-based addressing, that showcases geomean performance overheads of 5.2 % for data isolation and 9.7 % for code and data isolation, evaluated with the SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite.

**Summary**: In recent years, the Internet has been dominated by content-rich platforms, employing recommendation systems to provide users with more appealing content (e.g., videos in YouTube, movies in Netflix). While traditional content recommendations are oblivious to network conditions, the paradigm of Network-Friendly Recommendations (NFR) has recently emerged, favoring content that improves network performance (e.g. cached near the user), while still being appealing to the user. However, NFR algorithms sometimes achieve their goal by shrinking the pool of content recommended to users. The undesirable side-effect is reduced content diversity, a phenomenon known as ``content/filter bubble''. This reduced diversity is problematic for both users, who are prevented from exploring a broader range of content, and content creators (e.g. YouTubers) whose content may be recommended less frequently, leading to perceived unfairness. In this paper, we first investigate - using real data and state-of-the-art NFR schemes - the extent of this phenomenon. We then formulate a ``Diverse-NFR'' optimization problem (i.e., network-friendly recommendations with - sufficient - content diversity), and through a series of transformation steps, we manage to reduce it to a linear program that can be solved fast and optimally. Our findings show that Diverse-NFR can achieve high network gains (comparable to non-diverse NFR) while maintaining diversity constraints. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that incorporates diversity issues into network-friendly recommendation algorithms.

**Authors**: Amy Yang, Jingyi Yang, Aya Ibrahim, Xinfeng Xie, Bangsheng Tang, Grigory Sizov, Jongsoo Park, Jianyu Huang

**Updated**: 2024-11-04T04:15:36Z

**Summary**: We present context parallelism for long-context large language model inference, which achieves near-linear scaling for long-context prefill latency with up to 128 H100 GPUs across 16 nodes. Particularly, our method achieves 1M context prefill with Llama3 405B model in 77s (93% parallelization efficiency, 63% FLOPS utilization) and 128K context prefill in 3.8s. We develop two lossless exact ring attention variants: pass-KV and pass-Q to cover a wide range of use cases with the state-of-the-art performance: full prefill, persistent KV prefill and decode. Benchmarks on H100 GPU hosts inter-connected with RDMA and TCP both show similar scalability for long-context prefill, demonstrating that our method scales well using common commercial data center with medium-to-low inter-host bandwidth.

**Summary**: The room temperature continuous wave (CW) very-high-frequency (VHF) gun is one of the candidates for the electron gun of the high-repetition-rate free-electron lasers (FELs). The VHF gun operates with a cathode gradient of ~ 20 MV/m and an accelerating voltage of ~ 750 kV. The gun dark current emission leads to beam loss along the FEL machine, therefore is a critical parameter for the performance of the CW gun. In this paper, we presents a systematic study of the dark current reduction of the VHF gun, including cathode region optimizations, dark current tracking simulations and measurements. Over-inserted cathode plugs were tested in two VHF guns of different acceleration gap sizes, and both demonstrated significant dark current reduction ratios of more than two orders of magnitude.

**Summary**: Post-training KV-Cache compression methods typically either sample a subset of effectual tokens or quantize the data into lower numerical bit width. However, these methods cannot exploit redundancy in the hidden dimension of the KV tensors. This paper presents a hidden dimension compression approach called Palu, a KV-Cache compression framework that utilizes low-rank projection to reduce inference-time LLM memory usage. Palu decomposes the linear layers into low-rank matrices, caches compressed intermediate states, and reconstructs the full keys and values on the fly. To improve accuracy, compression rate, and efficiency, Palu further encompasses (1) a medium-grained low-rank decomposition scheme, (2) an efficient rank search algorithm, (3) low-rank-aware quantization compatibility enhancements, and (4) optimized GPU kernels with operators fusion. Extensive experiments with popular LLMs show that Palu compresses KV-Cache by 50% while maintaining strong accuracy and delivering up to 1.89x on the RoPE-based attention module. When combined with quantization, Palu's inherent quantization-friendly design yields small to negligible extra accuracy degradation while saving additional memory than quantization-only methods and achieving up to 2.91x speedup for the RoPE-based attention. Moreover, it maintains comparable or even better accuracy (up to 1.19 lower perplexity) compared to quantization-only methods. These results demonstrate Palu's superior capability to effectively address the efficiency and memory challenges of LLM inference posed by KV-Cache.

### A Simple and Effective $L_2$ Norm-Based Strategy for KV Cache   Compression
**Authors**: Alessio Devoto, Yu Zhao, Simone Scardapane, Pasquale Minervini

**Updated**: 2024-11-03T09:42:35Z

**Summary**: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often hindered by the extensive memory requirements of the Key-Value (KV) cache, especially as context lengths increase. Existing approaches to reduce the KV cache size involve either fine-tuning the model to learn a compression strategy or leveraging attention scores to reduce the sequence length. We analyse the attention distributions in decoder-only Transformers-based models and observe that attention allocation patterns stay consistent across most layers. Surprisingly, we find a clear correlation between the $L_2$ and the attention scores over cached KV pairs, where a low $L_2$ of a key embedding usually leads to a high attention score during decoding. This finding indicates that the influence of a KV pair is potentially determined by the key embedding itself before being queried. Based on this observation, we compress the KV cache based on the $L_2$ of key embeddings. Our experimental results show that this simple strategy can reduce the KV cache size by 50% on language modelling and needle-in-a-haystack tasks and 90% on passkey retrieval tasks without losing accuracy. Moreover, without relying on the attention scores, this approach remains compatible with FlashAttention, enabling broader applicability.

### Two-Timescale Model Caching and Resource Allocation for Edge-Enabled   AI-Generated Content Services
**Authors**: Zhang Liu, Hongyang Du, Xiangwang Hou, Lianfen Huang, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, Dusit Niyato, Khaled Ben Letaief

**Updated**: 2024-11-03T07:01:13Z

**Summary**: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology, enabling customized and personalized AI-generated content (AIGC) services. In this paper, we address challenges of edge-enabled AIGC service provisioning, which remain underexplored in the literature. These services require executing GenAI models with billions of parameters, posing significant obstacles to resource-limited wireless edge. We subsequently introduce the formulation of joint model caching and resource allocation for AIGC services to balance a trade-off between AIGC quality and latency metrics. We obtain mathematical relationships of these metrics with the computational resources required by GenAI models via experimentation. Afterward, we decompose the formulation into a model caching subproblem on a long-timescale and a resource allocation subproblem on a short-timescale. Since the variables to be solved are discrete and continuous, respectively, we leverage a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm to solve the former subproblem and propose a diffusion-based deep deterministic policy gradient (D3PG) algorithm to solve the latter. The proposed D3PG algorithm makes an innovative use of diffusion models as the actor network to determine optimal resource allocation decisions. Consequently, we integrate these two learning methods within the overarching two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (T2DRL) algorithm, the performance of which is studied through comparative numerical simulations.

### Disaggregated Database Management Systems
**Authors**: Shahram Ghandeharizadeh, Philip A. Bernstein, Dhruba Borthakur, Haoyu Huang, Jai Menon, Sumit Puri

**Updated**: 2024-11-02T14:40:36Z

**Summary**: Modern applications demand high performance and cost efficient database management systems (DBMSs). Their workloads may be diverse, ranging from online transaction processing to analytics and decision support. The cloud infrastructure enables disaggregation of monolithic DBMSs into components that facilitate software-hardware co-design. This is realized using pools of hardware resources, i.e., CPUs, GPUs, memory, FPGA, NVM, etc., connected using high-speed networks. This disaggregation trend is being adopted by cloud DBMSs because hardware re-provisioning can be achieved by simply invoking software APIs. Disaggregated DBMSs separate processing from storage, enabling each to scale elastically and independently. They may disaggregate compute usage based on functionality, e.g., compute needed for writes from compute needed for queries and compute needed for compaction. They may also use disaggregated memory, e.g., for intermediate results in a shuffle or for remote caching. The DBMS monitors the characteristics of a workload and dynamically assembles its components that are most efficient and cost effective for the workload. This paper is a summary of a panel session that discussed the capability, challenges, and opportunities of these emerging DBMSs and disaggregated hardware systems.

### CAMP: A Cost Adaptive Multi-Queue Eviction Policy for Key-Value Stores
**Authors**: Shahram Ghandeharizadeh, Sandy Irani, Jenny Lam, Jason Yap

**Updated**: 2024-11-02T13:52:49Z

**Summary**: Cost Adaptive Multi-queue eviction Policy (CAMP) is an algorithm for a general purpose key-value store (KVS) that manages key-value pairs computed by applications with different access patterns, key-value sizes, and varying costs for each key-value pair. CAMP is an approximation of the Greedy Dual Size (GDS) algorithm that can be implemented as efficiently as LRU. In particular, CAMP's eviction policies are as effective as those of GDS but require only a small fraction of the updates to an internal data structure in order to make those decisions. Similar to an implementation of LRU using queues, it adapts to changing workload patterns based on the history of requests for different key-value pairs. It is superior to LRU because it considers both the size and cost of key-value pairs to maximize the utility of the available memory across competing applications. We compare CAMP with both LRU and an alternative that requires human intervention to partition memory into pools and assign grouping of key-value pairs to different pools. The results demonstrate CAMP is as fast as LRU while outperforming both LRU and the pooled alternative. We also present results from an implementation of CAMP using Twitter's version of memcached.

### NEO: Saving GPU Memory Crisis with CPU Offloading for Online LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Xuanlin Jiang, Yang Zhou, Shiyi Cao, Ion Stoica, Minlan Yu

**Updated**: 2024-11-02T05:15:44Z

**Summary**: Online LLM inference powers many exciting applications such as intelligent chatbots and autonomous agents. Modern LLM inference engines widely rely on request batching to improve inference throughput, aiming to make it cost-efficient when running on expensive GPU accelerators. However, the limited GPU memory has largely limited the batch size achieved in practice, leaving significant GPU compute resources wasted.   We present NEO, an online LLM inference system that offloads part of attention compute and KV cache states from the GPU to the local host CPU, effectively increasing the GPU batch size and thus inference throughput. To this end, NEO proposes asymmetric GPU-CPU pipelining and load-aware scheduling to balance GPU and CPU loads and fully utilize their compute and memory resources. We evaluate NEO on a wide range of workloads (i.e., code generation, text summarization), GPUs (i.e., T4, A10G, H100), and LLM models (i.e., 7B, 8B, 70B). NEO achieves up to 7.5$\times$, 26%, and 14% higher throughput compared to GPU-only approach on T4, A10G, and H100 GPUs, respectively, while maintaining the same latency; with more powerful CPUs, NEO achieves up to 79.3% throughput gain on A10G GPU.

### XC-Cache: Cross-Attending to Cached Context for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: João Monteiro, Étienne Marcotte, Pierre-André Noël, Valentina Zantedeschi, David Vázquez, Nicolas Chapados, Christopher Pal, Perouz Taslakian

**Updated**: 2024-11-01T14:56:52Z

**Summary**: In-context learning (ICL) approaches typically leverage prompting to condition decoder-only language model generation on reference information. Just-in-time processing of a context is inefficient due to the quadratic cost of self-attention operations, and caching is desirable. However, caching transformer states can easily require almost as much space as the model parameters. When the right context isn't known in advance, caching ICL can be challenging. This work addresses these limitations by introducing models that, inspired by the encoder-decoder architecture, use cross-attention to condition generation on reference text without the prompt. More precisely, we leverage pre-trained decoder-only models and only train a small number of added layers. We use Question-Answering (QA) as a testbed to evaluate the ability of our models to perform conditional generation and observe that they outperform ICL, are comparable to fine-tuned prompted LLMs, and drastically reduce the space footprint relative to standard KV caching by two orders of magnitude.

### Block Transformer: Global-to-Local Language Modeling for Fast Inference
**Authors**: Namgyu Ho, Sangmin Bae, Taehyeon Kim, Hyunjik Jo, Yireun Kim, Tal Schuster, Adam Fisch, James Thorne, Se-Young Yun

**Updated**: 2024-11-01T08:52:18Z

**Summary**: We introduce the Block Transformer which adopts hierarchical global-to-local modeling to autoregressive transformers to mitigate the inference bottlenecks associated with self-attention. Self-attention requires the key-value (KV) cache of all previous sequences to be retrieved from memory at every decoding step to retrieve context information, leading to two primary bottlenecks during batch inference. First, there is a significant delay in obtaining the first token, as the information of the entire prompt must first be processed to prefill the KV cache. Second, computation of subsequent tokens is bottlenecked by the high memory I/O demand of fetching the entire KV cache, which grows linearly with sequence length, incurring quadratic memory reads overall. We design the Block Transformer to strategically mitigate these costs, by incorporating coarsity and locality into an integrated global-to-local architecture. At the lower layers, we aggregate tokens into fixed size blocks to apply attention across the entire sequence at coarse-grained detail, to capture the global context while minimizing KV cache overhead. At upper layers, we apply attention within each block to decode individual tokens, to model fine-grained details with a lightweight local KV cache. We pretrain vanilla and Block Transformers from scratch and demonstrate that Block Transformers reach 10--20x inference throughput compared to vanilla transformers with equivalent perplexity and zero-shot task performance. Code is available at https://github.com/itsnamgyu/block-transformer.

### Two Dimensional Hidden Surface Removal with Frame-to-frame Coherence
**Authors**: John Whitington

**Updated**: 2024-10-31T18:31:13Z

**Summary**: We describe a hidden surface removal algorithm for two-dimensional layered scenes built from arbitrary primitives, particularly suited to interaction and animation in rich scenes (for example, in illustration). The method makes use of a set-based raster representation to implement a front-to-back rendering model which analyses and dramatically reduces the amount of rasterization and composition required to render a scene. The method is extended to add frame-to-frame coherence analysis and caching for interactive or animated scenes. A powerful system of primitive-combiners called filters is described, which preserves the efficiencies of the algorithm in highly complicated scenes. The set representation is extended to solve the problem of correlated mattes, leading to an efficient solution for high quality antialiasing. A prototype implementation has been prepared.

### Novel Architecture for Distributed Travel Data Integration and Service   Provision Using Microservices
**Authors**: Biman Barua, M. Shamim Kaiser

**Updated**: 2024-10-31T17:41:14Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a microservices architecture for the purpose of enhancing the flexibility and performance of an airline reservation system. The architectural design incorporates Redis cache technologies, two different messaging systems (Kafka and RabbitMQ), two types of storages (MongoDB, and PostgreSQL). It also introduces authorization techniques, including secure communication through OAuth2 and JWT which is essential with the management of high-demand travel services. According to selected indicators, the architecture provides an impressive level of data consistency at 99.5% and a latency of data propagation of less than 75 ms allowing rapid and reliable intercommunication between microservices. A system throughput of 1050 events per second was achieved so that the acceptability level was maintained even during peak time. Redis caching reduced a 92% cache hit ratio on the database thereby lowering the burden on the database and increasing the speed of response. Further improvement of the systems scalability was done through the use of Docker and Kubernetes which enabled services to be expanded horizontally to cope with the changes in demand. The error rates were very low, at 0.2% further enhancing the efficiency of the system in handling real-time data integration. This approach is suggested to meet the specific needs of the airline reservation system. It is secure, fast, scalable, all serving to improve the user experience as well as the efficiency of operations. The low latency and high data integration levels and prevaiing efficient usage of the resources demonstrates the architecture ability to offer continued support in the ever growing high demand situations.

### MemANNS: Enhancing Billion-Scale ANNS Efficiency with Practical PIM   Hardware
**Authors**: Sitian Chen, Amelie Chi Zhou, Yucheng Shi, Yusen Li, Xin Yao

**Updated**: 2024-10-31T10:45:02Z

**Summary**: In numerous production environments, Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays an indispensable role, particularly when dealing with massive datasets that can contain billions of entries. The necessity for rapid response times in these applications makes the efficiency of ANNS algorithms crucial. However, traditional ANNS approaches encounter substantial challenges at the billion-scale level. CPU-based methods are hindered by the limitations of memory bandwidth, while GPU-based methods struggle with memory capacity and resource utilization efficiency. This paper introduces MemANNS, an innovative framework that utilizes UPMEM PIM architecture to address the memory bottlenecks in ANNS algorithms at scale. We concentrate on optimizing a well-known ANNS algorithm, IVFPQ, for PIM hardware through several techniques. First, we introduce an architecture-aware strategy for data placement and query scheduling that ensures an even distribution of workload across PIM chips, thereby maximizing the use of aggregated memory bandwidth. Additionally, we have developed an efficient thread scheduling mechanism that capitalizes on PIM's multi-threading capabilities and enhances memory management to boost cache efficiency. Moreover, we have recognized that real-world datasets often feature vectors with frequently co-occurring items. To address this, we propose a novel encoding method for IVFPQ that minimizes memory accesses during query processing. Our comprehensive evaluation using actual PIM hardware and real-world datasets at the billion-scale, show that MemANNS offers a significant 4.3x increase in QPS over CPU-based Faiss, and it matches the performance of GPU-based Faiss implementations. Additionally, MemANNS improves energy efficiency, with a 2.3x enhancement in QPS/Watt compared to GPU solutions.

### ALISE: Accelerating Large Language Model Serving with Speculative   Scheduling
**Authors**: Youpeng Zhao, Jun Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-31T00:58:11Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a revolutionary advancement in the contemporary landscape of artificial general intelligence (AGI). As exemplified by ChatGPT, LLM-based applications necessitate minimal response latency and maximal throughput for inference serving. However, due to the unpredictability of LLM execution, the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling policy employed by current LLM serving systems suffers from head-of-line (HoL) blocking issues and long job response times.   In this paper, we propose a new efficient LLM inference serving framework, named ALISE. The key design paradigm of ALISE is to leverage a novel speculative scheduler by estimating the execution time for each job and exploiting such prior knowledge to assign appropriate job priority orders, thus minimizing potential queuing delays for heterogeneous workloads. Furthermore, to mitigate the memory overhead of the intermediate key-value (KV) cache, we employ a priority-based adaptive memory management protocol and quantization-based compression techniques. Evaluations demonstrate that in comparison to the state-of-the-art solution vLLM, ALISE improves the throughput of inference serving by up to 1.8x and 2.1x under the same latency constraint on the Alpaca and ShareGPT datasets, respectively.

### Superposed Decoding: Multiple Generations from a Single Autoregressive   Inference Pass
**Authors**: Ethan Shen, Alan Fan, Sarah M. Pratt, Jae Sung Park, Matthew Wallingford, Sham M. Kakade, Ari Holtzman, Ranjay Krishna, Ali Farhadi, Aditya Kusupati

**Updated**: 2024-10-30T21:22:54Z

**Summary**: Many applications today provide users with multiple auto-complete drafts as they type, including GitHub's code completion, Gmail's smart compose, and Apple's messaging auto-suggestions. Under the hood, language models support this by running an autoregressive inference pass to provide a draft. Consequently, providing $k$ drafts to the user requires running an expensive language model $k$ times. To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$ inference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that generates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference pass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token embeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the language model. At every inference step we combine the $k$ drafts with the top-$k$ tokens to get $k^2$ new drafts and cache the $k$ most likely options, using an n-gram interpolation with minimal compute overhead to filter out incoherent generations. Our experiments show that $k$ drafts from Superposed Decoding are at least as coherent and factual as Nucleus Sampling and Greedy Decoding respectively, while being at least $2.44\times$ faster for $k\ge3$. In a compute-normalized setting, user evaluations demonstrably favor text generated by Superposed Decoding over Nucleus Sampling. Superposed Decoding can also be combined with other decoding strategies, resulting in universal coverage gains when scaling inference time compute. Code and more examples open-sourced at https://github.com/RAIVNLab/SuperposedDecoding.

### Attention-Enhanced Prioritized Proximal Policy Optimization for Adaptive   Edge Caching
**Authors**: Farnaz Niknia, Ping Wang, Zixu Wang, Aakash Agarwal, Adib S. Rezaei

**Updated**: 2024-10-30T16:06:21Z

**Summary**: This paper tackles the growing issue of excessive data transmission in networks. With increasing traffic, backhaul links and core networks are under significant traffic, leading to the investigation of caching solutions at edge routers. Many existing studies utilize Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to tackle caching problems, often assuming decision points at fixed intervals; however, real-world environments are characterized by random request arrivals. Additionally, critical file attributes such as lifetime, size, and priority significantly impact the effectiveness of caching policies, yet existing research fails to integrate all these attributes in policy design. In this work, we model the caching problem using a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) to better capture the continuous-time nature of real-world applications, enabling caching decisions to be triggered by random file requests. We then introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)--based caching strategy that fully considers file attributes like lifetime, size, and priority. Simulations show that our method outperforms a recent Deep Reinforcement Learning-based technique. To further advance our research, we improved the convergence rate of PPO by prioritizing transitions within the replay buffer through an attention mechanism. This mechanism evaluates the similarity between the current state and all stored transitions, assigning higher priorities to transitions that exhibit greater similarity.

### BUZZ: Beehive-structured Sparse KV Cache with Segmented Heavy Hitters   for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Junqi Zhao, Zhijin Fang, Shu Li, Shaohui Yang, Shichao He

**Updated**: 2024-10-30T14:53:37Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are essential in natural language processing but often struggle with inference speed and computational efficiency, limiting real-time deployment. The key-value (KV) cache mechanism reduces computational overhead in transformer models, but challenges in maintaining contextual understanding remain. In this paper, we propose BUZZ, a novel KV caching algorithm that leverages structured contextual information to minimize cache memory usage while enhancing inference speed. BUZZ employs a beehive-structured sparse cache, incorporating a sliding window to capture recent information and dynamically segmenting historical tokens into chunks to prioritize important tokens in local neighborhoods. We evaluate BUZZ on four real-world datasets: CNN/Daily Mail, XSUM, Wikitext, and 10-QA. Our results demonstrate that BUZZ (1) reduces cache memory usage by $\textbf{2.5}\times$ in LLM inference while maintaining over 99% accuracy in long-text summarization, and (2) surpasses state-of-the-art performance in multi-document question answering by $\textbf{7.69%}$ under the same memory limit, where full cache methods encounter out-of-memory issues. Additionally, BUZZ achieves significant inference speedup with a $\log{n}$ time complexity. The code is available at https://github.com/JunqiZhao888/buzz-llm.

### Training-Free Exponential Context Extension via Cascading KV Cache
**Authors**: Jeffrey Willette, Heejun Lee, Youngwan Lee, Myeongjae Jeon, Sung Ju Hwang

**Updated**: 2024-10-30T03:31:09Z

**Summary**: The transformer's context window is vital for tasks such as few-shot learning and conditional generation as it preserves previous tokens for active memory. However, as the context lengths increase, the computational costs grow quadratically, hindering the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world, long sequence scenarios. Although some recent key-value caching (KV Cache) methods offer linear inference complexity, they naively manage the stored context, prematurely evicting tokens and losing valuable information. Moreover, they lack an optimized prefill/prompt stage strategy, resulting in higher latency than even quadratic attention for realistic context sizes. In response, we introduce a novel mechanism that leverages cascading sub-cache buffers to selectively retain the most relevant tokens, enabling the model to maintain longer context histories without increasing the cache size. Our approach outperforms linear caching baselines across key benchmarks, including streaming perplexity, question answering, book summarization, and passkey retrieval, where it retains better retrieval accuracy at 1M tokens after four doublings of the cache size of 65K. Additionally, our method reduces prefill stage latency by a factor of 6.8 when compared to flash attention on 1M tokens. These innovations not only enhance the computational efficiency of LLMs but also pave the way for their effective deployment in resource-constrained environments, enabling large-scale, real-time applications with significantly reduced latency.

### WaveRoRA: Wavelet Rotary Route Attention for Multivariate Time Series   Forecasting
**Authors**: Aobo Liang, Yan Sun

**Updated**: 2024-10-30T02:36:55Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Transformer-based models (Transformers) have achieved significant success in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, previous works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the frequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework to model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet domain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the analysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally, the Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic complexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing long-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism: Rotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary position embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence tokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate information from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix, offering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA to capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that WaveRoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining lower computational costs.

### VL-Cache: Sparsity and Modality-Aware KV Cache Compression for   Vision-Language Model Inference Acceleration
**Authors**: Dezhan Tu, Danylo Vashchilenko, Yuzhe Lu, Panpan Xu

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T20:04:34Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a versatile set of tasks. A key challenge in accelerating VLMs is storing and accessing the large Key-Value (KV) cache that encodes long visual contexts, such as images or videos. While existing KV cache compression methods are effective for Large Language Models (LLMs), directly migrating them to VLMs yields suboptimal accuracy and speedup. To bridge the gap, we propose VL-Cache, a novel KV cache compression recipe tailored for accelerating VLM inference. In this paper, we first investigate the unique sparsity pattern of VLM attention by distinguishing visual and text tokens in prefill and decoding phases. Based on these observations, we introduce a layer-adaptive sparsity-aware cache budget allocation method that effectively distributes the limited cache budget across different layers, further reducing KV cache size without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we develop a modality-aware token scoring policy to better evaluate the token importance. Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that retaining only 10% of KV cache achieves accuracy comparable to that with full cache. In a speed benchmark, our method accelerates end-to-end latency of generating 100 tokens by up to 2.33x and speeds up decoding by up to 7.08x, while reducing the memory footprint of KV cache in GPU by 90%.

### Model Tells You What to Discard: Adaptive KV Cache Compression for LLMs
**Authors**: Suyu Ge, Yunan Zhang, Liyuan Liu, Minjia Zhang, Jiawei Han, Jianfeng Gao

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T18:26:09Z

**Summary**: In this study, we introduce adaptive KV cache compression, a plug-and-play method that reduces the memory footprint of generative inference for Large Language Models (LLMs). Different from the conventional KV cache that retains key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss. We will release our code and the compatible CUDA kernel for reproducibility.

### Ripple: Accelerating LLM Inference on Smartphones with Correlation-Aware   Neuron Management
**Authors**: Tuowei Wang, Ruwen Fan, Minxing Huang, Zixu Hao, Kun Li, Ting Cao, Youyou Lu, Yaoxue Zhang, Ju Ren

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T17:33:19Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet deploying them on mobile devices remains an arduous challenge due to their extensive computational and memory demands. While lightweight LLMs have been developed to fit mobile environments, they suffer from degraded model accuracy. In contrast, sparsity-based techniques minimize DRAM usage by selectively transferring only relevant neurons to DRAM while retaining the full model in external storage, such as flash. However, such approaches are critically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with severe IOPS constraints.   In this paper, we propose Ripple, a novel approach that accelerates LLM inference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory. Ripple leverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons frequently activated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access and optimize data transfer efficiency. Our approach incorporates a two-stage solution: an offline stage that reorganizes neuron placement based on co-activation patterns, and an online stage that employs tailored data access and caching strategies to align well with hardware characteristics. Evaluations conducted on a variety of smartphones and LLMs demonstrate that Ripple achieves up to 5.93x improvements in I/O latency compared to the state-of-the-art. As the first solution to optimize storage placement under sparsity, Ripple explores a new optimization space at the intersection of sparsity-driven algorithm and storage-level system co-design in LLM inference.

### Modeling and Monitoring of Indoor Populations using Sparse Positioning   Data (Extension)
**Authors**: Xiao Li, Huan Li, Hua Lu, Christian S. Jensen

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T16:55:23Z

**Summary**: In large venues like shopping malls and airports, knowledge on the indoor populations fuels applications such as business analytics, venue management, and safety control. In this work, we provide means of modeling populations in partitions of indoor space offline and of monitoring indoor populations continuously, by using indoor positioning data. However, the low-sampling rates of indoor positioning render the data temporally and spatially sparse, which in turn renders the offline capture of indoor populations challenging. It is even more challenging to continuously monitor indoor populations, as positioning data may be missing or not ready yet at the current moment. To address these challenges, we first enable probabilistic modeling of populations in indoor space partitions as Normal distributions. Based on that, we propose two learning-based estimators for on-the-fly prediction of population distributions. Leveraging the prediction-based schemes, we provide a unified continuous query processing framework for a type of query that enables continuous monitoring of populated partitions. The framework encompasses caching and result validity mechanisms to reduce cost and maintain monitoring effectiveness. Extensive experiments on two real data sets show that the proposed estimators are able to outperform the state-of-the-art alternatives and that the query processing framework is effective and efficient.

### ProMoE: Fast MoE-based LLM Serving using Proactive Caching
**Authors**: Xiaoniu Song, Zihang Zhong, Rong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T15:31:27Z

**Summary**: The promising applications of large language models are often constrained by the limited GPU memory capacity available on edge devices. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models help mitigate this issue by activating only a subset of the model's parameters during computation, allowing the unused parameters to be offloaded to host memory and reducing overall GPU memory demand. However, existing cache-based offloading solutions handle cache misses reactively and significantly impact system performance. In this paper, we propose ProMoE, a novel proactive caching system that leverages intermediate model results to predict subsequent parameter usage. By proactively fetching experts in advance, ProMoE removes the loading time from the critical path and diminishes the performance overhead of offloading. Our evaluations demonstrate that ProMoE achieves an average speedup of 2.13x and 2.84x in the prefill and decode stages respectively, compared to existing offloading solutions.

### The Impact of Inference Acceleration Strategies on Bias of LLMs
**Authors**: Elisabeth Kirsten, Ivan Habernal, Vedant Nanda, Muhammad Bilal Zafar

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T15:19:13Z

**Summary**: Last few years have seen unprecedented advances in capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These advancements promise to deeply benefit a vast array of application domains. However, due to their immense size, performing inference with LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent work has proposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g., quantization, pruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the inference cost and latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of the predictive performance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we explore another critical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model generations due to inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of metrics, we probe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of outputs before and after inference acceleration shows significant change in bias. Worryingly, these bias effects are complex and unpredictable. A combination of an acceleration strategy and bias type may show little bias change in one model but may lead to a large effect in another. Our results highlight a need for in-depth and case-by-case evaluation of model bias after it has been modified to accelerate inference.

### LoongServe: Efficiently Serving Long-Context Large Language Models with   Elastic Sequence Parallelism
**Authors**: Bingyang Wu, Shengyu Liu, Yinmin Zhong, Peng Sun, Xuanzhe Liu, Xin Jin

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T13:04:42Z

**Summary**: The context window of large language models (LLMs) is rapidly increasing, leading to a huge variance in resource usage between different requests as well as between different phases of the same request. Restricted by static parallelism strategies, existing LLM serving systems cannot efficiently utilize the underlying resources to serve variable-length requests in different phases. To address this problem, we propose a new parallelism paradigm, elastic sequence parallelism (ESP), to elastically adapt to the variance between different requests and phases. Based on ESP, we design and build LoongServe, an LLM serving system that (1) improves computation efficiency by elastically adjusting the degree of parallelism in real-time, (2) improves communication efficiency by reducing key-value cache migration overhead and overlapping partial decoding communication with computation, and (3) improves GPU memory efficiency by reducing key-value cache fragmentation across instances. Our evaluation under diverse real-world datasets shows that LoongServe improves the maximum throughput by up to 3.85$\times$ compared to the chunked prefill and 5.81$\times$ compared to the prefill-decoding disaggregation.

### ASVD: Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition for Compressing   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhihang Yuan, Yuzhang Shang, Yue Song, Qiang Wu, Yan Yan, Guangyu Sun

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T12:28:58Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a new post-training compression paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate their wider adoption. We delve into LLM weight low-rank decomposition, and find that the challenges of this task stem from the distribution variance in the LLM activations and the sensitivity difference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by transforming the weight matrix based on the activation distribution. This transformation allows the outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into the transformed weight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers. In this way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the success of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced. ASVD can further achieve 50% KV cache reductions without performance drop in a training-free manner. Code is anonymously available in supplementary materials.

### Dynamic Content Caching with Waiting Costs via Restless Multi-Armed   Bandits
**Authors**: Ankita Koley, Chandramani Singh

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T12:03:14Z

**Summary**: We consider a system with a local cache connected to a backend server and an end user population. A set of contents are stored at the the server where they continuously get updated. The local cache keeps copies, potentially stale, of a subset of the contents. The users make content requests to the local cache which either can serve the local version if available or can fetch a fresh version or can wait for additional requests before fetching and serving a fresh version. Serving a stale version of a content incurs an age-of-version(AoV) dependent ageing cost, fetching it from the server incurs a fetching cost, and making a request wait incurs a per unit time waiting cost. We focus on the optimal actions subject to the cache capacity constraint at each decision epoch, aiming at minimizing the long term average cost. We pose the problem as a Restless Multi-armed Bandit(RMAB) Problem and propose a Whittle index based policy which is known to be asymptotically optimal. We explicitly characterize the Whittle indices. We numerically evaluate the proposed policy and also compare it to a greedy policy. We show that it is close to the optimal policy and substantially outperforms the greedy policy.

### QuaRot: Outlier-Free 4-Bit Inference in Rotated LLMs
**Authors**: Saleh Ashkboos, Amirkeivan Mohtashami, Maximilian L. Croci, Bo Li, Pashmina Cameron, Martin Jaggi, Dan Alistarh, Torsten Hoefler, James Hensman

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T11:09:12Z

**Summary**: We introduce QuaRot, a new Quantization scheme based on Rotations, which is able to quantize LLMs end-to-end, including all weights, activations, and KV cache in 4 bits. QuaRot rotates LLMs in a way that removes outliers from the hidden state without changing the output, making quantization easier. This computational invariance is applied to the hidden state (residual) of the LLM, as well as to the activations of the feed-forward components, aspects of the attention mechanism, and to the KV cache. The result is a quantized model where all matrix multiplications are performed in 4 bits, without any channels identified for retention in higher precision. Our 4-bit quantized LLaMa2-70B model has losses of at most 0.47 WikiText-2 perplexity and retains 99% of the zero-shot performance. We also show that QuaRot can provide lossless 6 and 8 bit LLaMa2 models without any calibration data using round-to-nearest quantization. Code is available at: https://github.com/spcl/QuaRot.

### Unleashing the Potential of the Diffusion Model in Few-shot Semantic   Segmentation
**Authors**: Muzhi Zhu, Yang Liu, Zekai Luo, Chenchen Jing, Hao Chen, Guangkai Xu, Xinlong Wang, Chunhua Shen

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T04:21:30Z

**Summary**: The Diffusion Model has not only garnered noteworthy achievements in the realm of image generation but has also demonstrated its potential as an effective pretraining method utilizing unlabeled data. Drawing from the extensive potential unveiled by the Diffusion Model in both semantic correspondence and open vocabulary segmentation, our work initiates an investigation into employing the Latent Diffusion Model for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation. Recently, inspired by the in-context learning ability of large language models, Few-shot Semantic Segmentation has evolved into In-context Segmentation tasks, morphing into a crucial element in assessing generalist segmentation models. In this context, we concentrate on Few-shot Semantic Segmentation, establishing a solid foundation for the future development of a Diffusion-based generalist model for segmentation. Our initial focus lies in understanding how to facilitate interaction between the query image and the support image, resulting in the proposal of a KV fusion method within the self-attention framework. Subsequently, we delve deeper into optimizing the infusion of information from the support mask and simultaneously re-evaluating how to provide reasonable supervision from the query mask. Based on our analysis, we establish a simple and effective framework named DiffewS, maximally retaining the original Latent Diffusion Model's generative framework and effectively utilizing the pre-training prior. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the previous SOTA models in multiple settings.

### Symmetric Locality: Definition and Initial Results
**Authors**: Giordan Escalona, Dylan McKellips, Chen Ding

**Updated**: 2024-10-29T02:52:24Z

**Summary**: In this short paper, we characterize symmetric locality. In designing algorithms, compilers, and systems, data movement is a common bottleneck in high-performance computation, in which we improve cache and memory performance. We study a special type of data reuse in the form of repeated traversals, or re-traversals, which are based on the symmetric group. The cyclic and sawtooth traces are previously known results in symmetric locality, and in this work, we would like to generalize this result for any re-traversal. Then, we also provide an abstract framework for applications in compiler design and machine learning models to improve the memory performance of certain programs.

### Not All Heads Matter: A Head-Level KV Cache Compression Method with   Integrated Retrieval and Reasoning
**Authors**: Yu Fu, Zefan Cai, Abedelkadir Asi, Wayne Xiong, Yue Dong, Wen Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-10-28T19:32:23Z

**Summary**: Key-Value (KV) caching is a common technique to enhance the computational efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs), but its memory overhead grows rapidly with input length. Prior work has shown that not all tokens are equally important for text generation, proposing layer-level KV cache compression to selectively retain key information. Recognizing the distinct roles of attention heads in generation, we propose HeadKV, a head-level KV cache compression method, and HeadKV-R2, which leverages a novel contextual reasoning ability estimation for compression. Our approach operates at the level of individual heads, estimating their importance for contextual QA tasks that require both retrieval and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks (LongBench, LooGLE), model architectures (e.g., Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct), and long-context abilities tests demonstrate that our head-level KV cache compression significantly outperforms strong baselines, particularly in low-resource settings (KV size = 64 & 128). Notably, our method retains just 1.5% of the KV cache while achieving 97% of the performance of the full KV cache on the contextual question answering benchmark.

### ShadowKV: KV Cache in Shadows for High-Throughput Long-Context LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Hanshi Sun, Li-Wen Chang, Wenlei Bao, Size Zheng, Ningxin Zheng, Xin Liu, Harry Dong, Yuejie Chi, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-28T19:08:12Z

**Summary**: With the widespread deployment of long-context large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing demand for efficient support of high-throughput inference. However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence length, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each token generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs. While various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up inference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to sufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding latency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a high-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key cache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger batch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV employs an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV pairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks, including RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and Qwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\times$ larger batch sizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\times$ on an A100 GPU without sacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite batch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory. The code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/ShadowKV.

### Online Weighted Paging with Unknown Weights
**Authors**: Orin Levy, Noam Touitou, Aviv Rosenberg

**Updated**: 2024-10-28T17:57:40Z

**Summary**: Online paging is a fundamental problem in the field of online algorithms, in which one maintains a cache of $k$ slots as requests for fetching pages arrive online. In the weighted variant of this problem, each page has its own fetching cost; a substantial line of work on this problem culminated in an (optimal) $O(\log k)$-competitive randomized algorithm, due to Bansal, Buchbinder and Naor (FOCS'07).   Existing work for weighted paging assumes that page weights are known in advance, which is not always the case in practice. For example, in multi-level caching architectures, the expected cost of fetching a memory block is a function of its probability of being in a mid-level cache rather than the main memory. This complex property cannot be predicted in advance; over time, however, one may glean information about page weights through sampling their fetching cost multiple times.   We present the first algorithm for online weighted paging that does not know page weights in advance, but rather learns from weight samples. In terms of techniques, this requires providing (integral) samples to a fractional solver, requiring a delicate interface between this solver and the randomized rounding scheme; we believe that our work can inspire online algorithms to other problems that involve cost sampling.

### Rethinking Programmed I/O for Fast Devices, Cheap Cores, and Coherent   Interconnects
**Authors**: Anastasiia Ruzhanskaia, Pengcheng Xu, David Cock, Timothy Roscoe

**Updated**: 2024-10-28T16:42:11Z

**Summary**: Conventional wisdom holds that an efficient interface between an OS running on a CPU and a high-bandwidth I/O device should be based on Direct Memory Access (DMA), descriptor rings, and interrupts: DMA offloads transfers from the CPU, descriptor rings provide buffering and queuing, and interrupts facilitate asynchronous interaction between cores and device with a lightweight notification mechanism. In this paper we question this wisdom in the light of modern hardware and workloads, particularly in cloud servers. Like others before us, we argue that the assumptions that led to this model are obsolete, and in many use-cases use of Programmed I/O (PIO), where the CPU explicitly transfers data and control information to and from a device via loads and stores, actually results in a more efficient system. However, unlike others to date, we push this idea further and show, in a real implementation, the gains in average and tail latency for fine-grained communication achievable using an open cache-coherence protocol which exposes cache transitions to a smart device. We show this using three use-cases: fine-grained RPC-style invocation of functions on an accelerator, offloading of operators in a streaming dataflow engine, and a network interface targeting for serverless functions, comparing our use of coherence with both traditional DMA-style interaction and a highly-optimized implementation using PIO over PCI Express (PCIe).

### MagicPIG: LSH Sampling for Efficient LLM Generation
**Authors**: Zhuoming Chen, Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Zihao Ye, Yang Zhou, Jianyu Zhang, Niklas Nolte, Yuandong Tian, Matthijs Douze, Leon Bottou, Zhihao Jia, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-28T14:44:22Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with long context windows have gained significant attention. However, the KV cache, stored to avoid re-computation, becomes a bottleneck. Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself suffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention is not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding throughput by $1.9\sim3.9\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 110ms decoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a context of 96k tokens. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/MagicPIG}.

### Skip2-LoRA: A Lightweight On-device DNN Fine-tuning Method for Low-cost   Edge Devices
**Authors**: Hiroki Matsutani, Masaaki Kondo, Kazuki Sunaga, Radu Marculescu

**Updated**: 2024-10-28T14:35:12Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes Skip2-LoRA as a lightweight fine-tuning method for deep neural networks to address the gap between pre-trained and deployed models. In our approach, trainable LoRA (low-rank adaptation) adapters are inserted between the last layer and every other layer to enhance the network expressive power while keeping the backward computation cost low. This architecture is well-suited to cache intermediate computation results of the forward pass and then can skip the forward computation of seen samples as training epochs progress. We implemented the combination of the proposed architecture and cache, denoted as Skip2-LoRA, and tested it on a $15 single board computer. Our results show that Skip2-LoRA reduces the fine-tuning time by 90.0% on average compared to the counterpart that has the same number of trainable parameters while preserving the accuracy, while taking only a few seconds on the microcontroller board.

### Beyond Autoregression: Fast LLMs via Self-Distillation Through Time
**Authors**: Justin Deschenaux, Caglar Gulcehre

**Updated**: 2024-10-28T13:56:30Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive (AR) Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across numerous tasks. However, the AR modeling paradigm presents certain limitations; for instance, contemporary autoregressive LLMs are trained to generate one token at a time, which can result in noticeable latency. Recent advances have indicated that search and repeated sampling can enhance performance in various applications, such as theorem proving, code generation, and alignment, by utilizing greater computational resources during inference. In this study, we demonstrate that diffusion language models are capable of generating at least 32 tokens simultaneously, while exceeding the performance of AR models in text quality and on the LAMBADA natural language understanding benchmark. This outcome is achieved through a novel distillation method for discrete diffusion models, which reduces the number of inference steps by a factor of 32-64. Practically, our models, even without caching, can generate tokens at a rate that is up to 8 times faster than AR models employing KV caching, and we anticipate further improvements with the inclusion of caching. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for diffusion language models with up to 860M parameters.

### SparseTem: Boosting the Efficiency of CNN-Based Video Encoders by   Exploiting Temporal Continuity
**Authors**: Kunyun Wang, Jieru Zhao, Shuo Yang, Wenchao Ding, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-10-28T07:13:25Z

**Summary**: Deep learning models have become pivotal in the field of video processing and is increasingly critical in practical applications such as autonomous driving and object detection. Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated their power, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain a highly efficient and high-performance choice for feature extraction and encoding. However, the intensive computational demands of convolution operations hinder its broader adoption as a video encoder. Given the inherent temporal continuity in video frames, changes between consecutive frames are minimal, allowing for the skipping of redundant computations. This technique, which we term as Diff Computation, presents two primary challenges. First, Diff Computation requires to cache intermediate feature maps to ensure the correctness of non-linear computations, leading to significant memory consumption. Second, the imbalance of sparsity among layers, introduced by Diff Computation, incurs accuracy degradation. To address these issues, we propose a memory-efficient scheduling method to eliminate memory overhead and an online adjustment mechanism to minimize accuracy degradation. We integrate these techniques into our framework, SparseTem, to seamlessly support various CNN-based video encoders. SparseTem achieves speedup of 1.79x for EfficientDet and 4.72x for CRNN, with minimal accuracy drop and no additional memory overhead. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SparseTem sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively utilizing temporal continuity to accelerate CNN-based video encoders.

### Accelerating Transformer Pre-training with 2:4 Sparsity
**Authors**: Yuezhou Hu, Kang Zhao, Weiyu Huang, Jianfei Chen, Jun Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-10-27T14:40:08Z

**Summary**: Training large transformers is slow, but recent innovations on GPU architecture give us an advantage. NVIDIA Ampere GPUs can execute a fine-grained 2:4 sparse matrix multiplication twice as fast as its dense equivalent. In the light of this property, we comprehensively investigate the feasibility of accelerating feed-forward networks (FFNs) of transformers in pre-training. First, we define a ``flip rate'' to monitor the stability of a 2:4 training process. Utilizing this metric, we propose three techniques to preserve accuracy: to modify the sparse-refined straight-through estimator by applying the masked decay term on gradients, to determine a feasible decay factor in warm-up stage, and to enhance the model's quality by a dense fine-tuning procedure near the end of pre-training. Besides, we devise two techniques to practically accelerate training: to calculate transposable 2:4 masks by convolution, and to accelerate gated activation functions by reducing GPU L2 cache miss. Experiments show that our 2:4 sparse training algorithm achieves similar convergence to dense training algorithms on several transformer pre-training tasks, while actual acceleration can be observed on different shapes of transformer block apparently. Our toolkit is available at https://github.com/huyz2023/2by4-pretrain.

### On the I/O Complexity of the CYK Algorithm and of a Family of Related DP   Algorithms
**Authors**: Lorenzo De Stefani, Vedant Gupta

**Updated**: 2024-10-27T04:31:35Z

**Summary**: Asymptotically tight lower bounds are derived for the Input/Output (I/O) complexity of a class of dynamic programming algorithms including matrix chain multiplication, optimal polygon triangulation, and the construction of optimal binary search trees. Assuming no recomputation of intermediate values, we establish an $\Omega\left(\frac{n^3}{\sqrt{M}B}\right)$ I/O lower bound, where $n$ denotes the size of the input and $M$ denotes the size of the available fast memory (cache). When recomputation is allowed, we show the same bound holds for $M < cn$, where $c$ is a positive constant. In the case where $M \ge 2n$, we show an $\Omega\left(n/B\right)$ I/O lower bound. We also discuss algorithms for which the number of executed I/O operations matches asymptotically each of the presented lower bounds, which are thus asymptotically tight.   Additionally, we refine our general method to obtain a lower bound for the I/O complexity of the Cocke-Younger-Kasami algorithm, where the size of the grammar impacts the I/O complexity. An upper bound with asymptotically matching performance in many cases is also provided.

### Resource-Aware Hierarchical Federated Learning in Wireless Video Caching   Networks
**Authors**: Md Ferdous Pervej, Andreas F. Molisch

**Updated**: 2024-10-26T22:19:04Z

**Summary**: Backhaul traffic congestion caused by the video traffic of a few popular files can be alleviated by storing the to-be-requested content at various levels in wireless video caching networks. Typically, content service providers (CSPs) own the content, and the users request their preferred content from the CSPs using their (wireless) internet service providers (ISPs). As these parties do not reveal their private information and business secrets, traditional techniques may not be readily used to predict the dynamic changes in users' future demands. Motivated by this, we propose a novel resource-aware hierarchical federated learning (RawHFL) solution for predicting user's future content requests. A practical data acquisition technique is used that allows the user to update its local training dataset based on its requested content. Besides, since networking and other computational resources are limited, considering that only a subset of the users participate in the model training, we derive the convergence bound of the proposed algorithm. Based on this bound, we minimize a weighted utility function for jointly configuring the controllable parameters to train the RawHFL energy efficiently under practical resource constraints. Our extensive simulation results validate the proposed algorithm's superiority, in terms of test accuracy and energy cost, over existing baselines.

### AdaNeg: Adaptive Negative Proxy Guided OOD Detection with   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Yabin Zhang, Lei Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-26T11:20:02Z

**Summary**: Recent research has shown that pre-trained vision-language models are effective at identifying out-of-distribution (OOD) samples by using negative labels as guidance. However, employing consistent negative labels across different OOD datasets often results in semantic misalignments, as these text labels may not accurately reflect the actual space of OOD images. To overcome this issue, we introduce \textit{adaptive negative proxies}, which are dynamically generated during testing by exploring actual OOD images, to align more closely with the underlying OOD label space and enhance the efficacy of negative proxy guidance. Specifically, our approach utilizes a feature memory bank to selectively cache discriminative features from test images, representing the targeted OOD distribution. This facilitates the creation of proxies that can better align with specific OOD datasets. While task-adaptive proxies average features to reflect the unique characteristics of each dataset, the sample-adaptive proxies weight features based on their similarity to individual test samples, exploring detailed sample-level nuances. The final score for identifying OOD samples integrates static negative labels with our proposed adaptive proxies, effectively combining textual and visual knowledge for enhanced performance. Our method is training-free and annotation-free, and it maintains fast testing speed. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, abbreviated as AdaNeg. Notably, on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark, our AdaNeg significantly outperforms existing methods, with a 2.45\% increase in AUROC and a 6.48\% reduction in FPR95. Codes are available at \url{https://github.com/YBZh/OpenOOD-VLM}.

### Lightweight, Secure and Stateful Serverless Computing with PSL
**Authors**: Alexander Thomas, Shubham Mishra, Kaiyuan Chen, John Kubiatowicz

**Updated**: 2024-10-25T23:17:56Z

**Summary**: We present PSL, a lightweight, secure and stateful Function-as-a-Serivce (FaaS) framework for Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). The framework provides rich programming language support on heterogeneous TEE hardware for statically compiled binaries and/or WebAssembly (WASM) bytecodes, with a familiar Key-Value Store (KVS) interface to secure, performant, network-embedded storage. It achieves near-native execution speeds by utilizing the dynamic memory mapping capabilities of Intel SGX2 to create an in-enclave WASM runtime with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. PSL is designed to efficiently operate within an asynchronous environment with a distributed tamper-proof confidential storage system, assuming minority failures. The system exchanges eventually-consistent state updates across nodes while utilizing release-consistent locking mechanisms to enhance transactional capabilities. The execution of PSL is up to 3.7x faster than the state-of-the-art SGX WASM runtime. PSL reaches 95k ops/s with YCSB 100% read workload and 89k ops/s with 50% read/write workload. We demonstrate the scalability and adaptivity of PSL through a case study of secure and distributed training of deep neural networks.

### LoCoCo: Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression
**Authors**: Ruisi Cai, Yuandong Tian, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-25T21:09:59Z

**Summary**: This paper tackles the memory hurdle of processing long context sequences in Large Language Models (LLMs), by presenting a novel approach, Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression (LoCoCo). LoCoCo employs only a fixed-size Key-Value (KV) cache, and can enhance efficiency in both inference and fine-tuning stages. Diverging from prior methods that selectively drop KV pairs based on heuristics, LoCoCo leverages a data-driven adaptive fusion technique, blending previous KV pairs with incoming tokens to minimize the loss of contextual information and ensure accurate attention modeling. This token integration is achieved through injecting one-dimensional convolutional kernels that dynamically calculate mixing weights for each KV cache slot. Designed for broad compatibility with existing LLM frameworks, LoCoCo allows for straightforward "drop-in" integration without needing architectural modifications, while incurring minimal tuning overhead. Experiments demonstrate that LoCoCo maintains consistently outstanding performance across various context lengths and can achieve a high context compression rate during both inference and fine-tuning phases. During inference, we successfully compressed up to 3482 tokens into a 128-size KV cache, while retaining comparable performance to the full sequence - an accuracy improvement of up to 0.2791 compared to baselines at the same cache size. During post-training tuning, we also effectively extended the context length from 4K to 32K using a KV cache of fixed size 512, achieving performance similar to fine-tuning with entire sequences.

### FutureFill: Fast Generation from Convolutional Sequence Models
**Authors**: Naman Agarwal, Xinyi Chen, Evan Dogariu, Vlad Feinberg, Daniel Suo, Peter Bartlett, Elad Hazan

**Updated**: 2024-10-25T19:45:33Z

**Summary**: We address the challenge of efficient auto-regressive generation in sequence prediction models by introducing FutureFill - a method for fast generation that applies to any sequence prediction algorithm based on convolutional operators. Our approach reduces the generation time requirement from quadratic to quasilinear relative to the context length. Additionally, FutureFill requires a prefill cache sized only by the number of tokens generated, which is smaller than the cache requirements for standard convolutional and attention-based models. We validate our theoretical findings with experimental evidence demonstrating correctness and efficiency gains in a synthetic generation task.

### RobustKV: Defending Large Language Models against Jailbreak Attacks via   KV Eviction
**Authors**: Tanqiu Jiang, Zian Wang, Jiacheng Liang, Changjiang Li, Yuhui Wang, Ting Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-25T19:18:22Z

**Summary**: Jailbreak attacks circumvent LLMs' built-in safeguards by concealing harmful queries within jailbreak prompts. While existing defenses primarily focus on mitigating the effects of jailbreak prompts, they often prove inadequate as jailbreak prompts can take arbitrary, adaptive forms. This paper presents RobustKV, a novel defense that adopts a fundamentally different approach by selectively removing critical tokens of harmful queries from key-value (KV) caches. Intuitively, for a jailbreak prompt to be effective, its tokens must achieve sufficient `importance' (as measured by attention scores), which inevitably lowers the importance of tokens in the concealed harmful query. Thus, by strategically evicting the KVs of the lowest-ranked tokens, RobustKV diminishes the presence of the harmful query in the KV cache, thus preventing the LLM from generating malicious responses. Extensive evaluation using benchmark datasets and models demonstrates that RobustKV effectively counters state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks while maintaining the LLM's general performance on benign queries. Moreover, RobustKV creates an intriguing evasiveness dilemma for adversaries, forcing them to balance between evading RobustKV and bypassing the LLM's built-in safeguards. This trade-off contributes to RobustKV's robustness against adaptive attacks. (warning: this paper contains potentially harmful content generated by LLMs.)

### Fast Inference for Augmented Large Language Models
**Authors**: Rana Shahout, Cong Liang, Shiji Xin, Qianru Lao, Yong Cui, Minlan Yu, Michael Mitzenmacher

**Updated**: 2024-10-25T19:18:00Z

**Summary**: Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance the capabilities of standalone LLMs by integrating external data sources through API calls. In interactive LLM applications, efficient scheduling is crucial for maintaining low request completion times, directly impacting user engagement. However, these augmentations introduce scheduling challenges due to the need to manage limited memory for cached information (KV caches). As a result, traditional size-based scheduling algorithms, such as Shortest Job First (SJF), become less effective at minimizing completion times. Existing work focuses only on handling requests during API calls by preserving, discarding, or swapping memory without considering how to schedule requests with API calls. In this paper, we propose LAMPS, a novel LLM inference framework for augmented LLMs. LAMPS minimizes request completion time through a unified scheduling approach that considers the total length of requests and their handling strategies during API calls. Recognizing that LLM inference is memory-bound, our approach ranks requests based on their consumption of memory over time, which depends on both the output sizes and how a request is managed during its API calls. To implement our scheduling, LAMPS predicts the strategy that minimizes memory waste of a request during its API calls, aligning with but improving upon existing approaches. We also propose starvation prevention techniques and optimizations to mitigate the overhead of our scheduling. We implement LAMPS on top of vLLM and evaluate its performance against baseline LLM inference systems, demonstrating improvements in end-to-end latency by 27%-85% and reductions in TTFT by 4%-96% compared to the existing augmented-LLM system, with even greater gains over vLLM.

### KVQuant: Towards 10 Million Context Length LLM Inference with KV Cache   Quantization
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sehoon Kim, Hiva Mohammadzadeh, Michael W. Mahoney, Yakun Sophia Shao, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2024-10-25T18:29:43Z

**Summary**: LLMs are seeing growing use for applications which require large context windows, and with these large context windows KV cache activations surface as the dominant contributor to memory consumption during inference. Quantization is a promising approach for compressing KV cache activations; however, existing solutions fail to represent activations accurately in sub-4-bit precision. Our work, KVQuant, facilitates low precision KV cache quantization by incorporating several novel methods: (i) Per-Channel Key Quantization, where we adjust the dimension along which we quantize the Key activations to better match the distribution; (ii) Pre-RoPE Key Quantization, where we quantize Key activations before the rotary positional embedding to mitigate its impact on quantization; (iii) Non-Uniform KV Cache Quantization, where we derive per-layer sensitivity-weighted non-uniform datatypes that better represent the distributions; and (iv) Per-Vector Dense-and-Sparse Quantization, where we isolate outliers separately for each vector to minimize skews in quantization ranges. By applying our method to the LLaMA, Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral models, we achieve < 0.1 perplexity degradation with 3-bit quantization on both Wikitext-2 and C4, outperforming existing approaches. Our method enables serving LLaMA-7B with a context length of up to 1 million on a single A100-80GB GPU and up to 10 million on an 8-GPU system. We develop custom CUDA kernels for KVQuant, showing that we can achieve up to ~1.7x speedups, compared to baseline fp16 matrix-vector multiplications, for the LLaMA-7B model.

### FasterCache: Training-Free Video Diffusion Model Acceleration with High   Quality
**Authors**: Zhengyao Lv, Chenyang Si, Junhao Song, Zhenyu Yang, Yu Qiao, Ziwei Liu, Kwan-Yee K. Wong

**Updated**: 2024-10-25T07:24:38Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present \textbf{\textit{FasterCache}}, a novel training-free strategy designed to accelerate the inference of video diffusion models with high-quality generation. By analyzing existing cache-based methods, we observe that \textit{directly reusing adjacent-step features degrades video quality due to the loss of subtle variations}. We further perform a pioneering investigation of the acceleration potential of classifier-free guidance (CFG) and reveal significant redundancy between conditional and unconditional features within the same timestep. Capitalizing on these observations, we introduce FasterCache to substantially accelerate diffusion-based video generation. Our key contributions include a dynamic feature reuse strategy that preserves both feature distinction and temporal continuity, and CFG-Cache which optimizes the reuse of conditional and unconditional outputs to further enhance inference speed without compromising video quality. We empirically evaluate FasterCache on recent video diffusion models. Experimental results show that FasterCache can significantly accelerate video generation (\eg 1.67$\times$ speedup on Vchitect-2.0) while keeping video quality comparable to the baseline, and consistently outperform existing methods in both inference speed and video quality.

### Read-ME: Refactorizing LLMs as Router-Decoupled Mixture of Experts with   System Co-Design
**Authors**: Ruisi Cai, Yeonju Ro, Geon-Woo Kim, Peihao Wang, Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi, Aditya Akella, Zhangyang Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-24T19:48:51Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has led to the adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures that dynamically leverage specialized subnetworks for improved efficiency and performance. Despite their benefits, MoE models face significant challenges during inference, including inefficient memory management and suboptimal batching, due to misaligned design choices between the model architecture and the system policies. Furthermore, the conventional approach of training MoEs from scratch is increasingly prohibitive in terms of cost. In this paper, we propose a novel framework Read-ME that transforms pre-trained dense LLMs into smaller MoE models (in contrast to "upcycling" generalist MoEs), avoiding the high costs of ground-up training. Our approach employs activation sparsity to extract experts. To compose experts, we examine the widely-adopted layer-wise router design and show its redundancy, and thus we introduce the pre-gating router decoupled from the MoE backbone that facilitates system-friendly pre-computing and lookahead scheduling, enhancing expert-aware batching and caching. Our codesign therefore addresses critical gaps on both the algorithmic and system fronts, establishing a scalable and efficient alternative for LLM inference in resource-constrained settings. Read-ME outperforms other popular open-source dense models of similar scales, achieving improvements of up to 10.1% on MMLU, and improving mean end-to-end latency up to 6.1%. Codes are available at: https://github.com/VITA-Group/READ-ME.

### KVSharer: Efficient Inference via Layer-Wise Dissimilar KV Cache Sharing
**Authors**: Yifei Yang, Zouying Cao, Qiguang Chen, Libo Qin, Dongjie Yang, Hai Zhao, Zhi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-24T08:06:41Z

**Summary**: The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly expanded model sizes, resulting in substantial GPU memory requirements during inference. The key and value storage of the attention map in the KV (key-value) cache accounts for more than 80\% of this memory consumption. Nowadays, most existing KV cache compression methods focus on intra-layer compression within a single Transformer layer but few works consider layer-wise compression. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play method called \textit{KVSharer}, which shares the KV cache between layers to achieve layer-wise compression. Rather than intuitively sharing based on higher similarity, we discover a counterintuitive phenomenon: sharing dissimilar KV caches better preserves the model performance. Experiments show that \textit{KVSharer} can reduce KV cache computation by 30\%, thereby lowering memory consumption without significantly impacting model performance and it can also achieve at least 1.3 times generation acceleration. Additionally, we verify that \textit{KVSharer} is compatible with existing intra-layer KV cache compression methods, and combining both can further save memory.

### The Nature of Mathematical Modeling and Probabilistic Optimization   Engineering in Generative AI
**Authors**: Fulu Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-24T05:29:20Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we give an in-depth analysis on the mathematical problem formulations and the probabilistic optimization explorations for some of the key components in Transformer model [33] in the field of generative AI. We explore and discuss some potential further enhancement for current state of the art methods for some key underlying technologies of generative AI models from algorithmic and probabilistic optimization perspective. In particular, we present an optimal solution for sub-word encoding (SWE) based on similar initial settings as that of byte-pair encoding (BPE) algorithm in [9] with similar objectives as that of WordPiece approach in [28, 31] to maximize the likelihood of the training data. We also present cross entropy optimization method to optimize hyperparameters for word2vec model [17]. In addition, we propose a factored combination of rotary positional encoding (RoPE) [32] and attention with linear biases (ALiBi) [23] with a harmonic series. We also present a probabilistic FlashAttention [6, 7] (PrFlashAttention) method with a probability distribution over block distances in the matrix to decide which block is likely to participate in a given round of attention computation while maintaining the lower triangle shape of the tensor for autoregressive language models by re-shaping the tensors. Finally, we present staircase adaptive quantization (SAQ) of key-value (KV) cache for multi-query attention (MQA) based on the framework presented in [16] to have gradual quantization degradation while achieving reasonable model quality and cost savings.

**Authors**: Yuchen Liu, Zhiyuan Peng, Zifan Zhang, Hanzhi Yu, Mingzhe Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-23T16:25:22Z

**Summary**: Digital network twins (DNTs), by representing a physical network using a virtual model, offer significant benefits such as streamlined network development, enhanced productivity, and cost reduction for next-generation (nextG) communication infrastructure. Existing works mainly describe the deployment of DNT technologies in various service sections.The full life cycle of DNTs for telecommunication has not yet been comprehensively studied, particularly in the aspects of fine-grained creation, real-time adaptation, resource-efficient deployment, and security protection. This article presents an in-depth overview of DNTs, exploring their concrete integration into networks and communication, covering the fundamental designs, the emergent applications, and critical challenges in multiple dimensions. We also include two detailed case studies to illustrate how DNTs can be applied in real-world scenarios such as wireless traffic forecasting and edge caching. Additionally, a forward-looking vision of the research opportunities in tackling the challenges of DNTs is provided, aiming to fully maximize the benefits of DNTs in nextG networks.

### Cold Start Latency in Serverless Computing: A Systematic Review,   Taxonomy, and Future Directions
**Authors**: Muhammed Golec, Guneet Kaur Walia, Mohit Kumar, Felix Cuadrado, Sukhpal Singh Gill, Steve Uhlig

**Updated**: 2024-10-23T15:44:09Z

**Summary**: Recently, academics and the corporate sector have paid attention to serverless computing, which enables dynamic scalability and an economic model. In serverless computing, users only pay for the time they actually use resources, enabling zero scaling to optimise cost and resource utilisation. However, this approach also introduces the serverless cold start problem. Researchers have developed various solutions to address the cold start problem, yet it remains an unresolved research area. In this article, we propose a systematic literature review on clod start latency in serverless computing. Furthermore, we create a detailed taxonomy of approaches to cold start latency, which we use to investigate existing techniques for reducing the cold start time and frequency. We have classified the current studies on cold start latency into several categories such as caching and application-level optimisation-based solutions, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)-based solutions. Moreover, we have analyzed the impact of cold start latency on quality of service, explored current cold start latency mitigation methods, datasets, and implementation platforms, and classified them into categories based on their common characteristics and features. Finally, we outline the open challenges and highlight the possible future directions.

### ExpertFlow: Optimized Expert Activation and Token Allocation for   Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Inference
**Authors**: Xin He, Shunkang Zhang, Yuxin Wang, Haiyan Yin, Zihao Zeng, Shaohuai Shi, Zhenheng Tang, Xiaowen Chu, Ivor Tsang, Ong Yew Soon

**Updated**: 2024-10-23T15:24:54Z

**Summary**: Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, while outperforming dense Large Language Models (LLMs) in terms of performance, face significant deployment challenges during inference due to their high memory demands. Existing offloading techniques, which involve swapping activated and idle experts between the GPU and CPU, often suffer from rigid expert caching mechanisms. These mechanisms fail to adapt to dynamic routing, leading to inefficient cache utilization, or incur prohibitive costs for prediction training. To tackle these inference-specific challenges, we introduce ExpertFlow, a comprehensive system specifically designed to enhance inference efficiency by accommodating flexible routing and enabling efficient expert scheduling between CPU and GPU. This reduces overhead and boosts system performance. Central to our approach is a predictive routing path-based offloading mechanism that utilizes a lightweight predictor to accurately forecast routing paths before computation begins. This proactive strategy allows for real-time error correction in expert caching, significantly increasing cache hit ratios and reducing the frequency of expert transfers, thereby minimizing I/O overhead. Additionally, we implement a dynamic token scheduling strategy that optimizes MoE inference by rearranging input tokens across different batches. This method not only reduces the number of activated experts per batch but also improves computational efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpertFlow achieves up to 93.72\% GPU memory savings and enhances inference speed by 2 to 10 times compared to baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and utility as a robust solution for resource-constrained inference scenarios.

### Value Residual Learning For Alleviating Attention Concentration In   Transformers
**Authors**: Zhanchao Zhou, Tianyi Wu, Zhiyun Jiang, Zhenzhong Lan

**Updated**: 2024-10-23T14:15:07Z

**Summary**: Transformers can capture long-range dependencies using self-attention, allowing tokens to attend to all others directly. However, stacking multiple attention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address this issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier layers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is computationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with residual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through adding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all subsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with single layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding from first layer, reducing the KV cache by nearly 50%. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates that ResFormer mitigates attention concentration problem in deeper layers and enhances representation across most layers, outperforming the vanilla Transformer, DenseFormer, and NeuTRENO in training error as well as downstream tasks. SVFormer trains significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer and performs better than other methods like GQA and CLA, with performance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate.

### Full Version: (De/Re)-Composition of Data-Parallel Computations via   Multi-Dimensional Homomorphisms
**Authors**: Ari Rasch

**Updated**: 2024-10-23T10:39:15Z

**Summary**: We formally introduce a systematic (de/re)-composition approach, based on the algebraic formalism of "Multi-Dimensional Homomorphisms (MDHs)". Our approach is designed as general enough to be applicable to a wide range of data-parallel computations and for various kinds of target parallel architectures. To efficiently target the deep and complex memory and core hierarchies of contemporary architectures, we exploit our introduced (de/re)-composition approach for a correct-by-construction, parametrized cache blocking and parallelization strategy. We show that our approach is powerful enough to express, in the same formalism, the (de/re)-composition strategies of different classes of state-of-the-art approaches (scheduling-based, polyhedral, etc), and we demonstrate that the parameters of our strategies enable systematically generating code that can be fully automatically optimized (auto-tuned) for the particular target architecture and characteristics of the input and output data (e.g., their sizes and memory layouts). Particularly, our experiments confirm that via auto-tuning, we achieve higher performance than state-of-the-art approaches, including hand-optimized solutions provided by vendors (such as NVIDIA cuBLAS/cuDNN and Intel oneMKL/oneDNN), on real-world data sets and for a variety of data-parallel computations, including: linear algebra routines, stencil and quantum chemistry computations, data mining algorithms, and computations that recently gained high attention due to their relevance for deep learning.

**Summary**: Chain of Thought (CoT) of multi-step benefits from the logical structure of the reasoning steps and task-specific actions, significantly enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models. As the prevalence of long CoT, the number of reasoning steps exceeds manageable token limits and leads to higher computational demands. Inspired by the fundamental logic of human cognition, ``derive, then reduce'', we conceptualize the standard multi-step CoT as a novel Markov Chain of Thought (MCoT). In this study, we consider the mathematical reasoning task, defining each reasoning step as text accompanied by a Python code snippet. To facilitate a longer reasoning path, self-correction is enabled through interactions with the code interpreter. Our MCoT aims to compress previous reasoning steps into a simplified question, enabling efficient next-step inference without relying on a lengthy KV cache. In our experiments, we curate the \texttt{MCoTInstruct} dataset, and the empirical results indicate that MCoT not only significantly enhances efficiency but also maintains comparable accuracy. While much remains to be explored, this work paves the way for exploring the long CoT reasoning abilities of LLMs.

**Authors**: Ayush RoyChowdhury, Mulong Luo, Prateek Sahu, Sarbartha Banerjee, Mohit Tiwari

**Updated**: 2024-10-23T05:55:31Z

**Summary**: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.   In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.

### Harnessing Your DRAM and SSD for Sustainable and Accessible LLM   Inference with Mixed-Precision and Multi-level Caching
**Authors**: Jie Peng, Zhang Cao, Huaizhi Qu, Zhengyu Zhang, Chang Guo, Yanyong Zhang, Zhichao Cao, Tianlong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-23T01:08:59Z

**Summary**: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, their massive parameter counts and associated extensive computing make LLMs' deployment the main part of carbon emission from nowadays AI applications. Compared to modern GPUs like H$100$, it would be significantly carbon-sustainable if we could leverage old-fashioned GPUs such as M$40$ (as shown in Figure 1, M$40$ only has one third carbon emission of H$100$'s) for LLM servings. However, the limited High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) available on such GPU often cannot support the loading of LLMs due to the gigantic model size and intermediate activation data, making their serving challenging. For instance, a LLaMA2 model with $70$B parameters typically requires $128$GB for inference, which substantially surpasses $24$GB HBM in a $3090$ GPU and remains infeasible even considering the additional $64$GB DRAM. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a mixed-precision with a model modularization algorithm to enable LLM inference on outdated hardware with resource constraints. (The precision denotes the numerical precision like FP16, INT8, INT4) and multi-level caching (M2Cache).)   Specifically, our M2Cache first modulizes neurons in LLM and creates their importance ranking. Then, it adopts a dynamic sparse mixed-precision quantization mechanism in weight space to reduce computational demands and communication overhead at each decoding step. It collectively lowers the operational carbon emissions associated with LLM inference. Moreover, M2Cache introduces a three-level cache management system with HBM, DRAM, and SSDs that complements the dynamic sparse mixed-precision inference. To enhance communication efficiency, M2Cache maintains a neuron-level mixed-precision LRU cache in HBM, a larger layer-aware cache in DRAM, and a full model in SSD.

**Authors**: Huawei Lin, Jikai Long, Zhaozhuo Xu, Weijie Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-10-22T19:07:08Z

**Summary**: Given a Large Language Model (LLM) generation, how can we identify which training data led to this generation? In this paper, we proposed RapidIn, a scalable framework adapting to LLMs for estimating the influence of each training data. The proposed framework consists of two stages: caching and retrieval. First, we compress the gradient vectors by over 200,000x, allowing them to be cached on disk or in GPU/CPU memory. Then, given a generation, RapidIn efficiently traverses the cached gradients to estimate the influence within minutes, achieving over a 6,326x speedup. Moreover, RapidIn supports multi-GPU parallelization to substantially accelerate caching and retrieval. Our empirical result confirms the efficiency and effectiveness of RapidIn.

**Authors**: Md Tahmidul Alam, Swarnav Mukhopadhyay, Md Mobinul Haque, Shubhra S. Pasayat, Chirag Gupta

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T17:23:03Z

**Summary**: More than 3 kV breakdown voltage was demonstrated in monolithic bidirectional GaN HEMTs for the first time having potential applications in 1200V or 1700V-class novel power converters. The on resistance of the fabricated transistors was ~20 ohm.mm or ~11 mili ohm.cm^2. Breakdown voltage was optimized by utilizing two field plates in either side of the transistor and optimizing their geometry. Shorter first field plate lengths (less than 2 micron) resulted in higher breakdown voltage and the possible reason for this was discussed. The transistors had a steep subthreshold swing of 92 mV / dec. The on/off ratio was greater than 10^5 and it was limited by the tool capacity. The fabricated 3 kV transistor was benchmarked against the state-of-the-art monolithic bidirectional GaN HEMTs in the performance matrices of breakdown voltage and on resistance, that showed crucial progress.

### Do Large Language Models Need a Content Delivery Network?
**Authors**: Yihua Cheng, Kuntai Du, Jiayi Yao, Junchen Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T15:59:18Z

**Summary**: As the use of large language models (LLMs) expands rapidly, so does the range of knowledge needed to supplement various LLM queries. Thus, enabling flexible and efficient injection of new knowledge in LLM inference is critical. Three high-level options exist: (i) embedding the knowledge in LLM's weights (i.e., fine-tuning), (ii) including the knowledge as a part of LLM's text input (i.e., in-context learning), or (iii) injecting the KV caches of the new knowledge to LLM during prefill. This paper argues that, although fine-tuning and in-context learning are popular, using KV caches as the medium of knowledge could simultaneously enable more modular management of knowledge injection and more efficient LLM serving with low cost and fast response. To realize these benefits, we envision a Knowledge Delivery Network (KDN), a new system component in LLM services that dynamically optimizes the storage, transfer, and composition of KV cache across LLM engines and other compute and storage resources. We believe that, just like content delivery networks (CDNs), such as Akamai, enabled the success of the Internet ecosystem through their efficient data delivery, KDNs will be critical to the success of LLM applications through their efficient knowledge delivery. We have open-sourced a KDN prototype at https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

### Formalising CXL Cache Coherence
**Authors**: Chengsong Tan, Alastair F. Donaldson, John Wickerson

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T11:29:49Z

**Summary**: We report our experience formally modelling and verifying CXL.cache, the inter-device cache coherence protocol of the Compute Express Link standard. We have used the Isabelle proof assistant to create a formal model for CXL.cache based on the prose English specification. This led to us identifying and proposing fixes to several problems we identified as unclear, ambiguous or inaccurate, some of which could lead to incoherence if left unfixed. Nearly all our issues and proposed fixes have been confirmed and tentatively accepted by the CXL consortium for adoption, save for one which is still under discussion. To validate the faithfulness of our model we performed scenario verification of essential restrictions such as "Snoop-pushes-GO", and produced a fully mechanised proof of a coherence property of the model. The considerable size of this proof, comprising tens of thousands of lemmas, prompted us to develop new proof automation tools, which we have made available for other Isabelle users working with similarly cumbersome proofs.

### Secure Collaborative Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation in   Cache-Assisted Ultra-Dense IoT Networks With Multi-Slope Channels
**Authors**: Tianqing Zhou, Bobo Wang, Dong Qin, Xuefang Nie, Nan Jiang, Chunguo Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T07:24:53Z

**Summary**: Cache-assisted ultra-dense mobile edge computing (MEC) networks are a promising solution for meeting the increasing demands of numerous Internet-of-Things mobile devices (IMDs). To address the complex interferences caused by small base stations (SBSs) deployed densely in such networks, this paper explores the combination of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and base station (BS) clustering. Additionally, security measures are introduced to protect IMDs' tasks offloaded to BSs from potential eavesdropping and malicious attacks. As for such a network framework, a computation offloading scheme is proposed to minimize IMDs' energy consumption while considering constraints such as delay, power, computing resources, and security costs, optimizing channel selections, task execution decisions, device associations, power controls, security service assignments, and computing resource allocations. To solve the formulated problem efficiently, we develop a further improved hierarchical adaptive search (FIHAS) algorithm, giving some insights into its parallel implementation, computation complexity, and convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can achieve lower total energy consumption and delay compared to other algorithms when strict latency and cost constraints are imposed.

### Residual vector quantization for KV cache compression in large language   model
**Authors**: Ankur Kumar

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T07:20:41Z

**Summary**: KV cache compression methods have mainly relied on scalar quantization techniques to reduce the memory requirements during decoding. In this work, we apply residual vector quantization, which has been widely used for high fidelity audio compression, to compress KV cache in large language models (LLM). We adapt the standard recipe with minimal changes to compress the output of any key or value projection matrix in a pretrained LLM: we scale the vector by its standard deviation, divide channels into groups and then quantize each group with the same residual vector quantizer. We learn the codebook using exponential moving average and there are no other learnable parameters including the input and output projections normally used in a vector quantization set up. We find that a residual depth of 8 recovers most of the performance of the unquantized model. We also find that grouping non-contiguous channels together works better than grouping contiguous channels for compressing key matrix and the method further benefits from a light weight finetuning of LLM together with the quantization. Overall, the proposed technique is competitive with existing quantization methods while being much simpler and results in 5.5x compression compared to half precision.

### AlignedKV: Reducing Memory Access of KV-Cache with Precision-Aligned   Quantization
**Authors**: Yifan Tan, Haoze Wang, Chao Yan, Yangdong Deng

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T05:06:01Z

**Summary**: Model quantization has become a crucial technique to address the issues of large memory consumption and long inference times associated with LLMs. Mixed-precision quantization, which distinguishes between important and unimportant parameters, stands out among numerous quantization schemes as it achieves a balance between precision and compression rate. However, existing approaches can only identify important parameters through qualitative analysis and manual experiments without quantitatively analyzing how their importance is determined. We propose a new criterion, so-called 'precision alignment', to build a quantitative framework to holistically evaluate the importance of parameters in mixed-precision quantization. Our observations on floating point addition under various real-world scenarios suggest that two addends should have identical precision, otherwise the information in the higher-precision number will be wasted. Such an observation offers an essential principle to determine the precision of each parameter in matrix multiplication operation. As the first step towards applying the above discovery to large model inference, we develop a dynamic KV-Cache quantization technique to effectively reduce memory access latency. Different from existing quantization approaches that focus on memory saving, this work directly aims to accelerate LLM inference through quantifying floating numbers. The proposed technique attains a 25% saving of memory access and delivers up to 1.3x speedup in the computation of attention in the decoding phase of LLM, with almost no loss of precision.

### WarmSwap: Sharing Dependencies for Accelerating Cold Starts in   Serverless Functions
**Authors**: Rui Li, Devesh Tiwari, Gene Cooperman

**Updated**: 2024-10-21T02:35:08Z

**Summary**: This work presents WarmSwap, a novel provider-side cold-start optimization for serverless computing. This optimization reduces cold-start time when booting and loading dependencies at runtime inside a function container. Previous approaches to the optimization of cold starts tend to fall into two categories: optimizing the infrastructure of serverless computing to benefit all serverless functions; or function-specific tuning for individual serverless functions. In contrast, WarmSwap offers a broad middle ground, which optimizes entire categories of serverless functions. WarmSwap eliminates the need to initialize middleware or software dependencies when launching a new serverless container, by migrating a pre-initialized live dependency image to the new function instance. WarmSwap respects the provider's cache constraints, as a single pre-warmed dependency image in the cache is shared among all serverless functions requiring that software dependency image. WarmSwap has been tested on seven representative functions from FunctionBench. In those tests, WarmSwap accelerates dependency loading for serverless functions with large dependency requirements by a factor ranging from 2.2 to 3.2. Simulation experiments using Azure traces indicate that WarmSwap can save 88\% of optimization space when sharing a dependency image among ten different functions.

### LLC Intra-set Write Balancing
**Authors**: Keshav Krishna, Ayush Verma

**Updated**: 2024-10-20T09:37:07Z

**Summary**: The increasing use of Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) in computer architecture has brought about new challenges, one of which is the write endurance problem. Frequent writes to a particular cache cell in NVM can lead to degradation of the memory cell and reduce its lifespan. To solve this problem, we propose a sample-based blocking technique for the Last Level Cache (LLC). Our approach involves defining a threshold value and sampling a subset of cache sets. If the number of writes to a way in a sampled set exceeds the threshold, the way is blocked, and writes are redirected to other ways. We also maintain a history structure to record the number of writes in a set and a PC-Table to use for blocking in unsampled sets. Based on blocking on sampled sets, variance of values stored in history is used to determine whether blocking had a positive impact or not, and on this basis, value corresponding to instruction pointer is incremented or decremented. This value is later used for blocking in unsampled sets. Our results show that our approach significantly balances write traffic to the cache and improves the overall lifespan of the memory cells while having better performance to the base-line system. Our approach can also be applied to other cache hierarchies and NVM technologies to mitigate the problem of write endurance.

### EPIC: Efficient Position-Independent Context Caching for Serving Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Junhao Hu, Wenrui Huang, Haoyi Wang, Weidong Wang, Tiancheng Hu, Qin Zhang, Hao Feng, Xusheng Chen, Yizhou Shan, Tao Xie

**Updated**: 2024-10-20T08:42:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are critical for a wide range of applications, but serving them efficiently becomes increasingly challenging as inputs become more complex. Context caching improves serving performance by exploiting inter-request dependency and reusing key-value (KV) cache across requests, thus improving time-to-first-token (TTFT). However, existing prefix-based context caching requires exact token prefix matches, limiting cache reuse in few-shot learning, multi-document QA, or retrieval-augmented generation, where prefixes may vary. In this paper, we present EPIC, an LLM serving system that introduces position-independent context caching (PIC), enabling modular KV cache reuse regardless of token chunk position (or prefix). EPIC features two key designs: AttnLink, which leverages static attention sparsity to minimize recomputation for accuracy recovery, and KVSplit, a customizable chunking method that preserves semantic coherence. Our experiments demonstrate that Epic delivers up to 8x improvements in TTFT and 7x throughput over existing systems, with negligible or no accuracy loss. By addressing the limitations of traditional caching approaches, Epic enables more scalable and efficient LLM inference.

### Lossless KV Cache Compression to 2%
**Authors**: Zhen Yang, J. N. Han, Kan Wu, Ruobing Xie, An Wang, Xingwu Sun, Zhanhui Kang

**Updated**: 2024-10-20T02:17:35Z

**Summary**: Large language models have revolutionized data processing in numerous domains, with their ability to handle extended context reasoning receiving notable recognition. To speed up inference, maintaining a key-value (KV) cache memory is essential. Nonetheless, the growing demands for KV cache memory create significant hurdles for efficient implementation. This work introduces a novel architecture, Cross-Layer Latent Attention (CLLA), aimed at compressing the KV cache to less than 2% of its original size while maintaining comparable performance levels. CLLA integrates multiple aspects of KV cache compression, including attention head/dimension reduction, layer sharing, and quantization techniques, into a cohesive framework. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CLLA achieves lossless performance on most tasks while utilizing minimal KV cache, marking a significant advancement in practical KV cache compression.

### Online Paging with Heterogeneous Cache Slots
**Authors**: Marek Chrobak, Samuel Haney, Mehraneh Liaee, Debmalya Panigrahi, Rajmohan Rajaraman, Ravi Sundaram, Neal E. Young

**Updated**: 2024-10-19T12:15:50Z

**Summary**: It is natural to generalize the online $k$-Server problem by allowing each request to specify not only a point $p$, but also a subset $S$ of servers that may serve it. For uniform metrics, the problem is equivalent to a generalization of Paging in which each request specifies not only a page $p$, but also a subset $S$ of cache slots, and is satisfied by having a copy of $p$ in some slot in $S$. We call this problem Slot-Heterogenous Paging.   We parameterize the problem by specifying a family $\mathcal S \subseteq 2^{[k]}$ of requestable slot sets, and we establish bounds on the competitive ratio as a function of the cache size $k$ and family $\mathcal S$:   - If all request sets are allowed ($\mathcal S=2^{[k]}\setminus\{\emptyset\}$), the optimal deterministic and randomized competitive ratios are exponentially worse than for standard \Paging ($\mathcal S=\{[k]\}$).   - As a function of $|\mathcal S|$ and $k$, the optimal deterministic ratio is polynomial: at most $O(k^2|\mathcal S|)$ and at least $\Omega(\sqrt{|\mathcal S|})$.   - For any laminar family $\mathcal S$ of height $h$, the optimal ratios are $O(hk)$ (deterministic) and $O(h^2\log k)$ (randomized).   - The special case of laminar $\mathcal S$ that we call All-or-One Paging extends standard Paging by allowing each request to specify a specific slot to put the requested page in. The optimal deterministic ratio for weighted All-or-One Paging is $\Theta(k)$. Offline All-or-One Paging is NP-hard.   Some results for the laminar case are shown via a reduction to the generalization of Paging in which each request specifies a set $\mathcal P of pages, and is satisfied by fetching any page from $\mathcal P into the cache. The optimal ratios for the latter problem (with laminar family of height $h$) are at most $hk$ (deterministic) and $h\,H_k$ (randomized).

### In-context KV-Cache Eviction for LLMs via Attention-Gate
**Authors**: Zihao Zeng, Bokai Lin, Tianqi Hou, Hao Zhang, Zhijie Deng

**Updated**: 2024-10-19T08:45:11Z

**Summary**: The KV-Cache technique has become the standard for the inference of large language models (LLMs). It caches states of self-attention to avoid recomputation. Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a bottleneck of the LLM inference system, especially when confronted with ultra-large models and long-context queries. A natural remedy is to discard the KV-Cache for less important tokens, with StreamingLLM as an example, but the used static eviction strategies cannot flexibly adapt to varying contexts. Remedies like H2O leverage accumulative attention scores to perform dynamic eviction but suffer from the attention bias issue in capturing contextual information. This paper bridges this gap by devising a parameterized KV-Cache eviction mechanism, dubbed as Attention-Gate, which accepts the whole context as input and yields eviction flags for each token to realize in-context eviction. The subsequent self-attention module proceeds according to the flags and only the KV states for the remaining tokens need to be cached. The Attention-Gates can vary among different heads and layers and be trivially plugged into pre-trained LLMs, tuned by cost-effective continual pre-training or supervised fine-tuning objectives to acquire what to discard. The computational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates is minimal. Our method is validated across multiple tasks, demonstrating both efficiency and adaptability. After a highly efficient continual pre-training, it achieves higher average accuracy and evicts more tokens compared to traditional training-free methods. In supervised fine-tuning, it not only evicts many tokens but also outperforms LoRA-finetuned LLMs on some datasets, such as RTE, where it improves accuracy by 13.9% while evicting 62.8% of tokens, showing that effective eviction of redundant tokens can even enhance performance.

### CSKV: Training-Efficient Channel Shrinking for KV Cache in Long-Context   Scenarios
**Authors**: Luning Wang, Shiyao Li, Xuefei Ning, Zhihang Yuan, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Yu Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-18T19:30:35Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to process long-context tasks. However, the large memory overhead of the key-value (KV) cache poses significant challenges in long-context scenarios. Existing training-free KV cache compression methods typically focus on quantization and token pruning, which have compression limits, and excessive sparsity can lead to severe performance degradation. Other methods design new architectures with less KV overhead but require significant training overhead. To address the above two drawbacks, we further explore the redundancy in the channel dimension and apply an architecture-level design with minor training costs. Therefore, we introduce CSKV, a training-efficient Channel Shrinking technique for KV cache compression: (1) We first analyze the singular value distribution of the KV cache, revealing significant redundancy and compression potential along the channel dimension. Based on this observation, we propose using low-rank decomposition for key and value layers and storing the low-dimension features. (2) To preserve model performance, we introduce a bi-branch KV cache, including a window-based full-precision KV cache and a low-precision compressed KV cache. (3) To reduce the training costs, we minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss for the compressed KV cache instead of retraining the entire LLMs. Extensive experiments show that CSKV can reduce the memory overhead of the KV cache by 80% while maintaining the model's long-context capability. Moreover, we show that our method can be seamlessly combined with quantization to further reduce the memory overhead, achieving a compression ratio of up to 95%.

### Improving Retrieval in Sponsored Search by Leveraging Query Context   Signals
**Authors**: Akash Kumar Mohankumar, Gururaj K, Gagan Madan, Amit Singh

**Updated**: 2024-10-18T13:59:54Z

**Summary**: Accurately retrieving relevant bid keywords for user queries is critical in Sponsored Search but remains challenging, particularly for short, ambiguous queries. Existing dense and generative retrieval models often fail to capture nuanced user intent in these cases. To address this, we propose an approach to enhance query understanding by augmenting queries with rich contextual signals derived from web search results and large language models, stored in an online cache. Specifically, we use web search titles and snippets to ground queries in real-world information and utilize GPT-4 to generate query rewrites and explanations that clarify user intent. These signals are efficiently integrated through a Fusion-in-Decoder based Unity architecture, enabling both dense and generative retrieval with serving costs on par with traditional context-free models. To address scenarios where context is unavailable in the cache, we introduce context glancing, a curriculum learning strategy that improves model robustness and performance even without contextual signals during inference. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that our context-aware approach substantially outperforms context-free models. Furthermore, online A/B testing on a prominent search engine across 160+ countries shows significant improvements in user engagement and revenue.

### A Systematic Study of Cross-Layer KV Sharing for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: You Wu, Haoyi Wu, Kewei Tu

**Updated**: 2024-10-18T13:01:14Z

**Summary**: Recently, sharing key-value (KV) cache across layers has been found effective in efficient inference of large language models (LLMs). To systematically investigate different techniques of cross-layer KV sharing, we propose a unified framework that covers several recent methods and their novel variants. We conduct comprehensive experiments on all the configurations of the framework, evaluating their generation throughput and performance in language modeling and downstream tasks. We find that when reducing the size of the KV cache by 2x, most configurations can achieve competitive performance to and higher throughput than standard transformers, but when further reducing the size of the KV cache, pairing queries of all layers with KVs of upper layers can better maintain performance, although it also introduces additional training cost and prefilling latency. We hope that this work will help users choose the appropriate approach according to their requirements and facilitate research on the acceleration of LLM inference.

### FAME: Towards Factual Multi-Task Model Editing
**Authors**: Li Zeng, Yingyu Shan, Zeming Liu, Jiashu Yao, Yuhang Guo

**Updated**: 2024-10-18T10:02:03Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) embed extensive knowledge and utilize it to perform exceptionally well across various tasks. Nevertheless, outdated knowledge or factual errors within LLMs can lead to misleading or incorrect responses, causing significant issues in practical applications. To rectify the fatal flaw without the necessity for costly model retraining, various model editing approaches have been proposed to correct inaccurate knowledge within LLMs in a cost-efficient way. To evaluate these model editing methods, previous work introduced a series of datasets. However, most of the previous datasets only contain fabricated data in a single format, which diverges from real-world model editing scenarios, raising doubts about their usability in practice. To facilitate the application of model editing in real-world scenarios, we propose the challenge of practicality. To resolve such challenges and effectively enhance the capabilities of LLMs, we present FAME, an factual, comprehensive, and multi-task dataset, which is designed to enhance the practicality of model editing. We then propose SKEME, a model editing method that uses a novel caching mechanism to ensure synchronization with the real world. The experiments demonstrate that SKEME performs excellently across various tasks and scenarios, confirming its practicality.

### Per-Bank Bandwidth Regulation of Shared Last-Level Cache for Real-Time   Systems
**Authors**: Connor Sullivan, Alex Manley, Mohammad Alian, Heechul Yun

**Updated**: 2024-10-17T20:11:34Z

**Summary**: Modern commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) multicore processors have advanced memory hierarchies that enhance memory-level parallelism (MLP), which is crucial for high performance. To support high MLP, shared last-level caches (LLCs) are divided into multiple banks, allowing parallel access. However, uneven distribution of cache requests from the cores, especially when requests from multiple cores are concentrated on a single bank, can result in significant contention affecting all cores that access the cache. Such cache bank contention can even be maliciously induced -- known as cache bank-aware denial-of-service (DoS) attacks -- in order to jeopardize the system's timing predictability.   In this paper, we propose a per-bank bandwidth regulation approach for multi-banked shared LLC based multicore real-time systems. By regulating bandwidth on a per-bank basis, the approach aims to prevent unnecessary throttling of cache accesses to non-contended banks, thus improving overall performance (throughput) without compromising isolation benefits of throttling. We implement our approach on a RISC-V system-on-chip (SoC) platform using FireSim and evaluate extensively using both synthetic and real-world workloads. Our evaluation results show that the proposed per-bank regulation approach effectively protects real-time tasks from co-running cache bank-aware DoS attacks, and offers up to a 3.66$\times$ performance improvement for the throttled benign best-effort tasks compared to prior bank-oblivious bandwidth throttling approaches.

## Keyword: LLM Inference 
 ### Recycled Attention: Efficient inference for long-context language models
**Authors**: Fangyuan Xu, Tanya Goyal, Eunsol Choi

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:57:07Z

**Summary**: Generating long sequences of tokens given a long-context input imposes a heavy computational burden for large language models (LLMs). One of the computational bottleneck comes from computing attention over a long sequence of input at each generation step. In this paper, we propose Recycled Attention, an inference-time method which alternates between full context attention and attention over a subset of input tokens. When performing partial attention, we recycle the attention pattern of a previous token that has performed full attention and attend only to the top K most attended tokens, reducing the cost of data movement and attention computation. Compared to previously proposed inference-time acceleration method which attends only to local context or tokens with high accumulative attention scores, our approach flexibly chooses tokens that are relevant to the current decoding step. We evaluate our methods on RULER, a suite of tasks designed to comprehensively evaluate long-context abilities, and long-context language modeling tasks. Applying our method to off-the-shelf LLMs achieves comparable speedup to baselines which only consider local context while improving the performance by 2x. We further explore two ideas to improve performance-efficiency trade-offs: (1) dynamically decide when to perform recycled or full attention step based on the query similarities and (2) continued pre-training the model with Recycled Attention.

### Is ChatGPT Transforming Academics' Writing Style?
**Authors**: Mingmeng Geng, Roberto Trotta

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:56:42Z

**Summary**: Based on one million arXiv papers submitted from May 2018 to January 2024, we assess the textual density of ChatGPT's writing style in their abstracts through a statistical analysis of word frequency changes. Our model is calibrated and validated on a mixture of real abstracts and ChatGPT-modified abstracts (simulated data) after a careful noise analysis. The words used for estimation are not fixed but adaptive, including those with decreasing frequency. We find that large language models (LLMs), represented by ChatGPT, are having an increasing impact on arXiv abstracts, especially in the field of computer science, where the fraction of LLM-style abstracts is estimated to be approximately 35%, if we take the responses of GPT-3.5 to one simple prompt, "revise the following sentences", as a baseline. We conclude with an analysis of both positive and negative aspects of the penetration of LLMs into academics' writing style.

### Logits of API-Protected LLMs Leak Proprietary Information
**Authors**: Matthew Finlayson, Xiang Ren, Swabha Swayamdipta

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:56:41Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) providers often hide the architectural details and parameters of their proprietary models by restricting public access to a limited API. In this work we show that, with only a conservative assumption about the model architecture, it is possible to learn a surprisingly large amount of non-public information about an API-protected LLM from a relatively small number of API queries (e.g., costing under $1000 USD for OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo). Our findings are centered on one key observation: most modern LLMs suffer from a softmax bottleneck, which restricts the model outputs to a linear subspace of the full output space. We exploit this fact to unlock several capabilities, including (but not limited to) obtaining cheap full-vocabulary outputs, auditing for specific types of model updates, identifying the source LLM given a single full LLM output, and even efficiently discovering the LLM's hidden size. Our empirical investigations show the effectiveness of our methods, which allow us to estimate the embedding size of OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo to be about 4096. Lastly, we discuss ways that LLM providers can guard against these attacks, as well as how these capabilities can be viewed as a feature (rather than a bug) by allowing for greater transparency and accountability.

### Using Language Models to Disambiguate Lexical Choices in Translation
**Authors**: Josh Barua, Sanjay Subramanian, Kayo Yin, Alane Suhr

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:48:57Z

**Summary**: In translation, a concept represented by a single word in a source language can have multiple variations in a target language. The task of lexical selection requires using context to identify which variation is most appropriate for a source text. We work with native speakers of nine languages to create DTAiLS, a dataset of 1,377 sentence pairs that exhibit cross-lingual concept variation when translating from English. We evaluate recent LLMs and neural machine translation systems on DTAiLS, with the best-performing model, GPT-4, achieving from 67 to 85% accuracy across languages. Finally, we use language models to generate English rules describing target-language concept variations. Providing weaker models with high-quality lexical rules improves accuracy substantially, in some cases reaching or outperforming GPT-4.

### LLMs as Method Actors: A Model for Prompt Engineering and Architecture
**Authors**: Colin Doyle

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:45:06Z

**Summary**: We introduce "Method Actors" as a mental model for guiding LLM prompt engineering and prompt architecture. Under this mental model, LLMs should be thought of as actors; prompts as scripts and cues; and LLM responses as performances. We apply this mental model to the task of improving LLM performance at playing Connections, a New York Times word puzzle game that prior research identified as a challenging benchmark for evaluating LLM reasoning. Our experiments with GPT-4o show that a "Method Actors" approach can significantly improve LLM performance over both a vanilla and "Chain of Thoughts" approach. A vanilla approach solves 27% of Connections puzzles in our dataset and a "Chain of Thoughts" approach solves 41% of puzzles, whereas our strongest "Method Actor" approach solves 86% of puzzles. We also test OpenAI's newest model designed specifically for complex reasoning tasks, o1-preview. When asked to solve a puzzle all at once, o1-preview solves 79% of Connections puzzles in our dataset, and when allowed to build puzzle solutions one guess at a time over multiple API calls, o1-preview solves 100% of the puzzles. Incorporating a "Method Actor" prompt architecture increases the percentage of puzzles that o1-preview solves perfectly from 76% to 87%.

### Quantitative Assessment of Intersectional Empathetic Bias and   Understanding
**Authors**: Vojtech Formanek, Ondrej Sotolar

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:43:15Z

**Summary**: A growing amount of literature critiques the current operationalizations of empathy based on loose definitions of the construct. Such definitions negatively affect dataset quality, model robustness, and evaluation reliability. We propose an empathy evaluation framework that operationalizes empathy close to its psychological origins. The framework measures the variance in responses of LLMs to prompts using existing metrics for empathy and emotional valence. The variance is introduced through the controlled generation of the prompts by varying social biases affecting context understanding, thus impacting empathetic understanding. The control over generation ensures high theoretical validity of the constructs in the prompt dataset. Also, it makes high-quality translation, especially into languages that currently have little-to-no way of evaluating empathy or bias, such as the Slavonic family, more manageable. Using chosen LLMs and various prompt types, we demonstrate the empathy evaluation with the framework, including multiple-choice answers and free generation. The variance in our initial evaluation sample is small and we were unable to measure convincing differences between the empathetic understanding in contexts given by different social groups. However, the results are promising because the models showed significant alterations their reasoning chains needed to capture the relatively subtle changes in the prompts. This provides the basis for future research into the construction of the evaluation sample and statistical methods for measuring the results.

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:40:34Z

**Summary**: We report the results of a spectroscopic survey of candidate T subdwarfs identified by the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 program. Near-infrared spectra of 31 sources with red $J-W2$ colors and large $J$-band reduced proper motions show varying signatures of subsolar metallicity, including strong collision-induced H$_2$ absorption, obscured methane and water features, and weak K I absorption. These metallicity signatures are supported by spectral model fits and 3D velocities, indicating thick disk and halo population membership for several sources. We identify three new metal-poor T subdwarfs ([M/H] $\lesssim$ $-$0.5), CWISE J062316.19+071505.6, WISEA J152443.14$-$262001.8, and CWISE J211250.11-052925.2; and 19 new "mild" subdwarfs with modest metal deficiency ([M/H] $\lesssim$ $-$0.25). We also identify three metal-rich brown dwarfs with thick disk kinematics. We provide kinematic evidence that the extreme L subdwarf 2MASS J053253.46+824646.5 and the mild T subdwarf CWISE J113010.07+313944.7 may be part of the Thamnos population, while the T subdwarf CWISE J155349.96+693355.2 may be part of the Helmi stream. We define a metallicity classification system for T dwarfs that adds mild subdwarfs (d/sdT), subdwarfs (sdT), and extreme subdwarfs (esdT) to the existing dwarf sequence. We also define a metallicity spectral index that correlates with metallicities inferred from spectral model fits and iron abundances from stellar primaries of benchmark T dwarf companions. This expansion of the T dwarf classification system supports investigations of ancient, metal-poor brown dwarfs now being uncovered in deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys.

### Fact or Fiction? Can LLMs be Reliable Annotators for Political Truths?
**Authors**: Veronica Chatrath, Marcelo Lotif, Shaina Raza

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:36:33Z

**Summary**: Political misinformation poses significant challenges to democratic processes, shaping public opinion and trust in media. Manual fact-checking methods face issues of scalability and annotator bias, while machine learning models require large, costly labelled datasets. This study investigates the use of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) as reliable annotators for detecting political factuality in news articles. Using open-source LLMs, we create a politically diverse dataset, labelled for bias through LLM-generated annotations. These annotations are validated by human experts and further evaluated by LLM-based judges to assess the accuracy and reliability of the annotations. Our approach offers a scalable and robust alternative to traditional fact-checking, enhancing transparency and public trust in media.

### Logic Query of Thoughts: Guiding Large Language Models to Answer Complex   Logic Queries with Knowledge Graphs
**Authors**: Lihui Liu, Zihao Wang, Ruizhong Qiu, Yikun Ban, Eunice Chan, Yangqiu Song, Jingrui He, Hanghang Tong

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:35:49Z

**Summary**: Despite the superb performance in many tasks, large language models (LLMs) bear the risk of generating hallucination or even wrong answers when confronted with tasks that demand the accuracy of knowledge. The issue becomes even more noticeable when addressing logic queries that require multiple logic reasoning steps. On the other hand, knowledge graph (KG) based question answering methods are capable of accurately identifying the correct answers with the help of knowledge graph, yet its accuracy could quickly deteriorate when the knowledge graph itself is sparse and incomplete. It remains a critical challenge on how to integrate knowledge graph reasoning with LLMs in a mutually beneficial way so as to mitigate both the hallucination problem of LLMs as well as the incompleteness issue of knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose 'Logic-Query-of-Thoughts' (LGOT) which is the first of its kind to combine LLMs with knowledge graph based logic query reasoning. LGOT seamlessly combines knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, effectively breaking down complex logic queries into easy to answer subquestions. Through the utilization of both knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, it successfully derives answers for each subquestion. By aggregating these results and selecting the highest quality candidate answers for each step, LGOT achieves accurate results to complex questions. Our experimental findings demonstrate substantial performance enhancements, with up to 20% improvement over ChatGPT.

### SVDQuant: Absorbing Outliers by Low-Rank Components for 4-Bit Diffusion   Models
**Authors**: Muyang Li, Yujun Lin, Zhekai Zhang, Tianle Cai, Xiuyu Li, Junxian Guo, Enze Xie, Chenlin Meng, Jun-Yan Zhu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:32:59Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have been proven highly effective at generating high-quality images. However, as these models grow larger, they require significantly more memory and suffer from higher latency, posing substantial challenges for deployment. In this work, we aim to accelerate diffusion models by quantizing their weights and activations to 4 bits. At such an aggressive level, both weights and activations are highly sensitive, where conventional post-training quantization methods for large language models like smoothing become insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose SVDQuant, a new 4-bit quantization paradigm. Different from smoothing which redistributes outliers between weights and activations, our approach absorbs these outliers using a low-rank branch. We first consolidate the outliers by shifting them from activations to weights, then employ a high-precision low-rank branch to take in the weight outliers with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This process eases the quantization on both sides. However, na\"{\i}vely running the low-rank branch independently incurs significant overhead due to extra data movement of activations, negating the quantization speedup. To address this, we co-design an inference engine Nunchaku that fuses the kernels of the low-rank branch into those of the low-bit branch to cut off redundant memory access. It can also seamlessly support off-the-shelf low-rank adapters (LoRAs) without the need for re-quantization. Extensive experiments on SDXL, PixArt-$\Sigma$, and FLUX.1 validate the effectiveness of SVDQuant in preserving image quality. We reduce the memory usage for the 12B FLUX.1 models by 3.5$\times$, achieving 3.0$\times$ speedup over the 4-bit weight-only quantized baseline on the 16GB laptop 4090 GPU, paving the way for more interactive applications on PCs. Our quantization library and inference engine are open-sourced.

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:26:17Z

**Summary**: We introduce FinDVer, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the explainable claim verification capabilities of LLMs in the context of understanding and analyzing long, hybrid-content financial documents. FinDVer contains 2,400 expert-annotated examples, divided into three subsets: information extraction, numerical reasoning, and knowledge-intensive reasoning, each addressing common scenarios encountered in real-world financial contexts. We assess a broad spectrum of LLMs under long-context and RAG settings. Our results show that even the current best-performing system, GPT-4o, still lags behind human experts. We further provide in-depth analysis on long-context and RAG setting, Chain-of-Thought reasoning, and model reasoning errors, offering insights to drive future advancements. We believe that FinDVer can serve as a valuable benchmark for evaluating LLMs in claim verification over complex, expert-domain documents.

### Multi-hop Evidence Pursuit Meets the Web: Team Papelo at FEVER 2024
**Authors**: Christopher Malon

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:25:06Z

**Summary**: Separating disinformation from fact on the web has long challenged both the search and the reasoning powers of humans. We show that the reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) and the retrieval power of modern search engines can be combined to automate this process and explainably verify claims. We integrate LLMs and search under a multi-hop evidence pursuit strategy. This strategy generates an initial question based on an input claim using a sequence to sequence model, searches and formulates an answer to the question, and iteratively generates follow-up questions to pursue the evidence that is missing using an LLM. We demonstrate our system on the FEVER 2024 (AVeriTeC) shared task. Compared to a strategy of generating all the questions at once, our method obtains .045 higher label accuracy and .155 higher AVeriTeC score (evaluating the adequacy of the evidence). Through ablations, we show the importance of various design choices, such as the question generation method, medium-sized context, reasoning with one document at a time, adding metadata, paraphrasing, reducing the problem to two classes, and reconsidering the final verdict. Our submitted system achieves .510 AVeriTeC score on the dev set and .477 AVeriTeC score on the test set.

### Free Record-Level Privacy Risk Evaluation Through Artifact-Based Methods
**Authors**: Joseph Pollock, Igor Shilov, Euodia Dodd, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:04:41Z

**Summary**: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are widely used to empirically assess the privacy risks of samples used to train a target machine learning model. State-of-the-art methods however require training hundreds of shadow models, with the same size and architecture of the target model, solely to evaluate the privacy risk. While one might be able to afford this for small models, the cost often becomes prohibitive for medium and large models.   We here instead propose a novel approach to identify the at-risk samples using only artifacts available during training, with little to no additional computational overhead. Our method analyzes individual per-sample loss traces and uses them to identify the vulnerable data samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our artifact-based approach through experiments on the CIFAR10 dataset, showing high precision in identifying vulnerable samples as determined by a SOTA shadow model-based MIA (LiRA). Impressively, our method reaches the same precision as another SOTA MIA when measured against LiRA, despite it being orders of magnitude cheaper. We then show LT-IQR to outperform alternative loss aggregation methods, perform ablation studies on hyperparameters, and validate the robustness of our method to the target metric. Finally, we study the evolution of the vulnerability score distribution throughout training as a metric for model-level risk assessment.

### Graph-Dictionary Signal Model for Sparse Representations of Multivariate   Data
**Authors**: William Cappelletti, Pascal Frossard

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T17:40:43Z

**Summary**: Representing and exploiting multivariate signals require capturing complex relations between variables. We define a novel Graph-Dictionary signal model, where a finite set of graphs characterizes relationships in data distribution through a weighted sum of their Laplacians. We propose a framework to infer the graph dictionary representation from observed data, along with a bilinear generalization of the primal-dual splitting algorithm to solve the learning problem. Our new formulation allows to include a priori knowledge on signal properties, as well as on underlying graphs and their coefficients. We show the capability of our method to reconstruct graphs from signals in multiple synthetic settings, where our model outperforms previous baselines. Then, we exploit graph-dictionary representations in a motor imagery decoding task on brain activity data, where we classify imagined motion better than standard methods relying on many more features.

### Multimodal Structure-Aware Quantum Data Processing
**Authors**: Hala Hawashin, Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T17:16:29Z

**Summary**: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP), their "black box" nature obscures their decision-making processes. To address this, researchers developed structured approaches using higher order tensors. These are able to model linguistic relations, but stall when training on classical computers due to their excessive size. Tensors are natural inhabitants of quantum systems and training on quantum computers provides a solution by translating text to variational quantum circuits. In this paper, we develop MultiQ-NLP: a framework for structure-aware data processing with multimodal text+image data. Here, "structure" refers to syntactic and grammatical relationships in language, as well as the hierarchical organization of visual elements in images. We enrich the translation with new types and type homomorphisms and develop novel architectures to represent structure. When tested on a main stream image classification task (SVO Probes), our best model showed a par performance with the state of the art classical models; moreover the best model was fully structured.

### Badminton Birdie-Like Aerodynamic Alignment of Drifting Dust Grains by   Subsonic Gaseous Flows in Protoplanetary Disks
**Authors**: Zhe-Yu Daniel Lin, Zhi-Yun Li, Haifeng Yang, Leslie W. Looney, Ian W. Stephens, Manuel Fernández-López, Rachel E. Harrison

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T17:09:35Z

**Summary**: Recent (sub)millimeter polarization observations of protoplanetary disks reveal toroidally aligned, effectively prolate dust grains large enough (at least ~100 $\mu$m) to efficiently scatter millimeter light. The alignment mechanism for these grains remains unclear. We explore the possibility that gas drag aligns grains through gas-dust relative motion when the grain's center of mass is offset from its geometric center, analogous to a badminton birdie's alignment in flight. A simple grain model of two non-identical spheres illustrates how a grain undergoes damped oscillations from flow-induced restoring torques which align its geometric center in the flow direction relative to its center of mass. Assuming specular reflection and subsonic flow, we derive an analytical equation of motion for spheroids where the center of mass can be shifted away from the spheroid's geometric center. We show that a prolate or an oblate grain can be aligned with the long axis parallel to the gas flow when the center of mass is shifted along that axis. Both scenarios can explain the required effectively prolate grains inferred from observations. Application to a simple disk model shows that the alignment timescales are shorter than or comparable to the orbital time. The grain alignment direction in a disk depends on the disk (sub-)structure and grain Stokes number (St) with azimuthal alignment for large St grains in sub-Keplerian smooth gas disks and for small St grains near the gas pressure extrema, such as rings and gaps.

### Inferring stochastic low-rank recurrent neural networks from neural data
**Authors**: Matthijs Pals, A Erdem Sağtekin, Felix Pei, Manuel Gloeckler, Jakob H Macke

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T17:07:23Z

**Summary**: A central aim in computational neuroscience is to relate the activity of large populations of neurons to an underlying dynamical system. Models of these neural dynamics should ideally be both interpretable and fit the observed data well. Low-rank recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit such interpretability by having tractable dynamics. However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs. Our method both elucidates the dynamical systems underlying experimental recordings and provides a generative model whose trajectories match observed variability.

### A constructive approach to selective risk control
**Authors**: Zijun Gao, Wenjie Hu, Qingyuan Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:52:41Z

**Summary**: Many modern applications require using data to select the statistical tasks and make valid inference after selection. In this article, we provide a unifying approach to control for a class of selective risks. Our method is motivated by a reformulation of the celebrated Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for multiple hypothesis testing as the fixed point iteration of the Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) procedure for constructing post-selection confidence intervals. Building on this observation, we propose a constructive approach to control extra-selection risk (where selection is made after decision) by iterating decision strategies that control the post-selection risk (where decision is made after selection). We show that many previous methods and results are special cases of this general framework, and we further extend this approach to problems with multiple selective risks. Our development leads to two surprising results about the BH procedure: (1) in the context of one-sided location testing, the BH procedure not only controls the false discovery rate at the null but also at other locations for free; (2) in the context of permutation tests, the BH procedure with exact permutation p-values can be well approximated by a procedure which only requires a total number of permutations that is almost linear in the total number of hypotheses.

### Language Models can Infer Action Semantics for Symbolic Planners from   Environment Feedback
**Authors**: Wang Zhu, Ishika Singh, Robin Jia, Jesse Thomason

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:50:24Z

**Summary**: Symbolic planners can discover a sequence of actions from initial to goal states given expert-defined, domain-specific logical action semantics. Large Language Models (LLMs) can directly generate such sequences, but limitations in reasoning and state-tracking often result in plans that are insufficient or unexecutable. We propose Predicting Semantics of Actions with Language Models (PSALM), which automatically learns action semantics by leveraging the strengths of both symbolic planners and LLMs. PSALM repeatedly proposes and executes plans, using the LLM to partially generate plans and to infer domain-specific action semantics based on execution outcomes. PSALM maintains a belief over possible action semantics that is iteratively updated until a goal state is reached. Experiments on 7 environments show that when learning just from one goal, PSALM boosts plan success rate from 36.4% (on Claude-3.5) to 100%, and explores the environment more efficiently than prior work to infer ground truth domain action semantics.

### FALCON: Feedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced   Coding Optimization system
**Authors**: Zeyuan Li, Yangfan He, Lewei He, Jianhui Wang, Tianyu Shi, Bin Lei, Yuchen Li, Qiuwu Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:50:05Z

**Summary**: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in automated code generation. Despite their strong instruction-following capabilities, these models frequently struggled to align with user intent in coding scenarios. In particular, they were hampered by datasets that lacked diversity and failed to address specialized tasks or edge cases. Furthermore, challenges in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) led to failures in generating precise, human-intent-aligned code. To tackle these challenges and improve the code generation performance for automated programming systems, we propose Feedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced Coding Optimization (i.e., FALCON). FALCON is structured into two hierarchical levels. From the global level, long-term memory improves code quality by retaining and applying learned knowledge. At the local level, short-term memory allows for the incorporation of immediate feedback from compilers and AI systems. Additionally, we introduce meta-reinforcement learning with feedback rewards to solve the global-local bi-level optimization problem and enhance the model's adaptability across diverse code generation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art performance, leading other reinforcement learning methods by more than 4.5 percentage points on the MBPP benchmark and 6.1 percentage points on the Humaneval benchmark. The open-sourced code is publicly available at https://github.com/titurte/FALCON.

### Mathematical Formalized Problem Solving and Theorem Proving in Different   Fields in Lean 4
**Authors**: Xichen Tang

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:42:41Z

**Summary**: Formalizing mathematical proofs using computerized verification languages like Lean 4 has the potential to significantly impact the field of mathematics, it offers prominent capabilities for advancing mathematical reasoning. However, existing efforts are largely limited to creating formalized versions of proofs from extensive online mathematical corpora, struggling to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of mathematics. To bridge the gap between traditional and computerized proof techniques, this paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate formal proof steps and complete formalized proofs. By converting natural language (NL) mathematical proofs into formalized versions, this work introduces the basic structure and tactics of the Lean 4 language. The goal is to determine how AI can be leveraged to assist the mathematical formalization process and improve its performance. Several examples are provided that demonstrate solving problems using both traditional and Lean 4-based approaches. Ultimately, this paper presents an explanation of the foundations of Lean 4 and comparative analyses of the mathematical formalization process using traditional and AI-augmented techniques. The findings indicate that AI- powered tools have significant potential to accelerate and enhance the formalization of mathematical proofs, paving the way for more efficient and reliable theorem-proving for AI for Math in the future.

### LLM4Mat-Bench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Materials Property   Prediction
**Authors**: Andre Niyongabo Rubungo, Kangming Li, Jason Hattrick-Simpers, Adji Bousso Dieng

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:42:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in materials science. However, little attention has been given to benchmarking and standardized evaluation for LLM-based materials property prediction, which hinders progress. We present LLM4Mat-Bench, the largest benchmark to date for evaluating the performance of LLMs in predicting the properties of crystalline materials. LLM4Mat-Bench contains about 1.9M crystal structures in total, collected from 10 publicly available materials data sources, and 45 distinct properties. LLM4Mat-Bench features different input modalities: crystal composition, CIF, and crystal text description, with 4.7M, 615.5M, and 3.1B tokens in total for each modality, respectively. We use LLM4Mat-Bench to fine-tune models with different sizes, including LLM-Prop and MatBERT, and provide zero-shot and few-shot prompts to evaluate the property prediction capabilities of LLM-chat-like models, including Llama, Gemma, and Mistral. The results highlight the challenges of general-purpose LLMs in materials science and the need for task-specific predictive models and task-specific instruction-tuned LLMs in materials property prediction.

### A Survey of AI-Related Cyber Security Risks and Countermeasures in   Mobility-as-a-Service
**Authors**: Kai-Fung Chu, Haiyue Yuan, Jinsheng Yuan, Weisi Guo, Nazmiye Balta-Ozkan, Shujun Li

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:31:06Z

**Summary**: Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) integrates different transport modalities and can support more personalisation of travellers' journey planning based on their individual preferences, behaviours and wishes. To fully achieve the potential of MaaS, a range of AI (including machine learning and data mining) algorithms are needed to learn personal requirements and needs, to optimise journey planning of each traveller and all travellers as a whole, to help transport service operators and relevant governmental bodies to operate and plan their services, and to detect and prevent cyber attacks from various threat actors including dishonest and malicious travellers and transport operators. The increasing use of different AI and data processing algorithms in both centralised and distributed settings opens the MaaS ecosystem up to diverse cyber and privacy attacks at both the AI algorithm level and the connectivity surfaces. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive review on the coupling between AI-driven MaaS design and the diverse cyber security challenges related to cyber attacks and countermeasures. In particular, we focus on how current and emerging AI-facilitated privacy risks (profiling, inference, and third-party threats) and adversarial AI attacks (evasion, extraction, and gamification) may impact the MaaS ecosystem. These risks often combine novel attacks (e.g., inverse learning) with traditional attack vectors (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks), exacerbating the risks for the wider participation actors and the emergence of new business models.

### Eigen Attention: Attention in Low-Rank Space for KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Utkarsh Saxena, Gobinda Saha, Sakshi Choudhary, Kaushik Roy

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:29:33Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the domain of natural language processing due to their impressive reasoning abilities. Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the context lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex tasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new bottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen Attention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby reducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we demonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache sizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop in performance. Code is available at https://github.com/UtkarshSaxena1/EigenAttn.

### Tell What You Hear From What You See -- Video to Audio Generation   Through Text
**Authors**: Xiulong Liu, Kun Su, Eli Shlizerman

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:29:07Z

**Summary**: The content of visual and audio scenes is multi-faceted such that a video can be paired with various audio and vice-versa. Thereby, in video-to-audio generation task, it is imperative to introduce steering approaches for controlling the generated audio. While Video-to-Audio generation is a well-established generative task, existing methods lack such controllability. In this work, we propose VATT, a multi-modal generative framework that takes a video and an optional text prompt as input, and generates audio and optional textual description of the audio. Such a framework has two advantages: i) Video-to-Audio generation process can be refined and controlled via text which complements the context of visual information, and ii) The model can suggest what audio to generate for the video by generating audio captions. VATT consists of two key modules: VATT Converter, a LLM that is fine-tuned for instructions and includes a projection layer that maps video features to the LLM vector space; and VATT Audio, a transformer that generates audio tokens from visual frames and from optional text prompt using iterative parallel decoding. The audio tokens are converted to a waveform by pretrained neural codec. Experiments show that when VATT is compared to existing video-to-audio generation methods in objective metrics, it achieves competitive performance when the audio caption is not provided. When the audio caption is provided as a prompt, VATT achieves even more refined performance (lowest KLD score of 1.41). Furthermore, subjective studies show that VATT Audio has been chosen as preferred generated audio than audio generated by existing methods. VATT enables controllable video-to-audio generation through text as well as suggesting text prompts for videos through audio captions, unlocking novel applications such as text-guided video-to-audio generation and video-to-audio captioning.

### Unmasking the Limits of Large Language Models: A Systematic Evaluation   of Masked Text Processing Ability through MskQA and MskCal
**Authors**: Fuka Matsuzaki, Haru-Tada Sato

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:07:47Z

**Summary**: This paper sheds light on the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by rigorously evaluating their ability to process masked text. We introduce two novel tasks: MskQA, measuring reasoning on masked question-answering datasets like RealtimeQA, and MskCal, assessing numerical reasoning on masked arithmetic problems.Testing GPT-4o and 4o-mini reveals that while LLMs exhibit some resilience to masked text, their performance is highly contingent on masking rates and semantic cues. Specifically, "solid masking," where semantic clues are entirely absent, leads to a significant performance drop compared to "partial lifting," where some semantic information is retained, indicating LLMs' reliance on surface-level patterns. Interestingly, GPT-4o consistently outperforms 4o-mini, particularly in MskCal, demonstrating a greater ability to handle numerical reasoning with masked text. This underscores the crucial role of semantic cues in the reasoning process of LLMs. Our study illuminates the interplay between background knowledge and reasoning ability in masked text processing, paving the way for a deeper understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations, and highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods to accurately assess their true comprehension abilities.

### GPTKB: Building Very Large Knowledge Bases from Language Models
**Authors**: Yujia Hu, Shrestha Ghosh, Tuan-Phong Nguyen, Simon Razniewski

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:06:09Z

**Summary**: General-domain knowledge bases (KB), in particular the "big three" -- Wikidata, Yago and DBpedia -- are the backbone of many intelligent applications. While these three have seen steady development, comprehensive KB construction at large has seen few fresh attempts. In this work, we propose to build a large general-domain KB entirely from a large language model (LLM). We demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale KB construction from LLMs, while highlighting specific challenges arising around entity recognition, entity and property canonicalization, and taxonomy construction. As a prototype, we use GPT-4o-mini to construct GPTKB, which contains 105 million triples for more than 2.9 million entities, at a cost 100x less than previous KBC projects. Our work is a landmark for two fields: For NLP, for the first time, it provides \textit{constructive} insights into the knowledge (or beliefs) of LLMs. For the Semantic Web, it shows novel ways forward for the long-standing challenge of general-domain KB construction. GPTKB is accessible at http://gptkb.org.

### The influence of persona and conversational task on social interactions   with a LLM-controlled embodied conversational agent
**Authors**: Leon O. H. Kroczek, Alexander May, Selina Hettenkofer, Andreas Ruider, Bernd Ludwig, Andreas Mühlberger

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T15:49:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in conversational tasks. Embodying an LLM as a virtual human allows users to engage in face-to-face social interactions in Virtual Reality. However, the influence of person- and task-related factors in social interactions with LLM-controlled agents remains unclear. In this study, forty-six participants interacted with a virtual agent whose persona was manipulated as extravert or introvert in three different conversational tasks (small talk, knowledge test, convincing). Social-evaluation, emotional experience, and realism were assessed using ratings. Interactive engagement was measured by quantifying participants' words and conversational turns. Finally, we measured participants' willingness to ask the agent for help during the knowledge test. Our findings show that the extraverted agent was more positively evaluated, elicited a more pleasant experience and greater engagement, and was assessed as more realistic compared to the introverted agent. Whereas persona did not affect the tendency to ask for help, participants were generally more confident in the answer when they had help of the LLM. Variation of personality traits of LLM-controlled embodied virtual agents, therefore, affects social-emotional processing and behavior in virtual interactions. Embodied virtual agents allow the presentation of naturalistic social encounters in a virtual environment.

### LightVA: Lightweight Visual Analytics with LLM Agent-Based Task Planning   and Execution
**Authors**: Yuheng Zhao, Junjie Wang, Linbin Xiang, Xiaowen Zhang, Zifei Guo, Cagatay Turkay, Yu Zhang, Siming Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T15:46:10Z

**Summary**: Visual analytics (VA) requires analysts to iteratively propose analysis tasks based on observations and execute tasks by creating visualizations and interactive exploration to gain insights. This process demands skills in programming, data processing, and visualization tools, highlighting the need for a more intelligent, streamlined VA approach. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been developed as agents to handle various tasks with dynamic planning and tool-using capabilities, offering the potential to enhance the efficiency and versatility of VA. We propose LightVA, a lightweight VA framework that supports task decomposition, data analysis, and interactive exploration through human-agent collaboration. Our method is designed to help users progressively translate high-level analytical goals into low-level tasks, producing visualizations and deriving insights. Specifically, we introduce an LLM agent-based task planning and execution strategy, employing a recursive process involving a planner, executor, and controller. The planner is responsible for recommending and decomposing tasks, the executor handles task execution, including data analysis, visualization generation and multi-view composition, and the controller coordinates the interaction between the planner and executor. Building on the framework, we develop a system with a hybrid user interface that includes a task flow diagram for monitoring and managing the task planning process, a visualization panel for interactive data exploration, and a chat view for guiding the model through natural language instructions. We examine the effectiveness of our method through a usage scenario and an expert study.

### Evaluating Large Language Model Capability in Vietnamese Fact-Checking   Data Generation
**Authors**: Long Truong To, Hung Tuan Le, Dat Van-Thanh Nguyen, Manh Trong Nguyen, Tri Thien Nguyen, Tin Van Huynh, Kiet Van Nguyen

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T15:35:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), with gradually improving reading comprehension and reasoning capabilities, are being applied to a range of complex language tasks, including the automatic generation of language data for various purposes. However, research on applying LLMs for automatic data generation in low-resource languages like Vietnamese is still underdeveloped and lacks comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs for automatic data generation for the Vietnamese fact-checking task, which faces significant data limitations. Specifically, we focus on fact-checking data where claims are synthesized from multiple evidence sentences to assess the information synthesis capabilities of LLMs. We develop an automatic data construction process using simple prompt techniques on LLMs and explore several methods to improve the quality of the generated data. To evaluate the quality of the data generated by LLMs, we conduct both manual quality assessments and performance evaluations using language models. Experimental results and manual evaluations illustrate that while the quality of the generated data has significantly improved through fine-tuning techniques, LLMs still cannot match the data quality produced by humans.

### Assessing Open-Source Large Language Models on Argumentation Mining   Subtasks
**Authors**: Mohammad Yeghaneh Abkenar, Weixing Wang, Hendrik Graupner, Manfred Stede

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T15:34:08Z

**Summary**: We explore the capability of four open-sourcelarge language models (LLMs) in argumentation mining (AM). We conduct experiments on three different corpora; persuasive essays(PE), argumentative microtexts (AMT) Part 1 and Part 2, based on two argumentation mining sub-tasks: (i) argumentative discourse units classifications (ADUC), and (ii) argumentative relation classification (ARC). This work aims to assess the argumentation capability of open-source LLMs, including Mistral 7B, Mixtral8x7B, LlamA2 7B and LlamA3 8B in both, zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Our analysis contributes to further assessing computational argumentation with open-source LLMs in future research efforts.

### Cross-validating causal discovery via Leave-One-Variable-Out
**Authors**: Daniela Schkoda, Philipp Faller, Patrick Blöbaum, Dominik Janzing

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T15:15:34Z

**Summary**: We propose a new approach to falsify causal discovery algorithms without ground truth, which is based on testing the causal model on a pair of variables that has been dropped when learning the causal model. To this end, we use the "Leave-One-Variable-Out (LOVO)" prediction where $Y$ is inferred from $X$ without any joint observations of $X$ and $Y$, given only training data from $X,Z_1,\dots,Z_k$ and from $Z_1,\dots,Z_k,Y$. We demonstrate that causal models on the two subsets, in the form of Acyclic Directed Mixed Graphs (ADMGs), often entail conclusions on the dependencies between $X$ and $Y$, enabling this type of prediction. The prediction error can then be estimated since the joint distribution $P(X, Y)$ is assumed to be available, and $X$ and $Y$ have only been omitted for the purpose of falsification. After presenting this graphical method, which is applicable to general causal discovery algorithms, we illustrate how to construct a LOVO predictor tailored towards algorithms relying on specific a priori assumptions, such as linear additive noise models. Simulations indicate that the LOVO prediction error is indeed correlated with the accuracy of the causal outputs, affirming the method's effectiveness.

### The rush to the poles and the role of magnetic buoyancy in the solar   dynamo
**Authors**: Simon Cloutier, Robert H. Cameron, Laurent Gizon

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T15:12:38Z

**Summary**: The butterfly diagram of the solar cycle exhibits a poleward migration of the diffuse magnetic field resulting from the decay of trailing sunspots. It is one component of what is sometimes referred to as the "rush to the poles". We investigate under which conditions the rush to the poles can be reproduced in flux-transport Babcock-Leighton dynamo models. We identify three main ways to reproduce it: a flux emergence probability that decreases rapidly with latitude; a threshold in subsurface toroidal field strength between slow and fast emergence; and an emergence rate based on magnetic buoyancy. We find that all three mechanisms lead to solar-like butterfly diagrams, but which present notable differences between them. The shape of the butterfly diagram is very sensitive to model parameters for the threshold prescription, while most models incorporating magnetic buoyancy converge to very similar butterfly diagrams, with butterfly wings widths of $\lesssim\pm 30^\circ$, in very good agreement with observations. With turbulent diffusivities above $35~\text{km}^2/\text{s}$ but below about $40~\text{km}^2/\text{s}$, buoyancy models are strikingly solar-like. The threshold and magnetic buoyancy prescriptions make the models non-linear and as such can saturate the dynamo through latitudinal quenching. The period of the models involving buoyancy is independent of the source term amplitude, but emergence loss increases it by $\simeq 60\%$. For the rush to the poles to be visible, a mechanism suppressing (enhancing) emergences at high (low) latitudes must operate. It is not sufficient that the toroidal field be stored at low latitudes for emergences to be limited to low latitudes. From these models we infer that the Sun is not in the advection-dominated regime, but also not in the diffusion-dominated regime. The cycle period is set through a balance between advection, diffusion and flux emergence.

### Multi-time small-area estimation of oil and gas production capacity by   Bayesian multilevel modeling
**Authors**: Hiroaki Minato

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T14:58:31Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach for estimating well-level oil and gas production capacities across small geographic areas over multiple time periods. Focusing on a basin, which is a geologically and economically distinct drilling region, we model the production level of wells grouped by area and time, using priors as regulators of inferences. Our model accounts for area-level and time-level variations as well as well-level variations, incorporating lateral length, water usage, and sand usage. The Maidenhead Coordinate System is used to define uniform (small) geographic areas, many of which contain only a small number of wells in a given time period. The Bayesian small-area model is first built and checked, using data from the Bakken region, covering from 21 February 2012 to 12 June 2024. The model is expanded to accommodate temporal dynamics by introducing time-effect components, allowing for the analysis of production trends over times. We explore the impact of technological advancements by modeling water-sand intensity as a proxy for production efficiency. The Bayesian multilevel modeling approach provides a robust and flexible tool for modeling oil or/and gas production at area and time levels, informing the energy production prediction with uncertainties.

### Hierarchical Regression Discontinuity Design: Pursuing Subgroup   Treatment Effects
**Authors**: Shonosuke Sugasawa, Takuya Ishihara, Daisuke Kurisu

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T14:54:51Z

**Summary**: Regression discontinuity design (RDD) is widely adopted for causal inference under intervention determined by a continuous variable. While one is interested in treatment effect heterogeneity by subgroups in many applications, RDD typically suffers from small subgroup-wise sample sizes, which makes the estimation results highly instable. To solve this issue, we introduce hierarchical RDD (HRDD), a hierarchical Bayes approach for pursuing treatment effect heterogeneity in RDD. A key feature of HRDD is to employ a pseudo-model based on a loss function to estimate subgroup-level parameters of treatment effects under RDD, and assign a hierarchical prior distribution to ''borrow strength'' from other subgroups. The posterior computation can be easily done by a simple Gibbs sampling, and the optimal bandwidth can be automatically selected by the Hyv\"{a}rinen scores for unnormalized models. We demonstrate the proposed HRDD through simulation and real data analysis, and show that HRDD provides much more stable point and interval estimation than separately applying the standard RDD method to each subgroup.

### A Two-Step Concept-Based Approach for Enhanced Interpretability and   Trust in Skin Lesion Diagnosis
**Authors**: Cristiano Patrício, Luís F. Teixeira, João C. Neves

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T14:52:42Z

**Summary**: The main challenges hindering the adoption of deep learning-based systems in clinical settings are the scarcity of annotated data and the lack of interpretability and trust in these systems. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) offer inherent interpretability by constraining the final disease prediction on a set of human-understandable concepts. However, this inherent interpretability comes at the cost of greater annotation burden. Additionally, adding new concepts requires retraining the entire system. In this work, we introduce a novel two-step methodology that addresses both of these challenges. By simulating the two stages of a CBM, we utilize a pretrained Vision Language Model (VLM) to automatically predict clinical concepts, and a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate disease diagnoses based on the predicted concepts. We validate our approach on three skin lesion datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms traditional CBMs and state-of-the-art explainable methods, all without requiring any training and utilizing only a few annotated examples. The code is available at https://github.com/CristianoPatricio/2-step-concept-based-skin-diagnosis.

### Secret Collusion among Generative AI Agents
**Authors**: Sumeet Ramesh Motwani, Mikhail Baranchuk, Martin Strohmeier, Vijay Bolina, Philip H. S. Torr, Lewis Hammond, Christian Schroeder de Witt

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T14:46:40Z

**Summary**: Recent capability increases in large language models (LLMs) open up applications in which groups of communicating generative AI agents solve joint tasks. This poses privacy and security challenges concerning the unauthorised sharing of information, or other unwanted forms of agent coordination. Modern steganographic techniques could render such dynamics hard to detect. In this paper, we comprehensively formalise the problem of secret collusion in systems of generative AI agents by drawing on relevant concepts from both AI and security literature. We study incentives for the use of steganography, and propose a variety of mitigation measures. Our investigations result in a model evaluation framework that systematically tests capabilities required for various forms of secret collusion. We provide extensive empirical results across a range of contemporary LLMs. While the steganographic capabilities of current models remain limited, GPT-4 displays a capability jump suggesting the need for continuous monitoring of steganographic frontier model capabilities. We conclude by laying out a comprehensive research program to mitigate future risks of collusion between generative AI models.

**Summary**: We use NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to study the ionising properties of a sample of 15721 galaxies at $3 \leq z_{\rm{phot}} \leq 9$, 90\% complete in stellar mass down to log(M$_{\star}$/[M$_{\odot}$])$\approx 7.5$. Out of the full sample, 1620 of the galaxies have spectroscopic redshift measurements from the literature. We use the spectral energy distribution fitting code \texttt{Prospector} to fit all available photometry and infer galaxy properties. We find a significantly milder evolution of the ionising photon production efficiency (\xion\/) with redshift and UV magnitude than previously reported. Interestingly, we observe two distinct populations in \xion\/, distinguished by their burstiness (given by SFR$_{10}$/SFR$_{100}$). Both populations show the same evolution with $z$ and M$_{\rm{UV}}$, but have a different \xion\/ normalisation. We convolve the more representative $\log(\xi_{\rm{ion}} (z,\text{M}_{\rm{UV}}))$ relations (accounting for $\sim96$\% of the sample), with luminosity functions from literature, to place constraints on the cosmic ionising photon budget. By combining our results, we find that one of our models can match the observational constraints from the \lya\/ forest at $z\lesssim6$. We conclude that galaxies with M$_{\rm{UV}}$ between $-16$ and $-20$, adopting a reasonable escape fraction, can produce enough ionising photons to ionise the Universe, without exceeding the required ionising photon budget.

### Evaluating and Adapting Large Language Models to Represent Folktales in   Low-Resource Languages
**Authors**: JA Meaney, Beatrice Alex, William Lamb

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T14:26:56Z

**Summary**: Folktales are a rich resource of knowledge about the society and culture of a civilisation. Digital folklore research aims to use automated techniques to better understand these folktales, and it relies on abstract representations of the textual data. Although a number of large language models (LLMs) claim to be able to represent low-resource langauges such as Irish and Gaelic, we present two classification tasks to explore how useful these representations are, and three adaptations to improve the performance of these models. We find that adapting the models to work with longer sequences, and continuing pre-training on the domain of folktales improves classification performance, although these findings are tempered by the impressive performance of a baseline SVM with non-contextual features.

### Predicting Resistive Pulse Signatures in Nanopores by Accurately   Modeling Access Regions
**Authors**: Martin Charron, Zachary Roelen, Deekshant Wadhwa, Vincent Tabard-Cossa

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T14:23:07Z

**Summary**: Resistive pulse sensing has been widely used to characterize and count single particles in solution moving through channels under an electric bias, with nanoscale pores more recently providing enough spatial resolution for nucleic acid sequencing at the single-molecule level. At its core, this technique relies on measuring the drop in ionic current through the pore induced by the passage of a molecule and, through conductance models, translating the blockage signal to molecular dimensions. However, there exists no model considering the resistive contributions of the pore exterior, i.e. the access regions, when obstructed by a molecule. This is becoming increasingly important for low aspect ratio pores, with the advent of 2D materials and ultrathin membranes. In this work, a general method by which to model the resistance of the access regions of a pore in the presence of an insulating obstruction is presented. Thin oblate spheroidal slices are used to partition access regions and infer their conductance when blocked by differently shaped objects. We show that our model accurately estimates the blocked-state conductance of 2D and finite-length pores as a function of the distance from the pore in the presence of simple obstructions geometries (e.g. cylindrical and spherical objects) or complex structures (i.e. sequence of simple obstruction sub-units). The model is further shown to capture off-axis effects by predicting deeper blockages for obstructions offset from the pore's central axis. A web-based tool is created to predict the electrical signatures of a wide range of molecule geometries translocating through differently shaped pores. The introduced model will help guide experimental designs and thus presents a straightforward way to extend the quantification of the resistive pulse technique at the nanoscale.

### CodeGRAG: Bridging the Gap between Natural Language and Programming   Language via Graphical Retrieval Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Kounianhua Du, Jizheng Chen, Renting Rui, Huacan Chai, Lingyue Fu, Wei Xia, Yasheng Wang, Ruiming Tang, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T14:17:05Z

**Summary**: Utilizing large language models to generate codes has shown promising meaning in software development revolution. Despite the intelligence shown by the general large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing among natural language and different programming languages. In this paper, we propose CodeGRAG, a Graphical Retrieval Augmented Code Generation framework to enhance the performance of LLMs. CodeGRAG builds the graphical view of code blocks based on the control flow and data flow of them to fill the gap between programming languages and natural language, which can facilitate natural language based LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging graphical representation into informative knowledge for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into the model parameters via finetuning the models with the help of a pretrained GNN expert model. Various experiments and ablations are done on four datasets including both the C++ and python languages to validate the hard meta-graph prompt, the soft prompting technique, and the effectiveness of the objectives for pretrained GNN expert. CodeGRAG improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Code-5970/.

### Exploring Relationships Between Cryptocurrency News Outlets and   Influencers' Twitter Activity and Market Prices
**Authors**: Meysam Alizadeh, Yasaman Asgari, Zeynab Samei, Sara Yari, Shirin Dehghani, Mael Kubli, Darya Zare, Juan Diego Bermeo, Veronika Batzdorfer, Fabrizio Gilardi

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T14:07:01Z

**Summary**: Academics increasingly acknowledge the predictive power of social media for a wide variety of events and, more specifically, for financial markets. Anecdotal and empirical findings show that cryptocurrencies are among the financial assets that have been affected by news and influencers' activities on Twitter. However, the extent to which Twitter crypto influencer's posts about trading signals and their effect on market prices is mostly unexplored. In this paper, we use LLMs to uncover buy and not-buy signals from influencers and news outlets' Twitter posts and use a VAR analysis with Granger Causality tests and cross-correlation analysis to understand how these trading signals are temporally correlated with the top nine major cryptocurrencies' prices. Overall, the results show a mixed pattern across cryptocurrencies and temporal periods. However, we found that for the top three cryptocurrencies with the highest presence within news and influencer posts, their aggregated LLM-detected trading signal over the preceding 24 hours granger-causes fluctuations in their market prices, exhibiting a lag of at least 6 hours. In addition, the results reveal fundamental differences in how influencers and news outlets cover cryptocurrencies.

### Evaluating Diversity in Automatic Poetry Generation
**Authors**: Yanran Chen, Hannes Gröner, Sina Zarrieß, Steffen Eger

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T14:02:13Z

**Summary**: Natural Language Generation (NLG), and more generally generative AI, are among the currently most impactful research fields. Creative NLG, such as automatic poetry generation, is a fascinating niche in this area. While most previous research has focused on forms of the Turing test when evaluating automatic poetry generation -- can humans distinguish between automatic and human generated poetry -- we evaluate the diversity of automatically generated poetry (with a focus on quatrains), by comparing distributions of generated poetry to distributions of human poetry along structural, lexical, semantic and stylistic dimensions, assessing different model types (word vs. character-level, general purpose LLMs vs. poetry-specific models), including the very recent LLaMA3-8B, and types of fine-tuning (conditioned vs. unconditioned). We find that current automatic poetry systems are considerably underdiverse along multiple dimensions -- they often do not rhyme sufficiently, are semantically too uniform and even do not match the length distribution of human poetry. Our experiments reveal, however, that style-conditioning and character-level modeling clearly increases diversity across virtually all dimensions we explore. Our identified limitations may serve as the basis for more genuinely diverse future poetry generation models.

### Why These Documents? Explainable Generative Retrieval with Hierarchical   Category Paths
**Authors**: Sangam Lee, Ryang Heo, SeongKu Kang, Susik Yoon, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T13:51:37Z

**Summary**: Generative retrieval has recently emerged as a new alternative of traditional information retrieval approaches. However, existing generative retrieval methods directly decode docid when a query is given, making it impossible to provide users with explanations as an answer for "Why this document is retrieved?". To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Category Path-Enhanced Generative Retrieval(HyPE), which enhances explainability by generating hierarchical category paths step-by-step before decoding docid. HyPE leverages hierarchical category paths as explanation, progressing from broad to specific semantic categories. This approach enables diverse explanations for the same document depending on the query by using shared category paths between the query and the document, and provides reasonable explanation by reflecting the document's semantic structure through a coarse-to-fine manner. HyPE constructs category paths with external high-quality semantic hierarchy, leverages LLM to select appropriate candidate paths for each document, and optimizes the generative retrieval model with path-augmented dataset. During inference, HyPE utilizes path-aware reranking strategy to aggregate diverse topic information, allowing the most relevant documents to be prioritized in the final ranked list of docids. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HyPE not only offers a high level of explainability but also improves the retrieval performance in the document retrieval task.

### Maximum a posteriori testing in statistical inverse problems
**Authors**: Remo Kretschmann, Frank Werner

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T13:40:37Z

**Summary**: This paper is concerned with a Bayesian approach to testing hypotheses in statistical inverse problems. Based on the posterior distribution $\Pi \left(\cdot |Y = y\right)$, we want to infer whether a feature $\langle\varphi, u^\dagger\rangle$ of the unknown quantity of interest $u^\dagger$ is positive. This can be done by the so-called maximum a posteriori test. We provide a frequentistic analysis of this test's properties such as level and power, and prove that it is a regularized test in the sense of Kretschmann et al. (2024). Furthermore we provide lower bounds for its power under classical spectral source conditions in case of Gaussian priors. Numerical simulations illustrate its superior performance both in moderately and severely ill-posed situations.

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T13:30:17Z

**Summary**: $\require{mediawiki-texvc}$Given the sensitivity of the resonant Lyman-$\mathrm{\alpha}$ (Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$) transition to absorption by neutral hydrogen, observations of Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ emitting galaxies (LAEs) have been widely used to probe the ionising capabilities of reionisation-era galaxies and their impact on the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, prior to JWST our understanding of the contribution of fainter sources and of ionised `bubbles' at earlier stages of reionisation remained uncertain. Here, we present the characterisation of three exceptionally distant LAEs at $z>8$, newly discovered by JWST/NIRSpec in the JADES survey. These three similarly bright ($M_\text{UV} \approx -20\,\mathrm{mag}$) LAEs exhibit small Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ velocity offsets from the systemic redshift, $\Delta v_\mathrm{Ly\alpha} \lesssim 200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, yet span a range of Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ equivalent widths ($15\,\AA$, $31\,\AA$, and $132\,\AA$). The former two show moderate Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ escape fractions ($f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha} \approx 10\%$), whereas Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ escapes remarkably efficiently from the third ($f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha} \approx 72\%$), which moreover is very compact (half-light radius of $90\pm10\,\mathrm{pc}$). We find these LAEs are low-mass galaxies dominated by very recent, vigorous bursts of star formation accompanied by strong nebular emission from metal-poor gas. We infer the two LAEs with modest $f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha}$, one of which reveals evidence for ionisation by an active galactic nucleus, may have reasonably produced small ionised bubbles preventing complete IGM absorption of Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$. The third, however, requires a $\sim 3\,\text{physical Mpc}$ bubble, indicating faint galaxies have contributed significantly. The most distant LAEs thus continue to be powerful observational probes into the earlier stages of reionisation.

### Gaussian process modelling of infectious diseases using the Greta   software package and GPUs
**Authors**: Eva Gunn, Nikhil Sengupta, Ben Swallow

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T13:24:42Z

**Summary**: Gaussian process are a widely-used statistical tool for conducting non-parametric inference in applied sciences, with many computational packages available to fit to data and predict future observations. We study the use of the Greta software for Bayesian inference to apply Gaussian process regression to spatio-temporal data of infectious disease outbreaks and predict . Greta builds on Tensorflow, making it comparatively easy to take advantage of the significant gain in speed offered by GPUs. In these complex spatio-temporal models, we show a reduction of up to 70\% in computational time relative to fitting the same models on CPUs. We show how the choice of covariance kernel impacts the ability to infer spread and extrapolate to unobserved spatial and temporal units. The inference pipeline is applied to weekly incidence data on tuberculosis in the East and West Midlands regions of England over a period of two years.

### AcceLLM: Accelerating LLM Inference using Redundancy for Load Balancing   and Data Locality
**Authors**: Ilias Bournias, Lukas Cavigelli, Georgios Zacharopoulos

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T13:24:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference on large-scale systems is expected to dominate future cloud infrastructures. Efficient LLM inference in cloud environments with numerous AI accelerators is challenging, necessitating extensive optimizations for optimal performance. Current systems batch prefill and decoding to boost throughput but encounter latency issues, while others disaggregate these phases, leading to resource underutilization. We propose AcceLLM, a novel method addressing latency and load balancing, inspired by the cache data management. It strategically utilizes redundant data to enhance inference via load balancing and optimal hardware use. Simulated evaluations on Nvidia H100 GPU and Huawei Ascend 910B2 show AcceLLM surpasses state-of-the-art systems up to 30% in latency and efficiency, handling diverse workloads effectively.

### Mind Your Step (by Step): Chain-of-Thought can Reduce Performance on   Tasks where Thinking Makes Humans Worse
**Authors**: Ryan Liu, Jiayi Geng, Addison J. Wu, Ilia Sucholutsky, Tania Lombrozo, Thomas L. Griffiths

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T13:11:58Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has become a widely used strategy for working with large language and multimodal models. While CoT has been shown to improve performance across many tasks, determining the settings in which it is effective remains an ongoing effort. In particular, it is still an open question in what settings CoT systematically reduces model performance. In this paper, we seek to identify the characteristics of tasks where CoT reduces performance by drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, looking at cases where (i) verbal thinking or deliberation hurts performance in humans, and (ii) the constraints governing human performance generalize to language models. Three such cases are implicit statistical learning, visual recognition, and classifying with patterns containing exceptions. In extensive experiments across all three settings, we find that a diverse collection of state-of-the-art models exhibit significant drop-offs in performance (e.g., up to 36.3% absolute accuracy for OpenAI o1-preview compared to GPT-4o) when using inference-time reasoning compared to zero-shot counterparts. We also identify three tasks that satisfy condition (i) but not (ii), and find that while verbal thinking reduces human performance in these tasks, CoT retains or increases model performance. Overall, our results show that while there is not an exact parallel between the cognitive processes of models and those of humans, considering cases where thinking has negative consequences for human performance can help us identify settings where it negatively impacts models. By connecting the literature on human deliberation with evaluations of CoT, we offer a new tool that can be used in understanding the impact of prompt choices and inference-time reasoning.

### Assessing the Answerability of Queries in Retrieval-Augmented Code   Generation
**Authors**: Geonmin Kim, Jaeyeon Kim, Hancheol Park, Wooksu Shin, Tae-Ho Kim

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T13:09:14Z

**Summary**: Thanks to unprecedented language understanding and generation capabilities of large language model (LLM), Retrieval-augmented Code Generation (RaCG) has recently been widely utilized among software developers. While this has increased productivity, there are still frequent instances of incorrect codes being provided. In particular, there are cases where plausible yet incorrect codes are generated for queries from users that cannot be answered with the given queries and API descriptions. This study proposes a task for evaluating answerability, which assesses whether valid answers can be generated based on users' queries and retrieved APIs in RaCG. Additionally, we build a benchmark dataset called Retrieval-augmented Code Generability Evaluation (RaCGEval) to evaluate the performance of models performing this task. Experimental results show that this task remains at a very challenging level, with baseline models exhibiting a low performance of 46.7%. Furthermore, this study discusses methods that could significantly improve performance.

### CRepair: CVAE-based Automatic Vulnerability Repair Technology
**Authors**: Penghui Liu, Yingzhou Bi, Jiangtao Huang, Xinxin Jiang, Lianmei Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T12:55:04Z

**Summary**: Software vulnerabilities are flaws in computer software systems that pose significant threats to the integrity, security, and reliability of modern software and its application data. These vulnerabilities can lead to substantial economic losses across various industries. Manual vulnerability repair is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors. To address the challenges of vulnerability repair, researchers have proposed various solutions, with learning-based automatic vulnerability repair techniques gaining widespread attention. However, existing methods often focus on learning more vulnerability data to improve repair outcomes, while neglecting the diverse characteristics of vulnerable code, and suffer from imprecise vulnerability localization.To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes CRepair, a CVAE-based automatic vulnerability repair technology aimed at fixing security vulnerabilities in system code. We first preprocess the vulnerability data using a prompt-based method to serve as input to the model. Then, we apply causal inference techniques to map the vulnerability feature data to probability distributions. By employing multi-sample feature fusion, we capture diverse vulnerability feature information. Finally, conditional control is used to guide the model in repairing the vulnerabilities.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms other benchmark models, achieving a perfect repair rate of 52%. The effectiveness of the approach is validated from multiple perspectives, advancing AI-driven code vulnerability repair and showing promising applications.

### Confidence Regulation Neurons in Language Models
**Authors**: Alessandro Stolfo, Ben Wu, Wes Gurnee, Yonatan Belinkov, Xingyi Song, Mrinmaya Sachan, Neel Nanda

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T12:54:16Z

**Summary**: Despite their widespread use, the mechanisms by which large language models (LLMs) represent and regulate uncertainty in next-token predictions remain largely unexplored. This study investigates two critical components believed to influence this uncertainty: the recently discovered entropy neurons and a new set of components that we term token frequency neurons. Entropy neurons are characterized by an unusually high weight norm and influence the final layer normalization (LayerNorm) scale to effectively scale down the logits. Our work shows that entropy neurons operate by writing onto an unembedding null space, allowing them to impact the residual stream norm with minimal direct effect on the logits themselves. We observe the presence of entropy neurons across a range of models, up to 7 billion parameters. On the other hand, token frequency neurons, which we discover and describe here for the first time, boost or suppress each token's logit proportionally to its log frequency, thereby shifting the output distribution towards or away from the unigram distribution. Finally, we present a detailed case study where entropy neurons actively manage confidence in the setting of induction, i.e. detecting and continuing repeated subsequences.

**Authors**: Francesco Verdini, Pierfrancesco Melucci, Stefano Perna, Francesco Cariaggi, Marco Gaido, Sara Papi, Szymon Mazurek, Marek Kasztelnik, Luisa Bentivogli, Sébastien Bratières, Paolo Merialdo, Simone Scardapane

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T12:44:49Z

**Summary**: The remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) has driven research efforts to leverage them for a wide range of tasks and input modalities. In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.

### Analyzing Logs of Large-Scale Software Systems using Time Curves   Visualization
**Authors**: Dmytro Borysenkov, Adriano Vogel, Sören Henning, Esteban Perez-Wohlfeil

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T12:42:45Z

**Summary**: Logs are crucial for analyzing large-scale software systems, offering insights into system health, performance, security threats, potential bugs, etc. However, their chaotic nature$\unicode{x2013}$characterized by sheer volume, lack of standards, and variability$\unicode{x2013}$makes manual analysis complex. The use of clustering algorithms can assist by grouping logs into a smaller set of templates, but lose the temporal and relational context in doing so. On the contrary, Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide meaningful explanations but struggle with processing large collections efficiently. Moreover, representation techniques for both approaches are typically limited to either plain text or traditional charting, especially when dealing with large-scale systems. In this paper, we combine clustering and LLM summarization with event detection and Multidimensional Scaling through the use of Time Curves to produce a holistic pipeline that enables efficient and automatic summarization of vast collections of software system logs. The core of our approach is the proposal of a semimetric distance that effectively measures similarity between events, thus enabling a meaningful representation. We show that our method can explain the main events of logs collected from different applications without prior knowledge. We also show how the approach can be used to detect general trends as well as outliers in parallel and distributed systems by overlapping multiple projections. As a result, we expect a significant reduction of the time required to analyze and resolve system-wide issues, identify performance bottlenecks and security risks, debug applications, etc.

### SM3-Text-to-Query: Synthetic Multi-Model Medical Text-to-Query Benchmark
**Authors**: Sithursan Sivasubramaniam, Cedric Osei-Akoto, Yi Zhang, Kurt Stockinger, Jonathan Fuerst

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T12:27:13Z

**Summary**: Electronic health records (EHRs) are stored in various database systems with different database models on heterogeneous storage architectures, such as relational databases, document stores, or graph databases. These different database models have a big impact on query complexity and performance. While this has been a known fact in database research, its implications for the growing number of Text-to-Query systems have surprisingly not been investigated so far. In this paper, we present SM3-Text-to-Query, the first multi-model medical Text-to-Query benchmark based on synthetic patient data from Synthea, following the SNOMED-CT taxonomy -- a widely used knowledge graph ontology covering medical terminology. SM3-Text-to-Query provides data representations for relational databases (PostgreSQL), document stores (MongoDB), and graph databases (Neo4j and GraphDB (RDF)), allowing the evaluation across four popular query languages, namely SQL, MQL, Cypher, and SPARQL. We systematically and manually develop 408 template questions, which we augment to construct a benchmark of 10K diverse natural language question/query pairs for these four query languages (40K pairs overall). On our dataset, we evaluate several common in-context-learning (ICL) approaches for a set of representative closed and open-source LLMs. Our evaluation sheds light on the trade-offs between database models and query languages for different ICL strategies and LLMs. Last, SM3-Text-to-Query is easily extendable to additional query languages or real, standard-based patient databases.

### The robustness of inferred envelope and core rotation rates of red-giant   stars from asteroseismology
**Authors**: F. Ahlborn, E. P. Bellinger, S. Hekker, S. Basu, D. Mokrytska

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T12:20:58Z

**Summary**: Rotation is an important, yet poorly-modelled phenomenon of stellar structure and evolution. Accurate estimates of internal rotation rates are therefore valuable for constraining stellar evolution models. We aim to assess the accuracy of asteroseismic estimates of internal rotation rates and how these depend on the fundamental stellar parameters. We apply the recently-developed method called extended-MOLA inversions to infer localised estimates of internal rotation rates of synthetic observations of red giants. We search for suitable reference stellar models following a grid-based approach, and assess the robustness of the resulting inferences to the choice of reference model. We find that matching the mixed mode pattern between the observation and the reference model is an important criterion to select suitable reference models. We propose to i) select a set of reference models based on the correlation between the observed rotational splittings and the mode-trapping parameter ii) compute rotation rates for all these models iii) use the mean value obtained across the whole set as the estimate of the internal rotation rates. We find that the effect of a near surface perturbation in the synthetic observations on the rotation rates estimated based on the correlation between the observed rotational splittings and the mode-trapping parameter is negligible. We conclude that when using an ensemble of reference models, constructed based on matching the mixed mode pattern, the input rotation rates can be recovered across a range of fundamental stellar parameters like mass, mixing-length parameter and composition. Further, red-giant rotation rates determined in this way are also independent of a near surface perturbation of stellar structure.

### An Early FIRST Reproduction and Improvements to Single-Token Decoding   for Fast Listwise Reranking
**Authors**: Zijian Chen, Ronak Pradeep, Jimmy Lin

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T12:08:17Z

**Summary**: Recent advances have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) excel as listwise rerankers, but their high computational demands remain a barrier to widespread adoption. Further, the traditional language modeling (LM) objective is not ideally suited for reranking tasks. FIRST is a novel approach that addresses these challenges by integrating a learning-to-rank objective and leveraging the logits of only the first generated token, thereby significantly reducing inference latency compared to traditional LLM rerankers. In this study, we extend the evaluation of FIRST to the TREC Deep Learning datasets (DL19-22), validating its robustness across diverse domains. We investigate the influence of different first-stage retrievers on FIRST rerankers, observing diminishing returns and patterns consistent with traditional LLM rerankers. Through applying the FIRST objective to a broader range of backbone models, we achieve effectiveness surpassing the original implementation. Our experiments confirm that fast reranking with single-token logits does not compromise out-of-domain reranking quality. To better quantify the computational savings in the original study, we measure and compare latency to find a 21%-42% gain across various models and benchmarks. Moreover, while LM training implicitly improves zero-shot single-token reranking, our experiments also raise questions about whether LM pre-training may hinder subsequent fine-tuning with the FIRST objective. These findings pave the way for more efficient and effective listwise reranking in future applications.

### LBPE: Long-token-first Tokenization to Improve Large Language Models
**Authors**: Haoran Lian, Yizhe Xiong, Zijia Lin, Jianwei Niu, Shasha Mo, Hui Chen, Peng Liu, Guiguang Ding

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T12:03:36Z

**Summary**: The prevalent use of Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) in Large Language Models (LLMs) facilitates robust handling of subword units and avoids issues of out-of-vocabulary words. Despite its success, a critical challenge persists: long tokens, rich in semantic information, have fewer occurrences in tokenized datasets compared to short tokens, which can result in imbalanced learning issue across different tokens. To address that, we propose LBPE, which prioritizes long tokens during the encoding process. LBPE generates tokens according to their reverse ranks of token length rather than their ranks in the vocabulary, granting longer tokens higher priority during the encoding process. Consequently, LBPE smooths the frequency differences between short and long tokens, and thus mitigates the learning imbalance. Extensive experiments across diverse language modeling tasks demonstrate that LBPE consistently outperforms the original BPE, well demonstrating its effectiveness.

### KyrgyzNLP: Challenges, Progress, and Future
**Authors**: Anton Alekseev, Timur Turatali

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T12:03:31Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have excelled in numerous benchmarks, advancing AI applications in both linguistic and non-linguistic tasks. However, this has primarily benefited well-resourced languages, leaving less-resourced ones (LRLs) at a disadvantage. In this paper, we highlight the current state of the NLP field in the specific LRL: kyrgyz tili.   Human evaluation, including annotated datasets created by native speakers, remains an irreplaceable component of reliable NLP performance, especially for LRLs where automatic evaluations can fall short. In recent assessments of the resources for Turkic languages, Kyrgyz is labeled with the status 'Scraping By', a severely under-resourced language spoken by millions. This is concerning given the growing importance of the language, not only in Kyrgyzstan but also among diaspora communities where it holds no official status.   We review prior efforts in the field, noting that many of the publicly available resources have only recently been developed, with few exceptions beyond dictionaries (the processed data used for the analysis is presented at https://kyrgyznlp.github.io/). While recent papers have made some headway, much more remains to be done. Despite interest and support from both business and government sectors in the Kyrgyz Republic, the situation for Kyrgyz language resources remains challenging. We stress the importance of community-driven efforts to build these resources, ensuring the future advancement sustainability. We then share our view of the most pressing challenges in Kyrgyz NLP. Finally, we propose a roadmap for future development in terms of research topics and language resources.

### Estimating location parameters of two exponential distributions with   ordered scale parameters
**Authors**: Lakshmi Kanta Patra, Constantinos Petropoulos, Shrajal Bajpai, Naresh Garg

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T11:35:38Z

**Summary**: In the usual statistical inference problem, we estimate an unknown parameter of a statistical model using the information in the random sample. A priori information about the parameter is also known in several real-life situations. One such information is order restriction between the parameters. This prior formation improves the estimation quality. In this paper, we deal with the component-wise estimation of location parameters of two exponential distributions studied with ordered scale parameters under a bowl-shaped affine invariant loss function and generalized Pitman closeness criterion. We have shown that several benchmark estimators, such as maximum likelihood estimators (MLE), uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimators (UMVUE), and best affine equivariant estimators (BAEE), are inadmissible. We have given sufficient conditions under which the dominating estimators are derived. Under the generalized Pitman closeness criterion, a Stein-type improved estimator is proposed. As an application, we have considered special sampling schemes such as type-II censoring, progressive type-II censoring, and record values. Finally, we perform a simulation study to compare the risk performance of the improved estimators

### EUREKHA: Enhancing User Representation for Key Hackers Identification in   Underground Forums
**Authors**: Abdoul Nasser Hassane Amadou, Anas Motii, Saida Elouardi, EL Houcine Bergou

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T11:09:45Z

**Summary**: Underground forums serve as hubs for cybercriminal activities, offering a space for anonymity and evasion of conventional online oversight. In these hidden communities, malicious actors collaborate to exchange illicit knowledge, tools, and tactics, driving a range of cyber threats from hacking techniques to the sale of stolen data, malware, and zero-day exploits. Identifying the key instigators (i.e., key hackers), behind these operations is essential but remains a complex challenge. This paper presents a novel method called EUREKHA (Enhancing User Representation for Key Hacker Identification in Underground Forums), designed to identify these key hackers by modeling each user as a textual sequence. This sequence is processed through a large language model (LLM) for domain-specific adaptation, with LLMs acting as feature extractors. These extracted features are then fed into a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to model user structural relationships, significantly improving identification accuracy. Furthermore, we employ BERTopic (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Topic Modeling) to extract personalized topics from user-generated content, enabling multiple textual representations per user and optimizing the selection of the most representative sequence. Our study demonstrates that fine-tuned LLMs outperform state-of-the-art methods in identifying key hackers. Additionally, when combined with GNNs, our model achieves significant improvements, resulting in approximately 6% and 10% increases in accuracy and F1-score, respectively, over existing methods. EUREKHA was tested on the Hack-Forums dataset, and we provide open-source access to our code.

### Enhancing Robustness in Language-Driven Robotics: A Modular Approach to   Failure Reduction
**Authors**: Émiland Garrabé, Pierre Teixeira, Mahdi Khoramshahi, Stéphane Doncieux

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T11:00:05Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to significant progress in robotics, enabling embodied agents to better understand and execute open-ended tasks. However, existing approaches using LLMs face limitations in grounding their outputs within the physical environment and aligning with the capabilities of the robot. This challenge becomes even more pronounced with smaller language models, which are more computationally efficient but less robust in task planning and execution. In this paper, we present a novel modular architecture designed to enhance the robustness of LLM-driven robotics by addressing these grounding and alignment issues. We formalize the task planning problem within a goal-conditioned POMDP framework, identify key failure modes in LLM-driven planning, and propose targeted design principles to mitigate these issues. Our architecture introduces an ``expected outcomes'' module to prevent mischaracterization of subgoals and a feedback mechanism to enable real-time error recovery. Experimental results, both in simulation and on physical robots, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves task success rates for pick-and-place and manipulation tasks compared to both larger LLMs and standard baselines. Through hardware experiments, we also demonstrate how our architecture can be run efficiently and locally. This work highlights the potential of smaller, locally-executable LLMs in robotics and provides a scalable, efficient solution for robust task execution.

### Bridging the Gap between Learning and Inference for Diffusion-Based   Molecule Generation
**Authors**: Peidong Liu, Wenbo Zhang, Xue Zhe, Jiancheng Lv, Xianggen Liu

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T10:53:39Z

**Summary**: The efficacy of diffusion models in generating a spectrum of data modalities, including images, text, and videos, has spurred inquiries into their utility in molecular generation, yielding significant advancements in the field. However, the molecular generation process with diffusion models involves multiple autoregressive steps over a finite time horizon, leading to exposure bias issues inherently. To address the exposure bias issue, we propose a training framework named GapDiff. The core idea of GapDiff is to utilize model-predicted conformations as ground truth probabilistically during training, aiming to mitigate the data distributional disparity between training and inference, thereby enhancing the affinity of generated molecules. We conduct experiments using a 3D molecular generation model on the CrossDocked2020 dataset, and the vina energy and diversity demonstrate the potency of our framework with superior affinity. GapDiff is available at \url{https://github.com/HUGHNew/gapdiff}.

### Hi-SAM: Marrying Segment Anything Model for Hierarchical Text   Segmentation
**Authors**: Maoyuan Ye, Jing Zhang, Juhua Liu, Chenyu Liu, Baocai Yin, Cong Liu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T10:45:12Z

**Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a profound vision foundation model pretrained on a large-scale dataset, breaks the boundaries of general segmentation and sparks various downstream applications. This paper introduces Hi-SAM, a unified model leveraging SAM for hierarchical text segmentation. Hi-SAM excels in segmentation across four hierarchies, including pixel-level text, word, text-line, and paragraph, while realizing layout analysis as well. Specifically, we first turn SAM into a high-quality pixel-level text segmentation (TS) model through a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach. We use this TS model to iteratively generate the pixel-level text labels in a semi-automatical manner, unifying labels across the four text hierarchies in the HierText dataset. Subsequently, with these complete labels, we launch the end-to-end trainable Hi-SAM based on the TS architecture with a customized hierarchical mask decoder. During inference, Hi-SAM offers both automatic mask generation (AMG) mode and promptable segmentation (PS) mode. In the AMG mode, Hi-SAM segments pixel-level text foreground masks initially, then samples foreground points for hierarchical text mask generation and achieves layout analysis in passing. As for the PS mode, Hi-SAM provides word, text-line, and paragraph masks with a single point click. Experimental results show the state-of-the-art performance of our TS model: 84.86% fgIOU on Total-Text and 88.96% fgIOU on TextSeg for pixel-level text segmentation. Moreover, compared to the previous specialist for joint hierarchical detection and layout analysis on HierText, Hi-SAM achieves significant improvements: 4.73% PQ and 5.39% F1 on the text-line level, 5.49% PQ and 7.39% F1 on the paragraph level layout analysis, requiring $20\times$ fewer training epochs. The code is available at https://github.com/ymy-k/Hi-SAM.

### Deterministic Uncertainty Propagation for Improved Model-Based Offline   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Abdullah Akgül, Manuel Haußmann, Melih Kandemir

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T10:38:26Z

**Summary**: Current approaches to model-based offline reinforcement learning often incorporate uncertainty-based reward penalization to address the distributional shift problem. These approaches, commonly known as pessimistic value iteration, use Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the Bellman target to perform temporal difference based policy evaluation. We find out that the randomness caused by this sampling step significantly delays convergence. We present a theoretical result demonstrating the strong dependency of suboptimality on the number of Monte Carlo samples taken per Bellman target calculation. Our main contribution is a deterministic approximation to the Bellman target that uses progressive moment matching, a method developed originally for deterministic variational inference. The resulting algorithm, which we call Moment Matching Offline Model-Based Policy Optimization (MOMBO), propagates the uncertainty of the next state through a nonlinear Q-network in a deterministic fashion by approximating the distributions of hidden layer activations by a normal distribution. We show that it is possible to provide tighter guarantees for the suboptimality of MOMBO than the existing Monte Carlo sampling approaches. We also observe MOMBO to converge faster than these approaches in a large set of benchmark tasks.

### Provably Transformers Harness Multi-Concept Word Semantics for Efficient   In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Dake Bu, Wei Huang, Andi Han, Atsushi Nitanda, Taiji Suzuki, Qingfu Zhang, Hau-San Wong

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T10:30:59Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have displayed remarkable creative prowess and emergence capabilities. Existing empirical studies have revealed a strong connection between these LLMs' impressive emergence abilities and their in-context learning (ICL) capacity, allowing them to solve new tasks using only task-specific prompts without further fine-tuning. On the other hand, existing empirical and theoretical studies also show that there is a linear regularity of the multi-concept encoded semantic representation behind transformer-based LLMs. However, existing theoretical work fail to build up an understanding of the connection between this regularity and the innovative power of ICL. Additionally, prior work often focuses on simplified, unrealistic scenarios involving linear transformers or unrealistic loss functions, and they achieve only linear or sub-linear convergence rates. In contrast, this work provides a fine-grained mathematical analysis to show how transformers leverage the multi-concept semantics of words to enable powerful ICL and excellent out-of-distribution ICL abilities, offering insights into how transformers innovate solutions for certain unseen tasks encoded with multiple cross-concept semantics. Inspired by empirical studies on the linear latent geometry of LLMs, the analysis is based on a concept-based low-noise sparse coding prompt model. Leveraging advanced techniques, this work showcases the exponential 0-1 loss convergence over the highly non-convex training dynamics, which pioneeringly incorporates the challenges of softmax self-attention, ReLU-activated MLPs, and cross-entropy loss. Empirical simulations corroborate the theoretical findings.

### WorkflowLLM: Enhancing Workflow Orchestration Capability of Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Shengda Fan, Xin Cong, Yuepeng Fu, Zhong Zhang, Shuyan Zhang, Yuanwei Liu, Yesai Wu, Yankai Lin, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T09:58:02Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have driven a revolutionary paradigm shift in process automation from Robotic Process Automation to Agentic Process Automation by automating the workflow orchestration procedure based on LLMs. However, existing LLMs (even the advanced OpenAI GPT-4o) are confined to achieving satisfactory capability in workflow orchestration. To address this limitation, we present WorkflowLLM, a data-centric framework elaborately designed to enhance the capability of LLMs in workflow orchestration. It first constructs a large-scale fine-tuning dataset WorkflowBench with 106,763 samples, covering 1,503 APIs from 83 applications across 28 categories. Specifically, the construction process can be divided into three phases: (1) Data Collection: we collect real-world workflow data from Apple Shortcuts and RoutineHub, transcribing them into Python-style code. We further equip them with generated hierarchical thought via ChatGPT. (2) Query Expansion: we prompt ChatGPT to generate more task queries to enrich the diversity and complexity of workflows. (3) Workflow Generation: we leverage an annotator model trained on collected data to generate workflows for synthesized queries. Finally, we merge the synthetic samples that pass quality confirmation with the collected samples to obtain the WorkflowBench. Based on WorkflowBench, we fine-tune Llama-3.1-8B to obtain WorkflowLlama. Our experiments show that WorkflowLlama demonstrates a strong capacity to orchestrate complex workflows, while also achieving notable generalization performance on previously unseen APIs. Additionally, WorkflowBench exhibits robust zero-shot generalization capabilities on an out-of-distribution task planning dataset, T-Eval. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/WorkflowLLM.

**Authors**: Dincy R. Arikkat, Abhinav M., Navya Binu, Parvathi M., Navya Biju, K. S. Arunima, Vinod P., Rafidha Rehiman K. A., Mauro Conti

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T09:40:53Z

**Summary**: In the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber security, intelligent chatbots are gaining prominence. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing empower these chatbots to handle user inquiries and deliver threat intelligence. This helps cyber security knowledge readily available to both professionals and the public. Traditional rule-based chatbots often lack flexibility and struggle to adapt to user interactions. In contrast, Large Language Model-based chatbots offer contextually relevant information across multiple domains and adapt to evolving conversational contexts. In this work, we develop IntellBot, an advanced cyber security Chatbot built on top of cutting-edge technologies like Large Language Models and Langchain alongside a Retrieval-Augmented Generation model to deliver superior capabilities. This chatbot gathers information from diverse data sources to create a comprehensive knowledge base covering known vulnerabilities, recent cyber attacks, and emerging threats. It delivers tailored responses, serving as a primary hub for cyber security insights. By providing instant access to relevant information and resources, this IntellBot enhances threat intelligence, incident response, and overall security posture, saving time and empowering users with knowledge of cyber security best practices. Moreover, we analyzed the performance of our copilot using a two-stage evaluation strategy. We achieved BERT score above 0.8 by indirect approach and a cosine similarity score ranging from 0.8 to 1, which affirms the accuracy of our copilot. Additionally, we utilized RAGAS to evaluate the RAG model, and all evaluation metrics consistently produced scores above 0.77, highlighting the efficacy of our system.

### Kicking time back in black-hole mergers: Ancestral masses, spins, birth   recoils and hierarchical-formation viability of GW190521
**Authors**: Carlos Araújo Álvarez, Henry W. Y. Wong, Anna Liu, Juan Calderón Bustillo

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T09:34:01Z

**Summary**: Pair-instability supernova (PISN) prevents black-hole formation from stellar collapse within the approximate mass range $M\in [65,130]M_\odot$. However, such black holes may form hierarchically through merging ancestral black holes, whose properties determine those of the ``child'' one: mass, spin, and recoil velocity. Crucially, the child will leave its host environment if its ``birth recoil'' exceeds the corresponding escape velocity, preventing further mergers. We exploit relations between the final recoil and spin of quasi-circular black-hole mergers to obtain posterior probability distributions for the hypothetical ancestral masses, spins and birth recoils of the component black holes of GW190521. To this, we present a Bayesian framework applicable to existing estimates for the components of black-hole merger observations. We consider both the quasi-circular (generically spinning) analysis performed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration and the eccentric (aligned-spin) one performed by Romero-Shaw et. al. We evaluate the probability $p_{2g}$ that the GW190521 components inferred by these analyses formed from the merger of stellar-origin black holes and were retained by their environment. For the primary component, which populates the PISN gap, such scenario is strongly suppressed if GW190521 happened in a Globular Cluster with $p_{2g} \sim 10^{-3}$ unless it was quasi-circular and its ancestors had aligned-spins, uncharacteristic of hierarchical formation channels, or small spins, which yields $p_{2g} \simeq 10^{-2}$. If GW190521 was eccentric, we obtain $p_{2g} \simeq 0.1$ for any host other than an AGN, and zero for a Globular Cluster. If GW190521 was quasi-circular, a Nuclear-Star Cluster origin is possible with $p_{2g} \in (\sim 0.4 \sim ,0.8)$

### VISTA: Visual Integrated System for Tailored Automation in Math Problem   Generation Using LLM
**Authors**: Jeongwoo Lee, Kwangsuk Park, Jihyeon Park

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T09:15:56Z

**Summary**: Generating accurate and consistent visual aids is a critical challenge in mathematics education, where visual representations like geometric shapes and functions play a pivotal role in enhancing student comprehension. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the creation of complex mathematical visualizations alongside coherent problem text. Our approach not only simplifies the generation of precise visual aids but also aligns these aids with the problem's core mathematical concepts, improving both problem creation and assessment. By integrating multiple agents, each responsible for distinct tasks such as numeric calculation, geometry validation, and visualization, our system delivers mathematically accurate and contextually relevant problems with visual aids. Evaluation across Geometry and Function problem types shows that our method significantly outperforms basic LLMs in terms of text coherence, consistency, relevance and similarity, while maintaining the essential geometrical and functional integrity of the original problems. Although some challenges remain in ensuring consistent visual outputs, our framework demonstrates the immense potential of LLMs in transforming the way educators generate and utilize visual aids in math education.

### Seq1F1B: Efficient Sequence-Level Pipeline Parallelism for Large   Language Model Training
**Authors**: Ao Sun, Weilin Zhao, Xu Han, Cheng Yang, Xinrong Zhang, Zhiyuan Liu, Chuan Shi, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T09:02:24Z

**Summary**: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on distributed training strategies, among which pipeline parallelism plays a crucial role. As LLMs' training sequence length extends to 32k or even 128k, the current pipeline parallel methods face severe bottlenecks, including high memory footprints and substantial pipeline bubbles, greatly hindering model scalability and training throughput. To enhance memory efficiency and training throughput, in this work, we introduce an efficient sequence-level one-forward-one-backward (1F1B) pipeline scheduling method tailored for training LLMs on long sequences named Seq1F1B. Seq1F1B decomposes batch-level schedulable units into finer sequence-level units, reducing bubble size and memory footprint. Considering that Seq1F1B may produce slight extra bubbles if sequences are split evenly, we design a computation-wise strategy to partition input sequences and mitigate this side effect. Compared to competitive pipeline baseline methods such as Megatron 1F1B pipeline parallelism, our method achieves higher training throughput with less memory footprint. Notably, Seq1F1B efficiently trains a LLM with 30B parameters on sequences up to 64k using 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs without recomputation strategies, a feat unachievable with existing methods. Our source code is based on Megatron-LM, and now is avaiable at: https://github.com/MayDomine/Seq1F1B.git.

### Web Archives Metadata Generation with GPT-4o: Challenges and Insights
**Authors**: Abigail Yongping Huang, Ashwin Nair, Zhen Rong Goh, Tianrui Liu

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T08:59:40Z

**Summary**: Current metadata creation for web archives is time consuming and costly due to reliance on human effort. This paper explores the use of gpt-4o for metadata generation within the Web Archive Singapore, focusing on scalability, efficiency, and cost effectiveness. We processed 112 Web ARChive (WARC) files using data reduction techniques, achieving a notable 99.9% reduction in metadata generation costs. By prompt engineering, we generated titles and abstracts, which were evaluated both intrinsically using Levenshtein Distance and BERTScore, and extrinsically with human cataloguers using McNemar's test. Results indicate that while our method offers significant cost savings and efficiency gains, human curated metadata maintains an edge in quality. The study identifies key challenges including content inaccuracies, hallucinations, and translation issues, suggesting that Large Language Models (LLMs) should serve as complements rather than replacements for human cataloguers. Future work will focus on refining prompts, improving content filtering, and addressing privacy concerns through experimentation with smaller models. This research advances the integration of LLMs in web archiving, offering valuable insights into their current capabilities and outlining directions for future enhancements. The code is available at https://github.com/masamune-prog/warc2summary for further development and use by institutions facing similar challenges.

### Curry-DPO: Enhancing Alignment using Curriculum Learning & Ranked   Preferences
**Authors**: Pulkit Pattnaik, Rishabh Maheshwary, Kelechi Ogueji, Vikas Yadav, Sathwik Tejaswi Madhusudhan

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T08:55:00Z

**Summary**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective technique that leverages pairwise preference data (usually one chosen and rejected response pair per user prompt) to align LLMs to human preferences. In practice, multiple responses can exist for a given prompt with varying quality relative to each other. With availability of such quality ratings for multiple responses, we propose utilizing these responses to create multiple preference pairs for a given prompt. Our work focuses on systematically using the constructed multiple preference pair in DPO training via curriculum learning methodology. In particular, we order these multiple pairs of preference data from easy to hard (emulating curriculum training) according to various criteria. We show detailed comparisons of our proposed approach to the standard single-pair DPO setting. Our method, which we call Curry-DPO consistently shows increased performance gains on MTbench, Vicuna, WizardLM, and the UltraFeedback test set, highlighting its effectiveness. More specifically, Curry-DPO achieves a score of 7.43 on MT-bench with Zephy-7B model outperforming majority of existing LLMs with similar parameter size. Curry-DPO also achieves the highest adjusted win rates on Vicuna, WizardLM, and UltraFeedback test datasets (90.7%, 87.1%, and 87.9% respectively) in our experiments, with notable gains of upto 7.5% when compared to standard DPO technique. We release the preference pairs used in alignment at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ServiceNow-AI/Curriculum_DPO_preferences

### Gap-Filling Prompting Enhances Code-Assisted Mathematical Reasoning
**Authors**: Mohammad Ghiasvand Mohammadkhani

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T08:52:59Z

**Summary**: Despite the strong performance of large language models (LLMs) in tasks like mathematical reasoning, their practical use is limited by high computational demands and proprietary restrictions. Chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT) fine-tuning are common methods to transfer LLM knowledge to small language models (SLMs). However, CoT often leads to calculation errors in SLMs, while PoT has shown more promise. While most PoT-based approaches focus on direct problem-to-code conversion or extracting only the key information from questions and then providing code solution for it, this work emphasizes filling the gaps in the question to clearly illustrate the solution path, which can be challenging for an SLM to understand when such information is not explicitly provided. Therefore, this paper introduces Gap-Filling Prompting (GFP), a novel two-step prompting strategy designed to enhance the problem-solving process for SLMs. The first step identifies these gaps and provides hints for filling them, while the second step adds the hints to the question to generate a final code solution. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that GFP significantly improves the mathematical reasoning abilities of SLMs.

### Benchmarking Distributional Alignment of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Nicole Meister, Carlos Guestrin, Tatsunori Hashimoto

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T08:41:17Z

**Summary**: Language models (LMs) are increasingly used as simulacra for people, yet their ability to match the distribution of views of a specific demographic group and be \textit{distributionally aligned} remains uncertain. This notion of distributional alignment is complex, as there is significant variation in the types of attributes that are simulated. Prior works have underexplored the role of three critical variables -- the question domain, steering method, and distribution expression method -- which motivates our contribution of a benchmark explicitly addressing these dimensions. We construct a dataset expanding beyond political values, create human baselines for this task, and evaluate the extent to which an LM can align with a particular group's opinion distribution to inform design choices of such simulation systems. Our analysis reveals open problems regarding if, and how, LMs can be used to simulate humans, and that LLMs can more accurately describe the opinion distribution than simulate such distributions.

### GraphXAIN: Narratives to Explain Graph Neural Networks
**Authors**: Mateusz Cedro, David Martens

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T08:29:10Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a powerful technique for machine learning on graph-structured data, yet they pose interpretability challenges, especially for non-expert users. Existing GNN explanation methods often yield technical outputs such as subgraphs and feature importance scores, which are not easily understood. Building on recent insights from social science and other Explainable AI (XAI) methods, we propose GraphXAIN, a natural language narrative that explains individual predictions made by GNNs. We present a model-agnostic and explainer-agnostic XAI approach that complements graph explainers by generating GraphXAINs, using Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrating graph data, individual predictions from GNNs, explanatory subgraphs, and feature importances. We define XAI Narratives and XAI Descriptions, highlighting their distinctions and emphasizing the importance of narrative principles in effective explanations. By incorporating natural language narratives, our approach supports graph practitioners and non-expert users, aligning with social science research on explainability and enhancing user understanding and trust in complex GNN models. We demonstrate GraphXAIN's capabilities on a real-world graph dataset, illustrating how its generated narratives can aid understanding compared to traditional graph explainer outputs or other descriptive explanation methods.

**Authors**: Yassine Abbahaddou, Sofiane Ennadir, Johannes F. Lutzeyer, Fragkiskos D. Malliaros, Michalis Vazirgiannis

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T08:26:42Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are nowadays the benchmark approach in graph representation learning, have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. While existing defense techniques primarily concentrate on the training phase of GNNs, involving adjustments to message passing architectures or pre-processing methods, there is a noticeable gap in methods focusing on increasing robustness during inference. In this context, this study introduces RobustCRF, a post-hoc approach aiming to enhance the robustness of GNNs at the inference stage. Our proposed method, founded on statistical relational learning using a Conditional Random Field, is model-agnostic and does not require prior knowledge about the underlying model architecture. We validate the efficacy of this approach across various models, leveraging benchmark node classification datasets.

### Lift-and-Embed Learning Methods for Solving Scalar Hyperbolic Equations   with Discontinuous Solutions
**Authors**: Zhenjiang Liu, Qi Sun, Xuejun Xu

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T07:33:30Z

**Summary**: Unlike traditional mesh-based approximations of differential operators, machine learning methods, which exploit the automatic differentiation of neural networks, have attracted increasing attention for their potential to mitigate stability issues encountered in the numerical simulation of hyperbolic conservation laws. However, solutions to hyperbolic problems are often piecewise smooth, rendering the differential form invalid along discontinuity interfaces and limiting the effectiveness of standard learning approaches. In this work, we propose lift-and-embed learning methods for solving scalar hyperbolic equations with discontinuous solutions, which consist of (i) embedding the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition within a higher-dimensional space through the inclusion of an augmented variable in the solution ansatz; (ii) utilizing physics-informed neural networks to manage the increased dimensionality and to address both linear and quasi-linear problems within a unified learning framework; and (iii) projecting the trained network solution back onto the original lower-dimensional plane to obtain the approximate solution. Besides, the location of discontinuity can be parametrized as extra model parameters and inferred concurrently with the training of network solution. With collocation points sampled on piecewise surfaces rather than distributed over the entire lifted space, we conduct numerical experiments on various benchmark problems to demonstrate the capability of our methods in resolving discontinuous solutions without spurious numerical smearing and oscillations.

### Robust and Efficient Fine-tuning of LLMs with Bayesian   Reparameterization of Low-Rank Adaptation
**Authors**: Ayan Sengupta, Vaibhav Seth, Arinjay Pathak, Natraj Raman, Sriram Gopalakrishnan, Tanmoy Chakraborty

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T07:31:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly resource-intensive to fine-tune due to their enormous size. While low-rank adaptation is a prominent parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach, it suffers from sensitivity to hyperparameter choices, leading to instability in model performance on fine-tuning downstream tasks. This paper highlights the importance of effective parameterization in low-rank fine-tuning to reduce estimator variance and enhance the stability of final model outputs. We propose MonteCLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning technique, employing Monte Carlo estimation to learn an unbiased posterior estimation of low-rank parameters with low expected variance, which stabilizes fine-tuned LLMs with only O(1) additional parameters. MonteCLoRA shows significant improvements in accuracy and robustness, achieving up to 3.8% higher accuracy and 8.6% greater robustness than existing efficient fine-tuning methods on natural language understanding tasks with pre-trained RoBERTa-base. Furthermore, in generative tasks with pre-trained LLaMA-1-7B, MonteCLoRA demonstrates robust zero-shot performance with 50% lower variance than the contemporary efficient fine-tuning methods. The theoretical and empirical results presented in the paper underscore how parameterization and hyperpriors balance exploration-exploitation in the low-rank parametric space, therefore leading to more optimal and robust parameter estimation during efficient fine-tuning.

### Is K-fold cross validation the best model selection method for Machine   Learning?
**Authors**: Juan M Gorriz, R. Martin Clemente, F Segovia, J Ramirez, A Ortiz, J. Suckling

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T07:30:25Z

**Summary**: As a technique that can compactly represent complex patterns, machine learning has significant potential for predictive inference. K-fold cross-validation (CV) is the most common approach to ascertaining the likelihood that a machine learning outcome is generated by chance, and it frequently outperforms conventional hypothesis testing. This improvement uses measures directly obtained from machine learning classifications, such as accuracy, that do not have a parametric description. To approach a frequentist analysis within machine learning pipelines, a permutation test or simple statistics from data partitions (i.e., folds) can be added to estimate confidence intervals. Unfortunately, neither parametric nor non-parametric tests solve the inherent problems of partitioning small sample-size datasets and learning from heterogeneous data sources. The fact that machine learning strongly depends on the learning parameters and the distribution of data across folds recapitulates familiar difficulties around excess false positives and replication. A novel statistical test based on K-fold CV and the Upper Bound of the actual risk (K-fold CUBV) is proposed, where uncertain predictions of machine learning with CV are bounded by the worst case through the evaluation of concentration inequalities. Probably Approximately Correct-Bayesian upper bounds for linear classifiers in combination with K-fold CV are derived and used to estimate the actual risk. The performance with simulated and neuroimaging datasets suggests that K-fold CUBV is a robust criterion for detecting effects and validating accuracy values obtained from machine learning and classical CV schemes, while avoiding excess false positives.

### Ev2R: Evaluating Evidence Retrieval in Automated Fact-Checking
**Authors**: Mubashara Akhtar, Michael Schlichtkrull, Andreas Vlachos

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T07:05:06Z

**Summary**: Current automated fact-checking (AFC) approaches commonly evaluate evidence either implicitly via the predicted verdicts or by comparing retrieved evidence with a predefined closed knowledge source, such as Wikipedia. However, these methods suffer from limitations, resulting from their reliance on evaluation metrics developed for different purposes and constraints imposed by closed knowledge sources. Recent advances in natural language generation (NLG) evaluation offer new possibilities for evidence assessment. In this work, we introduce Ev2R, an evaluation framework for AFC that comprises three types of approaches for evidence evaluation: reference-based, proxy-reference, and reference-less. We evaluate their effectiveness through agreement with human ratings and adversarial tests, and demonstrate that prompt-based scorers, particularly those leveraging LLMs and reference evidence, outperform traditional evaluation approaches.

### Robust Prompt Optimization for Defending Language Models Against   Jailbreaking Attacks
**Authors**: Andy Zhou, Bo Li, Haohan Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T06:57:05Z

**Summary**: Despite advances in AI alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks or jailbreaking, in which adversaries can modify prompts to induce unwanted behavior. While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art.

**Authors**: Hamed Karami, Amanda Bleichrodt, Ruiyan Luo, Gerardo Chowell

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T06:49:28Z

**Summary**: Background: Mathematical models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are essential tools across various scientific disciplines, including biology, ecology, and healthcare informatics. They are used to simulate complex dynamic systems and inform decision-making. In this paper, we introduce BayesianFitForecast, an R toolbox specifically developed to streamline Bayesian parameter estimation and forecasting in ODE models, making it particularly relevant to health informatics and public health decision-making. The toolbox is available at https://github.com/gchowell/BayesianFitForecast/.   Results: This toolbox enables automatic generation of Stan files, allowing users to configure models, define priors, and analyze results with minimal programming expertise. To demonstrate the versatility and robustness of BayesianFitForecast, we apply it to the analysis of the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francisco, comparing Poisson and negative binomial error structures within the SEIR model. We also test it by fitting multiple time series of state variables using simulated data. BayesianFitForecast provides robust tools for evaluating model performance, including convergence diagnostics, posterior distributions, credible intervals, and performance metrics.   Conclusion: By improving the accessibility of advanced Bayesian methods, this toolbox significantly broadens the application of Bayesian inference methods to dynamical systems critical for healthcare and epidemiological forecasting. A tutorial video demonstrating the toolbox's functionality is available at https://youtu.be/jnxMjz3V3n8.

### Enhancing Visual Classification using Comparative Descriptors
**Authors**: Hankyeol Lee, Gawon Seo, Wonseok Choi, Geunyoung Jung, Kyungwoo Song, Jiyoung Jung

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T06:28:02Z

**Summary**: The performance of vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, in visual classification tasks, has been enhanced by leveraging semantic knowledge from large language models (LLMs), including GPT. Recent studies have shown that in zero-shot classification tasks, descriptors incorporating additional cues, high-level concepts, or even random characters often outperform those using only the category name. In many classification tasks, while the top-1 accuracy may be relatively low, the top-5 accuracy is often significantly higher. This gap implies that most misclassifications occur among a few similar classes, highlighting the model's difficulty in distinguishing between classes with subtle differences. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel concept of comparative descriptors. These descriptors emphasize the unique features of a target class against its most similar classes, enhancing differentiation. By generating and integrating these comparative descriptors into the classification framework, we refine the semantic focus and improve classification accuracy. An additional filtering process ensures that these descriptors are closer to the image embeddings in the CLIP space, further enhancing performance. Our approach demonstrates improved accuracy and robustness in visual classification tasks by addressing the specific challenge of subtle inter-class differences.

### Controlling Grokking with Nonlinearity and Data Symmetry
**Authors**: Ahmed Salah, David Yevick

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T06:19:29Z

**Summary**: This paper demonstrates that grokking behavior in modular arithmetic with a modulus P in a neural network can be controlled by modifying the profile of the activation function as well as the depth and width of the model. Plotting the even PCA projections of the weights of the last NN layer against their odd projections further yields patterns which become significantly more uniform when the nonlinearity is increased by incrementing the number of layers. These patterns can be employed to factor P when P is nonprime. Finally, a metric for the generalization ability of the network is inferred from the entropy of the layer weights while the degree of nonlinearity is related to correlations between the local entropy of the weights of the neurons in the final layer.

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T06:12:56Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Diagram of Thought (DoT) have enabled the creation of autonomous intelligent systems capable of performing cluster diagnostics and troubleshooting. By integrating these technologies with self-play methodologies, we have developed an LLM-agent system designed to autonomously diagnose and resolve issues within AI clusters.

### A High-Performance List Decoding Algorithm for Surface Codes with   Erroneous Syndrome
**Authors**: Jifan Liang, Qianfan Wang, Lvzhou Li, Xiao Ma

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T06:08:02Z

**Summary**: Quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) are necessary for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Surface codes are a class of topological QECCs that have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional error-correcting capabilities and easy implementation. In the decoding process of surface codes, the syndromes are crucial for error correction, however, they are not always correctly measured. Most of the existing decoding algorithms for surface codes need extra measurements to correct syndromes with errors, which implies a potential increase in inference complexity and decoding latency. In this paper, we propose a high-performance list decoding algorithm for surface codes with erroneous syndromes, where syndrome soft information is incorporated in the decoding, allowing qubits and syndrome to be recovered without needing extra measurements. Precisely, we first use belief propagation (BP) decoding for pre-processing with syndrome soft information, followed by ordered statistics decoding (OSD) for post-processing to list and recover both qubits and syndromes. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm efficiently recovers erroneous syndromes and significantly improves the decoding performance of surface codes with erroneous syndromes compared to minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM), BP and original BP-OSD algorithms.

### Accelerating Greedy Coordinate Gradient and General Prompt Optimization   via Probe Sampling
**Authors**: Yiran Zhao, Wenyue Zheng, Tianle Cai, Xuan Long Do, Kenji Kawaguchi, Anirudh Goyal, Michael Shieh

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T06:07:51Z

**Summary**: Safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical issue given their rapid progresses. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing adversarial prompts to break the aligned LLMs, but optimization of GCG is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b-chat and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. Furthermore, probe sampling is also able to accelerate other prompt optimization techniques and adversarial methods, leading to acceleration of $1.8\times$ for AutoPrompt, $2.4\times$ for APE and $2.4\times$ for AutoDAN.

### LLM-PySC2: Starcraft II learning environment for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zongyuan Li, Yanan Ni, Runnan Qi, Lumin Jiang, Chang Lu, Xiaojie Xu, Xiangbei Liu, Pengfei Li, Yunzheng Guo, Zhe Ma, Xian Guo, Kuihua Huang, Xuebo Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T06:04:22Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a new environment LLM-PySC2 (the Large Language Model StarCraft II Learning Environment), a platform derived from DeepMind's StarCraft II Learning Environment that serves to develop Large Language Models (LLMs) based decision-making methodologies. This environment is the first to offer the complete StarCraft II action space, multi-modal observation interfaces, and a structured game knowledge database, which are seamlessly connected with various LLMs to facilitate the research of LLMs-based decision-making. To further support multi-agent research, we developed an LLM collaborative framework that supports multi-agent concurrent queries and multi-agent communication. In our experiments, the LLM-PySC2 environment is adapted to be compatible with the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) task group and provided eight new scenarios focused on macro-decision abilities. We evaluated nine mainstream LLMs in the experiments, and results show that sufficient parameters are necessary for LLMs to make decisions, but improving reasoning ability does not directly lead to better decision-making outcomes. Our findings further indicate the importance of enabling large models to learn autonomously in the deployment environment through parameter training or train-free learning techniques. Ultimately, we expect that the LLM-PySC2 environment can promote research on learning methods for LLMs, helping LLM-based methods better adapt to task scenarios.

### Reasoning Robustness of LLMs to Adversarial Typographical Errors
**Authors**: Esther Gan, Yiran Zhao, Liying Cheng, Yancan Mao, Anirudh Goyal, Kenji Kawaguchi, Min-Yen Kan, Michael Shieh

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T05:54:05Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, CoT can be biased by users' instruction. In this work, we study the reasoning robustness of LLMs to typographical errors, which can naturally occur in users' queries. We design an Adversarial Typo Attack ($\texttt{ATA}$) algorithm that iteratively samples typos for words that are important to the query and selects the edit that is most likely to succeed in attacking. It shows that LLMs are sensitive to minimal adversarial typographical changes. Notably, with 1 character edit, Mistral-7B-Instruct's accuracy drops from 43.7% to 38.6% on GSM8K, while with 8 character edits the performance further drops to 19.2%. To extend our evaluation to larger and closed-source LLMs, we develop the $\texttt{R$^2$ATA}$ benchmark, which assesses models' $\underline{R}$easoning $\underline{R}$obustness to $\underline{\texttt{ATA}}$. It includes adversarial typographical questions derived from three widely used reasoning datasets-GSM8K, BBH, and MMLU-by applying $\texttt{ATA}$ to open-source LLMs. $\texttt{R$^2$ATA}$ demonstrates remarkable transferability and causes notable performance drops across multiple super large and closed-source LLMs.

### SciDQA: A Deep Reading Comprehension Dataset over Scientific Papers
**Authors**: Shruti Singh, Nandan Sarkar, Arman Cohan

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T05:28:22Z

**Summary**: Scientific literature is typically dense, requiring significant background knowledge and deep comprehension for effective engagement. We introduce SciDQA, a new dataset for reading comprehension that challenges LLMs for a deep understanding of scientific articles, consisting of 2,937 QA pairs. Unlike other scientific QA datasets, SciDQA sources questions from peer reviews by domain experts and answers by paper authors, ensuring a thorough examination of the literature. We enhance the dataset's quality through a process that carefully filters out lower quality questions, decontextualizes the content, tracks the source document across different versions, and incorporates a bibliography for multi-document question-answering. Questions in SciDQA necessitate reasoning across figures, tables, equations, appendices, and supplementary materials, and require multi-document reasoning. We evaluate several open-source and proprietary LLMs across various configurations to explore their capabilities in generating relevant and factual responses. Our comprehensive evaluation, based on metrics for surface-level similarity and LLM judgements, highlights notable performance discrepancies. SciDQA represents a rigorously curated, naturally derived scientific QA dataset, designed to facilitate research on complex scientific text understanding.

### Exploring the LLM Journey from Cognition to Expression with Linear   Representations
**Authors**: Yuzi Yan, Jialian Li, Yipin Zhang, Dong Yan

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T05:19:48Z

**Summary**: This paper presents an in-depth examination of the evolution and interplay of cognitive and expressive capabilities in large language models (LLMs), with a specific focus on Baichuan-7B and Baichuan-33B, an advanced bilingual (Chinese and English) LLM series. We define and explore the model's cognitive and expressive capabilities through linear representations across three critical phases: Pretraining, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Cognitive capability is defined as the quantity and quality of information conveyed by the neuron output vectors within the network, similar to the neural signal processing in human cognition. Expressive capability is defined as the model's capability to produce word-level output. Our findings unveil a sequential development pattern, where cognitive abilities are largely established during Pretraining, whereas expressive abilities predominantly advance during SFT and RLHF. Statistical analyses confirm a significant correlation between the two capabilities, suggesting that cognitive capacity may limit expressive potential. The paper also explores the theoretical underpinnings of these divergent developmental trajectories and their connection to the LLMs' architectural design. Moreover, we evaluate various optimization-independent strategies, such as few-shot learning and repeated sampling, which bridge the gap between cognitive and expressive capabilities. This research reveals the potential connection between the hidden space and the output space, contributing valuable insights into the interpretability and controllability of their training processes.

### Discovering Latent Structural Causal Models from Spatio-Temporal Data
**Authors**: Kun Wang, Sumanth Varambally, Duncan Watson-Parris, Yi-An Ma, Rose Yu

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T05:12:16Z

**Summary**: Many important phenomena in scientific fields such as climate, neuroscience, and epidemiology are naturally represented as spatiotemporal gridded data with complex interactions. For example, in climate science, researchers aim to uncover how large-scale events, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO), influence other global processes. Inferring causal relationships from these data is a challenging problem compounded by the high dimensionality of such data and the correlations between spatially proximate points. We present SPACY (SPAtiotemporal Causal discoverY), a novel framework based on variational inference, designed to explicitly model latent time-series and their causal relationships from spatially confined modes in the data. Our method uses an end-to-end training process that maximizes an evidence-lower bound (ELBO) for the data likelihood. Theoretically, we show that, under some conditions, the latent variables are identifiable up to transformation by an invertible matrix. Empirically, we show that SPACY outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data, remains scalable for large grids, and identifies key known phenomena from real-world climate data.

### Hal-Eval: A Universal and Fine-grained Hallucination Evaluation   Framework for Large Vision Language Models
**Authors**: Chaoya Jiang, Hongrui Jia, Wei Ye, Mengfan Dong, Haiyang Xu, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Shikun Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T05:08:43Z

**Summary**: Large Vision Language Models exhibit remarkable capabilities but struggle with hallucinations inconsistencies between images and their descriptions. Previous hallucination evaluation studies on LVLMs have identified hallucinations in terms of objects, attributes, and relations but overlooked complex hallucinations that create an entire narrative around a fictional entity. In this paper, we introduce a refined taxonomy of hallucinations, featuring a new category: Event Hallucination. We then utilize advanced LLMs to generate and filter fine grained hallucinatory data consisting of various types of hallucinations, with a particular focus on event hallucinations, laying the groundwork for integrating discriminative and generative evaluation methods within our universal evaluation framework. The proposed benchmark distinctively assesses LVLMs ability to tackle a broad spectrum of hallucinations, making it a reliable and comprehensive tool for gauging LVLMs efficacy in handling hallucinations. We will release our code and data.

### Content Quality vs. Attention Allocation: An LLM-Based Case Study in   Peer-to-peer Mental Health Networks
**Authors**: Teng Ye, Hanson Yan, Xuhuan Huang, Connor Grogan, Walter Yuan, Qiaozhu Mei, Matthew O. Jackson

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T05:04:55Z

**Summary**: With the rise of social media and peer-to-peer networks, users increasingly rely on crowdsourced responses for information and assistance. However, the mechanisms used to rank and promote responses often prioritize and end up biasing in favor of timeliness over quality, which may result in suboptimal support for help-seekers. We analyze millions of responses to mental health-related posts, utilizing large language models (LLMs) to assess the multi-dimensional quality of content, including relevance, empathy, and cultural alignment, among other aspects. Our findings reveal a mismatch between content quality and attention allocation: earlier responses - despite being relatively lower in quality - receive disproportionately high fractions of upvotes and visibility due to platform ranking algorithms. We demonstrate that the quality of the top-ranked responses could be improved by up to 39 percent, and even the simplest re-ranking strategy could significantly improve the quality of top responses, highlighting the need for more nuanced ranking mechanisms that prioritize both timeliness and content quality, especially emotional engagement in online mental health communities.

**Summary**: Latent representation alignment has become a foundational technique for constructing multimodal large language models (MLLM) by mapping embeddings from different modalities into a shared space, often aligned with the embedding space of large language models (LLMs) to enable effective cross-modal understanding. While preliminary protein-focused MLLMs have emerged, they have predominantly relied on heuristic approaches, lacking a fundamental understanding of optimal alignment practices across representations. In this study, we explore the alignment of multimodal representations between LLMs and Geometric Deep Models (GDMs) in the protein domain. We comprehensively evaluate three state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma2-2B, LLaMa3.1-8B, and LLaMa3.1-70B) with four protein-specialized GDMs (GearNet, GVP, ScanNet, GAT). Our work examines alignment factors from both model and protein perspectives, identifying challenges in current alignment methodologies and proposing strategies to improve the alignment process. Our key findings reveal that GDMs incorporating both graph and 3D structural information align better with LLMs, larger LLMs demonstrate improved alignment capabilities, and protein rarity significantly impacts alignment performance. We also find that increasing GDM embedding dimensions, using two-layer projection heads, and fine-tuning LLMs on protein-specific data substantially enhance alignment quality. These strategies offer potential enhancements to the performance of protein-related multimodal models. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Tizzzzy/LLM-GDM-alignment.

### On Generative Agents in Recommendation
**Authors**: An Zhang, Yuxin Chen, Leheng Sheng, Xiang Wang, Tat-Seng Chua

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T03:58:00Z

**Summary**: Recommender systems are the cornerstone of today's information dissemination, yet a disconnect between offline metrics and online performance greatly hinders their development. Addressing this challenge, we envision a recommendation simulator, capitalizing on recent breakthroughs in human-level intelligence exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose Agent4Rec, a user simulator in recommendation, leveraging LLM-empowered generative agents equipped with user profile, memory, and actions modules specifically tailored for the recommender system. In particular, these agents' profile modules are initialized using real-world datasets (e.g. MovieLens, Steam, Amazon-Book), capturing users' unique tastes and social traits; memory modules log both factual and emotional memories and are integrated with an emotion-driven reflection mechanism; action modules support a wide variety of behaviors, spanning both taste-driven and emotion-driven actions. Each agent interacts with personalized recommender models in a page-by-page manner, relying on a pre-implemented collaborative filtering-based recommendation algorithm. We delve into both the capabilities and limitations of Agent4Rec, aiming to explore an essential research question: ``To what extent can LLM-empowered generative agents faithfully simulate the behavior of real, autonomous humans in recommender systems?'' Extensive and multi-faceted evaluations of Agent4Rec highlight both the alignment and deviation between agents and user-personalized preferences. Beyond mere performance comparison, we explore insightful experiments, such as emulating the filter bubble effect and discovering the underlying causal relationships in recommendation tasks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/LehengTHU/Agent4Rec.

**Authors**: Anish Pahilajani, Devasha Trivedi, Jincen Shuai, Khin S. Yone, Samyak Rajesh Jain, Namyong Park, Ryan A. Rossi, Nesreen K. Ahmed, Franck Dernoncourt, Yu Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T03:09:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in multi-hop question-answering (M-QA) due to their advanced reasoning abilities. However, the impact of the inherent reasoning structures on LLM M-QA performance remains unclear, largely due to the absence of QA datasets that provide fine-grained reasoning structures. To address this gap, we introduce the Graph Reasoning-Structured Question Answering Dataset (GRS-QA), which includes both semantic contexts and reasoning structures for QA pairs. Unlike existing M-QA datasets, where different reasoning structures are entangled together, GRS-QA explicitly captures intricate reasoning pathways by constructing reasoning graphs, where nodes represent textual contexts and edges denote logical flows. These reasoning graphs of different structures enable a fine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning capabilities across various reasoning structures. Our empirical analysis reveals that LLMs perform differently when handling questions with varying reasoning structures. This finding facilitates the exploration of textual structures as compared with semantics.

### SpecHub: Provable Acceleration to Multi-Draft Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Ryan Sun, Tianyi Zhou, Xun Chen, Lichao Sun

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T02:47:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in advancing natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but their sequential token generation limits inference speed. Multi-Draft Speculative Decoding (MDSD) offers a promising solution by using a smaller draft model to generate multiple token sequences, which the target LLM verifies in parallel. However, current heuristic approaches, such as Recursive Rejection Sampling (RRS), suffer from low acceptance rates in subsequent drafts, limiting the advantages of using multiple drafts. Meanwhile, Optimal Transport with Membership Cost (OTM) can theoretically improve acceptance rates, but its computational cost is too high for real-time use. We present SpecHub, a novel, efficient sampling-verification method for MDSD that improves acceptance rates with only linear computational overhead. By simplifying the OTM problem into a compact Linear Programming model, SpecHub significantly reduces computational complexity. It further accelerates sampling by leveraging a sparse joint distribution, focusing computation on high-probability token sequences. In extensive experiments, Spechub consistently generates 0.05-0.27 and 0.02-0.16 more tokens per step than RRS and RRS without replacement. We attach our code at \url{https://github.com/MasterGodzilla/Speculative_decoding_OT}.

### A Taxonomy of AgentOps for Enabling Observability of Foundation Model   based Agents
**Authors**: Liming Dong, Qinghua Lu, Liming Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T02:31:03Z

**Summary**: The ever-improving quality of LLMs has fueled the growth of a diverse range of downstream tasks, leading to an increased demand for AI automation and a burgeoning interest in developing foundation model (FM)-based autonomous agents. As AI agent systems tackle more complex tasks and evolve, they involve a wider range of stakeholders, including agent users, agentic system developers and deployers, and AI model developers. These systems also integrate multiple components such as AI agent workflows, RAG pipelines, prompt management, agent capabilities, and observability features. In this case, obtaining reliable outputs and answers from these agents remains challenging, necessitating a dependable execution process and end-to-end observability solutions. To build reliable AI agents and LLM applications, it is essential to shift towards designing AgentOps platforms that ensure observability and traceability across the entire development-to-production life-cycle. To this end, we conducted a rapid review and identified relevant AgentOps tools from the agentic ecosystem. Based on this review, we provide an overview of the essential features of AgentOps and propose a comprehensive overview of observability data/traceable artifacts across the agent production life-cycle. Our findings provide a systematic overview of the current AgentOps landscape, emphasizing the critical role of observability/traceability in enhancing the reliability of autonomous agent systems.

 ### Recycled Attention: Efficient inference for long-context language models
**Authors**: Fangyuan Xu, Tanya Goyal, Eunsol Choi

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:57:07Z

**Summary**: Generating long sequences of tokens given a long-context input imposes a heavy computational burden for large language models (LLMs). One of the computational bottleneck comes from computing attention over a long sequence of input at each generation step. In this paper, we propose Recycled Attention, an inference-time method which alternates between full context attention and attention over a subset of input tokens. When performing partial attention, we recycle the attention pattern of a previous token that has performed full attention and attend only to the top K most attended tokens, reducing the cost of data movement and attention computation. Compared to previously proposed inference-time acceleration method which attends only to local context or tokens with high accumulative attention scores, our approach flexibly chooses tokens that are relevant to the current decoding step. We evaluate our methods on RULER, a suite of tasks designed to comprehensively evaluate long-context abilities, and long-context language modeling tasks. Applying our method to off-the-shelf LLMs achieves comparable speedup to baselines which only consider local context while improving the performance by 2x. We further explore two ideas to improve performance-efficiency trade-offs: (1) dynamically decide when to perform recycled or full attention step based on the query similarities and (2) continued pre-training the model with Recycled Attention.

### Is ChatGPT Transforming Academics' Writing Style?
**Authors**: Mingmeng Geng, Roberto Trotta

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:56:42Z

**Summary**: Based on one million arXiv papers submitted from May 2018 to January 2024, we assess the textual density of ChatGPT's writing style in their abstracts through a statistical analysis of word frequency changes. Our model is calibrated and validated on a mixture of real abstracts and ChatGPT-modified abstracts (simulated data) after a careful noise analysis. The words used for estimation are not fixed but adaptive, including those with decreasing frequency. We find that large language models (LLMs), represented by ChatGPT, are having an increasing impact on arXiv abstracts, especially in the field of computer science, where the fraction of LLM-style abstracts is estimated to be approximately 35%, if we take the responses of GPT-3.5 to one simple prompt, "revise the following sentences", as a baseline. We conclude with an analysis of both positive and negative aspects of the penetration of LLMs into academics' writing style.

### Logits of API-Protected LLMs Leak Proprietary Information
**Authors**: Matthew Finlayson, Xiang Ren, Swabha Swayamdipta

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:56:41Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) providers often hide the architectural details and parameters of their proprietary models by restricting public access to a limited API. In this work we show that, with only a conservative assumption about the model architecture, it is possible to learn a surprisingly large amount of non-public information about an API-protected LLM from a relatively small number of API queries (e.g., costing under $1000 USD for OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo). Our findings are centered on one key observation: most modern LLMs suffer from a softmax bottleneck, which restricts the model outputs to a linear subspace of the full output space. We exploit this fact to unlock several capabilities, including (but not limited to) obtaining cheap full-vocabulary outputs, auditing for specific types of model updates, identifying the source LLM given a single full LLM output, and even efficiently discovering the LLM's hidden size. Our empirical investigations show the effectiveness of our methods, which allow us to estimate the embedding size of OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo to be about 4096. Lastly, we discuss ways that LLM providers can guard against these attacks, as well as how these capabilities can be viewed as a feature (rather than a bug) by allowing for greater transparency and accountability.

### Using Language Models to Disambiguate Lexical Choices in Translation
**Authors**: Josh Barua, Sanjay Subramanian, Kayo Yin, Alane Suhr

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:48:57Z

**Summary**: In translation, a concept represented by a single word in a source language can have multiple variations in a target language. The task of lexical selection requires using context to identify which variation is most appropriate for a source text. We work with native speakers of nine languages to create DTAiLS, a dataset of 1,377 sentence pairs that exhibit cross-lingual concept variation when translating from English. We evaluate recent LLMs and neural machine translation systems on DTAiLS, with the best-performing model, GPT-4, achieving from 67 to 85% accuracy across languages. Finally, we use language models to generate English rules describing target-language concept variations. Providing weaker models with high-quality lexical rules improves accuracy substantially, in some cases reaching or outperforming GPT-4.

### LLMs as Method Actors: A Model for Prompt Engineering and Architecture
**Authors**: Colin Doyle

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:45:06Z

**Summary**: We introduce "Method Actors" as a mental model for guiding LLM prompt engineering and prompt architecture. Under this mental model, LLMs should be thought of as actors; prompts as scripts and cues; and LLM responses as performances. We apply this mental model to the task of improving LLM performance at playing Connections, a New York Times word puzzle game that prior research identified as a challenging benchmark for evaluating LLM reasoning. Our experiments with GPT-4o show that a "Method Actors" approach can significantly improve LLM performance over both a vanilla and "Chain of Thoughts" approach. A vanilla approach solves 27% of Connections puzzles in our dataset and a "Chain of Thoughts" approach solves 41% of puzzles, whereas our strongest "Method Actor" approach solves 86% of puzzles. We also test OpenAI's newest model designed specifically for complex reasoning tasks, o1-preview. When asked to solve a puzzle all at once, o1-preview solves 79% of Connections puzzles in our dataset, and when allowed to build puzzle solutions one guess at a time over multiple API calls, o1-preview solves 100% of the puzzles. Incorporating a "Method Actor" prompt architecture increases the percentage of puzzles that o1-preview solves perfectly from 76% to 87%.

### Quantitative Assessment of Intersectional Empathetic Bias and   Understanding
**Authors**: Vojtech Formanek, Ondrej Sotolar

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:43:15Z

**Summary**: A growing amount of literature critiques the current operationalizations of empathy based on loose definitions of the construct. Such definitions negatively affect dataset quality, model robustness, and evaluation reliability. We propose an empathy evaluation framework that operationalizes empathy close to its psychological origins. The framework measures the variance in responses of LLMs to prompts using existing metrics for empathy and emotional valence. The variance is introduced through the controlled generation of the prompts by varying social biases affecting context understanding, thus impacting empathetic understanding. The control over generation ensures high theoretical validity of the constructs in the prompt dataset. Also, it makes high-quality translation, especially into languages that currently have little-to-no way of evaluating empathy or bias, such as the Slavonic family, more manageable. Using chosen LLMs and various prompt types, we demonstrate the empathy evaluation with the framework, including multiple-choice answers and free generation. The variance in our initial evaluation sample is small and we were unable to measure convincing differences between the empathetic understanding in contexts given by different social groups. However, the results are promising because the models showed significant alterations their reasoning chains needed to capture the relatively subtle changes in the prompts. This provides the basis for future research into the construction of the evaluation sample and statistical methods for measuring the results.

### Fact or Fiction? Can LLMs be Reliable Annotators for Political Truths?
**Authors**: Veronica Chatrath, Marcelo Lotif, Shaina Raza

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:36:33Z

**Summary**: Political misinformation poses significant challenges to democratic processes, shaping public opinion and trust in media. Manual fact-checking methods face issues of scalability and annotator bias, while machine learning models require large, costly labelled datasets. This study investigates the use of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) as reliable annotators for detecting political factuality in news articles. Using open-source LLMs, we create a politically diverse dataset, labelled for bias through LLM-generated annotations. These annotations are validated by human experts and further evaluated by LLM-based judges to assess the accuracy and reliability of the annotations. Our approach offers a scalable and robust alternative to traditional fact-checking, enhancing transparency and public trust in media.

### Logic Query of Thoughts: Guiding Large Language Models to Answer Complex   Logic Queries with Knowledge Graphs
**Authors**: Lihui Liu, Zihao Wang, Ruizhong Qiu, Yikun Ban, Eunice Chan, Yangqiu Song, Jingrui He, Hanghang Tong

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:35:49Z

**Summary**: Despite the superb performance in many tasks, large language models (LLMs) bear the risk of generating hallucination or even wrong answers when confronted with tasks that demand the accuracy of knowledge. The issue becomes even more noticeable when addressing logic queries that require multiple logic reasoning steps. On the other hand, knowledge graph (KG) based question answering methods are capable of accurately identifying the correct answers with the help of knowledge graph, yet its accuracy could quickly deteriorate when the knowledge graph itself is sparse and incomplete. It remains a critical challenge on how to integrate knowledge graph reasoning with LLMs in a mutually beneficial way so as to mitigate both the hallucination problem of LLMs as well as the incompleteness issue of knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose 'Logic-Query-of-Thoughts' (LGOT) which is the first of its kind to combine LLMs with knowledge graph based logic query reasoning. LGOT seamlessly combines knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, effectively breaking down complex logic queries into easy to answer subquestions. Through the utilization of both knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, it successfully derives answers for each subquestion. By aggregating these results and selecting the highest quality candidate answers for each step, LGOT achieves accurate results to complex questions. Our experimental findings demonstrate substantial performance enhancements, with up to 20% improvement over ChatGPT.

### SVDQuant: Absorbing Outliers by Low-Rank Components for 4-Bit Diffusion   Models
**Authors**: Muyang Li, Yujun Lin, Zhekai Zhang, Tianle Cai, Xiuyu Li, Junxian Guo, Enze Xie, Chenlin Meng, Jun-Yan Zhu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:32:59Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have been proven highly effective at generating high-quality images. However, as these models grow larger, they require significantly more memory and suffer from higher latency, posing substantial challenges for deployment. In this work, we aim to accelerate diffusion models by quantizing their weights and activations to 4 bits. At such an aggressive level, both weights and activations are highly sensitive, where conventional post-training quantization methods for large language models like smoothing become insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose SVDQuant, a new 4-bit quantization paradigm. Different from smoothing which redistributes outliers between weights and activations, our approach absorbs these outliers using a low-rank branch. We first consolidate the outliers by shifting them from activations to weights, then employ a high-precision low-rank branch to take in the weight outliers with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This process eases the quantization on both sides. However, na\"{\i}vely running the low-rank branch independently incurs significant overhead due to extra data movement of activations, negating the quantization speedup. To address this, we co-design an inference engine Nunchaku that fuses the kernels of the low-rank branch into those of the low-bit branch to cut off redundant memory access. It can also seamlessly support off-the-shelf low-rank adapters (LoRAs) without the need for re-quantization. Extensive experiments on SDXL, PixArt-$\Sigma$, and FLUX.1 validate the effectiveness of SVDQuant in preserving image quality. We reduce the memory usage for the 12B FLUX.1 models by 3.5$\times$, achieving 3.0$\times$ speedup over the 4-bit weight-only quantized baseline on the 16GB laptop 4090 GPU, paving the way for more interactive applications on PCs. Our quantization library and inference engine are open-sourced.

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:26:17Z

**Summary**: We introduce FinDVer, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the explainable claim verification capabilities of LLMs in the context of understanding and analyzing long, hybrid-content financial documents. FinDVer contains 2,400 expert-annotated examples, divided into three subsets: information extraction, numerical reasoning, and knowledge-intensive reasoning, each addressing common scenarios encountered in real-world financial contexts. We assess a broad spectrum of LLMs under long-context and RAG settings. Our results show that even the current best-performing system, GPT-4o, still lags behind human experts. We further provide in-depth analysis on long-context and RAG setting, Chain-of-Thought reasoning, and model reasoning errors, offering insights to drive future advancements. We believe that FinDVer can serve as a valuable benchmark for evaluating LLMs in claim verification over complex, expert-domain documents.

### Multi-hop Evidence Pursuit Meets the Web: Team Papelo at FEVER 2024
**Authors**: Christopher Malon

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:25:06Z

**Summary**: Separating disinformation from fact on the web has long challenged both the search and the reasoning powers of humans. We show that the reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) and the retrieval power of modern search engines can be combined to automate this process and explainably verify claims. We integrate LLMs and search under a multi-hop evidence pursuit strategy. This strategy generates an initial question based on an input claim using a sequence to sequence model, searches and formulates an answer to the question, and iteratively generates follow-up questions to pursue the evidence that is missing using an LLM. We demonstrate our system on the FEVER 2024 (AVeriTeC) shared task. Compared to a strategy of generating all the questions at once, our method obtains .045 higher label accuracy and .155 higher AVeriTeC score (evaluating the adequacy of the evidence). Through ablations, we show the importance of various design choices, such as the question generation method, medium-sized context, reasoning with one document at a time, adding metadata, paraphrasing, reducing the problem to two classes, and reconsidering the final verdict. Our submitted system achieves .510 AVeriTeC score on the dev set and .477 AVeriTeC score on the test set.

### Physics-Aware Combinatorial Assembly Sequence Planning using Data-free   Action Masking
**Authors**: Ruixuan Liu, Alan Chen, Weiye Zhao, Changliu Liu

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:22:46Z

**Summary**: Combinatorial assembly uses standardized unit primitives to build objects that satisfy user specifications. This paper studies assembly sequence planning (ASP) for physical combinatorial assembly. Given the shape of the desired object, the goal is to find a sequence of actions for placing unit primitives to build the target object. In particular, we aim to ensure the planned assembly sequence is physically executable. However, ASP for combinatorial assembly is particularly challenging due to its combinatorial nature. To address the challenge, we employ deep reinforcement learning to learn a construction policy for placing unit primitives sequentially to build the desired object. Specifically, we design an online physics-aware action mask that filters out invalid actions, which effectively guides policy learning and ensures violation-free deployment. In the end, we apply the proposed method to Lego assembly with more than 250 3D structures. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method plans physically valid assembly sequences to build all structures, achieving a $100\%$ success rate, whereas the best comparable baseline fails more than $40$ structures. Our implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/intelligent-control-lab/PhysicsAwareCombinatorialASP}.

### Multi-Dimensional Reconfigurable, Physically Composable Hybrid   Diffractive Optical Neural Network
**Authors**: Ziang Yin, Yu Yao, Jeff Zhang, Jiaqi Gu

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T18:08:49Z

**Summary**: Diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs), leveraging free-space light wave propagation for ultra-parallel, high-efficiency computing, have emerged as promising artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators. However, their inherent lack of reconfigurability due to fixed optical structures post-fabrication hinders practical deployment in the face of dynamic AI workloads and evolving applications. To overcome this challenge, we introduce, for the first time, a multi-dimensional reconfigurable hybrid diffractive ONN system (MDR-HDONN), a physically composable architecture that unlocks a new degree of freedom and unprecedented versatility in DONNs. By leveraging full-system learnability, MDR-HDONN repurposes fixed fabricated optical hardware, achieving exponentially expanded functionality and superior task adaptability through the differentiable learning of system variables. Furthermore, MDR-HDONN adopts a hybrid optical/photonic design, combining the reconfigurability of integrated photonics with the ultra-parallelism of free-space diffractive systems. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MDR-HDONN has digital-comparable accuracy on various task adaptations with 74x faster speed and 194x lower energy. Compared to prior DONNs, MDR-HDONN shows exponentially larger functional space with 5x faster training speed, paving the way for a new paradigm of versatile, composable, hybrid optical/photonic AI computing. We will open-source our codes.

**Authors**: Yandika Sirgabsou, Benjamin Hardin, François Leblanc, Efi Raili, Pericle Salvini, David Jackson, Marina Jirotka, Lars Kunze

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T17:44:40Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the critical issue of psychological safety in the design and operation of autonomous vehicles, which are increasingly integrated with artificial intelligence technologies. While traditional safety standards focus primarily on physical safety, this paper emphasizes the psychological implications that arise from human interactions with autonomous vehicles, highlighting the importance of trust and perceived risk as significant factors influencing user acceptance. Through a review of existing safety techniques, the paper defines psychological safety in the context of autonomous vehicles, proposes a risk model to identify and assess psychological risks, and adopts a system-theoretic analysis method. The paper illustrates the potential psychological hazards using a scenario involving a family's experience with an autonomous vehicle, aiming to systematically evaluate situations that could lead to psychological harm. By establishing a framework that incorporates psychological safety alongside physical safety, the paper contributes to the broader discourse on the safe deployment of autonomous vehicle and aims to guide future developments in user-cantered design and regulatory practices.

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T17:20:47Z

**Summary**: Machine learning methods have a groundbreaking impact in many application domains, but their application on real robotic platforms is still limited. Despite the many challenges associated with combining machine learning technology with robotics, robot learning remains one of the most promising directions for enhancing the capabilities of robots. When deploying learning-based approaches on real robots, extra effort is required to address the challenges posed by various real-world factors. To investigate the key factors influencing real-world deployment and to encourage original solutions from different researchers, we organized the Robot Air Hockey Challenge at the NeurIPS 2023 conference. We selected the air hockey task as a benchmark, encompassing low-level robotics problems and high-level tactics. Different from other machine learning-centric benchmarks, participants need to tackle practical challenges in robotics, such as the sim-to-real gap, low-level control issues, safety problems, real-time requirements, and the limited availability of real-world data. Furthermore, we focus on a dynamic environment, removing the typical assumption of quasi-static motions of other real-world benchmarks. The competition's results show that solutions combining learning-based approaches with prior knowledge outperform those relying solely on data when real-world deployment is challenging. Our ablation study reveals which real-world factors may be overlooked when building a learning-based solution.

### Multimodal Structure-Aware Quantum Data Processing
**Authors**: Hala Hawashin, Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T17:16:29Z

**Summary**: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP), their "black box" nature obscures their decision-making processes. To address this, researchers developed structured approaches using higher order tensors. These are able to model linguistic relations, but stall when training on classical computers due to their excessive size. Tensors are natural inhabitants of quantum systems and training on quantum computers provides a solution by translating text to variational quantum circuits. In this paper, we develop MultiQ-NLP: a framework for structure-aware data processing with multimodal text+image data. Here, "structure" refers to syntactic and grammatical relationships in language, as well as the hierarchical organization of visual elements in images. We enrich the translation with new types and type homomorphisms and develop novel architectures to represent structure. When tested on a main stream image classification task (SVO Probes), our best model showed a par performance with the state of the art classical models; moreover the best model was fully structured.

### Renewable Energy Powered and Open RAN-based Architecture for 5G Fixed   Wireless Access Provisioning in Rural Areas
**Authors**: Anselme Ndikumana, Kim Khoa Nguyen, Mohamed Cheriet

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:53:12Z

**Summary**: Due to the high costs of optical fiber deployment in Low-Density and Rural Areas (LDRAs), 5G Fixed Wireless Access (5G FWA) recently emerged as an affordable solution. A widely adopted deployment scenario of 5G FWA includes edge cloud that supports computing services and Radio Access Network (RAN) functions. Such edge cloud requires network and energy resources for 5G FWA. This paper proposes renewable energy powered and Open RAN-based architecture for 5G FWA serving LDRAs using three-level closed-loops. Open RAN is a new 5G RAN architecture allowing Open Central Unit and Open Distributed Unit to be distributed in virtualized environment. The first closed-loop distributes radio resources to Open RAN instances and slices at the edge cloud. The second closed-loop allocates radio resources to houses. We design a new energy model that leverages renewable energy. We jointly optimize radio and energy resource allocation in closed-loop 3. We formulate ultra-small and small-time scale optimization problems that link closed-loops to maximize communication utility while minimizing energy costs. We propose reinforcement learning and successive convex approximation to solve the formulated problems. Then, we use solution data and continual learning to improve resource allocation on a large timescale. Our proposal satisfies 97.14% slice delay budget.

### Language Models can Infer Action Semantics for Symbolic Planners from   Environment Feedback
**Authors**: Wang Zhu, Ishika Singh, Robin Jia, Jesse Thomason

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:50:24Z

**Summary**: Symbolic planners can discover a sequence of actions from initial to goal states given expert-defined, domain-specific logical action semantics. Large Language Models (LLMs) can directly generate such sequences, but limitations in reasoning and state-tracking often result in plans that are insufficient or unexecutable. We propose Predicting Semantics of Actions with Language Models (PSALM), which automatically learns action semantics by leveraging the strengths of both symbolic planners and LLMs. PSALM repeatedly proposes and executes plans, using the LLM to partially generate plans and to infer domain-specific action semantics based on execution outcomes. PSALM maintains a belief over possible action semantics that is iteratively updated until a goal state is reached. Experiments on 7 environments show that when learning just from one goal, PSALM boosts plan success rate from 36.4% (on Claude-3.5) to 100%, and explores the environment more efficiently than prior work to infer ground truth domain action semantics.

### FALCON: Feedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced   Coding Optimization system
**Authors**: Zeyuan Li, Yangfan He, Lewei He, Jianhui Wang, Tianyu Shi, Bin Lei, Yuchen Li, Qiuwu Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:50:05Z

**Summary**: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in automated code generation. Despite their strong instruction-following capabilities, these models frequently struggled to align with user intent in coding scenarios. In particular, they were hampered by datasets that lacked diversity and failed to address specialized tasks or edge cases. Furthermore, challenges in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) led to failures in generating precise, human-intent-aligned code. To tackle these challenges and improve the code generation performance for automated programming systems, we propose Feedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced Coding Optimization (i.e., FALCON). FALCON is structured into two hierarchical levels. From the global level, long-term memory improves code quality by retaining and applying learned knowledge. At the local level, short-term memory allows for the incorporation of immediate feedback from compilers and AI systems. Additionally, we introduce meta-reinforcement learning with feedback rewards to solve the global-local bi-level optimization problem and enhance the model's adaptability across diverse code generation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art performance, leading other reinforcement learning methods by more than 4.5 percentage points on the MBPP benchmark and 6.1 percentage points on the Humaneval benchmark. The open-sourced code is publicly available at https://github.com/titurte/FALCON.

**Authors**: Xichen Tang

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:42:41Z

**Summary**: Formalizing mathematical proofs using computerized verification languages like Lean 4 has the potential to significantly impact the field of mathematics, it offers prominent capabilities for advancing mathematical reasoning. However, existing efforts are largely limited to creating formalized versions of proofs from extensive online mathematical corpora, struggling to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of mathematics. To bridge the gap between traditional and computerized proof techniques, this paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate formal proof steps and complete formalized proofs. By converting natural language (NL) mathematical proofs into formalized versions, this work introduces the basic structure and tactics of the Lean 4 language. The goal is to determine how AI can be leveraged to assist the mathematical formalization process and improve its performance. Several examples are provided that demonstrate solving problems using both traditional and Lean 4-based approaches. Ultimately, this paper presents an explanation of the foundations of Lean 4 and comparative analyses of the mathematical formalization process using traditional and AI-augmented techniques. The findings indicate that AI- powered tools have significant potential to accelerate and enhance the formalization of mathematical proofs, paving the way for more efficient and reliable theorem-proving for AI for Math in the future.

**Authors**: Andre Niyongabo Rubungo, Kangming Li, Jason Hattrick-Simpers, Adji Bousso Dieng

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:42:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in materials science. However, little attention has been given to benchmarking and standardized evaluation for LLM-based materials property prediction, which hinders progress. We present LLM4Mat-Bench, the largest benchmark to date for evaluating the performance of LLMs in predicting the properties of crystalline materials. LLM4Mat-Bench contains about 1.9M crystal structures in total, collected from 10 publicly available materials data sources, and 45 distinct properties. LLM4Mat-Bench features different input modalities: crystal composition, CIF, and crystal text description, with 4.7M, 615.5M, and 3.1B tokens in total for each modality, respectively. We use LLM4Mat-Bench to fine-tune models with different sizes, including LLM-Prop and MatBERT, and provide zero-shot and few-shot prompts to evaluate the property prediction capabilities of LLM-chat-like models, including Llama, Gemma, and Mistral. The results highlight the challenges of general-purpose LLMs in materials science and the need for task-specific predictive models and task-specific instruction-tuned LLMs in materials property prediction.

### Eigen Attention: Attention in Low-Rank Space for KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Utkarsh Saxena, Gobinda Saha, Sakshi Choudhary, Kaushik Roy

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:29:33Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the domain of natural language processing due to their impressive reasoning abilities. Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the context lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex tasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new bottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen Attention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby reducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we demonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache sizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop in performance. Code is available at https://github.com/UtkarshSaxena1/EigenAttn.

### Tell What You Hear From What You See -- Video to Audio Generation   Through Text
**Authors**: Xiulong Liu, Kun Su, Eli Shlizerman

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:29:07Z

**Summary**: The content of visual and audio scenes is multi-faceted such that a video can be paired with various audio and vice-versa. Thereby, in video-to-audio generation task, it is imperative to introduce steering approaches for controlling the generated audio. While Video-to-Audio generation is a well-established generative task, existing methods lack such controllability. In this work, we propose VATT, a multi-modal generative framework that takes a video and an optional text prompt as input, and generates audio and optional textual description of the audio. Such a framework has two advantages: i) Video-to-Audio generation process can be refined and controlled via text which complements the context of visual information, and ii) The model can suggest what audio to generate for the video by generating audio captions. VATT consists of two key modules: VATT Converter, a LLM that is fine-tuned for instructions and includes a projection layer that maps video features to the LLM vector space; and VATT Audio, a transformer that generates audio tokens from visual frames and from optional text prompt using iterative parallel decoding. The audio tokens are converted to a waveform by pretrained neural codec. Experiments show that when VATT is compared to existing video-to-audio generation methods in objective metrics, it achieves competitive performance when the audio caption is not provided. When the audio caption is provided as a prompt, VATT achieves even more refined performance (lowest KLD score of 1.41). Furthermore, subjective studies show that VATT Audio has been chosen as preferred generated audio than audio generated by existing methods. VATT enables controllable video-to-audio generation through text as well as suggesting text prompts for videos through audio captions, unlocking novel applications such as text-guided video-to-audio generation and video-to-audio captioning.

### Unmasking the Limits of Large Language Models: A Systematic Evaluation   of Masked Text Processing Ability through MskQA and MskCal
**Authors**: Fuka Matsuzaki, Haru-Tada Sato

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:07:47Z

**Summary**: This paper sheds light on the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by rigorously evaluating their ability to process masked text. We introduce two novel tasks: MskQA, measuring reasoning on masked question-answering datasets like RealtimeQA, and MskCal, assessing numerical reasoning on masked arithmetic problems.Testing GPT-4o and 4o-mini reveals that while LLMs exhibit some resilience to masked text, their performance is highly contingent on masking rates and semantic cues. Specifically, "solid masking," where semantic clues are entirely absent, leads to a significant performance drop compared to "partial lifting," where some semantic information is retained, indicating LLMs' reliance on surface-level patterns. Interestingly, GPT-4o consistently outperforms 4o-mini, particularly in MskCal, demonstrating a greater ability to handle numerical reasoning with masked text. This underscores the crucial role of semantic cues in the reasoning process of LLMs. Our study illuminates the interplay between background knowledge and reasoning ability in masked text processing, paving the way for a deeper understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations, and highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods to accurately assess their true comprehension abilities.

### GPTKB: Building Very Large Knowledge Bases from Language Models
**Authors**: Yujia Hu, Shrestha Ghosh, Tuan-Phong Nguyen, Simon Razniewski

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:06:09Z

**Summary**: General-domain knowledge bases (KB), in particular the "big three" -- Wikidata, Yago and DBpedia -- are the backbone of many intelligent applications. While these three have seen steady development, comprehensive KB construction at large has seen few fresh attempts. In this work, we propose to build a large general-domain KB entirely from a large language model (LLM). We demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale KB construction from LLMs, while highlighting specific challenges arising around entity recognition, entity and property canonicalization, and taxonomy construction. As a prototype, we use GPT-4o-mini to construct GPTKB, which contains 105 million triples for more than 2.9 million entities, at a cost 100x less than previous KBC projects. Our work is a landmark for two fields: For NLP, for the first time, it provides \textit{constructive} insights into the knowledge (or beliefs) of LLMs. For the Semantic Web, it shows novel ways forward for the long-standing challenge of general-domain KB construction. GPTKB is accessible at http://gptkb.org.

### Digital Twin Backed Closed-Loops for Energy-Aware and Open RAN-based   Fixed Wireless Access Serving Rural Areas
**Authors**: Anselme Ndikumana, Kim Khoa Nguyen, Mohamed Cheriet

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T16:05:54Z

**Summary**: Internet access in rural areas should be improved to support digital inclusion and 5G services. Due to the high deployment costs of fiber optics in these areas, Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) has become a preferable alternative. Additionally, the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) can facilitate the interoperability of FWA elements, allowing some FWA functions to be deployed at the edge cloud. However, deploying edge clouds in rural areas can increase network and energy costs. To address these challenges, we propose a closed-loop system assisted by a Digital Twin (DT) to automate energy-aware O-RAN based FWA resource management in rural areas. We consider the FWA and edge cloud as the Physical Twin (PT) and design a closed-loop that distributes radio resources to edge cloud instances for scheduling. We develop another closed-loop for intra-slice resource allocation to houses. We design an energy model that integrates radio resource allocation and formulate ultra-small and small-timescale optimizations for the PT to maximize slice requirement satisfaction while minimizing energy costs. We then design a reinforcement learning approach and successive convex approximation to address the formulated problems. We present a DT that replicates the PT by incorporating solution experiences into future states. The results show that our approach efficiently uses radio and energy resources.

### The influence of persona and conversational task on social interactions   with a LLM-controlled embodied conversational agent
**Authors**: Leon O. H. Kroczek, Alexander May, Selina Hettenkofer, Andreas Ruider, Bernd Ludwig, Andreas Mühlberger

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T15:49:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in conversational tasks. Embodying an LLM as a virtual human allows users to engage in face-to-face social interactions in Virtual Reality. However, the influence of person- and task-related factors in social interactions with LLM-controlled agents remains unclear. In this study, forty-six participants interacted with a virtual agent whose persona was manipulated as extravert or introvert in three different conversational tasks (small talk, knowledge test, convincing). Social-evaluation, emotional experience, and realism were assessed using ratings. Interactive engagement was measured by quantifying participants' words and conversational turns. Finally, we measured participants' willingness to ask the agent for help during the knowledge test. Our findings show that the extraverted agent was more positively evaluated, elicited a more pleasant experience and greater engagement, and was assessed as more realistic compared to the introverted agent. Whereas persona did not affect the tendency to ask for help, participants were generally more confident in the answer when they had help of the LLM. Variation of personality traits of LLM-controlled embodied virtual agents, therefore, affects social-emotional processing and behavior in virtual interactions. Embodied virtual agents allow the presentation of naturalistic social encounters in a virtual environment.

### LightVA: Lightweight Visual Analytics with LLM Agent-Based Task Planning   and Execution
**Authors**: Yuheng Zhao, Junjie Wang, Linbin Xiang, Xiaowen Zhang, Zifei Guo, Cagatay Turkay, Yu Zhang, Siming Chen

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T15:46:10Z

**Summary**: Visual analytics (VA) requires analysts to iteratively propose analysis tasks based on observations and execute tasks by creating visualizations and interactive exploration to gain insights. This process demands skills in programming, data processing, and visualization tools, highlighting the need for a more intelligent, streamlined VA approach. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been developed as agents to handle various tasks with dynamic planning and tool-using capabilities, offering the potential to enhance the efficiency and versatility of VA. We propose LightVA, a lightweight VA framework that supports task decomposition, data analysis, and interactive exploration through human-agent collaboration. Our method is designed to help users progressively translate high-level analytical goals into low-level tasks, producing visualizations and deriving insights. Specifically, we introduce an LLM agent-based task planning and execution strategy, employing a recursive process involving a planner, executor, and controller. The planner is responsible for recommending and decomposing tasks, the executor handles task execution, including data analysis, visualization generation and multi-view composition, and the controller coordinates the interaction between the planner and executor. Building on the framework, we develop a system with a hybrid user interface that includes a task flow diagram for monitoring and managing the task planning process, a visualization panel for interactive data exploration, and a chat view for guiding the model through natural language instructions. We examine the effectiveness of our method through a usage scenario and an expert study.

### TwiNet: Connecting Real World Networks to their Digital Twins Through a   Live Bidirectional Link
**Authors**: Clifton Paul Robinson, Andrea Lacava, Pedram Johari, Francesca Cuomo, Tommaso Melodia

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T15:43:55Z

**Summary**: The wireless spectrum's increasing complexity poses challenges and opportunities, highlighting the necessity for real-time solutions and robust data processing capabilities. Digital Twin (DT), virtual replicas of physical systems, integrate real-time data to mirror their real-world counterparts, enabling precise monitoring and optimization. Incorporating DTs into wireless communication enhances predictive maintenance, resource allocation, and troubleshooting, thus bolstering network reliability. Our paper introduces TwiNet, enabling bidirectional, near-realtime links between real-world wireless spectrum scenarios and DT replicas. Utilizing the protocol, MQTT, we can achieve data transfer times with an average latency of 14 ms, suitable for real-time communication. This is confirmed by monitoring real-world traffic and mirroring it in real-time within the DT's wireless environment. We evaluate TwiNet's performance in two use cases: (i) assessing risky traffic configurations of UEs in a Safe Adaptive Data Rate (SADR) system, improving network performance by approximately 15% compared to original network selections; and (ii) deploying new CNNs in response to jammed pilots, achieving up to 97% accuracy training on artificial data and deploying a new model in as low as 2 minutes to counter persistent adversaries. TwiNet enables swift deployment and adaptation of DTs, addressing crucial challenges in modern wireless communication systems.

### Evaluating Large Language Model Capability in Vietnamese Fact-Checking   Data Generation
**Authors**: Long Truong To, Hung Tuan Le, Dat Van-Thanh Nguyen, Manh Trong Nguyen, Tri Thien Nguyen, Tin Van Huynh, Kiet Van Nguyen

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T15:35:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), with gradually improving reading comprehension and reasoning capabilities, are being applied to a range of complex language tasks, including the automatic generation of language data for various purposes. However, research on applying LLMs for automatic data generation in low-resource languages like Vietnamese is still underdeveloped and lacks comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs for automatic data generation for the Vietnamese fact-checking task, which faces significant data limitations. Specifically, we focus on fact-checking data where claims are synthesized from multiple evidence sentences to assess the information synthesis capabilities of LLMs. We develop an automatic data construction process using simple prompt techniques on LLMs and explore several methods to improve the quality of the generated data. To evaluate the quality of the data generated by LLMs, we conduct both manual quality assessments and performance evaluations using language models. Experimental results and manual evaluations illustrate that while the quality of the generated data has significantly improved through fine-tuning techniques, LLMs still cannot match the data quality produced by humans.

**Authors**: Mohammad Yeghaneh Abkenar, Weixing Wang, Hendrik Graupner, Manfred Stede

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T15:34:08Z

**Summary**: We explore the capability of four open-sourcelarge language models (LLMs) in argumentation mining (AM). We conduct experiments on three different corpora; persuasive essays(PE), argumentative microtexts (AMT) Part 1 and Part 2, based on two argumentation mining sub-tasks: (i) argumentative discourse units classifications (ADUC), and (ii) argumentative relation classification (ARC). This work aims to assess the argumentation capability of open-source LLMs, including Mistral 7B, Mixtral8x7B, LlamA2 7B and LlamA3 8B in both, zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Our analysis contributes to further assessing computational argumentation with open-source LLMs in future research efforts.

### A Two-Step Concept-Based Approach for Enhanced Interpretability and   Trust in Skin Lesion Diagnosis
**Authors**: Cristiano Patrício, Luís F. Teixeira, João C. Neves

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T14:52:42Z

**Summary**: The main challenges hindering the adoption of deep learning-based systems in clinical settings are the scarcity of annotated data and the lack of interpretability and trust in these systems. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) offer inherent interpretability by constraining the final disease prediction on a set of human-understandable concepts. However, this inherent interpretability comes at the cost of greater annotation burden. Additionally, adding new concepts requires retraining the entire system. In this work, we introduce a novel two-step methodology that addresses both of these challenges. By simulating the two stages of a CBM, we utilize a pretrained Vision Language Model (VLM) to automatically predict clinical concepts, and a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate disease diagnoses based on the predicted concepts. We validate our approach on three skin lesion datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms traditional CBMs and state-of-the-art explainable methods, all without requiring any training and utilizing only a few annotated examples. The code is available at https://github.com/CristianoPatricio/2-step-concept-based-skin-diagnosis.

### Secret Collusion among Generative AI Agents
**Authors**: Sumeet Ramesh Motwani, Mikhail Baranchuk, Martin Strohmeier, Vijay Bolina, Philip H. S. Torr, Lewis Hammond, Christian Schroeder de Witt

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T14:46:40Z

**Summary**: Recent capability increases in large language models (LLMs) open up applications in which groups of communicating generative AI agents solve joint tasks. This poses privacy and security challenges concerning the unauthorised sharing of information, or other unwanted forms of agent coordination. Modern steganographic techniques could render such dynamics hard to detect. In this paper, we comprehensively formalise the problem of secret collusion in systems of generative AI agents by drawing on relevant concepts from both AI and security literature. We study incentives for the use of steganography, and propose a variety of mitigation measures. Our investigations result in a model evaluation framework that systematically tests capabilities required for various forms of secret collusion. We provide extensive empirical results across a range of contemporary LLMs. While the steganographic capabilities of current models remain limited, GPT-4 displays a capability jump suggesting the need for continuous monitoring of steganographic frontier model capabilities. We conclude by laying out a comprehensive research program to mitigate future risks of collusion between generative AI models.

### Evaluating and Adapting Large Language Models to Represent Folktales in   Low-Resource Languages
**Authors**: JA Meaney, Beatrice Alex, William Lamb

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T14:26:56Z

**Summary**: Folktales are a rich resource of knowledge about the society and culture of a civilisation. Digital folklore research aims to use automated techniques to better understand these folktales, and it relies on abstract representations of the textual data. Although a number of large language models (LLMs) claim to be able to represent low-resource langauges such as Irish and Gaelic, we present two classification tasks to explore how useful these representations are, and three adaptations to improve the performance of these models. We find that adapting the models to work with longer sequences, and continuing pre-training on the domain of folktales improves classification performance, although these findings are tempered by the impressive performance of a baseline SVM with non-contextual features.

### CodeGRAG: Bridging the Gap between Natural Language and Programming   Language via Graphical Retrieval Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Kounianhua Du, Jizheng Chen, Renting Rui, Huacan Chai, Lingyue Fu, Wei Xia, Yasheng Wang, Ruiming Tang, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T14:17:05Z

**Summary**: Utilizing large language models to generate codes has shown promising meaning in software development revolution. Despite the intelligence shown by the general large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing among natural language and different programming languages. In this paper, we propose CodeGRAG, a Graphical Retrieval Augmented Code Generation framework to enhance the performance of LLMs. CodeGRAG builds the graphical view of code blocks based on the control flow and data flow of them to fill the gap between programming languages and natural language, which can facilitate natural language based LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging graphical representation into informative knowledge for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into the model parameters via finetuning the models with the help of a pretrained GNN expert model. Various experiments and ablations are done on four datasets including both the C++ and python languages to validate the hard meta-graph prompt, the soft prompting technique, and the effectiveness of the objectives for pretrained GNN expert. CodeGRAG improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Code-5970/.

Anecdotal and empirical findings show that cryptocurrencies are among the financial assets that have been affected by news and influencers' activities on Twitter. However, the extent to which Twitter crypto influencer's posts about trading signals and their effect on market prices is mostly unexplored. In this paper, we use LLMs to uncover buy and not-buy signals from influencers and news outlets' Twitter posts and use a VAR analysis with Granger Causality tests and cross-correlation analysis to understand how these trading signals are temporally correlated with the top nine major cryptocurrencies' prices. Overall, the results show a mixed pattern across cryptocurrencies and temporal periods. However, we found that for the top three cryptocurrencies with the highest presence within news and influencer posts, their aggregated LLM-detected trading signal over the preceding 24 hours granger-causes fluctuations in their market prices, exhibiting a lag of at least 6 hours. In addition, the results reveal fundamental differences in how influencers and news outlets cover cryptocurrencies.

### Evaluating Diversity in Automatic Poetry Generation
**Authors**: Yanran Chen, Hannes Gröner, Sina Zarrieß, Steffen Eger

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T14:02:13Z

**Summary**: Natural Language Generation (NLG), and more generally generative AI, are among the currently most impactful research fields. Creative NLG, such as automatic poetry generation, is a fascinating niche in this area. While most previous research has focused on forms of the Turing test when evaluating automatic poetry generation -- can humans distinguish between automatic and human generated poetry -- we evaluate the diversity of automatically generated poetry (with a focus on quatrains), by comparing distributions of generated poetry to distributions of human poetry along structural, lexical, semantic and stylistic dimensions, assessing different model types (word vs. character-level, general purpose LLMs vs. poetry-specific models), including the very recent LLaMA3-8B, and types of fine-tuning (conditioned vs. unconditioned). We find that current automatic poetry systems are considerably underdiverse along multiple dimensions -- they often do not rhyme sufficiently, are semantically too uniform and even do not match the length distribution of human poetry. Our experiments reveal, however, that style-conditioning and character-level modeling clearly increases diversity across virtually all dimensions we explore. Our identified limitations may serve as the basis for more genuinely diverse future poetry generation models.

### Why These Documents? Explainable Generative Retrieval with Hierarchical   Category Paths
**Authors**: Sangam Lee, Ryang Heo, SeongKu Kang, Susik Yoon, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T13:51:37Z

**Summary**: Generative retrieval has recently emerged as a new alternative of traditional information retrieval approaches. However, existing generative retrieval methods directly decode docid when a query is given, making it impossible to provide users with explanations as an answer for "Why this document is retrieved?". To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Category Path-Enhanced Generative Retrieval(HyPE), which enhances explainability by generating hierarchical category paths step-by-step before decoding docid. HyPE leverages hierarchical category paths as explanation, progressing from broad to specific semantic categories. This approach enables diverse explanations for the same document depending on the query by using shared category paths between the query and the document, and provides reasonable explanation by reflecting the document's semantic structure through a coarse-to-fine manner. HyPE constructs category paths with external high-quality semantic hierarchy, leverages LLM to select appropriate candidate paths for each document, and optimizes the generative retrieval model with path-augmented dataset. During inference, HyPE utilizes path-aware reranking strategy to aggregate diverse topic information, allowing the most relevant documents to be prioritized in the final ranked list of docids. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HyPE not only offers a high level of explainability but also improves the retrieval performance in the document retrieval task.

**Authors**: Ilias Bournias, Lukas Cavigelli, Georgios Zacharopoulos

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T13:24:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference on large-scale systems is expected to dominate future cloud infrastructures. Efficient LLM inference in cloud environments with numerous AI accelerators is challenging, necessitating extensive optimizations for optimal performance. Current systems batch prefill and decoding to boost throughput but encounter latency issues, while others disaggregate these phases, leading to resource underutilization. We propose AcceLLM, a novel method addressing latency and load balancing, inspired by the cache data management. It strategically utilizes redundant data to enhance inference via load balancing and optimal hardware use. Simulated evaluations on Nvidia H100 GPU and Huawei Ascend 910B2 show AcceLLM surpasses state-of-the-art systems up to 30% in latency and efficiency, handling diverse workloads effectively.

### Assessing the Answerability of Queries in Retrieval-Augmented Code   Generation
**Authors**: Geonmin Kim, Jaeyeon Kim, Hancheol Park, Wooksu Shin, Tae-Ho Kim

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T13:09:14Z

**Summary**: Thanks to unprecedented language understanding and generation capabilities of large language model (LLM), Retrieval-augmented Code Generation (RaCG) has recently been widely utilized among software developers. While this has increased productivity, there are still frequent instances of incorrect codes being provided. In particular, there are cases where plausible yet incorrect codes are generated for queries from users that cannot be answered with the given queries and API descriptions. This study proposes a task for evaluating answerability, which assesses whether valid answers can be generated based on users' queries and retrieved APIs in RaCG. Additionally, we build a benchmark dataset called Retrieval-augmented Code Generability Evaluation (RaCGEval) to evaluate the performance of models performing this task. Experimental results show that this task remains at a very challenging level, with baseline models exhibiting a low performance of 46.7%. Furthermore, this study discusses methods that could significantly improve performance.

### Confidence Regulation Neurons in Language Models
**Authors**: Alessandro Stolfo, Ben Wu, Wes Gurnee, Yonatan Belinkov, Xingyi Song, Mrinmaya Sachan, Neel Nanda

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T12:54:16Z

**Summary**: Despite their widespread use, the mechanisms by which large language models (LLMs) represent and regulate uncertainty in next-token predictions remain largely unexplored. This study investigates two critical components believed to influence this uncertainty: the recently discovered entropy neurons and a new set of components that we term token frequency neurons. Entropy neurons are characterized by an unusually high weight norm and influence the final layer normalization (LayerNorm) scale to effectively scale down the logits. Our work shows that entropy neurons operate by writing onto an unembedding null space, allowing them to impact the residual stream norm with minimal direct effect on the logits themselves. We observe the presence of entropy neurons across a range of models, up to 7 billion parameters. On the other hand, token frequency neurons, which we discover and describe here for the first time, boost or suppress each token's logit proportionally to its log frequency, thereby shifting the output distribution towards or away from the unigram distribution. Finally, we present a detailed case study where entropy neurons actively manage confidence in the setting of induction, i.e. detecting and continuing repeated subsequences.

### How to Connect Speech Foundation Models and Large Language Models? What   Matters and What Does Not
**Authors**: Francesco Verdini, Pierfrancesco Melucci, Stefano Perna, Francesco Cariaggi, Marco Gaido, Sara Papi, Szymon Mazurek, Marek Kasztelnik, Luisa Bentivogli, Sébastien Bratières, Paolo Merialdo, Simone Scardapane

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T12:44:49Z

**Summary**: The remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) has driven research efforts to leverage them for a wide range of tasks and input modalities. In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.

### Analyzing Logs of Large-Scale Software Systems using Time Curves   Visualization
**Authors**: Dmytro Borysenkov, Adriano Vogel, Sören Henning, Esteban Perez-Wohlfeil

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T12:42:45Z

**Summary**: Logs are crucial for analyzing large-scale software systems, offering insights into system health, performance, security threats, potential bugs, etc. However, their chaotic nature$\unicode{x2013}$characterized by sheer volume, lack of standards, and variability$\unicode{x2013}$makes manual analysis complex. The use of clustering algorithms can assist by grouping logs into a smaller set of templates, but lose the temporal and relational context in doing so. On the contrary, Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide meaningful explanations but struggle with processing large collections efficiently. Moreover, representation techniques for both approaches are typically limited to either plain text or traditional charting, especially when dealing with large-scale systems. In this paper, we combine clustering and LLM summarization with event detection and Multidimensional Scaling through the use of Time Curves to produce a holistic pipeline that enables efficient and automatic summarization of vast collections of software system logs. The core of our approach is the proposal of a semimetric distance that effectively measures similarity between events, thus enabling a meaningful representation. We show that our method can explain the main events of logs collected from different applications without prior knowledge. We also show how the approach can be used to detect general trends as well as outliers in parallel and distributed systems by overlapping multiple projections. As a result, we expect a significant reduction of the time required to analyze and resolve system-wide issues, identify performance bottlenecks and security risks, debug applications, etc.

### SM3-Text-to-Query: Synthetic Multi-Model Medical Text-to-Query Benchmark
**Authors**: Sithursan Sivasubramaniam, Cedric Osei-Akoto, Yi Zhang, Kurt Stockinger, Jonathan Fuerst

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T12:27:13Z

**Summary**: Electronic health records (EHRs) are stored in various database systems with different database models on heterogeneous storage architectures, such as relational databases, document stores, or graph databases. These different database models have a big impact on query complexity and performance. While this has been a known fact in database research, its implications for the growing number of Text-to-Query systems have surprisingly not been investigated so far. In this paper, we present SM3-Text-to-Query, the first multi-model medical Text-to-Query benchmark based on synthetic patient data from Synthea, following the SNOMED-CT taxonomy -- a widely used knowledge graph ontology covering medical terminology. SM3-Text-to-Query provides data representations for relational databases (PostgreSQL), document stores (MongoDB), and graph databases (Neo4j and GraphDB (RDF)), allowing the evaluation across four popular query languages, namely SQL, MQL, Cypher, and SPARQL. We systematically and manually develop 408 template questions, which we augment to construct a benchmark of 10K diverse natural language question/query pairs for these four query languages (40K pairs overall). On our dataset, we evaluate several common in-context-learning (ICL) approaches for a set of representative closed and open-source LLMs. Our evaluation sheds light on the trade-offs between database models and query languages for different ICL strategies and LLMs. Last, SM3-Text-to-Query is easily extendable to additional query languages or real, standard-based patient databases.

### An Early FIRST Reproduction and Improvements to Single-Token Decoding   for Fast Listwise Reranking
**Authors**: Zijian Chen, Ronak Pradeep, Jimmy Lin

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T12:08:17Z

**Summary**: Recent advances have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) excel as listwise rerankers, but their high computational demands remain a barrier to widespread adoption. Further, the traditional language modeling (LM) objective is not ideally suited for reranking tasks. FIRST is a novel approach that addresses these challenges by integrating a learning-to-rank objective and leveraging the logits of only the first generated token, thereby significantly reducing inference latency compared to traditional LLM rerankers. In this study, we extend the evaluation of FIRST to the TREC Deep Learning datasets (DL19-22), validating its robustness across diverse domains. We investigate the influence of different first-stage retrievers on FIRST rerankers, observing diminishing returns and patterns consistent with traditional LLM rerankers. Through applying the FIRST objective to a broader range of backbone models, we achieve effectiveness surpassing the original implementation. Our experiments confirm that fast reranking with single-token logits does not compromise out-of-domain reranking quality. To better quantify the computational savings in the original study, we measure and compare latency to find a 21%-42% gain across various models and benchmarks. Moreover, while LM training implicitly improves zero-shot single-token reranking, our experiments also raise questions about whether LM pre-training may hinder subsequent fine-tuning with the FIRST objective. These findings pave the way for more efficient and effective listwise reranking in future applications.

### LBPE: Long-token-first Tokenization to Improve Large Language Models
**Authors**: Haoran Lian, Yizhe Xiong, Zijia Lin, Jianwei Niu, Shasha Mo, Hui Chen, Peng Liu, Guiguang Ding

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T12:03:36Z

**Summary**: The prevalent use of Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) in Large Language Models (LLMs) facilitates robust handling of subword units and avoids issues of out-of-vocabulary words. Despite its success, a critical challenge persists: long tokens, rich in semantic information, have fewer occurrences in tokenized datasets compared to short tokens, which can result in imbalanced learning issue across different tokens. To address that, we propose LBPE, which prioritizes long tokens during the encoding process. LBPE generates tokens according to their reverse ranks of token length rather than their ranks in the vocabulary, granting longer tokens higher priority during the encoding process. Consequently, LBPE smooths the frequency differences between short and long tokens, and thus mitigates the learning imbalance. Extensive experiments across diverse language modeling tasks demonstrate that LBPE consistently outperforms the original BPE, well demonstrating its effectiveness.

### KyrgyzNLP: Challenges, Progress, and Future
**Authors**: Anton Alekseev, Timur Turatali

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T12:03:31Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have excelled in numerous benchmarks, advancing AI applications in both linguistic and non-linguistic tasks. However, this has primarily benefited well-resourced languages, leaving less-resourced ones (LRLs) at a disadvantage. In this paper, we highlight the current state of the NLP field in the specific LRL: kyrgyz tili.   Human evaluation, including annotated datasets created by native speakers, remains an irreplaceable component of reliable NLP performance, especially for LRLs where automatic evaluations can fall short. In recent assessments of the resources for Turkic languages, Kyrgyz is labeled with the status 'Scraping By', a severely under-resourced language spoken by millions. This is concerning given the growing importance of the language, not only in Kyrgyzstan but also among diaspora communities where it holds no official status.   We review prior efforts in the field, noting that many of the publicly available resources have only recently been developed, with few exceptions beyond dictionaries (the processed data used for the analysis is presented at https://kyrgyznlp.github.io/). While recent papers have made some headway, much more remains to be done. Despite interest and support from both business and government sectors in the Kyrgyz Republic, the situation for Kyrgyz language resources remains challenging. We stress the importance of community-driven efforts to build these resources, ensuring the future advancement sustainability. We then share our view of the most pressing challenges in Kyrgyz NLP. Finally, we propose a roadmap for future development in terms of research topics and language resources.

### EUREKHA: Enhancing User Representation for Key Hackers Identification in   Underground Forums
**Authors**: Abdoul Nasser Hassane Amadou, Anas Motii, Saida Elouardi, EL Houcine Bergou

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T11:09:45Z

**Summary**: Underground forums serve as hubs for cybercriminal activities, offering a space for anonymity and evasion of conventional online oversight. In these hidden communities, malicious actors collaborate to exchange illicit knowledge, tools, and tactics, driving a range of cyber threats from hacking techniques to the sale of stolen data, malware, and zero-day exploits. Identifying the key instigators (i.e., key hackers), behind these operations is essential but remains a complex challenge. This paper presents a novel method called EUREKHA (Enhancing User Representation for Key Hacker Identification in Underground Forums), designed to identify these key hackers by modeling each user as a textual sequence. This sequence is processed through a large language model (LLM) for domain-specific adaptation, with LLMs acting as feature extractors. These extracted features are then fed into a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to model user structural relationships, significantly improving identification accuracy. Furthermore, we employ BERTopic (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Topic Modeling) to extract personalized topics from user-generated content, enabling multiple textual representations per user and optimizing the selection of the most representative sequence. Our study demonstrates that fine-tuned LLMs outperform state-of-the-art methods in identifying key hackers. Additionally, when combined with GNNs, our model achieves significant improvements, resulting in approximately 6% and 10% increases in accuracy and F1-score, respectively, over existing methods. EUREKHA was tested on the Hack-Forums dataset, and we provide open-source access to our code.

### Enhancing Robustness in Language-Driven Robotics: A Modular Approach to   Failure Reduction
**Authors**: Émiland Garrabé, Pierre Teixeira, Mahdi Khoramshahi, Stéphane Doncieux

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T11:00:05Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to significant progress in robotics, enabling embodied agents to better understand and execute open-ended tasks. However, existing approaches using LLMs face limitations in grounding their outputs within the physical environment and aligning with the capabilities of the robot. This challenge becomes even more pronounced with smaller language models, which are more computationally efficient but less robust in task planning and execution. In this paper, we present a novel modular architecture designed to enhance the robustness of LLM-driven robotics by addressing these grounding and alignment issues. We formalize the task planning problem within a goal-conditioned POMDP framework, identify key failure modes in LLM-driven planning, and propose targeted design principles to mitigate these issues. Our architecture introduces an ``expected outcomes'' module to prevent mischaracterization of subgoals and a feedback mechanism to enable real-time error recovery. Experimental results, both in simulation and on physical robots, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves task success rates for pick-and-place and manipulation tasks compared to both larger LLMs and standard baselines. Through hardware experiments, we also demonstrate how our architecture can be run efficiently and locally. This work highlights the potential of smaller, locally-executable LLMs in robotics and provides a scalable, efficient solution for robust task execution.

### Provably Transformers Harness Multi-Concept Word Semantics for Efficient   In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Dake Bu, Wei Huang, Andi Han, Atsushi Nitanda, Taiji Suzuki, Qingfu Zhang, Hau-San Wong

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T10:30:59Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have displayed remarkable creative prowess and emergence capabilities. Existing empirical studies have revealed a strong connection between these LLMs' impressive emergence abilities and their in-context learning (ICL) capacity, allowing them to solve new tasks using only task-specific prompts without further fine-tuning. On the other hand, existing empirical and theoretical studies also show that there is a linear regularity of the multi-concept encoded semantic representation behind transformer-based LLMs. However, existing theoretical work fail to build up an understanding of the connection between this regularity and the innovative power of ICL. Additionally, prior work often focuses on simplified, unrealistic scenarios involving linear transformers or unrealistic loss functions, and they achieve only linear or sub-linear convergence rates. In contrast, this work provides a fine-grained mathematical analysis to show how transformers leverage the multi-concept semantics of words to enable powerful ICL and excellent out-of-distribution ICL abilities, offering insights into how transformers innovate solutions for certain unseen tasks encoded with multiple cross-concept semantics. Inspired by empirical studies on the linear latent geometry of LLMs, the analysis is based on a concept-based low-noise sparse coding prompt model. Leveraging advanced techniques, this work showcases the exponential 0-1 loss convergence over the highly non-convex training dynamics, which pioneeringly incorporates the challenges of softmax self-attention, ReLU-activated MLPs, and cross-entropy loss. Empirical simulations corroborate the theoretical findings.

### WorkflowLLM: Enhancing Workflow Orchestration Capability of Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Shengda Fan, Xin Cong, Yuepeng Fu, Zhong Zhang, Shuyan Zhang, Yuanwei Liu, Yesai Wu, Yankai Lin, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T09:58:02Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have driven a revolutionary paradigm shift in process automation from Robotic Process Automation to Agentic Process Automation by automating the workflow orchestration procedure based on LLMs. However, existing LLMs (even the advanced OpenAI GPT-4o) are confined to achieving satisfactory capability in workflow orchestration. To address this limitation, we present WorkflowLLM, a data-centric framework elaborately designed to enhance the capability of LLMs in workflow orchestration. It first constructs a large-scale fine-tuning dataset WorkflowBench with 106,763 samples, covering 1,503 APIs from 83 applications across 28 categories. Specifically, the construction process can be divided into three phases: (1) Data Collection: we collect real-world workflow data from Apple Shortcuts and RoutineHub, transcribing them into Python-style code. We further equip them with generated hierarchical thought via ChatGPT. (2) Query Expansion: we prompt ChatGPT to generate more task queries to enrich the diversity and complexity of workflows. (3) Workflow Generation: we leverage an annotator model trained on collected data to generate workflows for synthesized queries. Finally, we merge the synthetic samples that pass quality confirmation with the collected samples to obtain the WorkflowBench. Based on WorkflowBench, we fine-tune Llama-3.1-8B to obtain WorkflowLlama. Our experiments show that WorkflowLlama demonstrates a strong capacity to orchestrate complex workflows, while also achieving notable generalization performance on previously unseen APIs. Additionally, WorkflowBench exhibits robust zero-shot generalization capabilities on an out-of-distribution task planning dataset, T-Eval. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/WorkflowLLM.

**Authors**: Dincy R. Arikkat, Abhinav M., Navya Binu, Parvathi M., Navya Biju, K. S. Arunima, Vinod P., Rafidha Rehiman K. A., Mauro Conti

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T09:40:53Z

**Summary**: In the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber security, intelligent chatbots are gaining prominence. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing empower these chatbots to handle user inquiries and deliver threat intelligence. This helps cyber security knowledge readily available to both professionals and the public. Traditional rule-based chatbots often lack flexibility and struggle to adapt to user interactions. In contrast, Large Language Model-based chatbots offer contextually relevant information across multiple domains and adapt to evolving conversational contexts. In this work, we develop IntellBot, an advanced cyber security Chatbot built on top of cutting-edge technologies like Large Language Models and Langchain alongside a Retrieval-Augmented Generation model to deliver superior capabilities. This chatbot gathers information from diverse data sources to create a comprehensive knowledge base covering known vulnerabilities, recent cyber attacks, and emerging threats. It delivers tailored responses, serving as a primary hub for cyber security insights. By providing instant access to relevant information and resources, this IntellBot enhances threat intelligence, incident response, and overall security posture, saving time and empowering users with knowledge of cyber security best practices. Moreover, we analyzed the performance of our copilot using a two-stage evaluation strategy. We achieved BERT score above 0.8 by indirect approach and a cosine similarity score ranging from 0.8 to 1, which affirms the accuracy of our copilot. Additionally, we utilized RAGAS to evaluate the RAG model, and all evaluation metrics consistently produced scores above 0.77, highlighting the efficacy of our system.

### VISTA: Visual Integrated System for Tailored Automation in Math Problem   Generation Using LLM
**Authors**: Jeongwoo Lee, Kwangsuk Park, Jihyeon Park

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T09:15:56Z

**Summary**: Generating accurate and consistent visual aids is a critical challenge in mathematics education, where visual representations like geometric shapes and functions play a pivotal role in enhancing student comprehension. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the creation of complex mathematical visualizations alongside coherent problem text. Our approach not only simplifies the generation of precise visual aids but also aligns these aids with the problem's core mathematical concepts, improving both problem creation and assessment. By integrating multiple agents, each responsible for distinct tasks such as numeric calculation, geometry validation, and visualization, our system delivers mathematically accurate and contextually relevant problems with visual aids. Evaluation across Geometry and Function problem types shows that our method significantly outperforms basic LLMs in terms of text coherence, consistency, relevance and similarity, while maintaining the essential geometrical and functional integrity of the original problems. Although some challenges remain in ensuring consistent visual outputs, our framework demonstrates the immense potential of LLMs in transforming the way educators generate and utilize visual aids in math education.

### Seq1F1B: Efficient Sequence-Level Pipeline Parallelism for Large   Language Model Training
**Authors**: Ao Sun, Weilin Zhao, Xu Han, Cheng Yang, Xinrong Zhang, Zhiyuan Liu, Chuan Shi, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T09:02:24Z

**Summary**: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on distributed training strategies, among which pipeline parallelism plays a crucial role. As LLMs' training sequence length extends to 32k or even 128k, the current pipeline parallel methods face severe bottlenecks, including high memory footprints and substantial pipeline bubbles, greatly hindering model scalability and training throughput. To enhance memory efficiency and training throughput, in this work, we introduce an efficient sequence-level one-forward-one-backward (1F1B) pipeline scheduling method tailored for training LLMs on long sequences named Seq1F1B. Seq1F1B decomposes batch-level schedulable units into finer sequence-level units, reducing bubble size and memory footprint. Considering that Seq1F1B may produce slight extra bubbles if sequences are split evenly, we design a computation-wise strategy to partition input sequences and mitigate this side effect. Compared to competitive pipeline baseline methods such as Megatron 1F1B pipeline parallelism, our method achieves higher training throughput with less memory footprint. Notably, Seq1F1B efficiently trains a LLM with 30B parameters on sequences up to 64k using 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs without recomputation strategies, a feat unachievable with existing methods. Our source code is based on Megatron-LM, and now is avaiable at: https://github.com/MayDomine/Seq1F1B.git.

### Web Archives Metadata Generation with GPT-4o: Challenges and Insights
**Authors**: Abigail Yongping Huang, Ashwin Nair, Zhen Rong Goh, Tianrui Liu

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T08:59:40Z

**Summary**: Current metadata creation for web archives is time consuming and costly due to reliance on human effort. This paper explores the use of gpt-4o for metadata generation within the Web Archive Singapore, focusing on scalability, efficiency, and cost effectiveness. We processed 112 Web ARChive (WARC) files using data reduction techniques, achieving a notable 99.9% reduction in metadata generation costs. By prompt engineering, we generated titles and abstracts, which were evaluated both intrinsically using Levenshtein Distance and BERTScore, and extrinsically with human cataloguers using McNemar's test. Results indicate that while our method offers significant cost savings and efficiency gains, human curated metadata maintains an edge in quality. The study identifies key challenges including content inaccuracies, hallucinations, and translation issues, suggesting that Large Language Models (LLMs) should serve as complements rather than replacements for human cataloguers. Future work will focus on refining prompts, improving content filtering, and addressing privacy concerns through experimentation with smaller models. This research advances the integration of LLMs in web archiving, offering valuable insights into their current capabilities and outlining directions for future enhancements. The code is available at https://github.com/masamune-prog/warc2summary for further development and use by institutions facing similar challenges.

**Authors**: Pulkit Pattnaik, Rishabh Maheshwary, Kelechi Ogueji, Vikas Yadav, Sathwik Tejaswi Madhusudhan

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T08:55:00Z

**Summary**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective technique that leverages pairwise preference data (usually one chosen and rejected response pair per user prompt) to align LLMs to human preferences. In practice, multiple responses can exist for a given prompt with varying quality relative to each other. With availability of such quality ratings for multiple responses, we propose utilizing these responses to create multiple preference pairs for a given prompt. Our work focuses on systematically using the constructed multiple preference pair in DPO training via curriculum learning methodology. In particular, we order these multiple pairs of preference data from easy to hard (emulating curriculum training) according to various criteria. We show detailed comparisons of our proposed approach to the standard single-pair DPO setting. Our method, which we call Curry-DPO consistently shows increased performance gains on MTbench, Vicuna, WizardLM, and the UltraFeedback test set, highlighting its effectiveness. More specifically, Curry-DPO achieves a score of 7.43 on MT-bench with Zephy-7B model outperforming majority of existing LLMs with similar parameter size. Curry-DPO also achieves the highest adjusted win rates on Vicuna, WizardLM, and UltraFeedback test datasets (90.7%, 87.1%, and 87.9% respectively) in our experiments, with notable gains of upto 7.5% when compared to standard DPO technique. We release the preference pairs used in alignment at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ServiceNow-AI/Curriculum_DPO_preferences

### Gap-Filling Prompting Enhances Code-Assisted Mathematical Reasoning
**Authors**: Mohammad Ghiasvand Mohammadkhani

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T08:52:59Z

**Summary**: Despite the strong performance of large language models (LLMs) in tasks like mathematical reasoning, their practical use is limited by high computational demands and proprietary restrictions. Chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT) fine-tuning are common methods to transfer LLM knowledge to small language models (SLMs). However, CoT often leads to calculation errors in SLMs, while PoT has shown more promise. While most PoT-based approaches focus on direct problem-to-code conversion or extracting only the key information from questions and then providing code solution for it, this work emphasizes filling the gaps in the question to clearly illustrate the solution path, which can be challenging for an SLM to understand when such information is not explicitly provided. Therefore, this paper introduces Gap-Filling Prompting (GFP), a novel two-step prompting strategy designed to enhance the problem-solving process for SLMs. The first step identifies these gaps and provides hints for filling them, while the second step adds the hints to the question to generate a final code solution. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that GFP significantly improves the mathematical reasoning abilities of SLMs.

### Benchmarking Distributional Alignment of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Nicole Meister, Carlos Guestrin, Tatsunori Hashimoto

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T08:41:17Z

**Summary**: Language models (LMs) are increasingly used as simulacra for people, yet their ability to match the distribution of views of a specific demographic group and be \textit{distributionally aligned} remains uncertain. This notion of distributional alignment is complex, as there is significant variation in the types of attributes that are simulated. Prior works have underexplored the role of three critical variables -- the question domain, steering method, and distribution expression method -- which motivates our contribution of a benchmark explicitly addressing these dimensions. We construct a dataset expanding beyond political values, create human baselines for this task, and evaluate the extent to which an LM can align with a particular group's opinion distribution to inform design choices of such simulation systems. Our analysis reveals open problems regarding if, and how, LMs can be used to simulate humans, and that LLMs can more accurately describe the opinion distribution than simulate such distributions.

### GraphXAIN: Narratives to Explain Graph Neural Networks
**Authors**: Mateusz Cedro, David Martens

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T08:29:10Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a powerful technique for machine learning on graph-structured data, yet they pose interpretability challenges, especially for non-expert users. Existing GNN explanation methods often yield technical outputs such as subgraphs and feature importance scores, which are not easily understood. Building on recent insights from social science and other Explainable AI (XAI) methods, we propose GraphXAIN, a natural language narrative that explains individual predictions made by GNNs. We present a model-agnostic and explainer-agnostic XAI approach that complements graph explainers by generating GraphXAINs, using Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrating graph data, individual predictions from GNNs, explanatory subgraphs, and feature importances. We define XAI Narratives and XAI Descriptions, highlighting their distinctions and emphasizing the importance of narrative principles in effective explanations. By incorporating natural language narratives, our approach supports graph practitioners and non-expert users, aligning with social science research on explainability and enhancing user understanding and trust in complex GNN models. We demonstrate GraphXAIN's capabilities on a real-world graph dataset, illustrating how its generated narratives can aid understanding compared to traditional graph explainer outputs or other descriptive explanation methods.

### Robust and Efficient Fine-tuning of LLMs with Bayesian   Reparameterization of Low-Rank Adaptation
**Authors**: Ayan Sengupta, Vaibhav Seth, Arinjay Pathak, Natraj Raman, Sriram Gopalakrishnan, Tanmoy Chakraborty

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T07:31:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly resource-intensive to fine-tune due to their enormous size. While low-rank adaptation is a prominent parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach, it suffers from sensitivity to hyperparameter choices, leading to instability in model performance on fine-tuning downstream tasks. This paper highlights the importance of effective parameterization in low-rank fine-tuning to reduce estimator variance and enhance the stability of final model outputs. We propose MonteCLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning technique, employing Monte Carlo estimation to learn an unbiased posterior estimation of low-rank parameters with low expected variance, which stabilizes fine-tuned LLMs with only O(1) additional parameters. MonteCLoRA shows significant improvements in accuracy and robustness, achieving up to 3.8% higher accuracy and 8.6% greater robustness than existing efficient fine-tuning methods on natural language understanding tasks with pre-trained RoBERTa-base. Furthermore, in generative tasks with pre-trained LLaMA-1-7B, MonteCLoRA demonstrates robust zero-shot performance with 50% lower variance than the contemporary efficient fine-tuning methods. The theoretical and empirical results presented in the paper underscore how parameterization and hyperpriors balance exploration-exploitation in the low-rank parametric space, therefore leading to more optimal and robust parameter estimation during efficient fine-tuning.

### Ev2R: Evaluating Evidence Retrieval in Automated Fact-Checking
**Authors**: Mubashara Akhtar, Michael Schlichtkrull, Andreas Vlachos

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T07:05:06Z

**Summary**: Current automated fact-checking (AFC) approaches commonly evaluate evidence either implicitly via the predicted verdicts or by comparing retrieved evidence with a predefined closed knowledge source, such as Wikipedia. However, these methods suffer from limitations, resulting from their reliance on evaluation metrics developed for different purposes and constraints imposed by closed knowledge sources. Recent advances in natural language generation (NLG) evaluation offer new possibilities for evidence assessment. In this work, we introduce Ev2R, an evaluation framework for AFC that comprises three types of approaches for evidence evaluation: reference-based, proxy-reference, and reference-less. We evaluate their effectiveness through agreement with human ratings and adversarial tests, and demonstrate that prompt-based scorers, particularly those leveraging LLMs and reference evidence, outperform traditional evaluation approaches.

### Robust Prompt Optimization for Defending Language Models Against   Jailbreaking Attacks
**Authors**: Andy Zhou, Bo Li, Haohan Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T06:57:05Z

**Summary**: Despite advances in AI alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks or jailbreaking, in which adversaries can modify prompts to induce unwanted behavior. While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art.

### Selective Generation for Controllable Language Models
**Authors**: Minjae Lee, Kyungmin Kim, Taesoo Kim, Sangdon Park

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T06:47:04Z

**Summary**: Trustworthiness of generative language models (GLMs) is crucial in their deployment to critical decision making systems. Hence, certified risk control methods such as selective prediction and conformal prediction have been applied to mitigating the hallucination problem in various supervised downstream tasks. However, the lack of appropriate correctness metric hinders applying such principled methods to language generation tasks. In this paper, we circumvent this problem by leveraging the concept of textual entailment to evaluate the correctness of the generated sequence, and propose two selective generation algorithms which control the false discovery rate with respect to the textual entailment relation (FDR-E) with a theoretical guarantee: $\texttt{SGen}^{\texttt{Sup}}$ and $\texttt{SGen}^{\texttt{Semi}}$. $\texttt{SGen}^{\texttt{Sup}}$, a direct modification of the selective prediction, is a supervised learning algorithm which exploits entailment-labeled data, annotated by humans. Since human annotation is costly, we further propose a semi-supervised version, $\texttt{SGen}^{\texttt{Semi}}$, which fully utilizes the unlabeled data by pseudo-labeling, leveraging an entailment set function learned via conformal prediction. Furthermore, $\texttt{SGen}^{\texttt{Semi}}$ enables to use more general class of selection functions, neuro-selection functions, and provides users with an optimal selection function class given multiple candidates. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the $\texttt{SGen}$ family in achieving a desired FDR-E level with comparable selection efficiency to those from baselines on both open and closed source GLMs. Code and datasets are provided at https://github.com/ml-postech/selective-generation.

### Enhancing Visual Classification using Comparative Descriptors
**Authors**: Hankyeol Lee, Gawon Seo, Wonseok Choi, Geunyoung Jung, Kyungwoo Song, Jiyoung Jung

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T06:28:02Z

**Summary**: The performance of vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, in visual classification tasks, has been enhanced by leveraging semantic knowledge from large language models (LLMs), including GPT. Recent studies have shown that in zero-shot classification tasks, descriptors incorporating additional cues, high-level concepts, or even random characters often outperform those using only the category name. In many classification tasks, while the top-1 accuracy may be relatively low, the top-5 accuracy is often significantly higher. This gap implies that most misclassifications occur among a few similar classes, highlighting the model's difficulty in distinguishing between classes with subtle differences. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel concept of comparative descriptors. These descriptors emphasize the unique features of a target class against its most similar classes, enhancing differentiation. By generating and integrating these comparative descriptors into the classification framework, we refine the semantic focus and improve classification accuracy. An additional filtering process ensures that these descriptors are closer to the image embeddings in the CLIP space, further enhancing performance. Our approach demonstrates improved accuracy and robustness in visual classification tasks by addressing the specific challenge of subtle inter-class differences.

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T06:12:56Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Diagram of Thought (DoT) have enabled the creation of autonomous intelligent systems capable of performing cluster diagnostics and troubleshooting. By integrating these technologies with self-play methodologies, we have developed an LLM-agent system designed to autonomously diagnose and resolve issues within AI clusters. Our innovations include a knowledge base tailored for cluster diagnostics, enhanced LLM algorithms, practical deployment strategies for agents, and a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLM capabilities in this domain. Through extensive experimentation across multiple dimensions, we have demonstrated the superiority of our system in addressing the challenges faced in cluster diagnostics, particularly in detecting and rectifying performance issues more efficiently and accurately than traditional methods.

### Accelerating Greedy Coordinate Gradient and General Prompt Optimization   via Probe Sampling
**Authors**: Yiran Zhao, Wenyue Zheng, Tianle Cai, Xuan Long Do, Kenji Kawaguchi, Anirudh Goyal, Michael Shieh

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T06:07:51Z

**Summary**: Safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical issue given their rapid progresses. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing adversarial prompts to break the aligned LLMs, but optimization of GCG is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b-chat and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. Furthermore, probe sampling is also able to accelerate other prompt optimization techniques and adversarial methods, leading to acceleration of $1.8\times$ for AutoPrompt, $2.4\times$ for APE and $2.4\times$ for AutoDAN.

### LLM-PySC2: Starcraft II learning environment for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zongyuan Li, Yanan Ni, Runnan Qi, Lumin Jiang, Chang Lu, Xiaojie Xu, Xiangbei Liu, Pengfei Li, Yunzheng Guo, Zhe Ma, Xian Guo, Kuihua Huang, Xuebo Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T06:04:22Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a new environment LLM-PySC2 (the Large Language Model StarCraft II Learning Environment), a platform derived from DeepMind's StarCraft II Learning Environment that serves to develop Large Language Models (LLMs) based decision-making methodologies. This environment is the first to offer the complete StarCraft II action space, multi-modal observation interfaces, and a structured game knowledge database, which are seamlessly connected with various LLMs to facilitate the research of LLMs-based decision-making. To further support multi-agent research, we developed an LLM collaborative framework that supports multi-agent concurrent queries and multi-agent communication. In our experiments, the LLM-PySC2 environment is adapted to be compatible with the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) task group and provided eight new scenarios focused on macro-decision abilities. We evaluated nine mainstream LLMs in the experiments, and results show that sufficient parameters are necessary for LLMs to make decisions, but improving reasoning ability does not directly lead to better decision-making outcomes. Our findings further indicate the importance of enabling large models to learn autonomously in the deployment environment through parameter training or train-free learning techniques. Ultimately, we expect that the LLM-PySC2 environment can promote research on learning methods for LLMs, helping LLM-based methods better adapt to task scenarios.

### Reasoning Robustness of LLMs to Adversarial Typographical Errors
**Authors**: Esther Gan, Yiran Zhao, Liying Cheng, Yancan Mao, Anirudh Goyal, Kenji Kawaguchi, Min-Yen Kan, Michael Shieh

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T05:54:05Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, CoT can be biased by users' instruction. In this work, we study the reasoning robustness of LLMs to typographical errors, which can naturally occur in users' queries. We design an Adversarial Typo Attack ($\texttt{ATA}$) algorithm that iteratively samples typos for words that are important to the query and selects the edit that is most likely to succeed in attacking. It shows that LLMs are sensitive to minimal adversarial typographical changes. Notably, with 1 character edit, Mistral-7B-Instruct's accuracy drops from 43.7% to 38.6% on GSM8K, while with 8 character edits the performance further drops to 19.2%. To extend our evaluation to larger and closed-source LLMs, we develop the $\texttt{R$^2$ATA}$ benchmark, which assesses models' $\underline{R}$easoning $\underline{R}$obustness to $\underline{\texttt{ATA}}$. It includes adversarial typographical questions derived from three widely used reasoning datasets-GSM8K, BBH, and MMLU-by applying $\texttt{ATA}$ to open-source LLMs. $\texttt{R$^2$ATA}$ demonstrates remarkable transferability and causes notable performance drops across multiple super large and closed-source LLMs.

### SciDQA: A Deep Reading Comprehension Dataset over Scientific Papers
**Authors**: Shruti Singh, Nandan Sarkar, Arman Cohan

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T05:28:22Z

**Summary**: Scientific literature is typically dense, requiring significant background knowledge and deep comprehension for effective engagement. We introduce SciDQA, a new dataset for reading comprehension that challenges LLMs for a deep understanding of scientific articles, consisting of 2,937 QA pairs. Unlike other scientific QA datasets, SciDQA sources questions from peer reviews by domain experts and answers by paper authors, ensuring a thorough examination of the literature. We enhance the dataset's quality through a process that carefully filters out lower quality questions, decontextualizes the content, tracks the source document across different versions, and incorporates a bibliography for multi-document question-answering. Questions in SciDQA necessitate reasoning across figures, tables, equations, appendices, and supplementary materials, and require multi-document reasoning. We evaluate several open-source and proprietary LLMs across various configurations to explore their capabilities in generating relevant and factual responses. Our comprehensive evaluation, based on metrics for surface-level similarity and LLM judgements, highlights notable performance discrepancies. SciDQA represents a rigorously curated, naturally derived scientific QA dataset, designed to facilitate research on complex scientific text understanding.

### Exploring the LLM Journey from Cognition to Expression with Linear   Representations
**Authors**: Yuzi Yan, Jialian Li, Yipin Zhang, Dong Yan

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T05:19:48Z

**Summary**: This paper presents an in-depth examination of the evolution and interplay of cognitive and expressive capabilities in large language models (LLMs), with a specific focus on Baichuan-7B and Baichuan-33B, an advanced bilingual (Chinese and English) LLM series. We define and explore the model's cognitive and expressive capabilities through linear representations across three critical phases: Pretraining, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Cognitive capability is defined as the quantity and quality of information conveyed by the neuron output vectors within the network, similar to the neural signal processing in human cognition. Expressive capability is defined as the model's capability to produce word-level output. Our findings unveil a sequential development pattern, where cognitive abilities are largely established during Pretraining, whereas expressive abilities predominantly advance during SFT and RLHF. Statistical analyses confirm a significant correlation between the two capabilities, suggesting that cognitive capacity may limit expressive potential. The paper also explores the theoretical underpinnings of these divergent developmental trajectories and their connection to the LLMs' architectural design. Moreover, we evaluate various optimization-independent strategies, such as few-shot learning and repeated sampling, which bridge the gap between cognitive and expressive capabilities. This research reveals the potential connection between the hidden space and the output space, contributing valuable insights into the interpretability and controllability of their training processes.

### Hal-Eval: A Universal and Fine-grained Hallucination Evaluation   Framework for Large Vision Language Models
**Authors**: Chaoya Jiang, Hongrui Jia, Wei Ye, Mengfan Dong, Haiyang Xu, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Shikun Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T05:08:43Z

**Summary**: Large Vision Language Models exhibit remarkable capabilities but struggle with hallucinations inconsistencies between images and their descriptions. Previous hallucination evaluation studies on LVLMs have identified hallucinations in terms of objects, attributes, and relations but overlooked complex hallucinations that create an entire narrative around a fictional entity. In this paper, we introduce a refined taxonomy of hallucinations, featuring a new category: Event Hallucination. We then utilize advanced LLMs to generate and filter fine grained hallucinatory data consisting of various types of hallucinations, with a particular focus on event hallucinations, laying the groundwork for integrating discriminative and generative evaluation methods within our universal evaluation framework. The proposed benchmark distinctively assesses LVLMs ability to tackle a broad spectrum of hallucinations, making it a reliable and comprehensive tool for gauging LVLMs efficacy in handling hallucinations. We will release our code and data.

### Content Quality vs. Attention Allocation: An LLM-Based Case Study in   Peer-to-peer Mental Health Networks
**Authors**: Teng Ye, Hanson Yan, Xuhuan Huang, Connor Grogan, Walter Yuan, Qiaozhu Mei, Matthew O. Jackson

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T05:04:55Z

**Summary**: With the rise of social media and peer-to-peer networks, users increasingly rely on crowdsourced responses for information and assistance. However, the mechanisms used to rank and promote responses often prioritize and end up biasing in favor of timeliness over quality, which may result in suboptimal support for help-seekers. We analyze millions of responses to mental health-related posts, utilizing large language models (LLMs) to assess the multi-dimensional quality of content, including relevance, empathy, and cultural alignment, among other aspects. Our findings reveal a mismatch between content quality and attention allocation: earlier responses - despite being relatively lower in quality - receive disproportionately high fractions of upvotes and visibility due to platform ranking algorithms. We demonstrate that the quality of the top-ranked responses could be improved by up to 39 percent, and even the simplest re-ranking strategy could significantly improve the quality of top responses, highlighting the need for more nuanced ranking mechanisms that prioritize both timeliness and content quality, especially emotional engagement in online mental health communities.

### TraDE: Network and Traffic-aware Adaptive Scheduling for Microservices   Under Dynamics
**Authors**: Ming Chen, Muhammed Tawfiqul Islam, Maria Rodriguez Read, Rajkumar Buyya

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T04:35:14Z

**Summary**: The transition from monolithic architecture to microservices has enhanced flexibility in application design and its scalable execution. This approach often involves using a computing cluster managed by a container orchestration platform, which supports the deployment of microservices. However, this shift introduces significant challenges, particularly in the efficient scheduling of containerized services. These challenges are compounded by unpredictable scenarios such as dynamic incoming workloads with various execution traffic and variable communication delays among cluster nodes. Existing works often overlook the real-time traffic impacts of dynamic requests on running microservices, as well as the varied communication delays across cluster nodes. Consequently, even optimally deployed microservices could suffer from significant performance degradation over time. To address these issues, we introduce a network and traffic-aware adaptive scheduling framework, TraDE. This framework can adaptively redeploy microservice containers to maintain desired performance amid changing traffic and network conditions within the hosting cluster. We have implemented TraDE as an extension to the Kubernetes platform. Additionally, we deployed realistic microservice applications in a real compute cluster and conducted extensive experiments to assess our framework's performance in various scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TraDE in rescheduling running microservices to enhance end-to-end performance while maintaining a high goodput ratio. Compared with the existing method NetMARKS, TraDE outperforms it by reducing the average response time of the application by up to 48.3\%, and improving the throughput by up to 1.4x while maintaining a goodput ratio of 95.36\% and showing robust adaptive capability under sustained workloads.

### Exploring the Alignment Landscape: LLMs and Geometric Deep Models in   Protein Representation
**Authors**: Dong Shu, Bingbing Duan, Kai Guo, Kaixiong Zhou, Jiliang Tang, Mengnan Du

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T04:15:08Z

**Summary**: Latent representation alignment has become a foundational technique for constructing multimodal large language models (MLLM) by mapping embeddings from different modalities into a shared space, often aligned with the embedding space of large language models (LLMs) to enable effective cross-modal understanding. While preliminary protein-focused MLLMs have emerged, they have predominantly relied on heuristic approaches, lacking a fundamental understanding of optimal alignment practices across representations. In this study, we explore the alignment of multimodal representations between LLMs and Geometric Deep Models (GDMs) in the protein domain. We comprehensively evaluate three state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma2-2B, LLaMa3.1-8B, and LLaMa3.1-70B) with four protein-specialized GDMs (GearNet, GVP, ScanNet, GAT). Our work examines alignment factors from both model and protein perspectives, identifying challenges in current alignment methodologies and proposing strategies to improve the alignment process. Our key findings reveal that GDMs incorporating both graph and 3D structural information align better with LLMs, larger LLMs demonstrate improved alignment capabilities, and protein rarity significantly impacts alignment performance. We also find that increasing GDM embedding dimensions, using two-layer projection heads, and fine-tuning LLMs on protein-specific data substantially enhance alignment quality. These strategies offer potential enhancements to the performance of protein-related multimodal models. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Tizzzzy/LLM-GDM-alignment.

### On Generative Agents in Recommendation
**Authors**: An Zhang, Yuxin Chen, Leheng Sheng, Xiang Wang, Tat-Seng Chua

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T03:58:00Z

**Summary**: Recommender systems are the cornerstone of today's information dissemination, yet a disconnect between offline metrics and online performance greatly hinders their development. Addressing this challenge, we envision a recommendation simulator, capitalizing on recent breakthroughs in human-level intelligence exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose Agent4Rec, a user simulator in recommendation, leveraging LLM-empowered generative agents equipped with user profile, memory, and actions modules specifically tailored for the recommender system. In particular, these agents' profile modules are initialized using real-world datasets (e.g. MovieLens, Steam, Amazon-Book), capturing users' unique tastes and social traits; memory modules log both factual and emotional memories and are integrated with an emotion-driven reflection mechanism; action modules support a wide variety of behaviors, spanning both taste-driven and emotion-driven actions. Each agent interacts with personalized recommender models in a page-by-page manner, relying on a pre-implemented collaborative filtering-based recommendation algorithm. We delve into both the capabilities and limitations of Agent4Rec, aiming to explore an essential research question: ``To what extent can LLM-empowered generative agents faithfully simulate the behavior of real, autonomous humans in recommender systems?'' Extensive and multi-faceted evaluations of Agent4Rec highlight both the alignment and deviation between agents and user-personalized preferences. Beyond mere performance comparison, we explore insightful experiments, such as emulating the filter bubble effect and discovering the underlying causal relationships in recommendation tasks.

### GRS-QA -- Graph Reasoning-Structured Question Answering Dataset
**Authors**: Anish Pahilajani, Devasha Trivedi, Jincen Shuai, Khin S. Yone, Samyak Rajesh Jain, Namyong Park, Ryan A. Rossi, Nesreen K. Ahmed, Franck Dernoncourt, Yu Wang

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T03:09:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in multi-hop question-answering (M-QA) due to their advanced reasoning abilities. However, the impact of the inherent reasoning structures on LLM M-QA performance remains unclear, largely due to the absence of QA datasets that provide fine-grained reasoning structures. To address this gap, we introduce the Graph Reasoning-Structured Question Answering Dataset (GRS-QA), which includes both semantic contexts and reasoning structures for QA pairs. Unlike existing M-QA datasets, where different reasoning structures are entangled together, GRS-QA explicitly captures intricate reasoning pathways by constructing reasoning graphs, where nodes represent textual contexts and edges denote logical flows. These reasoning graphs of different structures enable a fine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning capabilities across various reasoning structures. Our empirical analysis reveals that LLMs perform differently when handling questions with varying reasoning structures. This finding facilitates the exploration of textual structures as compared with semantics.

### SpecHub: Provable Acceleration to Multi-Draft Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Ryan Sun, Tianyi Zhou, Xun Chen, Lichao Sun

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T02:47:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in advancing natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but their sequential token generation limits inference speed. Multi-Draft Speculative Decoding (MDSD) offers a promising solution by using a smaller draft model to generate multiple token sequences, which the target LLM verifies in parallel. However, current heuristic approaches, such as Recursive Rejection Sampling (RRS), suffer from low acceptance rates in subsequent drafts, limiting the advantages of using multiple drafts. Meanwhile, Optimal Transport with Membership Cost (OTM) can theoretically improve acceptance rates, but its computational cost is too high for real-time use. We present SpecHub, a novel, efficient sampling-verification method for MDSD that improves acceptance rates with only linear computational overhead. By simplifying the OTM problem into a compact Linear Programming model, SpecHub significantly reduces computational complexity. It further accelerates sampling by leveraging a sparse joint distribution, focusing computation on high-probability token sequences. In extensive experiments, Spechub consistently generates 0.05-0.27 and 0.02-0.16 more tokens per step than RRS and RRS without replacement.

### A Taxonomy of AgentOps for Enabling Observability of Foundation Model   based Agents
**Authors**: Liming Dong, Qinghua Lu, Liming Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T02:31:03Z

**Summary**: The ever-improving quality of LLMs has fueled the growth of a diverse range of downstream tasks, leading to an increased demand for AI automation and a burgeoning interest in developing foundation model (FM)-based autonomous agents. As AI agent systems tackle more complex tasks and evolve, they involve a wider range of stakeholders, including agent users, agentic system developers and deployers, and AI model developers. These systems also integrate multiple components such as AI agent workflows, RAG pipelines, prompt management, agent capabilities, and observability features. In this case, obtaining reliable outputs and answers from these agents remains challenging, necessitating a dependable execution process and end-to-end observability solutions. To build reliable AI agents and LLM applications, it is essential to shift towards designing AgentOps platforms that ensure observability and traceability across the entire development-to-production life-cycle. To this end, we conducted a rapid review and identified relevant AgentOps tools from the agentic ecosystem. Based on this review, we provide an overview of the essential features of AgentOps and propose a comprehensive overview of observability data/traceable artifacts across the agent production life-cycle. Our findings provide a systematic overview of the current AgentOps landscape, emphasizing the critical role of observability/traceability in enhancing the reliability of autonomous agent systems.

### Fox-1 Technical Report
**Authors**: Zijian Hu, Jipeng Zhang, Rui Pan, Zhaozhuo Xu, Salman Avestimehr, Chaoyang He, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T02:24:29Z

**Summary**: We present Fox-1, a series of small language models (SLMs) consisting of Fox-1-1.6B and Fox-1-1.6B-Instruct-v0.1. These models are pre-trained on 3 trillion tokens of web-scraped document data and fine-tuned with 5 billion tokens of instruction-following and multi-turn conversation data. Aiming to improve the pre-training efficiency, Fox-1-1.6B model introduces a novel 3-stage data curriculum across all the training data with 2K-8K sequence length. In architecture design, Fox-1 features a deeper layer structure, an expanded vocabulary, and utilizes Grouped Query Attention (GQA), offering a performant and efficient architecture compared to other SLMs. Fox-1 achieves better or on-par performance in various benchmarks compared to StableLM-2-1.6B, Gemma-2B, Qwen1.5-1.8B, and OpenELM1.1B, with competitive inference speed and throughput. The model weights have been released under the Apache 2.0 license, where we aim to promote the democratization of LLMs and make them fully accessible to the whole open-source community.

### GPT Semantic Cache: Reducing LLM Costs and Latency via Semantic   Embedding Caching
**Authors**: Sajal Regmi, Chetan Phakami Pun

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T02:21:19Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT (Radford et al., 2019), have significantly advanced artificial intelligence by enabling sophisticated natural language understanding and generation. However, the high computational and financial costs associated with frequent API calls to these models present a substantial bottleneck, especially for applications like customer service chatbots that handle repetitive queries. In this paper, we introduce GPT Semantic Cache, a method that leverages semantic caching of query embeddings in in-memory storage (Redis). By storing embeddings of user queries, our approach efficiently identifies semantically similar questions, allowing for the retrieval of pre-generated responses without redundant API calls to the LLM. This technique reduces operational costs and improves response times, enhancing the efficiency of LLM-powered applications.

### Preference Tuning For Toxicity Mitigation Generalizes Across Languages
**Authors**: Xiaochen Li, Zheng-Xin Yong, Stephen H. Bach

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T02:17:22Z

**Summary**: Detoxifying multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) has become crucial due to their increasing global use. In this work, we explore zero-shot cross-lingual generalization of preference tuning in detoxifying LLMs. Unlike previous studies that show limited cross-lingual generalization for other safety tasks, we demonstrate that Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training with only English data can significantly reduce toxicity in multilingual open-ended generations. For example, the probability of mGPT-1.3B generating toxic continuations drops from 46.8% to 3.9% across 17 different languages after training. Our results also extend to other multilingual LLMs, such as BLOOM, Llama3, and Aya-23. Using mechanistic interpretability tools like causal intervention and activation analysis, we identified the dual multilinguality property of MLP layers in LLMs, which explains the cross-lingual generalization of DPO. Finally, we show that bilingual sentence retrieval can predict the cross-lingual transferability of DPO preference tuning.

### Seeing Through the Fog: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Hallucination   Detection Systems
**Authors**: Alexander Thomas, Seth Rosen, Vishnu Vettrivel

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T02:06:41Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a comparative analysis of hallucination detection systems for AI, focusing on automatic summarization and question answering tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs). We evaluate different hallucination detection systems using the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and cost-effectiveness metrics. Our results indicate that although advanced models can perform better they come at a much higher cost. We also demonstrate how an ideal hallucination detection system needs to maintain performance across different model sizes. Our findings highlight the importance of choosing a detection system aligned with specific application needs and resource constraints. Future research will explore hybrid systems and automated identification of underperforming components to enhance AI reliability and efficiency in detecting and mitigating hallucinations.

### Toxicity Detection for Free
**Authors**: Zhanhao Hu, Julien Piet, Geng Zhao, Jiantao Jiao, David Wagner

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T01:49:58Z

**Summary**: Current LLMs are generally aligned to follow safety requirements and tend to refuse toxic prompts. However, LLMs can fail to refuse toxic prompts or be overcautious and refuse benign examples. In addition, state-of-the-art toxicity detectors have low TPRs at low FPR, incurring high costs in real-world applications where toxic examples are rare. In this paper, we introduce Moderation Using LLM Introspection (MULI), which detects toxic prompts using the information extracted directly from LLMs themselves. We found we can distinguish between benign and toxic prompts from the distribution of the first response token's logits. Using this idea, we build a robust detector of toxic prompts using a sparse logistic regression model on the first response token logits. Our scheme outperforms SOTA detectors under multiple metrics.

### Hierarchical Visual Feature Aggregation for OCR-Free Document   Understanding
**Authors**: Jaeyoo Park, Jin Young Choi, Jeonghyung Park, Bohyung Han

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T00:58:12Z

**Summary**: We present a novel OCR-free document understanding framework based on pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our approach employs multi-scale visual features to effectively handle various font sizes within document images. To address the increasing costs of considering the multi-scale visual inputs for MLLMs, we propose the Hierarchical Visual Feature Aggregation (HVFA) module, designed to reduce the number of input tokens to LLMs. Leveraging a feature pyramid with cross-attentive pooling, our approach effectively manages the trade-off between information loss and efficiency without being affected by varying document image sizes. Furthermore, we introduce a novel instruction tuning task, which facilitates the model's text-reading capability by learning to predict the relative positions of input text, eventually minimizing the risk of truncated text caused by the limited capacity of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating superior performance in various document understanding tasks.

### What talking you?: Translating Code-Mixed Messaging Texts to English
**Authors**: Lynnette Hui Xian Ng, Luo Qi Chan

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T00:46:24Z

**Summary**: Translation of code-mixed texts to formal English allow a wider audience to understand these code-mixed languages, and facilitate downstream analysis applications such as sentiment analysis. In this work, we look at translating Singlish, which is colloquial Singaporean English, to formal standard English. Singlish is formed through the code-mixing of multiple Asian languages and dialects. We analysed the presence of other Asian languages and variants which can facilitate translation. Our dataset is short message texts, written as informal communication between Singlish speakers. We use a multi-step prompting scheme on five Large Language Models (LLMs) for language detection and translation. Our analysis show that LLMs do not perform well in this task, and we describe the challenges involved in translation of code-mixed languages. We also release our dataset in this link https://github.com/luoqichan/singlish.

### Enhancing AAC Software for Dysarthric Speakers in e-Health Settings: An   Evaluation Using TORGO
**Authors**: Macarious Hui, Jinda Zhang, Aanchan Mohan

**Updated**: 2024-11-08T00:36:10Z

**Summary**: Individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) frequently face challenges with articulation, leading to dysarthria and resulting in atypical speech patterns. In healthcare settings, communication breakdowns reduce the quality of care. While building an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tool to enable fluid communication we found that state-of-the-art (SOTA) automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology like Whisper and Wav2vec2.0 marginalizes atypical speakers largely due to the lack of training data. Our work looks to leverage SOTA ASR followed by domain specific error-correction. English dysarthric ASR performance is often evaluated on the TORGO dataset. Prompt-overlap is a well-known issue with this dataset where phrases overlap between training and test speakers. Our work proposes an algorithm to break this prompt-overlap. After reducing prompt-overlap, results with SOTA ASR models produce extremely high word error rates for speakers with mild and severe dysarthria. Furthermore, to improve ASR, our work looks at the impact of n-gram language models and large-language model (LLM) based multi-modal generative error-correction algorithms like Whispering-LLaMA for a second pass ASR. Our work highlights how much more needs to be done to improve ASR for atypical speakers to enable equitable healthcare access both in-person and in e-health settings.

### ZipNN: Lossless Compression for AI Models
**Authors**: Moshik Hershcovitch, Andrew Wood, Leshem Choshen, Guy Girmonsky, Roy Leibovitz, Ilias Ennmouri, Michal Malka, Peter Chin, Swaminathan Sundararaman, Danny Harnik

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T23:28:23Z

**Summary**: With the growth of model sizes and the scale of their deployment, their sheer size burdens the infrastructure requiring more network and more storage to accommodate these. While there is a vast model compression literature deleting parts of the model weights for faster inference, we investigate a more traditional type of compression - one that represents the model in a compact form and is coupled with a decompression algorithm that returns it to its original form and size - namely lossless compression.   We present ZipNN a lossless compression tailored to neural networks. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that specific lossless compression can gain significant network and storage reduction on popular models, often saving 33% and at times reducing over 50% of the model size. We investigate the source of model compressibility and introduce specialized compression variants tailored for models that further increase the effectiveness of compression. On popular models (e.g. Llama 3) ZipNN shows space savings that are over 17% better than vanilla compression while also improving compression and decompression speeds by 62%. We estimate that these methods could save over an ExaByte per month of network traffic downloaded from a large model hub like Hugging Face.

### FinTeamExperts: Role Specialized MOEs For Financial Analysis
**Authors**: Yue Yu, Prayag Tiwari

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T23:11:04Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Phi3 and Llama-3, are leading a significant leap in AI, as they can generalize knowledge from their training to new tasks without fine-tuning. However, their application in the financial domain remains relatively limited. The financial field is inherently complex, requiring a deep understanding across various perspectives, from macro, micro economic trend to quantitative analysis. Motivated by this complexity, a mixture of expert LLMs tailored to specific financial domains could offer a more comprehensive understanding for intricate financial tasks. In this paper, we present the FinTeamExperts, a role-specialized LLM framework structured as a Mixture of Experts (MOEs) for financial analysis. The framework simulates a collaborative team setting by training each model to specialize in distinct roles: Macro Analysts, Micro analysts, and Quantitative Analysts. This role-specific specialization enhances the model's ability to integrate their domain-specific expertise. We achieve this by training three 8-billion parameter models on different corpus, each dedicated to excelling in specific finance-related roles. We then instruct-tune FinTeamExperts on downstream tasks to align with practical financial tasks. The experimental results show that FinTeamExperts outperform all models of the same size and larger on three out of four datasets. On the fourth dataset, which presents a more complex task, FinTeamExperts still surpass all models of the same size. This highlights the success of our role-based specialization approach and the continued training approach for FinTeamExperts.

### Abstract2Appendix: Academic Reviews Enhance LLM Long-Context   Capabilities
**Authors**: Shengzhi Li, Kittipat Kampa, Rongyu Lin, Bohang Li, Shichao Pei

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T22:57:02Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various tasks, yet their ability to handle long-context reading remains challenging. This study explores the effectiveness of leveraging high-quality academic peer review data for fine-tuning LLMs to enhance their long-context capabilities. We compare the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) method with the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) method, demonstrating DPO's superiority and data efficiency. Our experiments show that the fine-tuned model achieves a 4.04-point improvement over phi-3 and a 2.6\% increase on the Qasper benchmark using only 2000 samples. Despite facing limitations in data scale and processing costs, this study underscores the potential of DPO and high-quality data in advancing LLM performance.   Additionally, the zero-shot benchmark results indicate that aggregated high-quality human reviews are overwhelmingly preferred over LLM-generated responses, even for the most capable models like GPT-4o. This suggests that high-quality human reviews are extremely rich in information, reasoning, and long-context retrieval, capabilities that even the most advanced models have not fully captured. These findings highlight the high utility of leveraging human reviews to further advance the field.

### RT-Grasp: Reasoning Tuning Robotic Grasping via Multi-modal Large   Language Model
**Authors**: Jinxuan Xu, Shiyu Jin, Yutian Lei, Yuqian Zhang, Liangjun Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T22:17:53Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their remarkable reasoning capabilities, making them influential across various fields. However, in robotics, their use has primarily been limited to manipulation planning tasks due to their inherent textual output. This paper addresses this limitation by investigating the potential of adopting the reasoning ability of LLMs for generating numerical predictions in robotics tasks, specifically for robotic grasping. We propose Reasoning Tuning, a novel method that integrates a reasoning phase before prediction during training, leveraging the extensive prior knowledge and advanced reasoning abilities of LLMs. This approach enables LLMs, notably with multi-modal capabilities, to generate accurate numerical outputs like grasp poses that are context-aware and adaptable through conversations. Additionally, we present the Reasoning Tuning VLM Grasp dataset, carefully curated to facilitate the adaptation of LLMs to robotic grasping. Extensive validation on both grasping datasets and real-world experiments underscores the adaptability of multi-modal LLMs for numerical prediction tasks in robotics. This not only expands their applicability but also bridges the gap between text-based planning and direct robot control, thereby maximizing the potential of LLMs in robotics.

### Alopex: A Computational Framework for Enabling On-Device Function Calls   with LLMs
**Authors**: Yide Ran, Zhaozhuo Xu, Yuhang Yao, Zijian Hu, Shanshan Han, Han Jin, Alay Dilipbhai Shah, Jipeng Zhang, Dimitris Stripelis, Tong Zhang, Salman Avestimehr, Chaoyang He

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T22:15:17Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their increased integration into mobile devices for personalized assistance, which enables LLMs to call external API functions to enhance their performance. However, challenges such as data scarcity, ineffective question formatting, and catastrophic forgetting hinder the development of on-device LLM agents. To tackle these issues, we propose Alopex, a framework that enables precise on-device function calls using the Fox LLM. Alopex introduces a logic-based method for generating high-quality training data and a novel ``description-question-output'' format for fine-tuning, reducing risks of function information leakage. Additionally, a data mixing strategy is used to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, combining function call data with textbook datasets to enhance performance in various tasks. Experimental results show that Alopex improves function call accuracy and significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting, providing a robust solution for integrating function call capabilities into LLMs without manual intervention.

### Toward Cultural Interpretability: A Linguistic Anthropological Framework   for Describing and Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs)
**Authors**: Graham M. Jones, Shai Satran, Arvind Satyanarayan

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T22:01:50Z

**Summary**: This article proposes a new integration of linguistic anthropology and machine learning (ML) around convergent interests in both the underpinnings of language and making language technologies more socially responsible. While linguistic anthropology focuses on interpreting the cultural basis for human language use, the ML field of interpretability is concerned with uncovering the patterns that Large Language Models (LLMs) learn from human verbal behavior. Through the analysis of a conversation between a human user and an LLM-powered chatbot, we demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of a new, conjoint field of inquiry, cultural interpretability (CI). By focusing attention on the communicative competence involved in the way human users and AI chatbots co-produce meaning in the articulatory interface of human-computer interaction, CI emphasizes how the dynamic relationship between language and culture makes contextually sensitive, open-ended conversation possible. We suggest that, by examining how LLMs internally "represent" relationships between language and culture, CI can: (1) provide insight into long-standing linguistic anthropological questions about the patterning of those relationships; and (2) aid model developers and interface designers in improving value alignment between language models and stylistically diverse speakers and culturally diverse speech communities. Our discussion proposes three critical research axes: relativity, variation, and indexicality.

### CodeLutra: Boosting LLM Code Generation via Preference-Guided Refinement
**Authors**: Leitian Tao, Xiang Chen, Tong Yu, Tung Mai, Ryan Rossi, Yixuan Li, Saayan Mitra

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T21:51:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code generation but often require substantial resources and tend to over-generalize, limiting their efficiency for specific tasks. Fine-tuning smaller, open-source LLMs presents a viable alternative; however, it typically lags behind cutting-edge models due to supervised fine-tuning's reliance solely on correct code examples, which restricts the model's ability to learn from its own mistakes and adapt to diverse programming challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce CodeLutra, a novel framework that enhances low-performing LLMs by leveraging both successful and failed code generation attempts. Unlike conventional fine-tuning, CodeLutra employs an iterative preference learning mechanism to compare correct and incorrect solutions as well as maximize the likelihood of correct codes. Through continuous iterative refinement, CodeLutra enables smaller LLMs to match or surpass GPT-4's performance in various code generation tasks without relying on vast external datasets or larger auxiliary models. On a challenging data analysis task, using just 500 samples improved Llama-3-8B's accuracy from 28.2% to 48.6%, approaching GPT-4's performance. These results highlight CodeLutra's potential to close the gap between open-source and closed-source models, making it a promising approach in the field of code generation.

### Hardware and Software Platform Inference
**Authors**: Cheng Zhang, Hanna Foerster, Robert D. Mullins, Yiren Zhao, Ilia Shumailov

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T21:44:04Z

**Summary**: It is now a common business practice to buy access to large language model (LLM) inference rather than self-host, because of significant upfront hardware infrastructure and energy costs. However, as a buyer, there is no mechanism to verify the authenticity of the advertised service including the serving hardware platform, e.g. that it is actually being served using an NVIDIA H100. Furthermore, there are reports suggesting that model providers may deliver models that differ slightly from the advertised ones, often to make them run on less expensive hardware. That way, a client pays premium for a capable model access on more expensive hardware, yet ends up being served by a (potentially less capable) cheaper model on cheaper hardware. In this paper we introduce \textit{\textbf{hardware and software platform inference (HSPI)}} -- a method for identifying the underlying \GPU{} architecture and software stack of a (black-box) machine learning model solely based on its input-output behavior. Our method leverages the inherent differences of various \GPU{} architectures and compilers to distinguish between different \GPU{} types and software stacks. By analyzing the numerical patterns in the model's outputs, we propose a classification framework capable of accurately identifying the \GPU{} used for model inference as well as the underlying software configuration. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of inferring \GPU{} type from black-box models. We evaluate HSPI against models served on different real hardware and find that in a white-box setting we can distinguish between different \GPU{}s with between $83.9\%$ and $100\%$ accuracy. Even in a black-box setting we are able to achieve results that are up to three times higher than random guess accuracy.

### Interactive Dialogue Agents via Reinforcement Learning on Hindsight   Regenerations
**Authors**: Joey Hong, Jessica Lin, Anca Dragan, Sergey Levine

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T21:37:51Z

**Summary**: Recent progress on large language models (LLMs) has enabled dialogue agents to generate highly naturalistic and plausible text. However, current LLM language generation focuses on responding accurately to questions and requests with a single effective response. In reality, many real dialogues are interactive, meaning an agent's utterances will influence their conversational partner, elicit information, or change their opinion. Accounting for how an agent can effectively steer a conversation is a crucial ability in many dialogue tasks, from healthcare to preference elicitation. Existing methods for fine-tuning dialogue agents to accomplish such tasks would rely on curating some amount of expert data. However, doing so often requires understanding the underlying cognitive processes of the conversational partner, which is a skill neither humans nor LLMs trained on human data can reliably do. Our key insight is that while LLMs may not be adept at identifying effective strategies for steering conversations a priori, or in the middle of an ongoing conversation, they can do so post-hoc, or in hindsight, after seeing how their conversational partner responds. We use this fact to rewrite and augment existing suboptimal data, and train via offline reinforcement learning (RL) an agent that outperforms both prompting and learning from unaltered human demonstrations. We apply our approach to two domains that require understanding human mental state, intelligent interaction, and persuasion: mental health support, and soliciting charitable donations. Our results in a user study with real humans show that our approach greatly outperforms existing state-of-the-art dialogue agents.

### Q-SFT: Q-Learning for Language Models via Supervised Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Joey Hong, Anca Dragan, Sergey Levine

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T21:36:52Z

**Summary**: Value-based reinforcement learning (RL) can in principle learn effective policies for a wide range of multi-turn problems, from games to dialogue to robotic control, including via offline RL from static previously collected datasets. However, despite the widespread use of policy gradient methods to train large language models for single turn tasks (e.g., question answering), value-based methods for multi-turn RL in an off-policy or offline setting have proven particularly challenging to scale to the setting of large language models. This setting requires effectively leveraging pretraining, scaling to large architectures with billions of parameters, and training on large datasets, all of which represent major challenges for current value-based RL methods. In this work, we propose a novel offline RL algorithm that addresses these drawbacks, casting Q-learning as a modified supervised fine-tuning (SFT) problem where the probabilities of tokens directly translate to Q-values. In this way we obtain an algorithm that smoothly transitions from maximizing the likelihood of the data during pretraining to learning a near-optimal Q-function during finetuning. Our algorithm has strong theoretical foundations, enjoying performance bounds similar to state-of-the-art Q-learning methods, while in practice utilizing an objective that closely resembles SFT. Because of this, our approach can enjoy the full benefits of the pretraining of language models, without the need to reinitialize any weights before RL finetuning, and without the need to initialize new heads for predicting values or advantages. Empirically, we evaluate our method on both pretrained LLMs and VLMs, on a variety of tasks including both natural language dialogue and robotic manipulation and navigation from images.

**Summary**: Human writers plan, then write. For large language models (LLMs) to play a role in longer-form article generation, we must understand the planning steps humans make before writing. We explore one kind of planning, source-selection in news, as a case-study for evaluating plans in long-form generation. We ask: why do specific stories call for specific kinds of sources? We imagine a generative process for story writing where a source-selection schema is first selected by a journalist, and then sources are chosen based on categories in that schema. Learning the article's plan means predicting the schema initially chosen by the journalist. Working with professional journalists, we adapt five existing schemata and introduce three new ones to describe journalistic plans for the inclusion of sources in documents. Then, inspired by Bayesian latent-variable modeling, we develop metrics to select the most likely plan, or schema, underlying a story, which we use to compare schemata. We find that two schemata: stance and social affiliation best explain source plans in most documents. However, other schemata like textual entailment explain source plans in factually rich topics like "Science". Finally, we find we can predict the most suitable schema given just the article's headline with reasonable accuracy. We see this as an important case-study for human planning, and provides a framework and approach for evaluating other kinds of plans. We release a corpora, NewsSources, with annotations for 4M articles.

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding the semantic relationships between queries and documents, even with lengthy and complex long-tail queries. These queries are challenging for feedback-based rankings due to sparse user engagement and limited feedback, making LLMs' ranking ability highly valuable. However, the large size and slow inference of LLMs necessitate the development of smaller, more efficient models (sLLMs). Recently, integrating ranking label generation into distillation techniques has become crucial, but existing methods underutilize LLMs' capabilities and are cumbersome. Our research, RRADistill: Re-Ranking Ability Distillation, propose an efficient label generation pipeline and novel sLLM training methods for both encoder and decoder models. We introduce an encoder-based method using a Term Control Layer to capture term matching signals and a decoder-based model with a ranking layer for enhanced understanding. A/B testing on a Korean-based search platform, validates the effectiveness of our approach in improving re-ranking for long-tail queries.

### Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs): Improved Prompt Injection   Attacks Detection
**Authors**: Md Abdur Rahman, Fan Wu, Alfredo Cuzzocrea, Sheikh Iqbal Ahamed

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T21:20:31Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming a popular tool as they have significantly advanced in their capability to tackle a wide range of language-based tasks. However, LLMs applications are highly vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, which poses a critical problem. These attacks target LLMs applications through using carefully designed input prompts to divert the model from adhering to original instruction, thereby it could execute unintended actions. These manipulations pose serious security threats which potentially results in data leaks, biased outputs, or harmful responses. This project explores the security vulnerabilities in relation to prompt injection attacks. To detect whether a prompt is vulnerable or not, we follows two approaches: 1) a pre-trained LLM, and 2) a fine-tuned LLM. Then, we conduct a thorough analysis and comparison of the classification performance. Firstly, we use pre-trained XLM-RoBERTa model to detect prompt injections using test dataset without any fine-tuning and evaluate it by zero-shot classification. Then, this proposed work will apply supervised fine-tuning to this pre-trained LLM using a task-specific labeled dataset from deepset in huggingface, and this fine-tuned model achieves impressive results with 99.13\% accuracy, 100\% precision, 98.33\% recall and 99.15\% F1-score thorough rigorous experimentation and evaluation. We observe that our approach is highly efficient in detecting prompt injection attacks.

### PentestAgent: Incorporating LLM Agents to Automated Penetration Testing
**Authors**: Xiangmin Shen, Lingzhi Wang, Zhenyuan Li, Yan Chen, Wencheng Zhao, Dawei Sun, Jiashui Wang, Wei Ruan

**Updated**: 2024-11-07T21:10:39Z

**Summary**: Penetration testing is a critical technique for identifying security vulnerabilities, traditionally performed manually by skilled security specialists. This complex process involves gathering information about the target system, identifying entry points, exploiting the system, and reporting findings. Despite its effectiveness, manual penetration testing is time-consuming and expensive, often requiring significant expertise and resources that many organizations cannot afford. While automated penetration testing methods have been proposed, they often fall short in real-world applications due to limitations in flexibility, adaptability, and implementation.   Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for enhancing penetration testing through increased intelligence and automation. However, current LLM-based approaches still face significant challenges, including limited penetration testing knowledge and a lack of comprehensive automation capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose PentestAgent, a novel LLM-based automated penetration testing framework that leverages the power of LLMs and various LLM-based techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance penetration testing knowledge and automate various tasks. Our framework leverages multi-agent collaboration to automate intelligence gathering, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation stages, reducing manual intervention. We evaluate PentestAgent using a comprehensive benchmark, demonstrating superior performance in task completion and overall efficiency. This work significantly advances the practical applicability of automated penetration testing systems.
