 ### Adaptive Layer Selection for Layer-Wise Token Pruning in LLM Inference
**Authors**: Rei Taniguchi, Yuyang Dong, Makoto Onizuka, Chuan Xiao

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:47:35Z

**Summary**: Due to the prevalence of large language models (LLMs), key-value (KV) cache reduction for LLM inference has received remarkable attention. Among numerous works that have been proposed in recent years, layer-wise token pruning approaches, which select a subset of tokens at particular layers to retain in KV cache and prune others, are one of the most popular schemes. They primarily adopt a set of pre-defined layers, at which tokens are selected. Such design is inflexible in the sense that the accuracy significantly varies across tasks and deteriorates in harder tasks such as KV retrieval. In this paper, we propose ASL, a training-free method that adaptively chooses the selection layer for KV cache reduction, exploiting the variance of token ranks ordered by attention score. The proposed method balances the performance across different tasks while meeting the user-specified KV budget requirement. ASL operates during the prefilling stage and can be jointly used with existing KV cache reduction methods such as SnapKV to optimize the decoding stage. By evaluations on the InfiniteBench, RULER, and NIAH benchmarks, we show that equipped with one-shot token selection, where tokens are selected at a layer and propagated to deeper layers, ASL outperforms state-of-the-art layer-wise token selection methods in accuracy while maintaining decoding speed and KV cache reduction.

### d3LLM: Ultra-Fast Diffusion LLM using Pseudo-Trajectory Distillation
**Authors**: Yu-Yang Qian, Junda Su, Lanxiang Hu, Peiyuan Zhang, Zhijie Deng, Peng Zhao, Hao Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:25:36Z

**Summary**: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer capabilities beyond those of autoregressive (AR) LLMs, such as parallel decoding and random-order generation. However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/d3LLM.

### From Sketch to Fresco: Efficient Diffusion Transformer with Progressive Resolution
**Authors**: Shikang Zheng, Guantao Chen, Lixuan He, Jiacheng Liu, Yuqi Lin, Chang Zou, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:15:30Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers achieve impressive generative quality but remain computationally expensive due to iterative sampling. Recently, dynamic resolution sampling has emerged as a promising acceleration technique by reducing the resolution of early sampling steps. However, existing methods rely on heuristic re-noising at every resolution transition, injecting noise that breaks cross-stage consistency and forces the model to relearn global structure. In addition, these methods indiscriminately upsample the entire latent space at once without checking which regions have actually converged, causing accumulated errors, and visible artifacts. Therefore, we propose \textbf{Fresco}, a dynamic resolution framework that unifies re-noise and global structure across stages with progressive upsampling, preserving both the efficiency of low-resolution drafting and the fidelity of high-resolution refinement, with all stages aligned toward the same final target. Fresco achieves near-lossless acceleration across diverse domains and models, including 10$\times$ speedup on FLUX, and 5$\times$ on HunyuanVideo, while remaining orthogonal to distillation, quantization and feature caching, reaching 22$\times$ speedup when combined with distilled models. Our code is in supplementary material and will be released on Github.

**Authors**: Mohammad Pivezhandi, Mahdi Banisharif, Saeed Bakhshan, Abusayeed Saifullah, Ali Jannesari

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T10:30:16Z

**Summary**: Performance prediction for OpenMP workloads on heterogeneous embedded SoCs is challenging due to complex interactions between task DAG structure, control-flow irregularity, cache and branch behavior, and thermal dynamics; classical heuristics struggle under workload irregularity, tabular regressors discard structural information, and model-free RL risks overheating resource-constrained devices. We introduce GraphPerf-RT, the first surrogate that unifies task DAG topology, CFG-derived code semantics, and runtime context (per-core DVFS, thermal state, utilization) in a heterogeneous graph representation with typed edges encoding precedence, placement, and contention. Multi-task evidential heads predict makespan, energy, cache and branch misses, and utilization with calibrated uncertainty (Normal-Inverse-Gamma), enabling risk-aware scheduling that filters low-confidence rollouts. We validate GraphPerf-RT on three embedded ARM platforms (Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RUBIK Pi), achieving R^2 > 0.95 with well-calibrated uncertainty (ECE < 0.05). To demonstrate end-to-end scheduling utility, we integrate the surrogate with four RL methods on Jetson TX2: single-agent model-free (SAMFRL), single-agent model-based (SAMBRL), multi-agent model-free (MAMFRL-D3QN), and multi-agent model-based (MAMBRL-D3QN). Experiments across 5 seeds (200 episodes each) show that MAMBRL-D3QN with GraphPerf-RT as the world model achieves 66% makespan reduction (0.97 +/- 0.35s) and 82% energy reduction (0.006 +/- 0.005J) compared to model-free baselines, demonstrating that accurate, uncertainty-aware surrogates enable effective model-based planning on thermally constrained embedded systems.

### Forecast the Principal, Stabilize the Residual: Subspace-Aware Feature Caching for Efficient Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Guantao Chen, Shikang Zheng, Yuqi Lin, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T10:30:12Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models have achieved unprecedented quality in image and video generation, yet their iterative sampling process remains computationally prohibitive. To accelerate inference, feature caching methods have emerged by reusing intermediate representations across timesteps. However, existing caching approaches treat all feature components uniformly. We reveal that DiT feature spaces contain distinct principal and residual subspaces with divergent temporal behavior: the principal subspace evolves smoothly and predictably, while the residual subspace exhibits volatile, low-energy oscillations that resist accurate prediction. Building on this insight, we propose SVD-Cache, a subspace-aware caching framework that decomposes diffusion features via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), applies exponential moving average (EMA) prediction to the dominant low-rank components, and directly reuses the residual subspace. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SVD-Cache achieves near-lossless across diverse models and methods, including 5.55$\times$ speedup on FLUX and HunyuanVideo, and compatibility with model acceleration techniques including distillation, quantization and sparse attention. Our code is in supplementary material and will be released on Github.

### Focal Guidance: Unlocking Controllability from Semantic-Weak Layers in Video Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Yuanyang Yin, Yufan Deng, Shenghai Yuan, Kaipeng Zhang, Xiao Yang, Feng Zhao

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T07:48:26Z

**Summary**: The task of Image-to-Video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize a video from a reference image and a text prompt. This requires diffusion models to reconcile high-frequency visual constraints and low-frequency textual guidance during the denoising process. However, while existing I2V models prioritize visual consistency, how to effectively couple this dual guidance to ensure strong adherence to the text prompt remains underexplored. In this work, we observe that in Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based I2V models, certain intermediate layers exhibit weak semantic responses (termed Semantic-Weak Layers), as indicated by a measurable drop in text-visual similarity. We attribute this to a phenomenon called Condition Isolation, where attention to visual features becomes partially detached from text guidance and overly relies on learned visual priors. To address this, we propose Focal Guidance (FG), which enhances the controllability from Semantic-Weak Layers. FG comprises two mechanisms: (1) Fine-grained Semantic Guidance (FSG) leverages CLIP to identify key regions in the reference frame and uses them as anchors to guide Semantic-Weak Layers. (2) Attention Cache transfers attention maps from semantically responsive layers to Semantic-Weak Layers, injecting explicit semantic signals and alleviating their over-reliance on the model's learned visual priors, thereby enhancing adherence to textual instructions. To further validate our approach and address the lack of evaluation in this direction, we introduce a benchmark for assessing instruction following in I2V models. On this benchmark, Focal Guidance proves its effectiveness and generalizability, raising the total score on Wan2.1-I2V to 0.7250 (+3.97\%) and boosting the MMDiT-based HunyuanVideo-I2V to 0.5571 (+7.44\%).

### SliceMoE: Bit-Sliced Expert Caching under Miss-Rate Constraints for Efficient MoE Inference
**Authors**: Yuseon Choi, Sangjin Kim, Jungjun Oh, Gwangtae Park, Byeongcheol Kim, Hoi-Jun Yoo

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T02:21:54Z

**Summary**: MoE models offer efficient scaling through conditional computation, but their large parameter size and expensive expert offloading make on-device deployment challenging. Existing acceleration techniques such as prefetching or expert clustering often increase energy usage or reduce expert diversity. We present SliceMoE, an energy-efficient MoE inference framework for miss-rate-constrained deployment. SliceMoE introduces Dynamic Bit-Sliced Caching (DBSC), which caches experts at slice-level granularity and assigns precision on demand to expand effective expert capacity. To support mixed-precision experts without memory duplication, we propose Calibration-Free Asymmetric Matryoshka Quantization (AMAT), a truncation-based scheme that maintains compatibility between low-bit and high-bit slices. We further introduce Predictive Cache Warmup (PCW) to reduce early-decode cold misses by reshaping cache contents during prefill. Evaluated on DeepSeek-V2-Lite and Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, SliceMoE reduces decode-stage energy consumption by up to 2.37x and 2.85x, respectively, and improves decode latency by up to 1.81x and 1.64x, while preserving near-high-bit accuracy. These results demonstrate that slice-level caching enables an efficient on-device MoE deployment.

### Tensor Product Attention Is All You Need
**Authors**: Yifan Zhang, Yifeng Liu, Huizhuo Yuan, Zhen Qin, Yang Yuan, Quanquan Gu, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao

**Updated**: 2026-01-11T23:01:33Z

**Summary**: Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, substantially shrinking the KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components and seamlessly integrating with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation on language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 surpasses or matches the performance of standard Transformer baselines including Multi-Head Attention (MHA), Multi-Query Attention (MQA), Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of established evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency and computational efficiency at decoding stage enables processing longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

### Deep Learning Model Deployment in Multiple Cloud Providers: an Exploratory Study Using Low Computing Power Environments
**Authors**: Elayne Lemos, Rodrigo Oliveira, Jairson Rodrigues, Rosalvo F. Oliveira Neto

**Updated**: 2026-01-11T21:19:16Z

**Summary**: The deployment of Machine Learning models in the cloud has grown among tech companies. Hardware requirements are higher when these models involve Deep Learning techniques, and the cloud providers' costs may be a barrier. We explore deploying Deep Learning models, using for experiments the GECToR model, a Deep Learning solution for Grammatical Error Correction, across three of the major cloud providers (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure). We evaluate real-time latency, hardware usage, and cost at each cloud provider in 7 execution environments with 10 experiments reproduced. We found that while Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) excel in performance, they had an average cost 300% higher than solutions without a GPU. Our analysis also suggests that processor cache memory size is a key variable for CPU-only deployments, and setups with sufficient cache achieved a 50% cost reduction compared to GPU-based deployments. This study indicates the feasibility and affordability of cloud-based Deep Learning inference solutions without a GPU, benefiting resource-constrained users such as startups and small research groups.

### MicLog: Towards Accurate and Efficient LLM-based Log Parsing via Progressive Meta In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Jianbo Yu, Yixuan Li, Hai Xu, Kang Xu, Junjielong Xu, Zhijing Li, Pinjia He, Wanyuan Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-11T17:46:10Z

**Summary**: Log parsing converts semi-structured logs into structured templates, forming a critical foundation for downstream analysis. Traditional syntax and semantic-based parsers often struggle with semantic variations in evolving logs and data scarcity stemming from their limited domain coverage. Recent large language model (LLM)-based parsers leverage in-context learning (ICL) to extract semantics from examples, demonstrating superior accuracy. However, LLM-based parsers face two main challenges: 1) underutilization of ICL capabilities, particularly in dynamic example selection and cross-domain generalization, leading to inconsistent performance; 2) time-consuming and costly LLM querying. To address these challenges, we present MicLog, the first progressive meta in-context learning (ProgMeta-ICL) log parsing framework that combines meta-learning with ICL on small open-source LLMs (i.e., Qwen-2.5-3B). Specifically, MicLog: i) enhances LLMs' ICL capability through a zero-shot to k-shot ProgMeta-ICL paradigm, employing weighted DBSCAN candidate sampling and enhanced BM25 demonstration selection; ii) accelerates parsing via a multi-level pre-query cache that dynamically matches and refines recently parsed templates. Evaluated on Loghub-2.0, MicLog achieves 10.3% higher parsing accuracy than the state-of-the-art parser while reducing parsing time by 42.4%.

### Graph-KV: Breaking Sequence via Injecting Structural Biases into Large Language Models
**Authors**: Haoyu Wang, Peihao Wang, Mufei Li, Shikun Liu, Siqi Miao, Zhangyang Wang, Pan Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-11T16:36:02Z

**Summary**: Modern large language models (LLMs) are inherently auto-regressive, requiring input to be serialized into flat sequences regardless of their structural dependencies. This serialization hinders the model's ability to leverage structural inductive biases, especially in tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and reasoning on data with native graph structures, where inter-segment dependencies are crucial. We introduce Graph-KV with the potential to overcome this limitation. Graph-KV leverages the KV-cache of text segments as condensed representations and governs their interaction through structural inductive biases. In this framework, 'target' segments selectively attend only to the KV-caches of their designated 'source' segments, rather than all preceding segments in a serialized sequence. This approach induces a graph-structured block mask, sparsifying attention and enabling a message-passing-like step within the LLM. Furthermore, strategically allocated positional encodings for source and target segments reduce positional bias and context window consumption. We evaluate Graph-KV across three scenarios: (1) seven RAG benchmarks spanning direct inference, multi-hop reasoning, and long-document understanding; (2) Arxiv-QA, a novel academic paper QA task with full-text scientific papers structured as citation ego-graphs; and (3) paper topic classification within a citation network. By effectively reducing positional bias and harnessing structural inductive biases, Graph-KV substantially outperforms baselines, including standard costly sequential encoding, across various settings. Code and the Graph-KV data are publicly available.

### Cohet: A CXL-Driven Coherent Heterogeneous Computing Framework with Hardware-Calibrated Full-System Simulation
**Authors**: Yanjing Wang, Lizhou Wu, Sunfeng Gao, Yibo Tang, Junhui Luo, Zicong Wang, Yang Ou, Dezun Dong, Nong Xiao, Mingche Lai

**Updated**: 2026-01-11T15:39:17Z

**Summary**: Conventional heterogeneous computing systems built on PCIe interconnects suffer from inefficient fine-grained host-device interactions and complex programming models. In recent years, many proprietary and open cache-coherent interconnect standards have emerged, among which compute express link (CXL) prevails in the open-standard domain after acquiring several competing solutions. Although CXL-based coherent heterogeneous computing holds the potential to fundamentally transform the collaborative computing mode of CPUs and XPUs, research in this direction remains hampered by the scarcity of available CXL-supported platforms, immature software/hardware ecosystems, and unclear application prospects. This paper presents Cohet, the first CXL-driven coherent heterogeneous computing framework. Cohet decouples the compute and memory resources to form unbiased CPU and XPU pools which share a single unified and coherent memory pool. It exposes a standard malloc/mmap interface to both CPU and XPU compute threads, leaving the OS dealing with smart memory allocation and management of heterogeneous resources. To facilitate Cohet research, we also present a full-system cycle-level simulator named SimCXL, which is capable of modeling all CXL sub-protocols and device types. SimCXL has been rigorously calibrated against a real CXL testbed with various CXL memory and accelerators, showing an average simulation error of 3%. Our evaluation reveals that CXL.cache reduces latency by 68% and increases bandwidth by 14.4x compared to DMA transfers at cacheline granularity. Building upon these insights, we demonstrate the benefits of Cohet with two killer apps, which are remote atomic operation (RAO) and remote procedure call (RPC). Compared to PCIe-NIC design, CXL-NIC achieves a 5.5 to 40.2x speedup for RAO offloading and an average speedup of 1.86x for RPC (de)serialization offloading.

### Caching Yields up to 5x Spectral Efficiency in Multi-Beam Satellite Communications
**Authors**: Hui Zhao, Dirk Slock, Petros Elia

**Updated**: 2026-01-11T14:14:12Z

**Summary**: This paper examines the integration of vector coded caching (VCC) into multi-beam satellite communications (SATCOM) systems and demonstrates that even limited receiver-side caching can substantially enhance spectral efficiency. By leveraging cached content to suppress interference, VCC enables the concurrent transmission of multiple precoded signal vectors that would otherwise require separate transmission resources. This leads to a multiplicative improvement in resource utilization in SATCOM. To characterize this performance, we model the satellite-to-ground channel using Rician-shadowed fading and after incorporating practical considerations such as matched-filter precoding, channel state information (CSI) acquisition overhead as well as CSI imperfections at the transmitter, we here derive closed-form expressions for the average sum rate and spectral efficiency gain of VCC in SATCOM. Our analysis, tightly validated through numerical simulations, reveals that VCC can yield spectral efficiency gains of 300% to 550% over traditional multi-user MISO SATCOM with the same resources. These gains -- which have nothing to do with multicasting, prefetching gains nor file popularity -- highlight VCC as a pure physical-layer solution for future high-throughput SATCOM systems, significantly narrowing the performance gap between satellite and wired networks.

### Learning-Augmented Performance Model for Tensor Product Factorization in High-Order FEM
**Authors**: Xuanzhengbo Ren, Yuta Kawai, Tetsuya Hoshino, Hirofumi Tomita, Takahiro Katagiri, Daichi Mukunoki, Seiya Nishizawa

**Updated**: 2026-01-11T12:20:48Z

**Summary**: Accurate performance prediction is essential for optimizing scientific applications on modern high-performance computing (HPC) architectures. Widely used performance models primarily focus on cache and memory bandwidth, which is suitable for many memory-bound workloads. However, it is unsuitable for highly arithmetic intensive cases such as the sum-factorization with tensor $n$-mode product kernels, which are an optimization technique for high-order finite element methods (FEM). On processors with relatively high single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instruction latency, such as the Fujitsu A64FX, the performance of these kernels is strongly influenced by loop-body splitting strategies. Memory-bandwidth-oriented models are therefore not appropriate for evaluating these splitting configurations, and a model that directly reflects instruction-level efficiency is required. To address this need, we develop a dependency-chain-based analytical formulation that links loop-splitting configurations to instruction dependencies in the tensor $n$-mode product kernel. We further use XGBoost to estimate key parameters in the analytical model that are difficult to model explicitly. Evaluations show that the learning-augmented model outperforms the widely used standard Roofline and Execution-Cache-Memory (ECM) models. On the Fujitsu A64FX processor, the learning-augmented model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) between 1% and 24% for polynomial orders ($P$) from 1 to 15. In comparison, the standard Roofline and ECM models yield errors of 42%-256% and 5%-117%, respectively. On the Intel Xeon Gold 6230 processor, the learning-augmented model achieves MAPE values from 1% to 13% for $P$=1 to $P$=14, and 24% at $P$=15. In contrast, the standard Roofline and ECM models produce errors of 1%-73% and 8%-112% for $P$=1 to $P$=15, respectively.

### Less is More: Improving LLM Reasoning with Minimal Test-Time Intervention
**Authors**: Zhen Yang, Mingyang Zhang, Feng Chen, Ganggui Ding, Liang Hou, Xin Tao, Ying-Cong Chen

**Updated**: 2026-01-11T08:32:23Z

**Summary**: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness. Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general, coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +9.28% average improvement on six benchmarks for DeepSeek-R1-7B and +11.25% on AIME2024 using Ling-mini-2.0-while remaining highly efficient.

### Burn-After-Use for Preventing Data Leakage through a Secure Multi-Tenant Architecture in Enterprise LLM
**Authors**: Qiang Zhang, Elena Emma Wang, Jiaming Li, Xichun Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-10T17:24:39Z

**Summary**: This study presents a Secure Multi-Tenant Architecture (SMTA) combined with a novel concept Burn-After-Use (BAU) mechanism for enterprise LLM environments to effectively prevent data leakage. As institutions increasingly adopt LLMs across departments, the risks of data leakage have become a critical security and compliance concern. The proposed SMTA isolates LLM instances across departments and enforces rigorous context ownership boundaries within an internally deployed infrastructure. The BAU mechanism introduces data confidentiality by enforcing ephemeral conversational contexts that are automatically destroyed after use, preventing cross-session or cross-user inference. The evaluation to SMTA and BAU is through two sets of realistic and reproducible experiments comprising of 127 test iterations. One aspect of this experiment is to assess prompt-based and semantic leakage attacks in a multi-tenant architecture (Appendix A) across 55 infrastructure-level attack tests, including vector-database credential compromise and shared logging pipeline exposure. SMTA achieves 92% defense success rate, demonstrating strong semantic isolation while highlighting residual risks from credential misconfiguration and observability pipelines. Another aspect is to evaluate the robustness of BAU under realistic failure scenarios (Appendix B) using four empirical metrics: Local Residual Persistence Rate (LRPR), Remote Residual Persistence Rate (RRPR), Image Frame Exposure Rate (IFER), and Burn Timer Persistence Rate (BTPR). Across 72 test iterations, BAU achieves a 76.75% success rate in mitigating post-session leakage threats across the client, server, application, infrastructure, and cache layers. These results show that SMTA and BAU together enforce strict isolation, complete session ephemerality, strong confidentiality guarantees, non-persistence, and policy-aligned behavior for enterprise LLMs.

### Mosaic: Unlocking Long-Context Inference for Diffusion LLMs via Global Memory Planning and Dynamic Peak Taming
**Authors**: Liang Zheng, Bowen Shi, Yitao Hu, Jiawei Zhang, Ruofan Li, Sheng Chen, Wenxin Li, Keqiu Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-10T13:17:08Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm, utilizing simultaneous denoising to enable global planning and iterative refinement. While these capabilities are particularly advantageous for long-context generation, deploying such models faces a prohibitive memory capacity barrier stemming from severe system inefficiencies. We identify that existing inference systems are ill-suited for this paradigm: unlike autoregressive models constrained by the cumulative KV-cache, dLLMs are bottlenecked by transient activations recomputed at every step. Furthermore, general-purpose memory reuse mechanisms lack the global visibility to adapt to dLLMs' dynamic memory peaks, which toggle between logits and FFNs. To address these mismatches, we propose Mosaic, a memory-efficient inference system that shifts from local, static management to a global, dynamic paradigm. Mosaic integrates a mask-only logits kernel to eliminate redundancy, a lazy chunking optimizer driven by an online heuristic search to adaptively mitigate dynamic peaks, and a global memory manager to resolve fragmentation via virtual addressing. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Mosaic achieves an average 2.71$\times$ reduction in the memory peak-to-average ratio and increases the maximum inference sequence length supportable on identical hardware by 15.89-32.98$\times$. This scalability is achieved without compromising accuracy and speed, and in fact reducing latency by 4.12%-23.26%.

### Rethinking Inter-Process Communication with Memory Operation Offloading
**Authors**: Misun Park, Richi Dubey, Yifan Yuan, Nam Sung Kim, Ada Gavrilovska

**Updated**: 2026-01-09T22:08:15Z

**Summary**: As multimodal and AI-driven services exchange hundreds of megabytes per request, existing IPC runtimes spend a growing share of CPU cycles on memory copies. Although both hardware and software mechanisms are exploring memory offloading, current IPC stacks lack a unified runtime model to coordinate them effectively.   This paper presents a unified IPC runtime suite that integrates both hardware- and software-based memory offloading into shared-memory communication. The system characterizes the interaction between offload strategies and IPC execution, including synchronization, cache visibility, and concurrency, and introduces multiple IPC modes that balance throughput, latency, and CPU efficiency.   Through asynchronous pipelining, selective cache injection, and hybrid coordination, the system turns offloading from a device-specific feature into a general system capability. Evaluations on real-world workloads show instruction count reductions of up to 22%, throughput improvements of up to 2.1x, and latency reductions of up to 72%, demonstrating that coordinated IPC offloading can deliver tangible end-to-end efficiency gains in modern data-intensive systems.

**Summary**: Optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference in production systems is increasingly difficult due to dynamic workloads, stringent latency/throughput targets, and a rapidly expanding configuration space. This complexity spans not only distributed parallelism strategies (tensor/pipeline/expert) but also intricate framework-specific runtime parameters such as those concerning the enablement of CUDA graphs, available KV-cache memory fractions, and maximum token capacity, which drastically impact performance. The diversity of modern inference frameworks (e.g., TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang), each employing distinct kernels and execution policies, makes manual tuning both framework-specific and computationally prohibitive. We present AIConfigurator, a unified performance-modeling system that enables rapid, framework-agnostic inference configuration search without requiring GPU-based profiling. AIConfigurator combines (1) a methodology that decomposes inference into analytically modelable primitives - GEMM, attention, communication, and memory operations while capturing framework-specific scheduling dynamics; (2) a calibrated kernel-level performance database for these primitives across a wide range of hardware platforms and popular open-weights models (GPT-OSS, Qwen, DeepSeek, LLama, Mistral); and (3) an abstraction layer that automatically resolves optimal launch parameters for the target backend, seamlessly integrating into production-grade orchestration systems. Evaluation on production LLM serving workloads demonstrates that AIConfigurator identifies superior serving configurations that improve performance by up to 40% for dense models (e.g., Qwen3-32B) and 50% for MoE architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-V3), while completing searches within 30 seconds on average. Enabling the rapid exploration of vast design spaces - from cluster topology down to engine specific flags.

### Don't Break the Cache: An Evaluation of Prompt Caching for Long-Horizon Agentic Tasks
**Authors**: Elias Lumer, Faheem Nizar, Akshaya Jangiti, Kevin Frank, Anmol Gulati, Mandar Phadate, Vamse Kumar Subbiah

**Updated**: 2026-01-09T18:41:57Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have enabled complex multi-turn agentic tasks requiring extensive tool calling, where conversations can span dozens of API calls with increasingly large context windows. However, although major LLM providers offer prompt caching to reduce cost and latency, its benefits for agentic workloads remain underexplored in the research literature. To our knowledge, no prior work quantifies these cost savings or compares caching strategies for multi-turn agentic tasks. We present a comprehensive evaluation of prompt caching across three major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) and compare three caching strategies, including full context caching, system prompt only caching, and caching that excludes dynamic tool results. We evaluate on DeepResearchBench, a multi-turn agentic benchmark where agents autonomously execute real-world web search tool calls to answer complex research questions, measuring both API cost and time to first token (TTFT) across over 500 agent sessions with 10,000-token system prompts. Our results demonstrate that prompt caching reduces API costs by 45-80% and improves time to first token by 13-31% across providers. We find that strategic prompt cache block control, such as placing dynamic content at the end of the system prompt, avoiding dynamic traditional function calling, and excluding dynamic tool results, provides more consistent benefits than naive full-context caching, which can paradoxically increase latency. Our analysis reveals nuanced variations in caching behavior across providers, and we provide practical guidance for implementing prompt caching in production agentic systems.

### From Off-Policy to On-Policy: Enhancing GUI Agents via Bi-level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation
**Authors**: Zezhou Wang, Ziyun Zhang, Xiaoyi Zhang, Zhuzhong Qian, Yan Lu

**Updated**: 2026-01-09T13:26:38Z

**Summary**: Vision-language models are increasingly deployed as computer-use agents (CUAs) that operate desktops and browsers. Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

### Employ SmartNICs' Data Path Accelerators for Ordered Key-Value Stores
**Authors**: Frederic Schimmelpfennig, Jan Sass, Reza Salkhordeh, Martin Kröning, Stefan Lankes, André Brinkmann

**Updated**: 2026-01-09T11:47:52Z

**Summary**: Remote in-memory key-value (KV) stores serve as a cornerstone for diverse modern workloads, and high-speed range scans are frequently a requirement. However, current architectures rarely achieve a simultaneous balance of peak efficiency, architectural simplicity, and native support for ordered operations. Conventional host-centric frameworks are restricted by kernel-space network stacks and internal bus latencies. While hash-based alternatives that utilize OS-bypass or run natively on SmartNICs offer high throughput, they lack the data structures necessary for range queries. Distributed RDMA-based systems provide performance and range functionality but often depend on stateful clients, which introduces complexity in scaling and error handling. Alternatively, SmartNIC implementations that traverse trees located in host memory are hampered by high DMA round-trip latencies.   This paper introduces a KV store that leverages the on-path Data Path Accelerators (DPAs) of the BlueField-3 SmartNIC to eliminate operating system overhead while facilitating stateless clients and range operations. These DPAs ingest network requests directly from NIC buffers to navigate a lock-free learned index residing in the accelerator's local memory. By deferring value retrieval from the host-side tree replica until the leaf level is reached, the design minimizes PCIe crossings. Write operations are staged in DPA memory and migrated in batches to the host, where structural maintenance is performed before being transactionally stitched back to the SmartNIC. Coupled with a NIC-resident read cache, the system achieves 33 million operations per second (MOPS) for point lookups and 13 MOPS for range queries. Our analysis demonstrates that this architecture matches or exceeds the performance of contemporary state-of-the-art solutions, while we identify hardware refinements that could further accelerate performance.

### FlashMem: Distilling Intrinsic Latent Memory via Computation Reuse
**Authors**: Yubo Hou, Zhisheng Chen, Tao Wan, Zengchang Qin

**Updated**: 2026-01-09T03:27:43Z

**Summary**: The stateless architecture of Large Language Models inherently lacks the mechanism to preserve dynamic context, compelling agents to redundantly reprocess history to maintain long-horizon autonomy. While latent memory offers a solution, current approaches are hindered by architectural segregation, relying on auxiliary encoders that decouple memory from the reasoning backbone. We propose FlashMem, a framework that distills intrinsic memory directly from transient reasoning states via computation reuse. Leveraging the property that internal representations uniquely encode input trajectories, FlashMem identifies the last hidden state as a sufficient statistic for the interaction history. This enables a Shared-KV Consolidator to synthesize memory by attending directly to the backbone's frozen cache, eliminating redundant re-parameterization. Furthermore, a parameter-free Cognitive Monitor leverages attention entropy to adaptively trigger consolidation only when high epistemic uncertainty is detected. Experiments demonstrate that FlashMem matches the performance of heavy baselines while reducing inference latency by 5 times, effectively bridging the gap between efficiency and persistent cognition.

### Simplex-FEM Networks (SiFEN): Learning A Triangulated Function Approximator
**Authors**: Chaymae Yahyati, Ismail Lamaakal, Khalid El Makkaoui, Ibrahim Ouahbi, Yassine Maleh

**Updated**: 2026-01-08T17:07:57Z

**Summary**: We introduce Simplex-FEM Networks (SiFEN), a learned piecewise-polynomial predictor that represents f: R^d -> R^k as a globally C^r finite-element field on a learned simplicial mesh in an optionally warped input space. Each query activates exactly one simplex and at most d+1 basis functions via barycentric coordinates, yielding explicit locality, controllable smoothness, and cache-friendly sparsity. SiFEN pairs degree-m Bernstein-Bezier polynomials with a light invertible warp and trains end-to-end with shape regularization, semi-discrete OT coverage, and differentiable edge flips. Under standard shape-regularity and bi-Lipschitz warp assumptions, SiFEN achieves the classic FEM approximation rate M^(-m/d) with M mesh vertices. Empirically, on synthetic approximation tasks, tabular regression/classification, and as a drop-in head on compact CNNs, SiFEN matches or surpasses MLPs and KANs at matched parameter budgets, improves calibration (lower ECE/Brier), and reduces inference latency due to geometric locality. These properties make SiFEN a compact, interpretable, and theoretically grounded alternative to dense MLPs and edge-spline networks.

### CHIMERA: Adaptive Cache Injection and Semantic Anchor Prompting for Zero-shot Image Morphing with Morphing-oriented Metrics
**Authors**: Dahyeon Kye, Jeahun Sung, Minkyu Jeon, Jihyong Oh

**Updated**: 2026-01-08T10:29:58Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models exhibit remarkable generative ability, yet achieving smooth and semantically consistent image morphing remains a challenge. Existing approaches often yield abrupt transitions or over-saturated appearances due to the lack of adaptive structural and semantic alignments. We propose CHIMERA, a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that formulates morphing as a cached inversion-guided denoising process. To handle large semantic and appearance disparities, we propose Adaptive Cache Injection and Semantic Anchor Prompting. Adaptive Cache Injection (ACI) caches down, mid, and up blocks features from both inputs during DDIM inversion and re-injects them adaptively during denoising, enabling spatial and semantic alignment in depth- and time-adaptive manners and enabling natural feature fusion and smooth transitions. Semantic Anchor Prompting (SAP) leverages a vision-language model to generate a shared anchor prompt that serves as a semantic anchor, bridging dissimilar inputs and guiding the denoising process toward coherent results. Finally, we introduce the Global-Local Consistency Score (GLCS), a morphing-oriented metric that simultaneously evaluates the global harmonization of the two inputs and the smoothness of the local morphing transition. Extensive experiments and user studies show that CHIMERA achieves smoother and more semantically aligned transitions than existing methods, establishing a new state of the art in image morphing. The code and project page will be publicly released.

### AgentOCR: Reimagining Agent History via Optical Self-Compression
**Authors**: Lang Feng, Fuchao Yang, Feng Chen, Xin Cheng, Haiyang Xu, Zhenglin Wan, Ming Yan, Bo An

**Updated**: 2026-01-08T10:10:20Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable agentic systems trained with reinforcement learning (RL) over multi-turn interaction trajectories, but practical deployment is bottlenecked by rapidly growing textual histories that inflate token budgets and memory usage. We introduce AgentOCR, a framework that exploits the superior information density of visual tokens by representing the accumulated observation-action history as a compact rendered image. To make multi-turn rollouts scalable, AgentOCR proposes segment optical caching. By decomposing history into hashable segments and maintaining a visual cache, this mechanism eliminates redundant re-rendering. Beyond fixed rendering, AgentOCR introduces agentic self-compression, where the agent actively emits a compression rate and is trained with compression-aware reward to adaptively balance task success and token efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks, ALFWorld and search-based QA. Remarkably, results demonstrate that AgentOCR preserves over 95\% of text-based agent performance while substantially reducing token consumption (>50\%), yielding consistent token and memory efficiency. Our further analysis validates a 20x rendering speedup from segment optical caching and the effective strategic balancing of self-compression.

### FalconFS: Distributed File System for Large-Scale Deep Learning Pipeline
**Authors**: Jingwei Xu, Junbin Kang, Mingkai Dong, Mingyu Liu, Lu Zhang, Shaohong Guo, Ziyan Qiu, Mingzhen You, Ziyi Tian, Anqi Yu, Tianhong Ding, Xinwei Hu, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2026-01-08T09:19:47Z

**Summary**: Client-side metadata caching has long been considered an effective method for accelerating metadata operations in distributed file systems (DFSs). However, we have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective but also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We thus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the stateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side path resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server side using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS also boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides easy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show that FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\times$ throughput for small file read/write and up to 12.81$\times$ throughput for deep learning model training. FalconFS has been running in Huawei autonomous driving system's production environment with 10,000 NPUs for one year and has been open-sourced.

### GPU-Accelerated INT8 Quantization for KV Cache Compression in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Maanas Taneja, Purab Shingvi

**Updated**: 2026-01-08T08:35:56Z

**Summary**: The key-value (KV) cache in large language models presents a significant memory bottleneck during inference, growing linearly with sequence length and often exceeding the memory footprint of model weights themselves. We implement and evaluate GPU-accelerated INT8 quantization for KV cache compression, achieving 4$\times$ memory reduction with minimal accuracy degradation. We develop four CUDA kernel variants -- naive, tiled, coarsened, and vectorized -- and benchmark them across realistic workload sizes up to 1 billion elements. Our vectorized kernel achieves up to 1,694$\times$ speedup over CPU baselines while maintaining reconstruction error below 0.004 and attention score error below 0.1 even for 8K-dimensional heads. These results demonstrate that INT8 quantization provides a practical approach for reducing memory pressure in LLM inference with negligible computational overhead (6--58ms) and minimal impact on downstream model behavior

### MQ-GNN: A Multi-Queue Pipelined Architecture for Scalable and Efficient GNN Training
**Authors**: Irfan Ullah, Young-Koo Lee

**Updated**: 2026-01-08T08:19:47Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning graph-structured data, but their scalability is hindered by inefficient mini-batch generation, data transfer bottlenecks, and costly inter-GPU synchronization. Existing training frameworks fail to overlap these stages, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. This paper proposes MQ-GNN, a multi-queue pipelined framework that maximizes training efficiency by interleaving GNN training stages and optimizing resource utilization. MQ-GNN introduces Ready-to-Update Asynchronous Consistent Model (RaCoM), which enables asynchronous gradient sharing and model updates while ensuring global consistency through adaptive periodic synchronization. Additionally, it employs global neighbor sampling with caching to reduce data transfer overhead and an adaptive queue-sizing strategy to balance computation and memory efficiency. Experiments on four large-scale datasets and ten baseline models demonstrate that MQ-GNN achieves up to \boldmath $\bm{4.6\,\times}$ faster training time and 30% improved GPU utilization while maintaining competitive accuracy. These results establish MQ-GNN as a scalable and efficient solution for multi-GPU GNN training.

### KVmix: Gradient-Based Layer Importance-Aware Mixed-Precision Quantization for KV Cache
**Authors**: Fei Li, Song Liu, Weiguo Wu, Shiqiang Nie, Jinyu Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-08T02:42:39Z

**Summary**: The high memory demands of the Key-Value (KV) Cache during the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) severely restrict their deployment in resource-constrained platforms. Quantization can effectively alleviate the memory pressure caused by KV Cache. However, existing methods either rely on static one-size-fits-all precision allocation or fail to dynamically prioritize critical KV in long-context tasks, forcing memory-accuracy-throughput tradeoffs. In this work, we propose a novel mixed-precision quantization method for KV Cache named KVmix. KVmix leverages gradient-based importance analysis to evaluate how individual Key and Value projection matrices affect the model loss, enabling layer-specific bit-width allocation for mix-precision quantization. It dynamically prioritizes higher precision for important layers while aggressively quantizing less influential ones, achieving a tunable balance between accuracy and efficiency. KVmix also introduces a dynamic long-context optimization strategy that adaptively keeps full-precision KV pairs for recent pivotal tokens and compresses older ones, achieving high-quality sequence generation with low memory usage. Additionally, KVmix provides efficient low-bit quantization and CUDA kernels to optimize computational overhead. On LLMs such as Llama and Mistral, KVmix achieves near-lossless inference performance with extremely low quantization configuration (Key 2.19bit Value 2.38bit), while delivering a remarkable 4.9x memory compression and a 5.3x speedup in inference throughput.

### PHOTON: Hierarchical Autoregressive Modeling for Lightspeed and Memory-Efficient Language Generation
**Authors**: Yuma Ichikawa, Naoya Takagi, Takumi Nakagawa, Yuzi Kanazawa, Akira Sakai

**Updated**: 2026-01-08T01:32:26Z

**Summary**: Transformers operate as horizontal token-by-token scanners; at each generation step, attending to an ever-growing sequence of token-level states. This access pattern increases prefill latency and makes long-context decoding more memory-bound, as KV-cache reads and writes dominate inference time over arithmetic operations. We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for TOp-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces horizontal scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context scanning. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations in parallel. We further introduce recursive generation that updates only the coarsest latent stream and eliminates bottom-up re-encoding. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, providing advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks. In particular, this reduces decode-time KV-cache traffic, yielding up to $10^{3}\times$ higher throughput per unit memory.

### XGrammar 2: Dynamic and Efficient Structured Generation Engine for Agentic LLMs
**Authors**: Linzhang Li, Yixin Dong, Guanjie Wang, Ziyi Xu, Alexander Jiang, Tianqi Chen

**Updated**: 2026-01-07T22:18:51Z

**Summary**: Modern LLM agents are required to handle increasingly complex structured generation tasks, such as tool calling and conditional structured generation. These tasks are significantly more dynamic than predefined structures, posing new challenges to the current structured generation engines. In this paper, we propose XGrammar 2, a highly optimized structured generation engine for agentic LLMs. XGrammar 2 accelerates the mask generation for these dynamic structured generation tasks through a new dynamic dispatching semantics: TagDispatch. We further introduce a just-in-time (JIT) compilation method to reduce compilation time and a cross-grammar caching mechanism to leverage the common sub-structures across different grammars. Additionally, we extend the previous PDA-based mask generation algorithm to the Earley-parser-based one and design a repetition compression algorithm to handle repetition structures in grammars. Evaluation results show that XGrammar 2 can achieve more than 6x speedup over the existing structured generation engines. Integrated with an LLM inference engine, XGrammar 2 can handle dynamic structured generation tasks with near-zero overhead.

### PackCache: A Training-Free Acceleration Method for Unified Autoregressive Video Generation via Compact KV-Cache
**Authors**: Kunyang Li, Mubarak Shah, Yuzhang Shang

**Updated**: 2026-01-07T19:51:06Z

**Summary**: A unified autoregressive model is a Transformer-based framework that addresses diverse multimodal tasks (e.g., text, image, video) as a single sequence modeling problem under a shared token space. Such models rely on the KV-cache mechanism to reduce attention computation from O(T^2) to O(T); however, KV-cache size grows linearly with the number of generated tokens, and it rapidly becomes the dominant bottleneck limiting inference efficiency and generative length. Unified autoregressive video generation inherits this limitation. Our analysis reveals that KV-cache tokens exhibit distinct spatiotemporal properties: (i) text and conditioning-image tokens act as persistent semantic anchors that consistently receive high attention, and (ii) attention to previous frames naturally decays with temporal distance. Leveraging these observations, we introduce PackCache, a training-free KV-cache management method that dynamically compacts the KV cache through three coordinated mechanisms: condition anchoring that preserves semantic references, cross-frame decay modeling that allocates cache budget according to temporal distance, and spatially preserving position embedding that maintains coherent 3D structure under cache removal. In terms of efficiency, PackCache accelerates end-to-end generation by 1.7-2.2x on 48-frame long sequences, showcasing its strong potential for enabling longer-sequence video generation. Notably, the final four frames - the portion most impacted by the progressively expanding KV-cache and thus the most expensive segment of the clip - PackCache delivers a 2.6x and 3.7x acceleration on A40 and H200, respectively, for 48-frame videos.

### PackKV: Reducing KV Cache Memory Footprint through LLM-Aware Lossy Compression
**Authors**: Bo Jiang, Taolue Yang, Youyuan Liu, Xubin He, Sheng Di, Sian Jin

**Updated**: 2026-01-07T19:29:44Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential across a wide range of practical applications. However, long-context inference remains a significant challenge due to the substantial memory requirements of the key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to several gigabytes as sequence length and batch size increase. In this paper, we present \textbf{PackKV}, a generic and efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-context generation. %, which synergistically supports both latency-critical and throughput-critical inference scenarios. PackKV introduces novel lossy compression techniques specifically tailored to the characteristics of KV cache data, featuring a careful co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach is compatible with the dynamically growing nature of the KV cache while preserving high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that, under the same and minimum accuracy drop as state-of-the-art quantization methods, PackKV achieves, on average, \textbf{153.2}\% higher memory reduction rate for the K cache and \textbf{179.6}\% for the V cache. Furthermore, PackKV delivers extremely high execution throughput, effectively eliminating decompression overhead and accelerating the matrix-vector multiplication operation. Specifically, PackKV achieves an average throughput improvement of \textbf{75.7}\% for K and \textbf{171.7}\% for V across A100 and RTX Pro 6000 GPUs, compared to cuBLAS matrix-vector multiplication kernels, while demanding less GPU memory bandwidth.

**Authors**: Jan Tagscherer, Sarah de Boer, Lena Philipp, Fennie van der Graaf, Dré Peeters, Joeran Bosma, Lars Leijten, Bogdan Obreja, Ewoud Smit, Alessa Hering

**Updated**: 2026-01-07T11:16:49Z

**Summary**: Developing foundation models in medical imaging requires continuous monitoring of downstream performance. Researchers are burdened with tracking numerous experiments, design choices, and their effects on performance, often relying on ad-hoc, manual workflows that are inherently slow and error-prone. We introduce EvalBlocks, a modular, plug-and-play framework for efficient evaluation of foundation models during development. Built on Snakemake, EvalBlocks supports seamless integration of new datasets, foundation models, aggregation methods, and evaluation strategies. All experiments and results are tracked centrally and are reproducible with a single command, while efficient caching and parallel execution enable scalable use on shared compute infrastructure. Demonstrated on five state-of-the-art foundation models and three medical imaging classification tasks, EvalBlocks streamlines model evaluation, enabling researchers to iterate faster and focus on model innovation rather than evaluation logistics. The framework is released as open source software at https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/eval-blocks.

### InComeS: Integrating Compression and Selection Mechanisms into LLMs for Efficient Model Editing
**Authors**: Shuaiyi Li, Zhisong Zhang, Yang Deng, Chenlong Deng, Tianqing Fang, Hongming Zhang, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu, Wai Lam

**Updated**: 2026-01-07T10:27:04Z

**Summary**: Although existing model editing methods perform well in recalling exact edit facts, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require deeper semantic understanding rather than mere knowledge regurgitation. Leveraging the strong contextual reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), in-context learning (ICL) becomes a promising editing method by comprehending edit information through context encoding. However, this method is constrained by the limited context window of LLMs, leading to degraded performance and efficiency as the number of edits increases. To overcome this limitation, we propose InComeS, a flexible framework that enhances LLMs' ability to process editing contexts through explicit compression and selection mechanisms. Specifically, InComeS compresses each editing context into the key-value (KV) cache of a special gist token, enabling efficient handling of multiple edits without being restricted by the model's context window. Furthermore, specialized cross-attention modules are added to dynamically select the most relevant information from the gist pools, enabling adaptive and effective utilization of edit information. We conduct experiments on diverse model editing benchmarks with various editing formats, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

### Multivariate Diffusion Transformer with Decoupled Attention for High-Fidelity Mask-Text Collaborative Facial Generation
**Authors**: Yushe Cao, Dianxi Shi, Xing Fu, Xuechao Zou, Haikuo Peng, Xueqi Li, Chun Yu, Junliang Xing

**Updated**: 2026-01-07T10:24:02Z

**Summary**: While significant progress has been achieved in multimodal facial generation using semantic masks and textual descriptions, conventional feature fusion approaches often fail to enable effective cross-modal interactions, thereby leading to suboptimal generation outcomes. To address this challenge, we introduce MDiTFace--a customized diffusion transformer framework that employs a unified tokenization strategy to process semantic mask and text inputs, eliminating discrepancies between heterogeneous modality representations. The framework facilitates comprehensive multimodal feature interaction through stacked, newly designed multivariate transformer blocks that process all conditions synchronously. Additionally, we design a novel decoupled attention mechanism by dissociating implicit dependencies between mask tokens and temporal embeddings. This mechanism segregates internal computations into dynamic and static pathways, enabling caching and reuse of features computed in static pathways after initial calculation, thereby reducing additional computational overhead introduced by mask condition by over 94% while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDiTFace significantly outperforms other competing methods in terms of both facial fidelity and conditional consistency.

### ADEPT: Adaptive Dynamic Early-Exit Process for Transformers
**Authors**: Sangmin Yoo, Srikanth Malla, Chiho Choi, Wei D. Lu, Joon Hee Choi

**Updated**: 2026-01-07T08:34:41Z

**Summary**: The inference of large language models imposes significant computational workloads, often requiring the processing of billions of parameters. Although early-exit strategies have proven effective in reducing computational demands by halting inference earlier, they apply either to only the first token in the generation phase or at the prompt level in the prefill phase. Thus, the Key-Value (KV) cache for skipped layers remains a bottleneck for subsequent token generation, limiting the benefits of early exit. We introduce ADEPT (Adaptive Dynamic Early-exit Process for Transformers), a novel approach designed to overcome this issue and enable dynamic early exit in both the prefill and generation phases. The proposed adaptive token-level early-exit mechanism adjusts computation dynamically based on token complexity, optimizing efficiency without compromising performance. ADEPT further enhances KV generation procedure by decoupling sequential dependencies in skipped layers, making token-level early exit more practical. Experimental results demonstrate that ADEPT improves efficiency by up to 25% in language generation tasks and achieves a 4x speed-up in downstream classification tasks, with up to a 45% improvement in performance.

### Sortblock: Similarity-Aware Feature Reuse for Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Hanqi Chen, Xu Zhang, Xiaoliu Guan, Lielin Jiang, Guanzhong Wang, Zeyu Chen, Yi Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-07T03:25:48Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that enhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential denoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment in real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches typically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking the evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To address this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration framework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock adaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant computations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped blocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures demonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\times$ inference speedup with minimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

### MorphServe: Efficient and Workload-Aware LLM Serving via Runtime Quantized Layer Swapping and KV Cache Resizing
**Authors**: Zhaoyuan Su, Zeyu Zhang, Tingfeng Lan, Zirui Wang, Haiying Shen, Juncheng Yang, Yue Cheng

**Updated**: 2026-01-07T03:04:41Z

**Summary**: Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) under dynamic and bursty workloads remains a key challenge for real-world deployment. Existing serving frameworks and static model compression techniques fail to adapt to workload fluctuations, leading to either service-level objective (SLO) violations under full-precision serving or persistent accuracy degradation with static quantization. We present MorphServe, a dynamic, workload-aware LLM serving framework based on morphological adaptation. MorphServe introduces two asynchronous, token-level runtime mechanisms: quantized layer swapping, which selectively replaces less impactful layers with quantized alternatives during high-load periods, and pressure-aware KV cache resizing, which dynamically adjusts KV cache capacity in response to memory pressure. These mechanisms enable state-preserving transitions with minimum runtime overhead and are fully compatible with modern scheduling and attention techniques. Extensive experiments on Vicuna and Llama family models with real-world workloads demonstrate that MorphServe reduces average SLO violations by 92.45 percent and improves the P95 TTFT latency by 2.2x-3.9x compared to full-precision serving, without compromising generation quality. These results establish MorphServe as a practical and elastic solution for LLM deployment in dynamic environments.

### DeepSearch: Overcome the Bottleneck of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards via Monte Carlo Tree Search
**Authors**: Fang Wu, Weihao Xuan, Heli Qi, Ximing Lu, Aaron Tu, Li Erran Li, Yejin Choi

**Updated**: 2026-01-07T02:08:44Z

**Summary**: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced reasoning skills in language models, contemporary studies have documented training plateaus after thousands of optimization steps, i.e., notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration, DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration, which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3) adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves 62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B reasoning models, while using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged computation.

### DIP: Dynamic In-Context Planner For Diffusion Language Models
**Authors**: Yang Li, Han Meng, Chenan Wang, Haipeng Chen

**Updated**: 2026-01-06T17:24:16Z

**Summary**: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have shown strong potential for general natural language tasks with in-context examples. However, due to the bidirectional attention mechanism, DLMs incur substantial computational cost as context length increases. This work addresses this issue with a key discovery: unlike the sequential generation in autoregressive language models (ARLMs), the diffusion generation paradigm in DLMs allows \textit{efficient dynamic adjustment of the context} during generation. Building on this insight, we propose \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{I}n-Context \textbf{P}lanner (DIP), a context-optimization method that dynamically selects and inserts in-context examples during generation, rather than providing all examples in the prompt upfront. Results show DIP maintains generation quality while achieving up to 12.9$\times$ inference speedup over standard inference and 1.17$\times$ over KV cache-enhanced inference.

### Bare-Metal Tensor Virtualization: Overcoming the Memory Wall in Edge-AI Inference on ARM64
**Authors**: Bugra Kilictas, Faruk Alpay

**Updated**: 2026-01-06T15:00:40Z

**Summary**: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" the bottleneck where data movement latency outstrips arithmetic throughput. Standard inference runtimes often incur significant overhead through high-level abstractions, dynamic dispatch, and unaligned memory access patterns. In this work, we present a novel "Virtual Tensor Core" architecture implemented in software, optimized specifically for ARM64 microarchitectures (Apple Silicon). By bypassing standard library containers in favor of direct memory mapping (mmap) and implementing hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels, we achieve a form of "Software-Defined Direct Memory Access (DMA)." Our proposed Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) guarantees 100% cache line utilization for weight matrices, while our zero-copy loader eliminates initialization latency. Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of >60 tokens/second on M2 hardware. While proprietary hardware accelerators (e.g., Apple AMX) can achieve higher peak throughput, our architecture provides a fully open, portable, and deterministic reference implementation for studying the memory bottleneck on general-purpose ARM silicon, meeting the 200ms psycholinguistic latency threshold without opaque dependencies.

### Joint Encoding of KV-Cache Blocks for Scalable LLM Serving
**Authors**: Joseph Kampeas, Emir Haleva

**Updated**: 2026-01-06T14:50:58Z

**Summary**: Modern large language models (LLMs) drive interactive AI systems but are bottlenecked by the memory-heavy growth of key-value (KV) caches, which limits real-time throughput under concurrent loads. Existing KV-cache compression methods rely on rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts, or require specialized compute, hindering scalability and deployment.   We propose joint encoding of KV-cache blocks, which fuses similar blocks across requests and input chunks into shared representations while preserving standard cache structure. This alleviates the KV-cache memory bottleneck, supporting high-concurrency serving without specialized hardware. Theoretically, we analyze the rate-distortion tradeoff of fused cache blocks under a Poisson process model. Empirically, our method achieves up to 4.38 $\times$ KV-cache compression with negligible accuracy loss across diverse LLMs and benchmarks, outperforming recent structured and adaptive compression baselines. In real LLM serving, joint encoding improves the token throughput by $\sim$40\% on a single-machine vLLM benchmark, demonstrating substantial gains in inference throughput. Code is available at https://github.com/sef1/kv_fast_fusion  kv_joint_encoding.

### Towards Threshold-Free KV Cache Pruning
**Authors**: Xuanfan Ni, Liyan Xu, Chenyang Lyu, Longyue Wang, Mo Yu, Lemao Liu, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Piji Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-06T14:32:34Z

**Summary**: To reduce memory consumption during LLM inference, prior works have proposed numerous methods that focus on KV cache pruning based on various criteria. While these techniques often accomplish lossless memory reduction on many datasets, they often rely on an under-emphasized condition: a dataset/domain-specific budget size threshold needs to be pre-determined to achieve the optimal performance. However, such input-specific tuning may be considerably limited in real-world scenarios, as open-domain inputs span diverse domains, lengths and difficulty levels, without clear boundaries for pre-tuning. Thus, the dependence of an input-sensitive threshold can be an inherent limitation that may cause large degradation on arbitrary inputs. In this work, we propose a new objective that lifts the threshold constraints for robust KV pruning, calling for "threshold-free" methods that automatically adjust budget sizes while ensuring full-cache performance. We then propose a novel method ReFreeKV as the first solution fulfilling this objective, validated by intensive experiments on 13 datasets of diverse context lengths, task types, and model sizes.

### RadioDiff-Flux: Efficient Radio Map Construction via Generative Denoise Diffusion Model Trajectory Midpoint Reuse
**Authors**: Xiucheng Wang, Peilin Zheng, Honggang Jia, Nan Cheng, Ruijin Sun, Conghao Zhou, Xuemin Shen

**Updated**: 2026-01-06T07:57:27Z

**Summary**: Accurate radio map (RM) construction is essential to enabling environment-aware and adaptive wireless communication. However, in future 6G scenarios characterized by high-speed network entities and fast-changing environments, it is very challenging to meet real-time requirements. Although generative diffusion models (DMs) can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with second-level delay, their iterative nature leads to prohibitive inference latency in delay-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, by uncovering a key structural property of diffusion processes: the latent midpoints remain highly consistent across semantically similar scenes, we propose RadioDiff-Flux, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework that decouples static environmental modeling from dynamic refinement, enabling the reuse of precomputed midpoints to bypass redundant denoising. In particular, the first stage generates a coarse latent representation using only static scene features, which can be cached and shared across similar scenarios. The second stage adapts this representation to dynamic conditions and transmitter locations using a pre-trained model, thereby avoiding repeated early-stage computation. The proposed RadioDiff-Flux significantly reduces inference time while preserving fidelity. Experiment results show that RadioDiff-Flux can achieve up to 50 acceleration with less than 0.15% accuracy loss, demonstrating its practical utility for fast, scalable RM generation in future 6G networks.

### Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion for Extendable Planning
**Authors**: Jaesik Yoon, Hyeonseo Cho, Sungjin Ahn

**Updated**: 2026-01-06T04:54:34Z

**Summary**: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

### Making MoE-based LLM Inference Resilient with Tarragon
**Authors**: Songyu Zhang, Aaron Tam, Myungjin Lee, Shixiong Qi, K. K. Ramakrishnan

**Updated**: 2026-01-06T04:01:10Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are increasingly used to serve LLMs at scale, but failures become common as deployment scale grows. Existing systems exhibit poor failure resilience: even a single worker failure triggers a coarse-grained, service-wide restart, discarding accumulated progress and halting the entire inference pipeline during recovery--an approach clearly ill-suited for latency-sensitive, LLM services.   We present Tarragon, a resilient MoE inference framework that confines the failures impact to individual workers while allowing the rest of the pipeline to continue making forward progress. Tarragon exploits the natural separation between the attention and expert computation in MoE-based transformers, treating attention workers (AWs) and expert workers (EWs) as distinct failure domains. Tarragon introduces a reconfigurable datapath to mask failures by rerouting requests to healthy workers. On top of this datapath, Tarragon implements a self-healing mechanism that relaxes the tightly synchronized execution of existing MoE frameworks. For stateful AWs, Tarragon performs asynchronous, incremental KV cache checkpointing with per-request restoration, and for stateless EWs, it leverages residual GPU memory to deploy shadow experts. These together keep recovery cost and recomputation overhead extremely low. Our evaluation shows that, compared to state-of-the-art MegaScale-Infer, Tarragon reduces failure-induced stalls by 160-213x (from ~64 s down to 0.3-0.4 s) while preserving performance when no failures occur.

**Authors**: Yang Yang, Shaofeng Rao, Yuxuan Hou, Jiabo Liu, Deng Hu, Yufei Guo, Jianzhou Zhao, Hechen Ren, Zhiwei Wang, Fan Yang

**Updated**: 2026-01-06T02:54:45Z

**Summary**: Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) have recently emerged as a promising platform for exploring correlated and topological quantum states, yet their potential for optoelectronic applications remains largely unexplored. Here, we report high-performance photodetectors based on van der Waals KV$_3$Sb$_5$/WSe$_2$ heterojunctions. A high-quality Schottky interface readily forms between KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and WSe$_2$, enabling efficient separation and transport of photoinduced carriers. Under 520 nm illumination, the device achieves an open-circuit voltage up to 0.6 V, a responsivity of 809 mA/W, and a fast response time of 18.3 us. This work demonstrates the promising optoelectronic applications of Kagome metals and highlights the potential of KV$_3$Sb$_5$-based van der Waals heterostructures for high-performance photodetection.

### LoRA-Drop: Temporal LoRA Decoding for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Hossein Rajabzadeh, Maryam Dialameh, Chul B. Park, Il-Min Kim, Hyock Ju Kwon

**Updated**: 2026-01-05T21:47:47Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) are bottlenecked by sequential decoding, where each new token typically requires executing all transformer layers. Existing dynamic-depth and layer-skipping methods reduce this cost, but often rely on auxiliary routing mechanisms or incur accuracy degradation when bypassed layers are left uncompensated. We present \textbf{LoRA-Drop}, a plug-and-play inference framework that accelerates decoding by applying a \emph{temporal compute schedule} to a fixed subset of intermediate layers: on most decoding steps, selected layers reuse the previous-token hidden state and apply a low-rank LoRA correction, while periodic \emph{refresh} steps execute the full model to prevent drift. LoRA-Drop requires no routing network, is compatible with standard KV caching, and can reduce KV-cache footprint by skipping KV updates in droppable layers during LoRA steps and refreshing periodically. Across \textbf{LLaMA2-7B}, \textbf{LLaMA3-8B}, \textbf{Qwen2.5-7B}, and \textbf{Qwen2.5-14B}, LoRA-Drop achieves up to \textbf{2.6$\times$ faster decoding} and \textbf{45--55\% KV-cache reduction} while staying within \textbf{0.5 percentage points (pp)} of baseline accuracy. Evaluations on reasoning (GSM8K, MATH, BBH), code generation (HumanEval, MBPP), and long-context/multilingual benchmarks (LongBench, XNLI, XCOPA) identify a consistent \emph{safe zone} of scheduling configurations that preserves quality while delivering substantial efficiency gains, providing a simple path toward adaptive-capacity inference in LLMs. Codes are available at https://github.com/hosseinbv/LoRA-Drop.git.

### High-repetition-rate terahertz and ultraviolet radiation for high-throughput ultrafast electron diffraction
**Authors**: Andrey Ryabov, Kasra Amini

**Updated**: 2026-01-05T18:25:44Z

**Summary**: Scaling femtosecond terahertz (THz) and ultraviolet (UV) sources to high repetition rates is essential for high-throughput ultrafast spectroscopy and imaging applications. Yet, their efficient generation at high average power remains limited by thermal effects, phase-matching constraints, and material damage. Here, we demonstrate broadband THz and UV generation driven by a common Yb:KGW laser operating from at 40 - 600 kHz. THz radiation is produced by optical rectification in stoichiometric MgO:LiNbO$_3$ using a line-focus geometry, yielding single-cycle pulses of 55 - 92 nJ energy with peak electric fields of 37 - 90 kV/cm. Electro-optic sampling and beam-quality measurements reveal tunable control between central frequency, bandwidth and field amplitude by translating the generation region transversely within the crystal. Using shorter pump pulses preserves THz conversion efficiency, while longer pulses at 100 kHz reduce THz output by up to a factor of four due to cumulative thermal effects. Femtosecond 257.5 nm UV pulses are generated by cascaded fourth-harmonic generation in $β$-barium borate with conversion efficiencies exceeding 10% at 40 kHz and stable operation up to 600 kHz. These results demonstrate a compact, thermally robust platform for high-average-power nonlinear conversion and are directly relevant to next-generation high-repetition-rate ultrafast electron diffraction and spectroscopy systems.

### BitDecoding: Unlocking Tensor Cores for Long-Context LLMs with Low-Bit KV Cache
**Authors**: Dayou Du, Shijie Cao, Jianyi Cheng, Luo Mai, Ting Cao, Mao Yang

**Updated**: 2026-01-05T18:08:27Z

**Summary**: The growth of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly increases memory and bandwidth pressure during autoregressive decoding due to the expanding Key-Value (KV) cache. While accuracy-preserving KV-cache quantization (e.g., 4-bit or 2-bit) reduces memory footprint, existing systems decode inefficiently by relying solely on CUDA cores, underutilizing Tensor Cores-the dominant compute resource on GPUs.   We present BitDecoding, the first inference system to efficiently decode low-bit KV caches by cooperatively leveraging CUDA cores and Tensor Cores. BitDecoding smartly induces Tensor-Core-friendly layouts, introduces warp-level dequantization parallelism, and provides unified system support through query transformation, high-performance tensor- and channel-wise quantization, and a software-pipelined dequantization kernel enabling mixed-precision execution. Architecture-aware optimizations further leverage Hopper's warpgroup tensor instructions and Blackwell's NVFP4 (MXFP4) tensor formats.   Evaluated on Blackwell, Hopper, and Ampere GPUs, BitDecoding achieves an average 7.5x decoding speedup over FP16 FlashDecoding-v2, up to 8.6x on Blackwell with NVFP4, and up to 4.3x over state-of-the-art approaches. On LLaMA-3.1-8B with a 128K context, BitDecoding reduces single-batch decoding latency by 3x. BitDecoding is open-sourced at https://github.com/OpenBitSys/BitDecoding.

### InfiniteVGGT: Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer for Endless Streams
**Authors**: Shuai Yuan, Yantai Yang, Xiaotian Yang, Xupeng Zhang, Zhonghao Zhao, Lingming Zhang, Zhipeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-05T17:11:00Z

**Summary**: The grand vision of enabling persistent, large-scale 3D visual geometry understanding is shackled by the irreconcilable demands of scalability and long-term stability. While offline models like VGGT achieve inspiring geometry capability, their batch-based nature renders them irrelevant for live systems. Streaming architectures, though the intended solution for live operation, have proven inadequate. Existing methods either fail to support truly infinite-horizon inputs or suffer from catastrophic drift over long sequences. We shatter this long-standing dilemma with InfiniteVGGT, a causal visual geometry transformer that operationalizes the concept of a rolling memory through a bounded yet adaptive and perpetually expressive KV cache. Capitalizing on this, we devise a training-free, attention-agnostic pruning strategy that intelligently discards obsolete information, effectively ``rolling'' the memory forward with each new frame. Fully compatible with FlashAttention, InfiniteVGGT finally alleviates the compromise, enabling infinite-horizon streaming while outperforming existing streaming methods in long-term stability. The ultimate test for such a system is its performance over a truly infinite horizon, a capability that has been impossible to rigorously validate due to the lack of extremely long-term, continuous benchmarks. To address this critical gap, we introduce the Long3D benchmark, which, for the first time, enables a rigorous evaluation of continuous 3D geometry estimation on sequences about 10,000 frames. This provides the definitive evaluation platform for future research in long-term 3D geometry understanding. Code is available at: https://github.com/AutoLab-SAI-SJTU/InfiniteVGGT

### Optimizing LLM Inference: Fluid-Guided Online Scheduling with Memory Constraints
**Authors**: Ruicheng Ao, Gan Luo, David Simchi-Levi, Xinshang Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-05T14:10:45Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) power many modern applications, but their inference procedure poses unique scheduling challenges: the Key-Value (KV) cache grows dynamically during response generation, and memory overflow triggers eviction that can cascade into system-wide failures. Even when memory capacity exceeds the theoretical requirement, conventional scheduling algorithms fail because they do not account for this dynamic memory growth -- a system that should be stable can become unstable under poor scheduling.   This paper formulates LLM inference optimization as a multi-stage online scheduling problem. We develop a fluid dynamics approximation to establish a tractable benchmark and derive the Waiting for Accumulated Inference Threshold (WAIT) algorithm. WAIT uses threshold-based batching to prevent eviction by keeping the system near load balance, achieving near-optimal throughput when output lengths are known.   For practical settings where output lengths are unknown at arrival, we introduce Nested WAIT. Rather than predicting output lengths, Nested WAIT classifies prompts on-the-fly: short prompts complete early and exit, while longer prompts naturally advance to later segments. A safety buffer provides high-probability protection against memory overflow with only logarithmic overhead.   Theoretical analysis establishes near-optimal performance in the asymptotic regime. Experiments on Llama-7B with an A100 GPU demonstrate that our approach achieves superior throughput and reduced latency compared to vLLM and Sarathi. This work applies operations research principles to establish a theoretical framework for LLM deployment under memory constraints.

### TravelBench: A Broader Real-World Benchmark for Multi-Turn and Tool-Using Travel Planning
**Authors**: Xiang Cheng, Yulan Hu, Xiangwen Zhang, Lu Xu, Zheng Pan, Xin Li, Yong Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-05T13:19:13Z

**Summary**: Travel planning is a natural real-world task to test large language models (LLMs) planning and tool-use abilities. Although prior work has studied LLM performance on travel planning, existing settings still differ from real-world needs, mainly due to limited domain coverage, insufficient modeling of users' implicit preferences in multi-turn conversations, and a lack of clear evaluation of agents' capability boundaries. To mitigate these gaps, we propose \textbf{TravelBench}, a benchmark for fully real-world travel planning. We collect user queries, user profile and tools from real scenarios, and construct three subtasks-Single-Turn, Multi-Turn, and Unsolvable-to evaluate agent's three core capabilities in real settings: (1) solving problems autonomously, (2) interacting with users over multiple turns to refine requirements, and (3) recognizing the limits of own abilities. To enable stable tool invocation and reproducible evaluation, we cache real tool-call results and build a sandbox environment that integrates ten travel-related tools. Agents can combine these tools to solve most practical travel planning problems, and our systematic verification demonstrates the stability of the proposed benchmark. We further evaluate multiple LLMs on TravelBench and conduct an in-depth analysis of their behaviors and performance. TravelBench provides a practical and reproducible evaluation benchmark to advance research on LLM agents for travel planning.\footnote{Our code and data will be available after internal review.

### Deferred Commitment Decoding for Diffusion Language Models with Confidence-Aware Sliding Windows
**Authors**: Yingte Shu, Yuchuan Tian, Chao Xu, Yunhe Wang, Hanting Chen

**Updated**: 2026-01-05T12:57:33Z

**Summary**: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a strong alternative to autoregressive models by enabling parallel text generation. To improve inference efficiency and KV-cache compatibility, prior work commonly adopts block-based diffusion, decoding tokens block by block. However, this paradigm suffers from a structural limitation that we term Boundary-Induced Context Truncation (BICT): undecoded tokens near block boundaries are forced to commit without access to nearby future context, even when such context could substantially reduce uncertainty. This limitation degrades decoding confidence and generation quality, especially for tasks requiring precise reasoning, such as mathematical problem solving and code generation. We propose Deferred Commitment Decoding (DCD), a novel, training-free decoding strategy that mitigates this issue. DCD maintains a confidence-aware sliding window over masked tokens, resolving low-uncertainty tokens early while deferring high-uncertainty tokens until sufficient contextual evidence becomes available. This design enables effective bidirectional information flow within the decoding window without sacrificing efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion language models, benchmarks, and caching configurations show that DCD improves generation accuracy by 1.39% with comparable time on average compared to fixed block-based diffusion methods, with the most significant improvement reaching 9.0%. These results demonstrate that deferring token commitment based on uncertainty is a simple yet effective principle for improving both the quality and efficiency of diffusion language model decoding.

### Not All Needles Are Found: How Fact Distribution and Don't Make It Up Prompts Shape Literal Extraction, Logical Inference, and Hallucination Risks in Long-Context LLMs
**Authors**: Amirali Ebrahimzadeh, Seyyed M. Salili

**Updated**: 2026-01-05T11:30:56Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support very long input contexts. Yet it remains unclear how reliably they extract and infer information at scale. Performance varies with context length and strongly interacts with how information is distributed in real-world corpora. Motivated by these observations, we study how fact placement, corpus-level fact distributions, and Don't Make It Up prompts influence model behavior. We introduce an extended needle-in-a-haystack benchmark across four production-scale models: Gemini-2.5-flash, ChatGPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5-haiku, and Deepseek-v3.2-chat. Unlike prior work, we separately evaluate literal extraction, logical inference, and hallucination risk. Our study considers both positional effects and realistic distributions of evidence across long contexts, as well as prompts that explicitly discourage fabrication. We find that longer contexts alone do not guarantee better performance and can be detrimental when relevant evidence is diluted or widely dispersed. Performance varies substantially across models: some show severe degradation under realistic conditions, while others remain more robust at longer context lengths. Anti-hallucination (AH) instructions can make some models overly conservative, sharply reducing accuracy in literal extraction and logical inference. While we do not directly compare retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and cache-augmented generation (CAG), our results suggest many failures stem from ineffective context utilization. Models often struggle to identify and prioritize relevant information even when it is present. These findings have direct practical implications, as enterprise workflows increasingly involve pasting large volumes of unfiltered documents into LLM prompts. Effective context length and model-specific robustness to long contexts are therefore critical for reliable LLM deployment in research and business.

### AR-MOT: Autoregressive Multi-object Tracking
**Authors**: Lianjie Jia, Yuhan Wu, Binghao Ran, Yifan Wang, Lijun Wang, Huchuan Lu

**Updated**: 2026-01-05T09:17:28Z

**Summary**: As multi-object tracking (MOT) tasks continue to evolve toward more general and multi-modal scenarios, the rigid and task-specific architectures of existing MOT methods increasingly hinder their applicability across diverse tasks and limit flexibility in adapting to new tracking formulations. Most approaches rely on fixed output heads and bespoke tracking pipelines, making them difficult to extend to more complex or instruction-driven tasks. To address these limitations, we propose AR-MOT, a novel autoregressive paradigm that formulates MOT as a sequence generation task within a large language model (LLM) framework. This design enables the model to output structured results through flexible sequence construction, without requiring any task-specific heads. To enhance region-level visual perception, we introduce an Object Tokenizer based on a pretrained detector. To mitigate the misalignment between global and regional features, we propose a Region-Aware Alignment (RAA) module, and to support long-term tracking, we design a Temporal Memory Fusion (TMF) module that caches historical object tokens. AR-MOT offers strong potential for extensibility, as new modalities or instructions can be integrated by simply modifying the output sequence format without altering the model architecture. Extensive experiments on MOT17 and DanceTrack validate the feasibility of our approach, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while laying the foundation for more general and flexible MOT systems.

### Mem-Rec: Memory Efficient Recommendation System using Alternative Representation
**Authors**: Gopi Krishna Jha, Anthony Thomas, Nilesh Jain, Sameh Gobriel, Tajana Rosing, Ravi Iyer

**Updated**: 2026-01-05T03:36:57Z

**Summary**: Deep learning-based recommendation systems (e.g., DLRMs) are widely used AI models to provide high-quality personalized recommendations. Training data used for modern recommendation systems commonly includes categorical features taking on tens-of-millions of possible distinct values. These categorical tokens are typically assigned learned vector representations, that are stored in large embedding tables, on the order of 100s of GB. Storing and accessing these tables represent a substantial burden in commercial deployments. Our work proposes MEM-REC, a novel alternative representation approach for embedding tables. MEM-REC leverages bloom filters and hashing methods to encode categorical features using two cache-friendly embedding tables. The first table (token embedding) contains raw embeddings (i.e. learned vector representation), and the second table (weight embedding), which is much smaller, contains weights to scale these raw embeddings to provide better discriminative capability to each data point. We provide a detailed architecture, design and analysis of MEM-REC addressing trade-offs in accuracy and computation requirements, in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques. We show that MEM-REC can not only maintain the recommendation quality and significantly reduce the memory footprint for commercial scale recommendation models but can also improve the embedding latency. In particular, based on our results, MEM-REC compresses the MLPerf CriteoTB benchmark DLRM model size by 2900x and performs up to 3.4x faster embeddings while achieving the same AUC as that of the full uncompressed model.

### KVCrush: Key value cache size-reduction using similarity in head-behaviour
**Authors**: Gopi Krishna Jha, Sameh Gobriel, Liubov Talamanova, Nilesh Jain

**Updated**: 2026-01-05T03:29:51Z

**Summary**: Key-value (KV) caching has emerged as a crucial optimization technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs). By allowing the attention operation to scale linearly rather than quadratically with the total sequence length, KV caching significantly enhances generation throughput. However, due to large context lengths in the modern LLMs, the memory footprint of the KV is a huge bottleneck for model deployment directly impacting the model's batch size, hindering its ability to deliver high-throughput. Existing research addresses this challenge using several techniques, such as discarding low-attention tokens, quantization, and matrix approximation which typically lead to a negative impact on the model accuracy.   In this paper, We propose KVCrush technology which can be combined with many KV compression technologies to improve the model accuracy at a much smaller memory. KVCrush provides an alternate representation scheme for key-value states, along with a low-overhead token pruning algorithm that accounts for the token distribution in the KV cache, which in turn allows for a a smaller footprint while maintaining the accuracy of the model. Based on our results, KVCrush reduces LongBench KV Cache size by 4x with less than 1% accuracy drop and achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy with minimal overhead, incurring less than 0.5% total inference latency. KVCrush not only outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art importance-based token retention schemes but is also compatible with typical practical LLM deployments using KV cache paging schemes such as vLLM and mixed precision quantization.

### RelayGR: Scaling Long-Sequence Generative Recommendation via Cross-Stage Relay-Race Inference

**Updated**: 2026-01-05T01:34:06Z

**Summary**: Real-time recommender systems execute multi-stage cascades (retrieval, pre-processing, fine-grained ranking) under strict tail-latency SLOs, leaving only tens of milliseconds for ranking. Generative recommendation (GR) models can improve quality by consuming long user-behavior sequences, but in production their online sequence length is tightly capped by the ranking-stage P99 budget. We observe that the majority of GR tokens encode user behaviors that are independent of the item candidates, suggesting an opportunity to pre-infer a user-behavior prefix once and reuse it during ranking rather than recomputing it on the critical path. Realizing this idea at industrial scale is non-trivial: the prefix cache must survive across multiple pipeline stages before the final ranking instance is determined, the user population implies cache footprints far beyond a single device, and indiscriminate pre-inference would overload shared resources under high QPS. We present RelayGR, a production system that enables in-HBM relay-race inference for GR. RelayGR selectively pre-infers long-term user prefixes, keeps their KV caches resident in HBM over the request lifecycle, and ensures the subsequent ranking can consume them without remote fetches. RelayGR combines three techniques: 1) a sequence-aware trigger that admits only at-risk requests under a bounded cache footprint and pre-inference load, 2) an affinity-aware router that co-locates cache production and consumption by routing both the auxiliary pre-infer signal and the ranking request to the same instance, and 3) a memory-aware expander that uses server-local DRAM to capture short-term cross-request reuse while avoiding redundant reloads. We implement RelayGR on Huawei Ascend NPUs and evaluate it with real queries. Under a fixed P99 SLO, RelayGR supports up to 1.5$\times$ longer sequences and improves SLO-compliant throughput by up to 3.6$\times$.

### Latent Space Communication via K-V Cache Alignment
**Authors**: Lucio M. Dery, Zohar Yahav, Henry Prior, Qixuan Feng, Jiajun Shen, Arthur Szlam

**Updated**: 2026-01-04T04:15:25Z

**Summary**: Solving increasingly complex problems with large language models (LLMs) necessitates a move beyond individual models and towards multi-model systems that can effectively collaborate. While text has traditionally served as the medium for inter-model communication, a richer and more efficient exchange is possible if models can access each other's internal states directly. In this paper, we propose learning a shared representation space that aligns the k-v caches of multiple models, creating a high-bandwidth channel for collaboration without altering the underlying pre-trained parameters. We do so by augmenting each model with adapters to translate its state into and out of this shared space. Via a suite of experiments with Gemma-2 models, we demonstrate that this approach not only enables seamless inter-model communication but also improves individual model performance. We also show that the shared space allows for the direct transfer of learned skills, such as soft prompts, between different models. Our work represents a significant step towards a future where models can fluidly share knowledge and capabilities.

### Hardware Acceleration for Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Survey
**Authors**: Bin Xu, Ayan Banerjee, Sandeep Gupta

**Updated**: 2026-01-04T00:01:40Z

**Summary**: Neural networks have become a dominant computational workload across cloud and edge platforms, but rapid growth in model size and deployment diversity has exposed hardware bottlenecks increasingly dominated by memory movement, communication, and irregular operators rather than peak arithmetic throughput. This survey reviews the technology landscape for hardware acceleration of deep learning, spanning GPUs and tensor-core architectures; domain-specific accelerators (e.g., TPUs/NPUs); FPGA-based designs; ASIC inference engines; and emerging LLM-serving accelerators such as LPUs (language processing units), alongside in-/near-memory computing and neuromorphic/analog approaches. We organize the space using a unified taxonomy across (i) workloads (CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers/LLMs), (ii) execution settings (training vs.\ inference; datacenter vs.\ edge), and (iii) optimization levers (reduced precision, sparsity and pruning, operator fusion, compilation and scheduling, and memory-system/interconnect design). We synthesize key architectural ideas including systolic arrays, vector and SIMD engines, specialized attention and softmax kernels, quantization-aware datapaths, and high-bandwidth memory, and we discuss how software stacks and compilers bridge model semantics to hardware. Finally, we highlight open challenges -- including efficient long-context LLM inference (KV-cache management), robust support for dynamic and sparse workloads, energy- and security-aware deployment, and fair benchmarking -- and point to promising directions for the next generation of neural acceleration.

### Warp-Cortex: An Asynchronous, Memory-Efficient Architecture for Million-Agent Cognitive Scaling on Consumer Hardware
**Authors**: Jorge L. Ruiz Williams

**Updated**: 2026-01-03T23:11:21Z

**Summary**: Current multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) frameworks suffer from linear memory scaling, rendering "System 2" parallel reasoning impractical on consumer hardware. We present Warp Cortex, an asynchronous architecture that theoretically enables million-agent cognitive scaling by decoupling agent logic from physical memory. Through Singleton Weight Sharing and a novel Topological Synapse--inspired by hybrid landmarking techniques from Topological Data Analysis (TDA)--we reduce memory complexity from O(N * L) to O(1) for weights and O(N * k) for context, where k << L. By treating the KV-cache as a point cloud in latent space, we apply witness-complex-inspired sparsification to preserve persistent homological features of the context manifold. On a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, we empirically demonstrate 100 concurrent agents at 2.2 GB total VRAM, with theoretical capacity exceeding 1,000 agents before compute latency becomes the bottleneck. We further introduce Referential Injection, a non-intrusive KV-cache update mechanism that allows asynchronous sub-agents to influence primary generation without stream disruption.

### XStreamVGGT: Extremely Memory-Efficient Streaming Vision Geometry Grounded Transformer with KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Zunhai Su, Weihao Ye, Hansen Feng, Keyu Fan, Jing Zhang, Dahai Yu, Zhengwu Liu, Ngai Wong

**Updated**: 2026-01-03T14:59:50Z

**Summary**: Learning-based 3D visual geometry models have benefited substantially from large-scale transformers. Among these, StreamVGGT leverages frame-wise causal attention for strong streaming reconstruction, but suffers from unbounded KV cache growth, leading to escalating memory consumption and inference latency as input frames accumulate. We propose XStreamVGGT, a tuning-free approach that systematically compresses the KV cache through joint pruning and quantization, enabling extremely memory-efficient streaming inference. Specifically, redundant KVs originating from multi-view inputs are pruned through efficient token importance identification, enabling a fixed memory budget. Leveraging the unique distribution of KV tensors, we incorporate KV quantization to further reduce memory consumption. Extensive evaluations show that XStreamVGGT achieves mostly negligible performance degradation while substantially reducing memory usage by 4.42$\times$ and accelerating inference by 5.48$\times$, enabling scalable and practical streaming 3D applications. The code is available at https://github.com/ywh187/XStreamVGGT/.

### EmoLoom-2B: Fast Base-Model Screening for Emotion Classification and VAD with Lexicon-Weak Supervision and KV-Off Evaluation
**Authors**: Zilin Li, Weiwei Xu, Xuanbo Lu, Zheda Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-03T08:25:58Z

**Summary**: We introduce EmoLoom-2B, a lightweight and reproducible pipeline that turns small language models under 2B parameters into fast screening candidates for joint emotion classification and Valence-Arousal-Dominance prediction. To ensure protocol-faithful and fair evaluation, we unify data loading, training, and inference under a single JSON input-output contract and remove avoidable variance by adopting KV-off decoding as the default setting. We incorporate two orthogonal semantic regularizers: a VAD-preserving constraint that aligns generated text with target VAD triples, and a lightweight external appraisal classifier that provides training-time guidance on goal attainment, controllability, certainty, and fairness without injecting long rationales. To improve polarity sensitivity, we introduce Valence Flip augmentation based on mirrored emotional pairs. During supervised fine-tuning, we apply A/B mixture sampling with entropy-aware temperature scheduling to balance coverage and convergence. Using Qwen-1.8B-Chat as the base model, EmoLoom-2B achieves strong performance on GoEmotions and EmpatheticDialogues, and demonstrates robust cross-corpus generalization on DailyDialog. The proposed recipe is budget-aware, auditable, and re-entrant, serving as a dependable screening pass before heavier training or multimodal fusion.

**Authors**: Karthikeya KV

**Updated**: 2026-01-03T07:05:35Z

**Summary**: This research introduces a transformative framework for integrating Vision-Enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced transformer-based architectures to tackle challenges in high-resolution image synthesis and multimodal data interpretation. The proposed model incorporates a rectified flow mechanism that connects noise and data with linear paths, enabling efficient and high-quality generation. A bidirectional tokenization strategy is employed to seamlessly merge inputs from text, image, and video modalities, fostering a unified understanding across diverse data types. By embedding spatial-temporal features and leveraging a hybrid text-image sequence modeling approach, the framework achieves unparalleled fidelity in synthesized images and coherent multimodal representations. The architecture is optimized with a noise-aware learning algorithm, addressing discrepancies in noisy data distributions and improving generative performance under varying input conditions. Rigorous evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate a 25% increase in image resolution clarity and a 20% reduction in computational requirements compared to diffusion-based methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits robust scalability and adaptability, showcasing its potential in applications like autonomous systems, creative content generation, and advanced video analysis. This work underscores the role of vision-centric LLMs in redefining capabilities in computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence.

### Decision-Aware Semantic State Synchronization in Compute-First Networking
**Authors**: Jianpeng Qi, Chao Liu, Chengrui Wang, Rui Wang, Junyu Dong, Yanwei Yu

**Updated**: 2026-01-03T06:22:48Z

**Summary**: In Compute-First Networking (CFN), an Access Point (AP) makes task offloading decisions based on resource state information reported by a Service Node (SN). A fundamental challenge arises from the trade-off between update overhead and decision accuracy: Frequent state updates consume limited network resources, while infrequent updates lead to stale state views and degraded task performance, especially under high system load. Existing approaches based on periodic updates or Age of Information (AoI) mainly focus on temporal freshness and often overlook whether a state change is actually relevant to offloading decisions. This paper proposes SenseCFN, a decision-aware state synchronization framework for CFN. Instead of synchronizing raw resource states, SenseCFN focuses on identifying state changes that are likely to alter offloading decisions. To this end, we introduce a lightweight semantic state representation that captures decision-relevant system characteristics, along with a Semantic Deviation Index (SDI) to quantify the impact of state shifts on decision outcomes. Based on SDI, the SN triggers updates only when significant decision-impacting changes are detected. Meanwhile, the AP performs offloading decisions using cached semantic states with explicit awareness of potential staleness. The update and offloading policies are jointly optimized using a centralized training with distributed execution (CTDE) approach. Simulation results show that SenseCFN maintains a task success rate of up to 99.6% in saturation-prone scenarios, outperforming baseline methods by more than 25%, while reducing status update frequency by approximately 70% to 96%. These results indicate that decision-aware state synchronization provides an effective and practical alternative to purely time-based update strategies in CFN.

### KV-Embedding: Training-free Text Embedding via Internal KV Re-routing in Decoder-only LLMs
**Authors**: Yixuan Tang, Yi Yang

**Updated**: 2026-01-03T02:55:43Z

**Summary**: While LLMs are powerful embedding backbones, their application in training-free settings faces two structural challenges: causal attention restricts early tokens from accessing subsequent context, and the next-token prediction objective biases representations toward generation rather than semantic compression. To address these limitations, we propose KV-Embedding, a framework that activates the latent representation power of frozen LLMs. Our method leverages the observation that the key-value (KV) states of the final token at each layer encode a compressed view of the sequence. By re-routing these states as a prepended prefix, we enable all tokens to access sequence-level context within a single forward pass. To ensure model-agnostic applicability, we introduce an automated layer selection strategy based on intrinsic dimensionality. Evaluations on MTEB across Qwen, Mistral, and Llama backbones show that KV-Embedding outperforms existing training-free baselines by up to 10%, while maintaining robust performance on sequences up to 4,096 tokens. These results demonstrate that internal state manipulation offers an efficient alternative to input modification, and we hope this work encourages further exploration of LLM internals for representation learning.

### Training-free Context-adaptive Attention for Efficient Long Context Modeling
**Authors**: Zeng You, Yaofo Chen, Shuhai Zhang, Zhijie Qiu, Tingyu Wu, Yingjian Li, Yaowei Wang, Mingkui Tan

**Updated**: 2026-01-02T12:55:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. These capabilities stem primarily from the self-attention mechanism, which enables modeling of long-range dependencies. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length poses significant computational and memory challenges, especially as sequence length extends to extremes. While various sparse attention and KV cache compression methods have been proposed to improve efficiency, they often suffer from limitations such as reliance on fixed patterns, inability to handle both prefilling and decoding stages, or the requirement for additional training. In this paper, we propose Training-free Context-adaptive Attention (TCA-Attention), a training-free sparse attention mechanism that selectively attends to only the informative tokens for efficient long-context inference. Our method consists of two lightweight phases: i) an offline calibration phase that determines head-specific sparsity budgets via a single forward pass, and ii) an online token selection phase that adaptively retains core context tokens using a lightweight redundancy metric. TCA-Attention provides a unified solution that accelerates both prefilling and decoding while reducing KV cache memory footprint, without requiring parameter updates or architectural changes. Theoretical analysis shows that our approach maintains bounded approximation error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCA-Attention achieves a 2.8$\times$ speedup and reduces KV cache by 61% at 128K context length while maintaining performance comparable to full attention across various benchmarks, offering a practical plug-and-play solution for efficient long-context inference.

### ROBIN: Incremental Oblique Interleaved ECC for Reliability Improvement in STT-MRAM Caches
**Authors**: Elham Cheshmikhani, Hamed Farbeh, Hossein Asadi

**Updated**: 2026-01-01T19:45:12Z

**Summary**: Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM} (STT-MRAM) is a promising alternative for SRAMs in on-chip cache memories. Besides all its advantages, high error rate in STT-MRAM is a major limiting factor for on-chip cache memories. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive analysis that reveals that the conventional Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) lose their efficiency due to data-dependent error patterns, and then propose an efficient ECC configuration, so-called ROBIN, to improve the correction capability. The evaluations show that the inefficiency of conventional ECC increases the cache error rate by an average of 151.7% while ROBIN reduces this value by more than 28.6x.

### Enhancing Reliability of STT-MRAM Caches by Eliminating Read Disturbance Accumulation
**Authors**: Elham Cheshmikhani, Hamed Farbeh, Hossein Asadi

**Updated**: 2026-01-01T19:22:51Z

**Summary**: Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) as one of the most promising replacements for SRAMs in on-chip cache memories benefits from higher density and scalability, near-zero leakage power, and non-volatility, but its reliability is threatened by high read disturbance error rate. Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) are conventionally suggested to overcome the read disturbance errors in STT-MRAM caches. By employing aggressive ECCs and checking out a cache block on every read access, a high level of cache reliability is achieved. However, to minimize the cache access time in modern processors, all blocks in the target cache set are simultaneously read in parallel for tags comparison operation and only the requested block is sent out, if any, after checking its ECC. These extra cache block reads without checking their ECCs until requesting the blocks by the processor cause the accumulation of read disturbance error, which significantly degrade the cache reliability. In this paper, we first introduce and formulate the read disturbance accumulation phenomenon and reveal that this accumulation due to conventional parallel accesses of cache blocks significantly increases the cache error rate. Then, we propose a simple yet effective scheme, so-called Read Error Accumulation Preventer cache (REAP-cache), to completely eliminate the accumulation of read disturbances without compromising the cache performance. Our evaluations show that the proposed REAP-cache extends the cache Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) by 171x, while increases the cache area by less than 1% and energy consumption by only 2.7%.

### Quantum Algorithm for the Fixed-Radius Neighbor Search
**Authors**: Luca Cappelli, Claudio Sanavio, Alessandro Andrea Zecchi, Giuseppe Murante, Sauro Succi

**Updated**: 2026-01-01T15:41:16Z

**Summary**: Neighbor search is a computationally demanding problem, usually both time- and memory-consuming. The main problem of this kind of algorithms is the long execution time due to cache misses. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm for the Fixed RAdius Neighbor Search problem (FRANS) based on the fixed-point version of Grover's algorithm. We propose an efficient circuit for solving the FRANS with linear query complexity with the number of particles $N$. The quantum circuit returns the list of all the neighbors' pairs within the fixed radius, together with their distance, avoiding the slow down given by cache miss.   We analyzed the gate and the query complexity of the circuit. Our FRANS algorithm presents a query complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N/\sqrt{M})$, where $M$ is the number of solutions, reaching the optimal lower bound of the Grover's algorithm. We propose different implementations of the oracle, which must be chosen depending on the precise structure of the database. Among these, we present an implementation using the Chebyshev distance with depth $\mathcal{O}(q_1)$, where $2^{q_1}$ is the number of grid points used to discretize a spatial dimension. State-of-the-art algorithms for state preparation allow for a trade-off between depth and width of the circuit, with a volume (depth$\times$ width) of $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$. This unfavorable scaling can be brought down to $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(\log N))$ in case of structured datasets. We proposed a stopping criterion based on Bayes interference and tested its validity on $1D$ simulations. Finally, we accounted for the readout complexity and assessed the resilience of the model to the readout error, suggesting an error correction-free strategy to check the accuracy of the results.

### FedSEA-LLaMA: A Secure, Efficient and Adaptive Federated Splitting Framework for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zishuai Zhang, Hainan zhang, Weihua Li, Qinnan zhang, jin Dong, Yongxin Tong, Zhiming Zheng

**Updated**: 2026-01-01T05:45:17Z

**Summary**: Private data holds promise for improving LLMs due to its high quality, but its scattered distribution across data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their deployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based federated split models are proposed, which offload most model parameters to the server (or distributed clients) while retaining only a small portion on the client to ensure data privacy. Despite this design, they still face three challenges: 1) Peer-to-peer key encryption struggles to secure transmitted vectors effectively; 2) The auto-regressive nature of LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially, causing high communication overhead; 3) Fixed partition points lack adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FedSEA-LLaMA, a Secure, Efficient, and Adaptive Federated splitting framework based on LLaMA2. First, we inject Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states to enable secure end-to-end vector transmission. Second, we employ attention-mask compression and KV cache collaboration to reduce communication costs, accelerating training and inference. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points for input/output blocks based on specific task requirements. Experiments on natural language understanding, summarization, and conversational QA tasks show that FedSEA-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2 and achieves up to 8x speedups in training and inference. Further analysis of privacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the effectiveness of FedSEA-LLaMA in security and adaptability.

**Updated**: 2025-12-31T19:08:07Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based language models offer a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) models by enabling parallel and controllable generation. Within this family, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) currently perform best but still underperform AR models in perplexity and lack key inference-time efficiency features, most notably KV caching. We introduce Eso-LMs, a new family of models that fuses AR and MDM paradigms, smoothly interpolating between their perplexities while overcoming their respective limitations. Unlike prior work, which uses transformers with bidirectional attention as MDM denoisers, we exploit the connection between MDMs and Any-Order autoregressive models and adopt causal attention. This design lets us compute the exact likelihood of MDMs for the first time and, crucially, enables us \to introduce KV caching for MDMs while preserving parallel generation for the first time, significantly improving inference efficiency. Combined with an optimized sampling schedule, Eso-LMs achieves a new state of the art on the speed-quality Pareto frontier for unconditional generation. On long contexts, it yields $\mathbf{14 - 65{}\times}$ faster inference than standard MDMs and $\mathbf{3 - 4{}\times}$ faster inference than prior semi-autoregressive approaches. We provide code, model checkpoints, and video tutorials on the project page: http://s-sahoo.github.io/Eso-LMs

**Updated**: 2025-12-31T18:58:19Z

**Summary**: Resource-management tasks in modern operating and distributed systems continue to rely primarily on hand-designed heuristics for tasks such as scheduling, caching, or active queue management. Designing performant heuristics is an expensive, time-consuming process that we are forced to continuously go through due to the constant flux of hardware, workloads and environments.   We propose a new alternative: synthesizing instance-optimal heuristics -- specialized for the exact workloads and hardware where they will be deployed -- using code-generating large language models (LLMs). To make this synthesis tractable, Vulcan separates policy and mechanism through LLM-friendly, task-agnostic interfaces. With these interfaces, users specify the inputs and objectives of their desired policy, while Vulcan searches for performant policies via evolutionary search over LLM-generated code. This interface is expressive enough to capture a wide range of system policies, yet sufficiently constrained to allow even small, inexpensive LLMs to generate correct and executable code.   We use Vulcan to synthesize performant heuristics for cache eviction and memory tiering, and find that these heuristics outperform all human-designed state-of-the-art algorithms by upto 69% and 7.9% in performance for each of these tasks respectively.

### Semantic Parsing with Candidate Expressions for Knowledge Base Question Answering
**Authors**: Daehwan Nam, Gary Geunbae Lee

**Updated**: 2025-12-31T18:45:49Z

**Summary**: Semantic parsers convert natural language to logical forms, which can be evaluated on knowledge bases (KBs) to produce denotations. Recent semantic parsers have been developed with sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) pre-trained language models (PLMs) or large language models, where the models treat logical forms as sequences of tokens. For syntactic and semantic validity, the semantic parsers use grammars that enable constrained decoding. However, the grammars lack the ability to utilize large information of KBs, although logical forms contain representations of KB elements, such as entities or relations. In this work, we propose a grammar augmented with candidate expressions for semantic parsing on a large KB with a seq2seq PLM. The grammar defines actions as production rules, and our semantic parser predicts actions during inference under the constraints by types and candidate expressions. We apply the grammar to knowledge base question answering, where the constraints by candidate expressions assist a semantic parser to generate valid KB elements. We also introduce two special rules, sub-type inference and union types, and a mask caching algorithm. In particular, sub-type inference and the mask caching algorithm greatly increase the decoding speed of our semantic parser. We experimented on two benchmarks, KQA Pro and Overnight, where the constraints by candidate expressions increased the accuracy of our semantic parser, whether it was trained with strong supervision or weak supervision. In addition, our semantic parser had a fast decoding speed in the experiments. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/daehwannam/candexpr-sp.git.

### Adaptive Resource Orchestration for Distributed Quantum Computing Systems
**Authors**: Kuan-Cheng Chen, Felix Burt, Nitish K. Panigrahy, Kin K. Leung

**Updated**: 2025-12-31T14:58:05Z

**Summary**: Scaling quantum computing beyond a single device requires networking many quantum processing units (QPUs) into a coherent quantum-HPC system. We propose the Modular Entanglement Hub (ModEn-Hub) architecture: a hub-and-spoke photonic interconnect paired with a real-time quantum network orchestrator. ModEn-Hub centralizes entanglement sources and shared quantum memory to deliver on-demand, high-fidelity Bell pairs across heterogeneous QPUs, while the control plane schedules teleportation-based non-local gates, launches parallel entanglement attempts, and maintains a small ebit cache. To quantify benefits, we implement a lightweight, reproducible Monte Carlo study under realistic loss and tight round budgets, comparing a naive sequential baseline to an orchestrated policy with logarithmically scaled parallelism and opportunistic caching. Across 1-128 QPUs and 2,500 trials per point, ModEn-Hub-style orchestration sustains about 90% teleportation success while the baseline degrades toward about 30%, at the cost of higher average entanglement attempts (about 10-12 versus about 3). These results provide clear, high-level evidence that adaptive resource orchestration in the ModEn-Hub enables scalable and efficient quantum-HPC operation on near-term hardware.

### MEIC-DT: Memory-Efficient Incremental Clustering for Long-Text Coreference Resolution with Dual-Threshold Constraints
**Authors**: Kangyang Luo, Shuzheng Si, Yuzhuo Bai, Cheng Gao, Zhitong Wang, Cheng Huang, Yingli Shen, Yufeng Han, Wenhao Li, Cunliang Kong, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2025-12-31T08:26:34Z

**Summary**: In the era of large language models (LLMs), supervised neural methods remain the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for Coreference Resolution. Yet, their full potential is underexplored, particularly in incremental clustering, which faces the critical challenge of balancing efficiency with performance for long texts. To address the limitation, we propose \textbf{MEIC-DT}, a novel dual-threshold, memory-efficient incremental clustering approach based on a lightweight Transformer. MEIC-DT features a dual-threshold constraint mechanism designed to precisely control the Transformer's input scale within a predefined memory budget. This mechanism incorporates a Statistics-Aware Eviction Strategy (\textbf{SAES}), which utilizes distinct statistical profiles from the training and inference phases for intelligent cache management. Furthermore, we introduce an Internal Regularization Policy (\textbf{IRP}) that strategically condenses clusters by selecting the most representative mentions, thereby preserving semantic integrity. Extensive experiments on common benchmarks demonstrate that MEIC-DT achieves highly competitive coreference performance under stringent memory constraints.

### ProCache: Constraint-Aware Feature Caching with Selective Computation for Diffusion Transformer Acceleration
**Authors**: Fanpu Cao, Yaofo Chen, Zeng You, Wei Luo, Cen Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-31T06:37:00Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling, yet their high computational cost hinders real-time deployment. While feature caching offers a promising training-free acceleration solution by exploiting temporal redundancy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) uniform caching intervals fail to align with the non-uniform temporal dynamics of DiT, and (2) naive feature reuse with excessively large caching intervals can lead to severe error accumulation. In this work, we analyze the evolution of DiT features during denoising and reveal that both feature changes and error propagation are highly time- and depth-varying. Motivated by this, we propose ProCache, a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that addresses these issues via two core components: (i) a constraint-aware caching pattern search module that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling, tailored to the model's temporal characteristics; and (ii) a selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on PixArt-alpha and DiT demonstrate that ProCache achieves up to 1.96x and 2.90x acceleration with negligible quality degradation, significantly outperforming prior caching-based methods.

### How Would Oblivious Memory Boost Graph Analytics on Trusted Processors?
**Authors**: Jiping Yu, Xiaowei Zhu, Kun Chen, Guanyu Feng, Yunyi Chen, Xiaoyu Fan, Wenguang Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-30T14:28:29Z

**Summary**: Trusted processors provide a way to perform joint computations while preserving data privacy. To overcome the performance degradation caused by data-oblivious algorithms to prevent information leakage, we explore the benefits of oblivious memory (OM) integrated in processors, to which the accesses are unobservable by adversaries. We focus on graph analytics, an important application vulnerable to access-pattern attacks. With a co-design between storage structure and algorithms, our prototype system is 100x faster than baselines given an OM sized around the per-core cache which can be implemented on existing processors with negligible overhead. This gives insights into equipping trusted processors with OM.

### CorGi: Contribution-Guided Block-Wise Interval Caching for Training-Free Acceleration of Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Yonglak Son, Suhyeok Kim, Seungryong Kim, Young Geun Kim

**Updated**: 2025-12-30T12:55:38Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformer (DiT) achieves remarkable performance in visual generation, but its iterative denoising process combined with larger capacity leads to a high inference cost. Recent works have demonstrated that the iterative denoising process of DiT models involves substantial redundant computation across steps. To effectively reduce the redundant computation in DiT, we propose CorGi (Contribution-Guided Block-Wise Interval Caching), training-free DiT inference acceleration framework that selectively reuses the outputs of transformer blocks in DiT across denoising steps. CorGi caches low-contribution blocks and reuses them in later steps within each interval to reduce redundant computation while preserving generation quality. For text-to-image tasks, we further propose CorGi+, which leverages per-block cross-attention maps to identify salient tokens and applies partial attention updates to protect important object details. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art DiT models demonstrates that CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x speedup on average, while preserving high generation quality.

### Lattice: Learning to Efficiently Compress the Memory
**Authors**: Mahdi Karami, Razvan Pascanu, Vahab Mirrokni

**Updated**: 2025-12-30T10:25:28Z

**Summary**: Attention mechanisms have revolutionized sequence learning but suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This paper introduces \model, a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) mechanism that leverages the inherent low-rank structure of K-V matrices to efficiently compress the cache into a fixed number of memory slots, achieving sub-quadratic complexity. We formulate this compression as an online optimization problem and derive a dynamic memory update rule based on a single gradient descent step. The resulting recurrence features a state- and input-dependent gating mechanism, offering an interpretable memory update process. The core innovation is the orthogonal update: each memory slot is updated exclusively with information orthogonal to its current state, hence incorporating only novel, non-redundant data to minimize interference with previously stored information. We derive an efficient computation for this orthogonal update rule and further approximate it with chunk-wise parallelization to ensure training scalability. Empirically, Lattice outperforms strong baselines on language modeling and associative recall tasks across diverse context lengths and model sizes, achieving superior memory efficiency with significantly reduced memory sizes.

### Infinity-RoPE: Action-Controllable Infinite Video Generation Emerges From Autoregressive Self-Rollout
**Authors**: Hidir Yesiltepe, Tuna Han Salih Meral, Adil Kaan Akan, Kaan Oktay, Pinar Yanardag

**Updated**: 2025-12-30T10:14:37Z

**Summary**: Current autoregressive video diffusion models are constrained by three core bottlenecks: (i) the finite temporal horizon imposed by the base model's 3D Rotary Positional Embedding (3D-RoPE), (ii) slow prompt responsiveness in maintaining fine-grained action control during long-form rollouts, and (iii) the inability to realize discontinuous cinematic transitions within a single generation stream. We introduce $\infty$-RoPE, a unified inference-time framework that addresses all three limitations through three interconnected components: Block-Relativistic RoPE, KV Flush, and RoPE Cut. Block-Relativistic RoPE reformulates temporal encoding as a moving local reference frame, where each newly generated latent block is rotated relative to the base model's maximum frame horizon while earlier blocks are rotated backward to preserve relative temporal geometry. This relativistic formulation eliminates fixed temporal positions, enabling continuous video generation far beyond the base positional limits. To obtain fine-grained action control without re-encoding, KV Flush renews the KV cache by retaining only two latent frames, the global sink and the last generated latent frame, thereby ensuring immediate prompt responsiveness. Finally, RoPE Cut introduces controlled discontinuities in temporal RoPE coordinates, enabling multi-cut scene transitions within a single continuous rollout. Together, these components establish $\infty$-RoPE as a training-free foundation for infinite-horizon, controllable, and cinematic video diffusion. Comprehensive experiments show that $\infty$-RoPE consistently surpasses previous autoregressive models in overall VBench scores.

### Bidirectional Sparse Attention for Faster Video Diffusion Training
**Authors**: Chenlu Zhan, Wen Li, Chuyu Shen, Jun Zhang, Suhui Wu, Hao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-30T08:58:30Z

**Summary**: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training, the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full attention.

### CPePC: Cooperative and Predictive Popularity based Caching for Named Data Networks
**Authors**: Pankaj Chaudhary, Neminath Hubballi, Sameer G. Kulkarni

**Updated**: 2025-12-30T08:35:28Z

**Summary**: Caching content is an inherent feature of Named Data Networks. Limited cache capacity of routers warrants that the choice of content being cached is judiciously done. Existing techniques resort to caching popular content to maximize utilization. However, these methods experience significant overhead for coordinating and estimating the popularity of content. To address this issue, in this paper, we present CPePC, which is a cooperative caching technique designed to improve performance. It accomplishes this through a combination of two factors. First, CPePC enhances efficiency by minimizing the overhead of popularity estimation. Second, it forecasts a parameter that governs caching decisions. Efficiency in popularity estimation is achieved by dividing the network into several non-overlapping communities using a community estimation algorithm and selecting a leader node to coordinate this on behalf of all the nodes in the community. CPePC bases its caching decisions by predicting a parameter whose value is estimated using current cache occupancy and the popularity of the content into account. We present algorithms for community detection, leader selection, content popularity estimation, and caching decisions made by the CPePC method. We evaluate and compare it with six other state-of-the-art caching techniques, with simulations performed using a discrete event simulator to show that it outperforms others.

### Causify DataFlow: A Framework For High-performance Machine Learning Stream Computing
**Authors**: Giacinto Paolo Saggese, Paul Smith

**Updated**: 2025-12-30T04:24:04Z

**Summary**: We present DataFlow, a computational framework for building, testing, and deploying high-performance machine learning systems on unbounded time-series data. Traditional data science workflows assume finite datasets and require substantial reimplementation when moving from batch prototypes to streaming production systems. This gap introduces causality violations, batch boundary artifacts, and poor reproducibility of real-time failures.   DataFlow resolves these issues through a unified execution model based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with point-in-time idempotency: outputs at any time t depend only on a fixed-length context window preceding t. This guarantee ensures that models developed in batch mode execute identically in streaming production without code changes. The framework enforces strict causality by automatically tracking knowledge time across all transformations, eliminating future-peeking bugs.   DataFlow supports flexible tiling across temporal and feature dimensions, allowing the same model to operate at different frequencies and memory profiles via configuration alone. It integrates natively with the Python data science stack and provides fit/predict semantics for online learning, caching and incremental computation, and automatic parallelization through DAG-based scheduling. We demonstrate its effectiveness across domains including financial trading, IoT, fraud detection, and real-time analytics.

### Learnable Query Aggregation with KV Routing for Cross-view Geo-localisation
**Authors**: Hualin Ye, Bingxi Liu, Jixiang Du, Yu Qin, Ziyi Chen, Hong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-30T01:51:52Z

**Summary**: Cross-view geo-localisation (CVGL) aims to estimate the geographic location of a query image by matching it with images from a large-scale database. However, the significant view-point discrepancies present considerable challenges for effective feature aggregation and alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CVGL system that incorporates three key improvements. Firstly, we leverage the DINOv2 backbone with a convolution adapter fine-tuning to enhance model adaptability to cross-view variations. Secondly, we propose a multi-scale channel reallocation module to strengthen the diversity and stability of spatial representations. Finally, we propose an improved aggregation module that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing into the feature aggregation process. Specifically, the module dynamically selects expert subspaces for the keys and values in a cross-attention framework, enabling adaptive processing of heterogeneous input domains. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with fewer trained parameters.

### Trellis: Learning to Compress Key-Value Memory in Attention Models
**Authors**: Mahdi Karami, Ali Behrouz, Praneeth Kacham, Vahab Mirrokni

**Updated**: 2025-12-29T20:32:10Z

**Summary**: Transformers, while powerful, suffer from quadratic computational complexity and the ever-growing Key-Value (KV) cache of the attention mechanism. This paper introduces Trellis, a novel Transformer architecture with bounded memory that learns how to compress its key-value memory dynamically at test time. Trellis replaces the standard KV cache with a fixed-size memory and train a two-pass recurrent compression mechanism to store new keys and values into memory. To achieve this, it leverages an online gradient descent procedure with a forget gate, enabling the compressed memory to be updated recursively while learning to retain important contextual information from incoming tokens at test time. Extensive experiments on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive tasks, and time series show that the proposed architecture outperforms strong baselines. Notably, its performance gains increase as the sequence length grows, highlighting its potential for long-context applications.

### Rethinking the Spatio-Temporal Alignment of End-to-End 3D Perception
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Li, Peidong Li, Xian Wu, Long Shi, Dedong Liu, Yitao Wu, Jiajia Fu, Dixiao Cui, Lijun Zhao, Lining Sun

**Updated**: 2025-12-29T17:48:56Z

**Summary**: Spatio-temporal alignment is crucial for temporal modeling of end-to-end (E2E) perception in autonomous driving (AD), providing valuable structural and textural prior information. Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD.

### Adaptable TeaStore

**Updated**: 2025-12-29T14:34:18Z

**Summary**: Modern cloud-native systems require adapting dynamically to changing operational conditions, including service outages, traffic surges, and evolving user requirements. While existing benchmarks provide valuable testbeds for performance and scalability evaluation, they lack explicit support for studying adaptation mechanisms, reconfiguration strategies, and graceful degradation. These limitations hinder systematic research on self-adaptive architectures in realistic cloud environments.   To cover this gap, we introduce Adaptable TeaStore, an extension of the renowned TeaStore architecture that incorporates adaptability as a first-class design concern. Our extension distinguishes between mandatory and optional services, supports multiple component versions -- with varying resource requirements and functionality levels -- considers the outsourcing of functionalities to external providers, and provides local cache mechanisms for performance and resilience. These features enable the systematic exploration of reconfiguration policies across diverse operational scenarios.   We discuss a broad catalogue of reference adaptation scenarios centred around Adaptable TeaStore, useful to evaluate the ability of a given adaptation technology to address conditions such as component unavailability, cyberattacks, provider outages, benign/malicious traffic increases, and user-triggered reconfigurations. Moreover, we present an open-source implementation of the architecture with APIs for metrics collection and adaptation triggers, to enable reproducible experiments.

### Breadcrumbs Reasoning: Memory-Efficient Reasoning with Compression Beacons
**Authors**: Giovanni Monea, Yair Feldman, Shankar Padmanabhan, Kianté Brantley, Yoav Artzi

**Updated**: 2025-12-29T13:06:57Z

**Summary**: The scalability of large language models for long-context reasoning is severely constrained by the linear growth of their Transformer key-value cache, which incurs significant memory and computational costs. We posit that as a model generates reasoning tokens, the informational value of past generated tokens diminishes, creating an opportunity for compression. In this work, we propose to periodically compress the generation KV cache with a learned, special-purpose token and evict compressed entries. We train the model to perform this compression via a modified joint distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Our training method minimizes overhead over the conventional RL process, as it leverages RL outputs for distillation. Empirically, our method achieves a superior memory-accuracy Pareto frontier compared to both the model without cache compression and training-free compression techniques.

### Local Rendezvous Hashing: Bounded Loads and Minimal Churn via Cache-Local Candidates
**Authors**: Yongjie Guan

**Updated**: 2025-12-29T12:52:57Z

**Summary**: Consistent hashing is fundamental to distributed systems, but ring-based schemes can exhibit high peak-to-average load ratios unless they use many virtual nodes, while multi-probe methods improve balance at the cost of scattered memory accesses. This paper introduces Local Rendezvous Hashing (LRH), which preserves a token ring but restricts Highest Random Weight (HRW) selection to a cache-local window of C distinct neighboring physical nodes. LRH locates a key by one binary search, enumerates exactly C distinct candidates using precomputed next-distinct offsets, and chooses the HRW winner (optionally weighted). Lookup cost is O(log|R| + C). Under fixed-topology liveness changes, fixed-candidate filtering remaps only keys whose original winner is down, yielding zero excess churn. In a benchmark with N=5000, V=256 (|R|=1.28M), K=50M and C=8, LRH reduces Max/Avg load from 1.2785 to 1.0947 and achieves 60.05 Mkeys/s, about 6.8x faster than multi-probe consistent hashing with 8 probes (8.80 Mkeys/s) while approaching its balance (Max/Avg 1.0697). A microbenchmark indicates multi-probe assignment is dominated by repeated ring searches and memory traffic rather than probe-generation arithmetic.

### BRkNN-light: Batch Processing of Reverse k-Nearest Neighbor Queries for Moving Objects on Road Networks
**Authors**: Anbang Song, Ziqiang Yu, Wei Liu, Yating Xu, Mingjin Tao

**Updated**: 2025-12-29T08:36:32Z

**Summary**: The Reverse $k$-Nearest Neighbor (R$k$NN) query over moving objects on road networks seeks to find all moving objects that consider the specified query point as one of their $k$ nearest neighbors. In location based services, many users probably submit R$k$NN queries simultaneously. However, existing methods largely overlook how to efficiently process multiple such queries together, missing opportunities to share redundant computations and thus reduce overall processing costs. To address this, this work is the first to explore batch processing of multiple R$k$NN queries, aiming to minimize total computation by sharing duplicate calculations across queries. To tackle this issue, we propose the BR$k$NN-Light algorithm, which uses rapid verification and pruning strategies based on geometric constraints, along with an optimized range search technique, to speed up the process of identifying the R$k$NNs for each query. Furthermore, it proposes a dynamic distance caching mechanism to enable computation reuse when handling multiple queries, thereby significantly reducing unnecessary computations. Experiments on multiple real-world road networks demonstrate the superiority of the BR$k$NN-Light algorithm on the processing of batch queries.

### Atomic-scale spin sensing of a 2D $d$-wave altermagnet via helical tunneling

**Updated**: 2025-12-29T08:22:06Z

**Summary**: Altermagnetism simultaneously possesses nonrelativistic spin responses and zero net magnetization, thus combining advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. This superiority originates from its unique dual feature, i.e., opposite-magnetic sublattices in real space and alternating spin polarization in momentum space enforced by the same crystal symmetry. Therefore, the determination of an altermagnetic order and its unique spin response inherently necessitates atomic-scale spin-resolved measurements in real and momentum spaces, an experimental milestone yet to be achieved. Here, via utilizing the helical edge (hinge) modes of a higher order topological insulator as the spin sensor, we realize spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy which enables us to pin down the dual-space feature of a layered $d$-wave altermagnet, KV$_2$Se$_2$O. In real space, atomic-registered mapping demonstrates the checkerboard antiferromagnetic order together with density-wave lattice modulation, and in momentum space, spin-resolved spectroscopic imaging provides a direct visualization of d-wave spin splitting of the band structure. Critically, using this new topology-guaranteed spin filter we directly reveal the unidirectional, spin-polarized quasiparticle excitations originating from the crystal symmetry-paired X and Y valleys around opposite magnetic sublattices simultaneously --the unique spin response for $d$-wave altermagnetism. Our experiments establish a solid basis for the exploration and utilization of altermagnetism in layered materials and further facilitate access to atomic-scale spin sensing and manipulating of 2D quantum materials.

### ODMA: On-Demand Memory Allocation Framework for LLM Serving on LPDDR-Class Accelerators
**Authors**: Guoqiang Zou, Wanyu Wang, Hao Zheng, Longxiang Yin, Yinhe Han

**Updated**: 2025-12-29T07:47:50Z

**Summary**: Device-memory management is a key bottleneck for serving large language models (LLMs) on accelerators whose memory has poor small-granularity random-access bandwidth (e.g., LPDDR5-class). Existing approaches either statically pre-allocate worst-case KV-cache per request, wasting substantial device memory, or rely on fine-grained paging that assumes high random-access tolerance and is therefore ill-suited to LPDDR-style systems. We present ODMA, an on-demand memory allocation framework for LLM serving on random-access-constrained device memory (RACM) platforms such as LPDDR5-based Cambricon MLUs. ODMA builds on generation-length prediction while addressing distribution drift and heavy-tailed request lengths via dynamic bucket partitioning and a large-bucket safeguard: bucket boundaries are periodically re-learned from online histograms, and high-uncertainty or overflowed requests fall back to a reserved large bucket for robustness. On Alpaca and Google-NQ, ODMA improves S3's predictor accuracy from 98.60% to 99.55% and from 82.68% to 93.36%, respectively. Serving DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B on four Cambricon MLU370-X4 accelerators, ODMA increases device-memory utilization from 55.05% to 72.45% on Alpaca and from 42.54% to 61.79% on Google-NQ, and boosts throughput by 23% and 27% over a static pre-allocation baseline. These results show that predictor-driven, hardware-aware allocation can unlock efficient LLM serving on RACM accelerators without hardware changes, complementing paging-centric designs tailored to HBM systems.

### Plug-and-Play Fidelity Optimization for Diffusion Transformer Acceleration via Cumulative Error Minimization
**Authors**: Tong Shao, Yusen Fu, Guoying Sun, Jingde Kong, Zhuotao Tian, Jingyong Su

**Updated**: 2025-12-29T07:36:36Z

**Summary**: Although Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as a predominant architecture for image and video generation, its iterative denoising process results in slow inference, which hinders broader applicability and development. Caching-based methods achieve training-free acceleration, while suffering from considerable computational error. Existing methods typically incorporate error correction strategies such as pruning or prediction to mitigate it. However, their fixed caching strategy fails to adapt to the complex error variations during denoising, which limits the full potential of error correction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel fidelity-optimization plugin for existing error correction methods via cumulative error minimization, named CEM. CEM predefines the error to characterize the sensitivity of model to acceleration jointly influenced by timesteps and cache intervals. Guided by this prior, we formulate a dynamic programming algorithm with cumulative error approximation for strategy optimization, which achieves the caching error minimization, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation fidelity. CEM is model-agnostic and exhibits strong generalization, which is adaptable to arbitrary acceleration budgets. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing error correction frameworks and quantized models without introducing any additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on nine generation models and quantized methods across three tasks demonstrate that CEM significantly improves generation fidelity of existing acceleration models, and outperforms the original generation performance on FLUX.1-dev, PixArt-$α$, StableDiffusion1.5 and Hunyuan. The code will be made publicly available.

### Knot Forcing: Taming Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models for Real-time Infinite Interactive Portrait Animation
**Authors**: Steven Xiao, Xindi Zhang, Dechao Meng, Qi Wang, Peng Zhang, Bang Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-29T03:22:01Z

**Summary**: Real-time portrait animation is essential for interactive applications such as virtual assistants and live avatars, requiring high visual fidelity, temporal coherence, ultra-low latency, and responsive control from dynamic inputs like reference images and driving signals. While diffusion-based models achieve strong quality, their non-causal nature hinders streaming deployment. Causal autoregressive video generation approaches enable efficient frame-by-frame generation but suffer from error accumulation, motion discontinuities at chunk boundaries, and degraded long-term consistency. In this work, we present a novel streaming framework named Knot Forcing for real-time portrait animation that addresses these challenges through three key designs: (1) a chunk-wise generation strategy with global identity preservation via cached KV states of the reference image and local temporal modeling using sliding window attention; (2) a temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning to smooth inter-chunk motion transitions; and (3) A "running ahead" mechanism that dynamically updates the reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference, keeping its semantic context ahead of the current rollout frame to support long-term coherence. Knot Forcing enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent, and interactive portrait animation over infinite sequences, achieving real-time performance with strong visual stability on consumer-grade GPUs.

### Accelerating Language Model Workflows with Prompt Choreography
**Authors**: TJ Bai, Jason Eisner

**Updated**: 2025-12-28T19:21:11Z

**Summary**: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent workflows. We introduce Prompt Choreography, a framework that efficiently executes LLM workflows by maintaining a dynamic, global KV cache. Each LLM call can attend to an arbitrary, reordered subset of previously encoded messages. Parallel calls are supported. Though caching messages' encodings sometimes gives different results from re-encoding them in a new context, we show in diverse settings that fine-tuning the LLM to work with the cache can help it mimic the original results. Prompt Choreography significantly reduces per-message latency (2.0--6.2$\times$ faster time-to-first-token) and achieves substantial end-to-end speedups ($>$2.2$\times$) in some workflows dominated by redundant computation.

### Attention Is All You Need for KV Cache in Diffusion LLMs
**Authors**: Quan Nguyen-Tri, Mukul Ranjan, Zhiqiang Shen

**Updated**: 2025-12-28T17:27:09Z

**Summary**: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose ${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), and $45.1\times$ on longer sequences, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput ($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

 ### SecureCAI: Injection-Resilient LLM Assistants for Cybersecurity Operations
**Authors**: Mohammed Himayath Ali, Mohammed Aqib Abdullah, Mohammed Mudassir Uddin, Shahnawaz Alam

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:59:45Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models have emerged as transformative tools for Security Operations Centers, enabling automated log analysis, phishing triage, and malware explanation; however, deployment in adversarial cybersecurity environments exposes critical vulnerabilities to prompt injection attacks where malicious instructions embedded in security artifacts manipulate model behavior. This paper introduces SecureCAI, a novel defense framework extending Constitutional AI principles with security-aware guardrails, adaptive constitution evolution, and Direct Preference Optimization for unlearning unsafe response patterns, addressing the unique challenges of high-stakes security contexts where traditional safety mechanisms prove insufficient against sophisticated adversarial manipulation. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SecureCAI reduces attack success rates by 94.7% compared to baseline models while maintaining 95.1% accuracy on benign security analysis tasks, with the framework incorporating continuous red-teaming feedback loops enabling dynamic adaptation to emerging attack strategies and achieving constitution adherence scores exceeding 0.92 under sustained adversarial pressure, thereby establishing a foundation for trustworthy integration of language model capabilities into operational cybersecurity workflows and addressing a critical gap in current approaches to AI safety within adversarial domains.

**Authors**: Ninghui Hao, Xinxing Yang, Boshen Yan, Dong Li, Junzhou Huang, Xintao Wu, Emily S. Ruiz, Arlene Ruiz de Luzuriaga, Chen Zhao, Guihong Wan

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:58:28Z

**Summary**: Spatial omics (SO) technologies enable spatially resolved molecular profiling, while hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) imaging remains the gold standard for morphological assessment in clinical pathology. Recent computational advances increasingly place H&E images at the center of SO analysis, bridging morphology with transcriptomic, proteomic, and other spatial molecular modalities, and pushing resolution toward the single-cell level. In this survey, we systematically review the computational evolution of SO from a histopathology-centered perspective and organize existing methods into three paradigms: integration, which jointly models paired multimodal data; mapping, which infers molecular profiles from H&E images; and foundation models, which learn generalizable representations from large-scale spatial datasets. We analyze how the role of H&E images evolves across these paradigms from spatial context to predictive anchor and ultimately to representation backbone in response to practical constraints such as limited paired data and increasing resolution demands. We further summarize actionable modeling directions enabled by current architectures and delineate persistent gaps driven by data, biology, and technology that are unlikely to be resolved by model design alone. Together, this survey provides a histopathology-centered roadmap for developing and applying computational frameworks in SO.

### Video Generation Models in Robotics -- Applications, Research Challenges, Future Directions
**Authors**: Zhiting Mei, Tenny Yin, Ola Shorinwa, Apurva Badithela, Zhonghe Zheng, Joseph Bruno, Madison Bland, Lihan Zha, Asher Hancock, Jaime Fernández Fisac, Philip Dames, Anirudha Majumdar

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:57:34Z

**Summary**: Video generation models have emerged as high-fidelity models of the physical world, capable of synthesizing high-quality videos capturing fine-grained interactions between agents and their environments conditioned on multi-modal user inputs. Their impressive capabilities address many of the long-standing challenges faced by physics-based simulators, driving broad adoption in many problem domains, e.g., robotics. For example, video models enable photorealistic, physically consistent deformable-body simulation without making prohibitive simplifying assumptions, which is a major bottleneck in physics-based simulation. Moreover, video models can serve as foundation world models that capture the dynamics of the world in a fine-grained and expressive way. They thus overcome the limited expressiveness of language-only abstractions in describing intricate physical interactions. In this survey, we provide a review of video models and their applications as embodied world models in robotics, encompassing cost-effective data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, visual planning, and policy evaluation. Further, we highlight important challenges hindering the trustworthy integration of video models in robotics, which include poor instruction following, hallucinations such as violations of physics, and unsafe content generation, in addition to fundamental limitations such as significant data curation, training, and inference costs. We present potential future directions to address these open research challenges to motivate research and ultimately facilitate broader applications, especially in safety-critical settings.

### A global view of post-interaction white dwarf-main sequence binaries
**Authors**: Cheyanne Shariat, Kareem El-Badry

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:46:39Z

**Summary**: Common-envelope evolution (CEE) is among the most uncertain phases in binary evolution. To empirically constrain CEE, we construct a uniformly selected sample of eclipsing post--common-envelope binaries (PCEBs). Starting from an unresolved white dwarf-main-sequence (WDMS) candidate sample within 200 pc selected from the Gaia color-magnitude diagram, we identify 39 detached eclipsing WDMS binaries using ZTF light curves. The binaries contain cool M dwarfs orbiting warm white dwarfs with orbital periods ($P_{\rm orb}$) of 0.1-2 d. The sample's simple selection function allows us to model observational incompleteness and infer intrinsic properties of the PCEB population. We find an orbital-period distribution consistent with being log-uniform over 0.1-2 d, contrary to recent reports of a bimodal distribution. The companion-mass distribution peaks around $0.25~{\rm M_\odot}$ and declines steeply toward larger masses. The estimated local space density is $7.2\times10^{-5}~{\rm pc^{-3}}$, corresponding to a Galaxy-wide birth rate of 0.01 per year. Combining our results with recent Gaia-based constraints on wider WDMS binaries, we construct an empirical period distribution of post-interaction WDMS binaries spanning 0.1-1000 d. The emerging period distribution is roughly log-flat (d$N/{\rm d}\log P_{\rm orb}\propto P_{\rm orb}^0$) at $P_{\rm orb} < 2$ d and log-increasing (d$N/{\rm d}\log P_{\rm orb}\propto P_{\rm orb}^1$) at $P_{\rm orb} = 100-1000$ d. The 10-100 d regime remains poorly constrained, but a few nearby systems suggest it is also well-populated. Short-period PCEBs ($P_{\rm orb}<2$ d) with M dwarf companions are roughly 2-3 times more common than wide ($P_{\rm orb} = 100-1000$ d) WDMS binaries with FGK companions, which likely formed through stable mass transfer. These results provide direct observational constraints on CEE and an empirical benchmark for binary-population models.

### MixtureVitae: Open Web-Scale Pretraining Dataset With High Quality Instruction and Reasoning Data Built from Permissive-First Text Sources

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:44:30Z

**Summary**: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize legal risk while providing strong downstream performance. MixtureVitae follows a permissive-first, risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions (e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources). MixtureVitae adopts a simple, single-stage pretraining recipe that integrates a large proportion of permissive synthetic instruction and reasoning data-signals typically introduced during post-training and generally scarce in permissive web corpora. We categorize all sources into a three-tier scheme that reflects varying risk levels and provide shard-level provenance metadata to enable risk-aware usage. In controlled experiments using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures and hyperparameters; 50B and 300B token budgets across 130M-1.7B parameters), models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B-parameters/300B-tokens setting, they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM late in training. Performance is particularly strong on MMLU and on math and code benchmarks: a 1.7B model pretrained on 300B MixtureVitae tokens matches or exceeds a strong 1.7B instruction-tuned baseline on GSM8K, HumanEval, and MBPP, despite using over 36 times fewer tokens (300B vs. ~11T). Supported by a thorough decontamination analysis, these results show that permissive-first data with high instruction and reasoning density, tiered by licensing and provenance-related risk, can provide a practical and risk-mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing reliance on broad web scrapes without sacrificing competitiveness.

### The Confidence Trap: Gender Bias and Predictive Certainty in LLMs
**Authors**: Ahmed Sabir, Markus Kängsepp, Rajesh Sharma

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:38:05Z

**Summary**: The increased use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in sensitive domains leads to growing interest in how their confidence scores correspond to fairness and bias. This study examines the alignment between LLM-predicted confidence and human-annotated bias judgments. Focusing on gender bias, the research investigates probability confidence calibration in contexts involving gendered pronoun resolution. The goal is to evaluate if calibration metrics based on predicted confidence scores effectively capture fairness-related disparities in LLMs. The results show that, among the six state-of-the-art models, Gemma-2 demonstrates the worst calibration according to the gender bias benchmark. The primary contribution of this work is a fairness-aware evaluation of LLMs' confidence calibration, offering guidance for ethical deployment. In addition, we introduce a new calibration metric, Gender-ECE, designed to measure gender disparities in resolution tasks.

### StarFlow: Generating Structured Workflow Outputs From Sketch Images
**Authors**: Patrice Bechard, Chao Wang, Amirhossein Abaskohi, Juan Rodriguez, Christopher Pal, David Vazquez, Spandana Gella, Sai Rajeswar, Perouz Taslakian

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:27:42Z

**Summary**: Workflows are a fundamental component of automation in enterprise platforms, enabling the orchestration of tasks, data processing, and system integrations. Despite being widely used, building workflows can be complex, often requiring manual configuration through low-code platforms or visual programming tools. To simplify this process, we explore the use of generative foundation models, particularly vision-language models (VLMs), to automatically generate structured workflows from visual inputs. Translating hand-drawn sketches or computer-generated diagrams into executable workflows is challenging due to the ambiguity of free-form drawings, variations in diagram styles, and the difficulty of inferring execution logic from visual elements. To address this, we introduce StarFlow, a framework for generating structured workflow outputs from sketches using vision-language models. We curate a diverse dataset of workflow diagrams -- including synthetic, manually annotated, and real-world samples -- to enable robust training and evaluation. We finetune and benchmark multiple vision-language models, conducting a series of ablation studies to analyze the strengths and limitations of our approach. Our results show that finetuning significantly enhances structured workflow generation, outperforming large vision-language models on this task.

### Testing subhalo abundance matching with galaxy kinematics
**Authors**: Fedir Boreiko, Tariq Yasin, Harry Desmond, Richard Stiskalek, Matt J. Jarvis

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:17:59Z

**Summary**: The rotation velocities of disc galaxies trace dark matter halo structure, providing direct constraints on the galaxy--halo connection. We construct a Bayesian forward model to connect the dark matter halo population predicted by $Λ$CDM with an observed sample of disc galaxies (SPARC) through their maximum rotation velocities. Our approach combines a subhalo abundance matching scheme (accounting for assembly bias) with a parameterised halo response to galaxy formation. When assuming no correlation between selection in the SPARC survey and halo properties, reproducing the observed velocities requires strong halo expansion, low abundance matching scatter ($<0.15$ dex at $1σ$) and a halo proxy that strongly suppresses the stellar masses in satellite haloes. This is in clear tension with independent clustering constraints. Allowing for SPARC-like galaxies to preferentially populate low $\Vmax$ haloes at fixed virial mass greatly improves the goodness-of-fit and resolves these tensions: the preferred halo response shifts to mild contraction, the abundance matching scatter increases to $\sint = 0.19^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$ dex and the proxy becomes consistent with clustering. However, the inferred selection threshold is extreme, implying that SPARC galaxies occupy the lowest ${\sim}16$ per cent of the $\Vmaxhalo$ distribution at fixed $\Mvir$. Moreover, even with selection, the inferred scatter remains in statistical disagreement with the low-mass clustering constraints, which are most representative of the SPARC galaxies in our sample. Our analysis highlights the advantage of augmenting clustering-based constraints on the galaxy--halo connection with kinematics and suggests a possible tension using current data.

### Learning Through Dialogue: Unpacking the Dynamics of Human-LLM Conversations on Political Issues
**Authors**: Shaz Furniturewala, Gerard Christopher Yeo, Kokil Jaidka

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:10:21Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as conversational partners for learning, yet the interactional dynamics supporting users' learning and engagement are understudied. We analyze the linguistic and interactional features from both LLM and participant chats across 397 human-LLM conversations about socio-political issues to identify the mechanisms and conditions under which LLM explanations shape changes in political knowledge and confidence. Mediation analyses reveal that LLM explanatory richness partially supports confidence by fostering users' reflective insight, whereas its effect on knowledge gain operates entirely through users' cognitive engagement. Moderation analyses show that these effects are highly conditional and vary by political efficacy. Confidence gains depend on how high-efficacy users experience and resolve uncertainty. Knowledge gains depend on high-efficacy users' ability to leverage extended interaction, with longer conversations benefiting primarily reflective users. In summary, we find that learning from LLMs is an interactional achievement, not a uniform outcome of better explanations. The findings underscore the importance of aligning LLM explanatory behavior with users' engagement states to support effective learning in designing Human-AI interactive systems.

### Forecasted Treatment Effects
**Authors**: Irene Botosaru, Raffaella Giacomini, Martin Weidner

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:09:42Z

**Summary**: We consider estimation and inference of the effects of a policy in the absence of an untreated or control group. We obtain unbiased estimators of individual (heterogeneous) treatment effects and a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of the average treatment effect. Our estimator averages, across individuals, the difference between observed post-treatment outcomes and unbiased forecasts of their counterfactuals, based on a (short) time series of pre-treatment data. The paper emphasizes the importance of focusing on forecast unbiasedness rather than accuracy when the end goal is estimation of average treatment effects. We show that simple basis function regressions ensure forecast unbiasedness for a broad class of data generating processes for the counterfactuals. In contrast, forecasting based on a specific parametric model requires stronger assumptions and is prone to misspecification and estimation bias. We show that our method can replicate the findings of some previous empirical studies but it does so without using an untreated or control group.

### Metaphors are a Source of Cross-Domain Misalignment of Large Reasoning Models
**Authors**: Zhibo Hu, Chen Wang, Yanfeng Shu, Hye-young Paik, Liming Zhu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:08:06Z

**Summary**: Earlier research has shown that metaphors influence human's decision making, which raises the question of whether metaphors also influence large language models (LLMs)' reasoning pathways, considering their training data contain a large number of metaphors. In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models. By monitoring these latent features, we design a detector that predict misaligned content with high accuracy.

### Kinship Data Benchmark for Multi-hop Reasoning
**Authors**: Tianda Sun, Dimitar Kazakov

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:07:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to perform multi-hop reasoning, i.e., to combine multiple pieces of information into a coherent inference. We introduce KinshipQA, a benchmark designed to probe this capability through reasoning over kinship relations. The central contribution of our work is a generative pipeline that produces, on demand, large-scale, realistic, and culture-specific genealogical data: collections of interconnected family trees that satisfy explicit marriage constraints associated with different kinship systems. This allows task difficulty, cultural assumptions, and relational depth to be systematically controlled and varied. From these genealogies, we derive textual inference tasks that require reasoning over implicit relational chains. We evaluate the resulting benchmark using six state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning both open-source and closed-source models, under a uniform zero-shot protocol with deterministic decoding. Performance is measured using exact-match and set-based metrics. Our results demonstrate that KinshipQA yields a wide spread of outcomes and exposes systematic differences in multi-hop reasoning across models and cultural settings.

### Non-Convex Portfolio Optimization via Energy-Based Models: A Comparative Analysis Using the Thermodynamic HypergRaphical Model Library (THRML) for Index Tracking
**Authors**: Javier Mancilla, Theodoros D. Bouloumis, Frederic Goguikian

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:04:33Z

**Summary**: Portfolio optimization under cardinality constraints transforms the classical Markowitz mean-variance problem from a convex quadratic problem into an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. This paper introduces a novel approach using THRML (Thermodynamic HypergRaphical Model Library), a JAX-based library for building and sampling probabilistic graphical models that reformulates index tracking as probabilistic inference on an Ising Hamiltonian. Unlike traditional methods that seek a single optimal solution, THRML samples from the Boltzmann distribution of high-quality portfolios using GPU-accelerated block Gibbs sampling, providing natural regularization against overfitting.   We implement three key innovations: (1) dynamic coupling strength that scales inversely with market volatility (VIX), adapting diversification pressure to market regimes; (2) rebalanced bias weights prioritizing tracking quality over momentum for index replication; and (3) sector-aware post-processing ensuring institutional-grade diversification. Backtesting on a 100-stock S and P 500 universe from 2023 to 2025 demonstrates that THRML achieves 4.31 percent annualized tracking error versus 5.66 to 6.30 percent for baselines, while simultaneously generating 128.63 percent total return against the index total return of 79.61 percent. The Diebold-Mariano test confirms statistical significance with p less than 0.0001 across all comparisons. These results position energy-based models as a promising paradigm for portfolio construction, bridging statistical mechanics and quantitative finance.

### Benchmarking Small Language Models and Small Reasoning Language Models on System Log Severity Classification
**Authors**: Yahya Masri, Emily Ma, Zifu Wang, Joseph Rogers, Chaowei Yang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:02:33Z

**Summary**: System logs are crucial for monitoring and diagnosing modern computing infrastructure, but their scale and complexity require reliable and efficient automated interpretation. Since severity levels are predefined metadata in system log messages, having a model merely classify them offers limited standalone practical value, revealing little about its underlying ability to interpret system logs. We argue that severity classification is more informative when treated as a benchmark for probing runtime log comprehension rather than as an end task. Using real-world journalctl data from Linux production servers, we evaluate nine small language models (SLMs) and small reasoning language models (SRLMs) under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) prompting. The results reveal strong stratification. Qwen3-4B achieves the highest accuracy at 95.64% with RAG, while Gemma3-1B improves from 20.25% under few-shot prompting to 85.28% with RAG. Notably, the tiny Qwen3-0.6B reaches 88.12% accuracy despite weak performance without retrieval. In contrast, several SRLMs, including Qwen3-1.7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, degrade substantially when paired with RAG. Efficiency measurements further separate models: most Gemma and Llama variants complete inference in under 1.2 seconds per log, whereas Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning exceeds 228 seconds per log while achieving <10% accuracy. These findings suggest that (1) architectural design, (2) training objectives, and (3) the ability to integrate retrieved context under strict output constraints jointly determine performance. By emphasizing small, deployable models, this benchmark aligns with real-time requirements of digital twin (DT) systems and shows that severity classification serves as a lens for evaluating model competence and real-time deployability, with implications for root cause analysis (RCA) and broader DT integration.

### "TODO: Fix the Mess Gemini Created": Towards Understanding GenAI-Induced Self-Admitted Technical Debt
**Authors**: Abdullah Al Mujahid, Mia Mohammad Imran

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:59:34Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and Gemini become integrated into software development workflows, developers increasingly leave traces of AI involvement in their code comments. Among these, some comments explicitly acknowledge both the use of generative AI and the presence of technical shortcomings. Analyzing 6,540 LLM-referencing code comments from public Python and JavaScript-based GitHub repositories (November 2022-July 2025), we identified 81 that also self-admit technical debt(SATD). Developers most often describe postponed testing, incomplete adaptation, and limited understanding of AI-generated code, suggesting that AI assistance affects both when and why technical debt emerges. We term GenAI-Induced Self-admitted Technical debt (GIST) as a proposed conceptual lens to describe recurring cases where developers incorporate AI-generated code while explicitly expressing uncertainty about its behavior or correctness.

### Beyond Single-Shot: Multi-step Tool Retrieval via Query Planning
**Authors**: Wei Fang, James Glass

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:58:39Z

**Summary**: LLM agents operating over massive, dynamic tool libraries rely on effective retrieval, yet standard single-shot dense retrievers struggle with complex requests. These failures primarily stem from the disconnect between abstract user goals and technical documentation, and the limited capacity of fixed-size embeddings to model combinatorial tool compositions. To address these challenges, we propose TOOLQP, a lightweight framework that models retrieval as iterative query planning. Instead of single-shot matching, TOOLQP decomposes instructions into sub-tasks and dynamically generates queries to interact with the retriever, effectively bridging the semantic gap by targeting the specific sub-tasks required for composition. We train TOOLQP using synthetic query trajectories followed by optimization via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Experiments demonstrate that TOOLQP achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization, robustness across diverse retrievers, and significant improvements in downstream agentic execution.

### Enhancing Self-Correction in Large Language Models through Multi-Perspective Reflection
**Authors**: Mariana Costa, Alberlucia Rafael Soarez, Daniel Kim, Camila Ferreira

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:57:05Z

**Summary**: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting advances LLM reasoning, challenges persist in consistency, accuracy, and self-correction, especially for complex or ethically sensitive tasks. Existing single-dimensional reflection methods offer insufficient improvements. We propose MyGO Poly-Reflective Chain-of-Thought (PR-CoT), a novel methodology employing structured multi-perspective reflection. After initial CoT, PR-CoT guides the LLM to self-assess its reasoning across multiple predefined angles: logical consistency, information completeness, biases/ethics, and alternative solutions. Implemented purely via prompt engineering, this process refines the initial CoT into a more robust and accurate final answer without model retraining. Experiments across arithmetic, commonsense, ethical decision-making, and logical puzzles, using GPT-three point five and GPT-four models, demonstrate PR-CoT's superior performance. It significantly outperforms traditional CoT and existing reflection methods in logical consistency and error correction, with notable gains in nuanced domains like ethical decision-making. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and qualitative analyses further validate the contribution of each reflection perspective and the overall efficacy of our poly-reflective paradigm in fostering more reliable LLM reasoning.

### DT-ICU: Towards Explainable Digital Twins for ICU Patient Monitoring via Multi-Modal and Multi-Task Iterative Inference
**Authors**: Wen Guo

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:54:19Z

**Summary**: We introduce DT-ICU, a multimodal digital twin framework for continuous risk estimation in intensive care. DT-ICU integrates variable-length clinical time series with static patient information in a unified multitask architecture, enabling predictions to be updated as new observations accumulate over the ICU stay. We evaluate DT-ICU on the large, publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset, where it consistently outperforms established baseline models under different evaluation settings. Our test-length analysis shows that meaningful discrimination is achieved shortly after admission, while longer observation windows further improve the ranking of high-risk patients in highly imbalanced cohorts. To examine how the model leverages heterogeneous data sources, we perform systematic modality ablations, revealing that the model learnt a reasonable structured reliance on interventions, physiological response observations, and contextual information. These analyses provide interpretable insights into how multimodal signals are combined and how trade-offs between sensitivity and precision emerge. Together, these results demonstrate that DT-ICU delivers accurate, temporally robust, and interpretable predictions, supporting its potential as a practical digital twin framework for continuous patient monitoring in critical care. The source code and trained model weights for DT-ICU are publicly available at https://github.com/GUO-W/DT-ICU-release.

### Towards Mitigating Excessive Forgetting in LLM Unlearning via Entanglement-Guidance with Proxy Constraint
**Authors**: Zhihao Liu, Jian Lou, Yuke Hu, Xiaochen Li, Yitian Chen, Tailun Chen, Zhizhen Qin, Kui Ren, Zhan Qin

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:50:04Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns, data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific data without full retraining. However, most existing methods still suffer from over-unlearning due to the lack of a principled mechanism to regulate the forgetting boundary, leading to unnecessary utility degradation and heightened privacy and robustness risks. In this work, we propose EGUP (Entanglement-Guided Unlearning with Proxy Constraint), a novel framework that leverages entanglement and proxy constraint to guide the unlearning process while mitigating over-unlearning. Within each iteration, EGUP employs inter-sample entanglement to adaptively reweight the unlearning strength, assigning greater unlearning efforts to forget samples that are semantically closer to retained knowledge. Across iterations, EGUP leverages intra-sample entanglement to track the representation shift of each forget sample and dynamically adjust its unlearning effort. In addition, we incorporate a proxy constraint that approximates the model's expected outputs after unlearning, forming a reference boundary that softly regularizes the unlearning process. EGUP is compatible with existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement. We evaluate EGUP on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements in the unlearning-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Moreover, EGUP achieves performance close to the retrained model while remaining scalable and robust.

### THETA: Triangulated Hand-State Estimation for Teleoperation and Automation in Robotic Hand Control
**Authors**: Alex Huang, Akshay Karthik

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:50:02Z

**Summary**: The teleoperation of robotic hands is limited by the high costs of depth cameras and sensor gloves, commonly used to estimate hand relative joint positions (XYZ). We present a novel, cost-effective approach using three webcams for triangulation-based tracking to approximate relative joint angles (theta) of human fingers. We also introduce a modified DexHand, a low-cost robotic hand from TheRobotStudio, to demonstrate THETA's real-time application. Data collection involved 40 distinct hand gestures using three 640x480p webcams arranged at 120-degree intervals, generating over 48,000 RGB images. Joint angles were manually determined by measuring midpoints of the MCP, PIP, and DIP finger joints. Captured RGB frames were processed using a DeepLabV3 segmentation model with a ResNet-50 backbone for multi-scale hand segmentation. The segmented images were then HSV-filtered and fed into THETA's architecture, consisting of a MobileNetV2-based CNN classifier optimized for hierarchical spatial feature extraction and a 9-channel input tensor encoding multi-perspective hand representations. The classification model maps segmented hand views into discrete joint angles, achieving 97.18% accuracy, 98.72% recall, F1 Score of 0.9274, and a precision of 0.8906. In real-time inference, THETA captures simultaneous frames, segments hand regions, filters them, and compiles a 9-channel tensor for classification. Joint-angle predictions are relayed via serial to an Arduino, enabling the DexHand to replicate hand movements. Future research will increase dataset diversity, integrate wrist tracking, and apply computer vision techniques such as OpenAI-Vision. THETA potentially ensures cost-effective, user-friendly teleoperation for medical, linguistic, and manufacturing applications.

### Are LLM Decisions Faithful to Verbal Confidence?
**Authors**: Jiawei Wang, Yanfei Zhou, Siddartha Devic, Deqing Fu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:49:51Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce surprisingly sophisticated estimates of their own uncertainty. However, it remains unclear to what extent this expressed confidence is tied to the reasoning, knowledge, or decision making of the model. To test this, we introduce $\textbf{RiskEval}$: a framework designed to evaluate whether models adjust their abstention policies in response to varying error penalties. Our evaluation of several frontier models reveals a critical dissociation: models are neither cost-aware when articulating their verbal confidence, nor strategically responsive when deciding whether to engage or abstain under high-penalty conditions. Even when extreme penalties render frequent abstention the mathematically optimal strategy, models almost never abstain, resulting in utility collapse. This indicates that calibrated verbal confidence scores may not be sufficient to create trustworthy and interpretable AI systems, as current models lack the strategic agency to convert uncertainty signals into optimal and risk-sensitive decisions.

### Contrastive Learning with Narrative Twins for Modeling Story Salience
**Authors**: Igor Sterner, Alex Lascarides, Frank Keller

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:48:46Z

**Summary**: Understanding narratives requires identifying which events are most salient for a story's progression. We present a contrastive learning framework for modeling narrative salience that learns story embeddings from narrative twins: stories that share the same plot but differ in surface form. Our model is trained to distinguish a story from both its narrative twin and a distractor with similar surface features but different plot. Using the resulting embeddings, we evaluate four narratologically motivated operations for inferring salience (deletion, shifting, disruption, and summarization). Experiments on short narratives from the ROCStories corpus and longer Wikipedia plot summaries show that contrastively learned story embeddings outperform a masked-language-model baseline, and that summarization is the most reliable operation for identifying salient sentences. If narrative twins are not available, random dropout can be used to generate the twins from a single story. Effective distractors can be obtained either by prompting LLMs or, in long-form narratives, by using different parts of the same story.

### Free-RBF-KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Adaptive Radial Basis Functions for Efficient Function Learning
**Authors**: Shao-Ting Chiu, Siu Wun Cheung, Ulisses Braga-Neto, Chak Shing Lee, Rui Peng Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:45:31Z

**Summary**: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have shown strong potential for efficiently approximating complex nonlinear functions. However, the original KAN formulation relies on B-spline basis functions, which incur substantial computational overhead due to De Boor's algorithm. To address this limitation, recent work has explored alternative basis functions such as radial basis functions (RBFs) that can improve computational efficiency and flexibility. Yet, standard RBF-KANs often sacrifice accuracy relative to the original KAN design. In this work, we propose Free-RBF-KAN, a RBF-based KAN architecture that incorporates adaptive learning grids and trainable smoothness to close this performance gap. Our method employs freely learnable RBF shapes that dynamically align grid representations with activation patterns, enabling expressive and adaptive function approximation. Additionally, we treat smoothness as a kernel parameter optimized jointly with network weights, without increasing computational complexity. We provide a general universality proof for RBF-KANs, which encompasses our Free-RBF-KAN formulation. Through a broad set of experiments, including multiscale function approximation, physics-informed machine learning, and PDE solution operator learning, Free-RBF-KAN achieves accuracy comparable to the original B-spline-based KAN while delivering faster training and inference. These results highlight Free-RBF-KAN as a compelling balance between computational efficiency and adaptive resolution, particularly for high-dimensional structured modeling tasks.

### Structure First, Reason Next: Enhancing a Large Language Model using Knowledge Graph for Numerical Reasoning in Financial Documents
**Authors**: Aryan Mishra, Akash Anil

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:39:08Z

**Summary**: Numerical reasoning is an important task in the analysis of financial documents. It helps in understanding and performing numerical predictions with logical conclusions for the given query seeking answers from financial texts. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in multiple Question-Answering (Q-A) systems with the capability of logical reasoning. As documents related to finance often consist of long and complex financial contexts, LLMs appear well-suited for building high-quality automated financial question-answering systems. However, LLMs often face challenges in accurately processing the various numbers within financial reports. Extracting numerical data from unstructured text and semi-structured tables, and reliably performing accurate calculations, remains a significant bottleneck for numerical reasoning in most state-of-the-art LLMs. Recent studies have shown that structured data augmentations, such as Knowledge Graphs (KGs), have notably improved the predictions of LLMs along with logical explanations. Thus, it is an important requirement to consider inherent structured information in financial reports while using LLMs for various financial analytics. This paper proposes a framework to incorporate structured information using KGs along with LLM predictions for numerical reasoning tasks. The KGs are extracted using a proposed schema inherently from the document under processing. We evaluated our proposed framework over the benchmark data FinQA, using an open-source LLM, namely Llama 3.1 8B Instruct. We observed that the proposed framework improved execution accuracy by approximately 12% relative to the vanilla LLM.

### Cost-Awareness in Tree-Search LLM Planning: A Systematic Study
**Authors**: Zihao Zhang, Hui Wei, Kenan Jiang, Shijia Pan, Shu Kai, Fei Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:29:58Z

**Summary**: Planning under resource constraints is central to real-world decision making, yet most large language model (LLM) planners assume uniform action costs. We systematically analyze whether tree-search LLM planners are cost-aware and whether they efficiently generate budget-feasible plans. In contrast to black-box prompting, explicit search trees expose intermediate decisions, node evaluations, and failure modes, which allows for controlled ablations of planner behavior. We study depth-first search, breadth-first search, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and bidirectional search within a unified framework. Our experiments show that existing tree-based LLM planners often struggle to find cost-optimal plans, and that additional search computation does not reliably improve optimality. Among the methods evaluated, bidirectional search achieves the best overall efficiency and success rate. MCTS achieves the highest optimality on short-horizon tasks. Tree-search planners are especially valuable for studying LLM planning because their reasoning steps are explicit, in contrast to plain LLMs that internalize planning dynamics through post-training trajectories. Our findings suggest that improving LLM planning under resource constraints will likely require new search algorithms, rather than solely scaling inference-time compute.

### Systematic Biases in Gravitational-Wave Parameter Estimation from Neglecting Orbital Eccentricity in Space-Based Detectors
**Authors**: Jin-Zhao Yang, Jia-Hao Zhong, Tao Yang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:18:16Z

**Summary**: Accurate modeling of gravitational-wave signals is essential for reliable inference of compact-binary source parameters, particularly for future space-based detectors operating in the milli- and deci-Hertz bands. In this work, we systematically investigate the parameter-estimation biases induced by neglecting orbital eccentricity when analyzing eccentric compact-binary coalescences with quasi-circular waveform templates. Focusing on the deci-Hertz detector B-DECIGO and the milli-Hertz detector LISA, we model eccentric inspiral signals using a frequency-domain waveform that incorporates eccentricity-induced higher harmonics and the time-dependent response of spaceborne detectors. We quantify systematic biases in the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, and luminosity distance using both Bayesian inference and the Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri (FCV) formalism, and assess their significance relative to statistical uncertainties. By constructing mock gravitational-wave catalogs spanning stellar-mass and massive black-hole binaries, we identify critical initial eccentricities at which systematic errors become comparable to statistical errors. We find that for B-DECIGO, even very small eccentricities, $e_0\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ at 0.1 Hz, can lead to significant biases, whereas for LISA such effects typically arise at larger eccentricities, $e_0\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ at $10^{-4}$ Hz, due to the smaller number of in-band cycles. Comparisons between FCV predictions and full Bayesian analyses demonstrate good agreement within the regime where waveform mismatches remain small, especially when extrinsic parameters are pre-aligned to minimize mismatches. Our results highlight the necessity of incorporating eccentricity in waveform models for future space-based gravitational-wave observations.

### Rotation-dependent $I$-Love-$Q$-$δM$ relations in perturbation theory
**Authors**: Eneko Aranguren

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:12:09Z

**Summary**: The so-called $I$-Love-$Q$ relations link some normalized versions of the moment of inertia, the Love number, and the quadrupole moment of a star. These relations, in principle, enable the inference of two of the quantities given the third. However, their use has been limited because the normalized versions of the multipole moments rely on the static mass derived from the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, which is not directly observable. In this work, using perturbation theory, we find that the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations can also be formulated in terms of an alternative set of normalized quantities that do not depend on the static mass, but on the actual (observable) mass.

### Learning the relations between neutron star and nuclear matter properties with symbolic regression
**Authors**: N. K. Patra, Tuhin Malik, Kai Zhou, Constança Providência

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T16:58:40Z

**Summary**: The equation of state (EOS) of dense matter in neutron stars (NSs) remains uncertain, particularly at supra-nuclear densities where complex nuclear interactions and the potential presence of exotic matter, like hyperons, come into play. The complex relationships existing between nuclear matter and neutron star properties are investigated. The focus is on their nonlinearities and interdependencies. In our analysis, we apply a machine learning algorithm known as symbolic regression, paired with principal component analysis, to datasets generated from Bayesian inference over relativistic mean-field models. A systematic Principal Component Analysis has allowed to break down the percentage contribution of each element or feature in the relationships obtained. This study examines two main models (datasets): the NL model, which includes nucleonic degrees of freedom; and the NL-hyp model, which includes hyperons in addition to nucleons. Our analysis confirms a robust correlation between the tidal deformability of a 1.4 \(M_\odot\) neutron star and $β$-equilibrium pressure at twice the nuclear saturation density. This correlation remains once hyperons are included. The contribution of the different nuclear matter properties at saturation to the radius and tidal deformability was calculated. It was shown that the isovector properties have the largest impact, with a contribution of about 90\%. We also studied the relationship between the proton fraction at different densities and various symmetry energy parameters defined at saturation density. For the hyperon data set, we took into account the effects of the negatively charged hyperon $Ξ$ in order to recover the relationships. Our study reveals the individual impact of various symmetry energy parameters on proton fractions at different densities.

### Nonlinear anisotropic equilibrium reconstruction in axisymmetric magnetic mirrors

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T16:57:13Z

**Summary**: Magnetic equilibrium reconstruction is a crucial simulation capability for interpreting diagnostic measurements of experimental plasmas. Equilibrium reconstruction has mostly been applied to systems with isotropic pressure and relatively low plasma $β= 2μ_0p/B^2$. This work extends nonlinear equilibrium reconstruction to high-$β$ plasmas with anisotropic pressure and applies it to the Wisconsin High Temperature Superconducting Axisymmetric Magnetic Mirror experiments to infer the presence of sloshing ions. A novel basis set for the plasma profiles and machine learning algorithm using scalable constrained Bayesian optimization allow accurate nonlinear reconstructions with uncertainty quantification to be made more quickly with fewer experimental diagnostics and improves the robustness of reconstructions at high $β$. In addition to WHAM and other mirrors, such reconstruction techniques are potentially attractive in high-performance devices with constrained diagnostic capabilities such as fusion power plants.

### Multi-Physics Bayesian Analysis of Neutron Star Crust Using Relativistic Mean-Field Model
**Authors**: Vishal Parmar, Ignazio Bombaci

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T16:54:46Z

**Summary**: We study the properties of neutron-star crust within a Bayesian framework based on a unified relativistic mean-field (RMF) description of dense matter. The analysis focuses on the posterior distributions of crust properties, constrained by nuclear experimental data, chiral effective field theory, and multimessenger neutron-star observations. In the inference, the outer crust is fixed using the AME2020 nuclear mass table, supplemented by Hartree--Fock--Bogoliubov mass models, while the inner crust is described using a compressible liquid-drop model consistently coupled to the RMF interaction. The same RMF framework is used to describe the uniform core, ensuring a unified treatment across all density regimes. From the resulting posteriors, we extract key crustal observables, including the crust--core transition density and pressure, crust thickness, crust mass, and the fractional crustal moment of inertia. We find that the transition density is primarily governed by the symmetry-energy slope $L$ and curvature $K_{\rm sym}$ evaluated at sub-saturation densities, while the transition pressure plays a central role in determining global crustal properties. The inner-crust equation of state reflects a collective interplay between isovector nuclear-matter properties rather than a dependence on any single parameter. We also assess the impact of using matched crust--core constructions and show that they can introduce systematic differences in predicted neutron-star properties when compared with fully unified treatments.

### Is Agentic RAG worth it? An experimental comparison of RAG approaches
**Authors**: Pietro Ferrazzi, Milica Cvjeticanin, Alessio Piraccini, Davide Giannuzzi

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T16:43:44Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are usually defined by the combination of a generator and a retrieval component that extracts textual context from a knowledge base to answer user queries. However, such basic implementations exhibit several limitations, including noisy or suboptimal retrieval, misuse of retrieval for out-of-scope queries, weak query-document matching, and variability or cost associated with the generator. These shortcomings have motivated the development of "Enhanced" RAG, where dedicated modules are introduced to address specific weaknesses in the workflow. More recently, the growing self-reflective capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new paradigm, which we refer to as "Agentic" RAG. In this approach, the LLM orchestrates the entire process-deciding which actions to perform, when to perform them, and whether to iterate-thereby reducing reliance on fixed, manually engineered modules. Despite the rapid adoption of both paradigms, it remains unclear which approach is preferable under which conditions. In this work, we conduct an extensive, empirically driven evaluation of Enhanced and Agentic RAG across multiple scenarios and dimensions. Our results provide practical insights into the trade-offs between the two paradigms, offering guidance on selecting the most effective RAG design for real-world applications, considering both costs and performance.

### Error mitigation for logical circuits using decoder confidence
**Authors**: Maria Dincă, Tim Chan, Simon C. Benjamin

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T16:33:16Z

**Summary**: Fault-tolerant quantum computers use decoders to monitor for errors and find a plausible correction. A decoder may provide a decoder confidence score (DCS) to gauge its success. We adopt a swim distance DCS, computed from the shortest path between syndrome clusters. By contracting tensor networks, we compare its performance to the well-known complementary gap and find that both reliably estimate the logical error probability (LEP) in a decoding window. We explore ways to use this to mitigate the LEP in entire circuits. For shallow circuits, we just abort if any decoding window produces an exceptionally low DCS: for a distance-13 surface code, rejecting a mere 0.1% of possible DCS values improves the entire circuit's LEP by more than 5 orders of magnitude. For larger algorithms comprising up to trillions of windows, DCS-based rejection remains effective for enhancing observable estimation. Moreover, one can use DCS to assign each circuit's output a unique LEP, and use it as a basis for maximum likelihood inference. This can reduce the effects of noise by an order of magnitude at no quantum cost; methods can be combined for further improvements.

### Exploring the Meta-level Reasoning of Large Language Models via a Tool-based Multi-hop Tabular Question Answering Task
**Authors**: Nick Ferguson, Alan Bundy, Kwabena Nuamah

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T16:29:21Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly focused on "reasoning" ability, a concept with many overlapping definitions in the LLM discourse. We take a more structured approach, distinguishing meta-level reasoning (denoting the process of reasoning about intermediate steps required to solve a task) from object-level reasoning (which concerns the low-level execution of the aforementioned steps.) We design a novel question answering task, which is based around the values of geopolitical indicators for various countries over various years. Questions require breaking down into intermediate steps, retrieval of data, and mathematical operations over that data. The meta-level reasoning ability of LLMs is analysed by examining the selection of appropriate tools for answering questions. To bring greater depth to the analysis of LLMs beyond final answer accuracy, our task contains 'essential actions' against which we can compare the tool call output of LLMs to infer the strength of reasoning ability. We find that LLMs demonstrate good meta-level reasoning on our task, yet are flawed in some aspects of task understanding. We find that n-shot prompting has little effect on accuracy; error messages encountered do not often deteriorate performance; and provide additional evidence for the poor numeracy of LLMs. Finally, we discuss the generalisation and limitation of our findings to other task domains.

### Leveraging 3D Representation Alignment and RGB Pretrained Priors for LiDAR Scene Generation
**Authors**: Nicolas Sereyjol-Garros, Ellington Kirby, Victor Besnier, Nermin Samet

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T16:20:20Z

**Summary**: LiDAR scene synthesis is an emerging solution to scarcity in 3D data for robotic tasks such as autonomous driving. Recent approaches employ diffusion or flow matching models to generate realistic scenes, but 3D data remains limited compared to RGB datasets with millions of samples. We introduce R3DPA, the first LiDAR scene generation method to unlock image-pretrained priors for LiDAR point clouds, and leverage self-supervised 3D representations for state-of-the-art results. Specifically, we (i) align intermediate features of our generative model with self-supervised 3D features, which substantially improves generation quality; (ii) transfer knowledge from large-scale image-pretrained generative models to LiDAR generation, mitigating limited LiDAR datasets; and (iii) enable point cloud control at inference for object inpainting and scene mixing with solely an unconditional model. On the KITTI-360 benchmark R3DPA achieves state of the art performance. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/valeoai/R3DPA.

### Causal Inference for Experiments with Latent Outcomes: Key Results and Their Implications for Design and Analysis
**Authors**: Jiawei Fu, Donald P. Green

**Summary**: How should researchers analyze randomized experiments in which the main outcome is latent and measured in multiple ways but each measure contains some degree of error? We first identify a critical study-specific noncomparability problem in existing methods for handling multiple measurements, which often rely on strong modeling assumptions or arbitrary standardization. Such approaches render the resulting estimands noncomparable across studies. To address the problem, we describe design-based approaches that enable researchers to identify causal parameters of interest, suggest ways that experimental designs can be augmented so as to make assumptions more credible, and discuss empirical tests of key assumptions. We show that when experimental researchers invest appropriately in multiple outcome measures, an optimally weighted scaled index of these measures enables researchers to obtain efficient and interpretable estimates of causal parameters by applying standard regression. An empirical application illustrates the gains in precision and robustness that multiple outcome measures can provide.

### MoE3D: A Mixture-of-Experts Module for 3D Reconstruction
**Authors**: Zichen Wang, Ang Cao, Liam J. Wang, Jeong Joon Park

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:58:03Z

**Summary**: We propose a simple yet effective approach to enhance the performance of feed-forward 3D reconstruction models. Existing methods often struggle near depth discontinuities, where standard regression losses encourage spatial averaging and thus blur sharp boundaries. To address this issue, we introduce a mixture-of-experts formulation that handles uncertainty at depth boundaries by combining multiple smooth depth predictions. A softmax weighting head dynamically selects among these hypotheses on a per-pixel basis. By integrating our mixture model into a pre-trained state-of-the-art 3D model, we achieve a substantial reduction of boundary artifacts and gains in overall reconstruction accuracy. Notably, our approach is highly compute efficient, delivering generalizable improvements even when fine-tuned on a small subset of training data while incurring only negligible additional inference computation, suggesting a promising direction for lightweight and accurate 3D reconstruction.

### The Role of Confounders and Linearity in Ecological Inference: A Reassessment
**Authors**: Shiro Kuriwaki, Cory McCartan

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:51:07Z

**Summary**: Estimating conditional means using only the marginal means available from aggregate data is commonly known as the ecological inference problem (EI). We provide a reassessment of EI, including a new formalization of identification conditions and a demonstration of how these conditions fail to hold in common cases. The identification conditions reveal that, similar to causal inference, credible ecological inference requires controlling for confounders. The aggregation process itself creates additional structure to assist in estimation by restricting the conditional expectation function to be linear in the predictor variable. A linear model perspective also clarifies the differences between the EI methods commonly used in the literature, and when they lead to ecological fallacies. We provide an overview of new methodology which builds on both the identification and linearity results to flexibly control for confounders and yield improved ecological inferences. Finally, using datasets for common EI problems in which the ground truth is fortuitously observed, we show that, while covariates can help, all methods are prone to overestimating both racial polarization and nationalized partisan voting.

### Adaptive Layer Selection for Layer-Wise Token Pruning in LLM Inference
**Authors**: Rei Taniguchi, Yuyang Dong, Makoto Onizuka, Chuan Xiao

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:47:35Z

**Summary**: Due to the prevalence of large language models (LLMs), key-value (KV) cache reduction for LLM inference has received remarkable attention. Among numerous works that have been proposed in recent years, layer-wise token pruning approaches, which select a subset of tokens at particular layers to retain in KV cache and prune others, are one of the most popular schemes. They primarily adopt a set of pre-defined layers, at which tokens are selected. Such design is inflexible in the sense that the accuracy significantly varies across tasks and deteriorates in harder tasks such as KV retrieval. In this paper, we propose ASL, a training-free method that adaptively chooses the selection layer for KV cache reduction, exploiting the variance of token ranks ordered by attention score. The proposed method balances the performance across different tasks while meeting the user-specified KV budget requirement. ASL operates during the prefilling stage and can be jointly used with existing KV cache reduction methods such as SnapKV to optimize the decoding stage. By evaluations on the InfiniteBench, RULER, and NIAH benchmarks, we show that equipped with one-shot token selection, where tokens are selected at a layer and propagated to deeper layers, ASL outperforms state-of-the-art layer-wise token selection methods in accuracy while maintaining decoding speed and KV cache reduction.

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:34:55Z

**Summary**: Thermodynamic profiles from X-ray and millimetre observations of galaxy clusters are often compared under the simplifying assumptions of smooth, spherically symmetric intracluster medium. These approximations lead to expected discrepancies in the inferred profiles, which can provide insights about the cluster structure or cosmology. Motivated by this, we present a joint XMM-\textit{Newton} and \textit{Planck} analysis of 116 CHEX-MATE clusters to measure $η_T = T_X/T_{SZ,X}$, the ratio between spectroscopic X-ray temperatures and a temperature proxy derived from Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) pressures and X-ray densities. We considered relativistic corrections to the thermal SZ signal and implemented X-ray absorption by Galactic molecular hydrogen. The $η_T$ distribution has a mean of $1.01 \pm 0.03$, with average changes of $8.1\%$ and $2.7\%$ when relativistic corrections and molecular hydrogen absorption are not included, respectively. The $η_T$ distribution is positively skewed, with the scatter mostly affected by cluster morphology: relaxed clusters are closer to unity and less scattered than mixed and disturbed systems. We find little or no correlation with redshift, mass, or temperature.

### The Shape of Markets: Machine learning modeling and Prediction Using 2-Manifold Geometries
**Authors**: Panagiotis G. Papaioannou, Athanassios N. Yannacopoulos

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:32:30Z

**Summary**: We introduce a Geometry Informed Model for financial forecasting by embedding high dimensional market data onto constant curvature 2manifolds. Guided by the uniformization theorem, we model market dynamics as Brownian motion on spherical S2, Euclidean R2, and hyperbolic H2 geometries. We further include the torus T, a compact, flat manifold admissible as a quotient space of the Euclidean plane anticipating its relevance for capturing cyclical dynamics. Manifold learning techniques infer the latent curvature from financial data, revealing the torus as the best performing geometry. We interpret this result through a macroeconomic lens, the torus circular dimensions align with endogenous cycles in output, interest rates, and inflation described by IS LM theory. Our findings demonstrate the value of integrating differential geometry with data-driven inference for financial modeling.

### Order in the Evaluation Court: A Critical Analysis of NLG Evaluation Trends

**Summary**: Despite advances in Natural Language Generation (NLG), evaluation remains challenging. Although various new metrics and LLM-as-a-judge (LaaJ) methods are proposed, human judgment persists as the gold standard. To systematically review how NLG evaluation has evolved, we employ an automatic information extraction scheme to gather key information from NLG papers, focusing on different evaluation methods (metrics, LaaJ and human evaluation). With extracted metadata from 14,171 papers across four major conferences (ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and INLG) over the past six years, we reveal several critical findings: (1) Task Divergence: While Dialogue Generation demonstrates a rapid shift toward LaaJ (>40% in 2025), Machine Translation remains locked into n-gram metrics, and Question Answering exhibits a substantial decline in the proportion of studies conducting human evaluation. (2) Metric Inertia: Despite the development of semantic metrics, general-purpose metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) continue to be widely used across tasks without empirical justification, often lacking the discriminative power to distinguish between specific quality criteria. (3) Human-LaaJ Divergence: Our association analysis challenges the assumption that LLMs act as mere proxies for humans; LaaJ and human evaluations prioritize very different signals, and explicit validation is scarce (<8% of papers comparing the two), with only moderate to low correlation. Based on these observations, we derive practical recommendations to improve the rigor of future NLG evaluation.

### Beyond Static Tools: Test-Time Tool Evolution for Scientific Reasoning
**Authors**: Jiaxuan Lu, Ziyu Kong, Yemin Wang, Rong Fu, Haiyuan Wan, Cheng Yang, Wenjie Lou, Haoran Sun, Lilong Wang, Yankai Jiang, Xiaosong Wang, Xiao Sun, Dongzhan Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:22:51Z

**Summary**: The central challenge of AI for Science is not reasoning alone, but the ability to create computational methods in an open-ended scientific world. Existing LLM-based agents rely on static, pre-defined tool libraries, a paradigm that fundamentally fails in scientific domains where tools are sparse, heterogeneous, and intrinsically incomplete. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Tool Evolution (TTE), a new paradigm that enables agents to synthesize, verify, and evolve executable tools during inference. By transforming tools from fixed resources into problem-driven artifacts, TTE overcomes the rigidity and long-tail limitations of static tool libraries. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciEvo, a benchmark comprising 1,590 scientific reasoning tasks supported by 925 automatically evolved tools. Extensive experiments show that TTE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and tool efficiency, while enabling effective cross-domain adaptation of computational tools. The code and benchmark have been released at https://github.com/lujiaxuan0520/Test-Time-Tool-Evol.

### GeoMotionGPT: Geometry-Aligned Motion Understanding with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhankai Ye, Bofan Li, Yukai Jin, Shuoqiu Li, Wei Wang, Yanfu Zhang, Shangqian Gao, Xin Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:14:29Z

**Summary**: Discrete motion tokenization has recently enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as versatile backbones for motion understanding and motion-language reasoning. However, existing pipelines typically decouple motion quantization from semantic embedding learning, linking them solely via token IDs. This approach fails to effectively align the intrinsic geometry of the motion space with the embedding space, thereby hindering the LLM's capacity for nuanced motion reasoning. We argue that alignment is most effective when both modalities share a unified geometric basis. Therefore, instead of forcing the LLM to reconstruct the complex geometry among motion tokens from scratch, we present a novel framework that explicitly enforces orthogonality on both the motion codebook and the LLM embedding space, ensuring that their relational structures naturally mirror each other. Specifically, we employ a decoder-only quantizer with Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable training and balanced codebook usage. To bridge the modalities, we use a sparse projection that maps motion codes into the LLM embedding space while preserving orthogonality. Finally, a two-stage orthonormal regularization schedule enforces soft constraints during tokenizer training and LLM fine-tuning to maintain geometric alignment without hindering semantic adaptation. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D demonstrate that our framework achieves a 20% performance improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, validating that a unified geometric basis effectively empowers the LLM for nuanced motion reasoning.

### An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning
**Authors**: Yonatan Kurniawan, Tracianne B. Neilsen, Benjamin L. Francis, Alex M. Stankovic, Mingjian Wen, Ilia Nikiforov, Ellad B. Tadmor, Vasily V. Bulatov, Vincenzo Lordi, Mark K. Transtrum

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:12:30Z

**Summary**: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.

### GP-GS: Gaussian Processes Densification for 3D Gaussian Splatting
**Authors**: Zhihao Guo, Jingxuan Su, Chenghao Qian, Shenglin Wang, Jinlong Fan, Jing Zhang, Wei Zhou, Hadi Amirpour, Yunlong Zhao, Liangxiu Han, Peng Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:12:26Z

**Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables photorealistic rendering but suffers from artefacts due to sparse Structure-from-Motion (SfM) initialisation. To address this limitation, we propose GP-GS, a Gaussian Process (GP) based densification framework for 3DGS optimisation. GP-GS formulates point cloud densification as a continuous regression problem, where a GP learns a local mapping from 2D pixel coordinates to 3D position and colour attributes. An adaptive neighbourhood-based sampling strategy generates candidate pixels for inference, while GP-predicted uncertainty is used to filter unreliable predictions, reducing noise and preserving geometric structure. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GP-GS consistently improves reconstruction quality and rendering fidelity, achieving up to 1.12 dB PSNR improvement over strong baselines.

### A Disproof of Large Language Model Consciousness: The Necessity of Continual Learning for Consciousness
**Authors**: Erik Hoel

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:06:05Z

**Summary**: Scientific theories of consciousness should be falsifiable and non-trivial. Recent research has given us formal tools to analyze these requirements of falsifiability and non-triviality for theories of consciousness. Surprisingly, many contemporary theories of consciousness fail to pass this bar, including theories based on causal structure but also (as I demonstrate) theories based on function. Herein I show these requirements of falsifiability and non-triviality especially constrain the potential consciousness of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) because of their proximity to systems that are equivalent to LLMs in terms of input/output function; yet, for these functionally equivalent systems, there cannot be any falsifiable and non-trivial theory of consciousness that judges them conscious. This forms the basis of a disproof of contemporary LLM consciousness. I then show a positive result, which is that theories of consciousness based on (or requiring) continual learning do satisfy the stringent formal constraints for a theory of consciousness in humans. Intriguingly, this work supports a hypothesis: If continual learning is linked to consciousness in humans, the current limitations of LLMs (which do not continually learn) are intimately tied to their lack of consciousness.

### TALM: Dynamic Tree-Structured Multi-Agent Framework with Long-Term Memory for Scalable Code Generation
**Authors**: Ming-Tung Shen, Yuh-Jzer Joung

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:04:16Z

**Summary**: Agentic code generation requires large language models (LLMs) capable of complex context management and multi-step reasoning. Prior multi-agent frameworks attempt to address these challenges through collaboration, yet they often suffer from rigid workflows and high reasoning recovery costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose TALM (Tree-Structured Multi-Agent Framework with Long-Term Memory), a dynamic framework that integrates structured task decomposition, localized re-reasoning, and long-term memory mechanisms. TALM employs an extensible tree-based collaboration structure. The parent-child relationships, when combined with a divide-and-conquer strategy, enhance reasoning flexibility and enable efficient error correction across diverse task scopes. Furthermore, a long-term memory module enables semantic querying and integration of prior knowledge, supporting implicit self-improvement through experience reuse. Experimental results on HumanEval, BigCodeBench, and ClassEval benchmarks demonstrate that TALM consistently delivers strong reasoning performance and high token efficiency, highlighting its robustness and practical utility in complex code generation tasks.

### DIAGPaper: Diagnosing Valid and Specific Weaknesses in Scientific Papers via Multi-Agent Reasoning
**Authors**: Zhuoyang Zou, Abolfazl Ansari, Delvin Ce Zhang, Dongwon Lee, Wenpeng Yin

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:59:00Z

**Summary**: Paper weakness identification using single-agent or multi-agent LLMs has attracted increasing attention, yet existing approaches exhibit key limitations. Many multi-agent systems simulate human roles at a surface level, missing the underlying criteria that lead experts to assess complementary intellectual aspects of a paper. Moreover, prior methods implicitly assume identified weaknesses are valid, ignoring reviewer bias, misunderstanding, and the critical role of author rebuttals in validating review quality. Finally, most systems output unranked weakness lists, rather than prioritizing the most consequential issues for users. In this work, we propose DIAGPaper, a novel multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges through three tightly integrated modules. The customizer module simulates human-defined review criteria and instantiates multiple reviewer agents with criterion-specific expertise. The rebuttal module introduces author agents that engage in structured debate with reviewer agents to validate and refine proposed weaknesses. The prioritizer module learns from large-scale human review practices to assess the severity of validated weaknesses and surfaces the top-K severest ones to users. Experiments on two benchmarks, AAAR and ReviewCritique, demonstrate that DIAGPaper substantially outperforms existing methods by producing more valid and more paper-specific weaknesses, while presenting them in a user-oriented, prioritized manner.

### The Curious Case of Factual (Mis)Alignment between LLMs' Short- and Long-Form Answers
**Authors**: Saad Obaid ul Islam, Anne Lauscher, Goran Glavaš

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:54:11Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer "When was Einstein born?" yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work, we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs' trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.

### OODEval: Evaluating Large Language Models on Object-Oriented Design
**Authors**: Bingxu Xiao, Yunwei Dong, Yiqi Tang, Manqing Zhang, Yifan Zhou, Chunyan Ma, Yepang Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:51:31Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven extensive evaluations in software engineering. however, most prior work concentrates on code-level tasks, leaving software design capabilities underexplored. To fill this gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating 29 LLMs on object-oriented design (OOD) tasks. Owing to the lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics, we introduce OODEval, a manually constructed benchmark comprising 50 OOD tasks of varying difficulty, and OODEval-Human, the first human-rated OOD benchmark, which includes 940 undergraduate-submitted class diagrams evaluated by instructors. We further propose CLUE (Class Likeness Unified Evaluation), a unified metric set that assesses both global correctness and fine-grained design quality in class diagram generation. Using these benchmarks and metrics, we investigate five research questions: overall correctness, comparison with humans, model dimension analysis, task feature analysis, and bad case analysis. The results indicate that while LLMs achieve high syntactic accuracy, they exhibit substantial semantic deficiencies, particularly in method and relationship generation. Among the evaluated models, Qwen3-Coder-30B achieves the best overall performance, rivaling DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4o, while Gemma3-4B-IT outperforms GPT-4o-Mini despite its smaller parameter scale. Although top-performing LLMs nearly match the average performance of undergraduates, they remain significantly below the level of the best human designers. Further analysis shows that parameter scale, code specialization, and instruction tuning strongly influence performance, whereas increased design complexity and lower requirement readability degrade it. Bad case analysis reveals common failure modes, including keyword misuse, missing classes or relationships, and omitted methods.

### Peformance Isolation for Inference Processes in Edge GPU Systems
**Authors**: Juan José Martín, José Flich, Carles Hernández

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:49:52Z

**Summary**: This work analyzes the main isolation mechanisms available in modern NVIDIA GPUs: MPS, MIG, and the recent Green Contexts, to ensure predictable inference time in safety-critical applications using deep learning models. The experimental methodology includes performance tests, evaluation of partitioning impact, and analysis of temporal isolation between processes, considering both the NVIDIA A100 and Jetson Orin platforms. It is observed that MIG provides a high level of isolation. At the same time, Green Contexts represent a promising alternative for edge devices by enabling fine-grained SM allocation with low overhead, albeit without memory isolation. The study also identifies current limitations and outlines potential research directions to improve temporal predictability in shared GPUs.

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:42:42Z

**Summary**: RTL design often relies heavily on ad-hoc testbench creation early in the design cycle. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for RTL code generation, their ability to reason about hardware specifications and generate targeted test plans remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of LLM reasoning capabilities for RTL verification stimuli generation, establishing a two-stage framework that decomposes test plan generation from testbench execution. Our benchmark reveals that state-of-the-art models, including DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.0-Sonnet, achieve only 15.7-21.7% success rates on generating stimuli that pass golden RTL designs. To improve LLM generated stimuli, we develop a comprehensive training methodology combining supervised fine-tuning with a novel reinforcement learning approach, GRPO with State Mutation (GRPO-SMu), which enhances exploration by varying input mutations. Our approach leverages a tree-based branching mutation strategy to construct training data comprising equivalent and mutated trees, moving beyond linear mutation approaches to provide rich learning signals. Training on this curated dataset, our 7B parameter model achieves a 33.3% golden test pass rate and a 13.9% mutation detection rate, representing a 17.6% absolute improvement over baseline and outperforming much larger general-purpose models. These results demonstrate that specialized training methodologies can significantly enhance LLM reasoning capabilities for hardware verification tasks, establishing a foundation for automated sub-unit testing in semiconductor design workflows.

### LLMs Enable Bag-of-Texts Representations for Short-Text Clustering
**Authors**: I-Fan Lin, Faegheh Hasibi, Suzan Verberne

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:39:21Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we propose a training-free method for unsupervised short text clustering that relies less on careful selection of embedders than other methods. In customer-facing chatbots, companies are dealing with large amounts of user utterances that need to be clustered according to their intent. In these settings, no labeled data is typically available, and the number of clusters is not known. Recent approaches to short-text clustering in label-free settings incorporate LLM output to refine existing embeddings. While LLMs can identify similar texts effectively, the resulting similarities may not be directly represented by distances in the dense vector space, as they depend on the original embedding. We therefore propose a method for transforming LLM judgments directly into a bag-of-texts representation in which texts are initialized to be equidistant, without assuming any prior distance relationships. Our method achieves comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art methods, but without embeddings optimization or assuming prior knowledge of clusters or labels. Experiments on diverse datasets and smaller LLMs show that our method is model agnostic and can be applied to any embedder, with relatively small LLMs, and different clustering methods. We also show how our method scales to large datasets, reducing the computational cost of the LLM use. The flexibility and scalability of our method make it more aligned with real-world training-free scenarios than existing clustering methods.

### Large Language Models for Physics Instrument Design
**Authors**: Sara Zoccheddu, Shah Rukh Qasim, Patrick Owen, Nicola Serra

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:30:54Z

**Summary**: We study the use of large language models (LLMs) for physics instrument design and compare their performance to reinforcement learning (RL). Using only prompting, LLMs are given task constraints and summaries of prior high-scoring designs and propose complete detector configurations, which we evaluate with the same simulators and reward functions used in RL-based optimization. Although RL yields stronger final designs, we find that modern LLMs consistently generate valid, resource-aware, and physically meaningful configurations that draw on broad pretrained knowledge of detector design principles and particle--matter interactions, despite having no task-specific training. Based on this result, as a first step toward hybrid design workflows, we explore pairing the LLMs with a dedicated trust region optimizer, serving as a precursor to future pipelines in which LLMs propose and structure design hypotheses while RL performs reward-driven optimization. Based on these experiments, we argue that LLMs are well suited as meta-planners: they can design and orchestrate RL-based optimization studies, define search strategies, and coordinate multiple interacting components within a unified workflow. In doing so, they point toward automated, closed-loop instrument design in which much of the human effort required to structure and supervise optimization can be reduced.

### An adjoint method for training data-driven reduced-order models
**Authors**: Donglin Liu, Francisco García Atienza, Mengwu Guo

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:30:50Z

**Summary**: Reduced-order modeling lies at the interface of numerical analysis and data-driven scientific computing, providing principled ways to compress high-fidelity simulations in science and engineering. We propose a training framework that couples a continuous-time form of operator inference with the adjoint-state method to obtain robust data-driven reduced-order models. This method minimizes a trajectory-based loss between reduced-order solutions and projected snapshot data, which removes the need to estimate time derivatives from noisy measurements and provides intrinsic temporal regularization through time integration. We derive the corresponding continuous adjoint equations to compute gradients efficiently and implement a gradient based optimizer to update the reduced model parameters. Each iteration only requires one forward reduced order solve and one adjoint solve, followed by inexpensive gradient assembly, making the method attractive for large-scale simulations. We validate the proposed method on three partial differential equations: viscous Burgers' equation, the two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation, and an advection-diffusion equation. We perform systematic comparisons against standard operator inference under two perturbation regimes, namely reduced temporal snapshot density and additive Gaussian noise. For clean data, both approaches deliver similar accuracy, but in situations with sparse sampling and noise, the proposed adjoint-based training provides better accuracy and enhanced roll-out stability.

### Beyond Entangled Planning: Task-Decoupled Planning for Long-Horizon Agents
**Authors**: Yunfan Li, Bingbing Xu, Xueyun Tian, Xiucheng Xu, Huawei Shen

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:30:10Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to autonomously execute complex, long-horizon tasks, yet planning remains a primary bottleneck for reliable task execution. Existing methods typically fall into two paradigms: step-wise planning, which is reactive but often short-sighted; and one-shot planning, which generates a complete plan upfront yet is brittle to execution errors. Crucially, both paradigms suffer from entangled contexts, where the agent must reason over a monolithic history spanning multiple sub-tasks. This entanglement increases cognitive load and lets local errors propagate across otherwise independent decisions, making recovery computationally expensive. To address this, we propose Task-Decoupled Planning (TDP), a training-free framework that replaces entangled reasoning with task decoupling. TDP decomposes tasks into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of sub-goals via a Supervisor. Using a Planner and Executor with scoped contexts, TDP confines reasoning and replanning to the active sub-task. This isolation prevents error propagation and corrects deviations locally without disrupting the workflow. Results on TravelPlanner, ScienceWorld, and HotpotQA show that TDP outperforms strong baselines while reducing token consumption by up to 82%, demonstrating that sub-task decoupling improves both robustness and efficiency for long-horizon agents.

### d3LLM: Ultra-Fast Diffusion LLM using Pseudo-Trajectory Distillation
**Authors**: Yu-Yang Qian, Junda Su, Lanxiang Hu, Peiyuan Zhang, Zhijie Deng, Peng Zhao, Hao Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:25:36Z

**Summary**: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer capabilities beyond those of autoregressive (AR) LLMs, such as parallel decoding and random-order generation. However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/d3LLM.

### A Unified Framework for Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis via Expert-Guided Multimodal Fusion with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jiaqi Qiao, Xiujuan Xu, Xinran Li, Yu Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:21:32Z

**Summary**: Multimodal emotion understanding requires effective integration of text, audio, and visual modalities for both discrete emotion recognition and continuous sentiment analysis. We present EGMF, a unified framework combining expert-guided multimodal fusion with large language models. Our approach features three specialized expert networks--a fine-grained local expert for subtle emotional nuances, a semantic correlation expert for cross-modal relationships, and a global context expert for long-range dependencies--adaptively integrated through hierarchical dynamic gating for context-aware feature selection. Enhanced multimodal representations are integrated with LLMs via pseudo token injection and prompt-based conditioning, enabling a single generative framework to handle both classification and regression through natural language generation. We employ LoRA fine-tuning for computational efficiency. Experiments on bilingual benchmarks (MELD, CHERMA, MOSEI, SIMS-V2) demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with superior cross-lingual robustness revealing universal patterns in multimodal emotional expressions across English and Chinese. We will release the source code publicly.

### Inferring charge-noise source locations from correlations in spin qubits
**Authors**: Juan S. Rojas-Arias, Akito Noiri, Jun Yoneda, Peter Stano, Takashi Nakajima, Kenta Takeda, Takashi Kobayashi, Giordano Scappucci, Seigo Tarucha, Daniel Loss

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:20:38Z

**Summary**: We investigate low-frequency noise in a spin-qubit device made in isotopically purified Si/Si-Ge. Observing sizable cross-correlations among energy fluctuations of different qubits, we conclude that these fluctuations are dominated by charge noise. At low frequencies, the noise spectra are not well described by a power law; instead, they reveal the presence of a few individual two-level fluctuators (TLFs). We demonstrate that the noise cross-correlations allow one to get information on the spatial location of such individual TLFs.

### Reducing Hallucinations in LLMs via Factuality-Aware Preference Learning
**Authors**: Sindhuja Chaduvula, Ahmed Y. Radwan, Azib Farooq, Yani Ioannou, Shaina Raza

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:16:29Z

**Summary**: Preference alignment methods such as RLHF and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) improve instruction following, but they can also reinforce hallucinations when preference judgments reward fluency and confidence over factual correctness. We introduce F-DPO (Factuality-aware Direct Preference Optimization), a simple extension of DPO that uses only binary factuality labels. F-DPO (i) applies a label-flipping transformation that corrects misordered preference pairs so the chosen response is never less factual than the rejected one, and (ii) adds a factuality-aware margin that emphasizes pairs with clear correctness differences, while reducing to standard DPO when both responses share the same factuality. We construct factuality-aware preference data by augmenting DPO pairs with binary factuality indicators and synthetic hallucinated variants. Across seven open-weight LLMs (1B-14B), F-DPO consistently improves factuality and reduces hallucination rates relative to both base models and standard DPO. On Qwen3-8B, F-DPO reduces hallucination rates by five times (from 0.424 to 0.084) while improving factuality scores by 50 percent (from 5.26 to 7.90). F-DPO also generalizes to out-of-distribution benchmarks: on TruthfulQA, Qwen2.5-14B achieves plus 17 percent MC1 accuracy (0.500 to 0.585) and plus 49 percent MC2 accuracy (0.357 to 0.531). F-DPO requires no auxiliary reward model, token-level annotations, or multi-stage training.

### FlyCo: Foundation Model-Empowered Drones for Autonomous 3D Structure Scanning in Open-World Environments
**Authors**: Chen Feng, Guiyong Zheng, Tengkai Zhuang, Yongqian Wu, Fangzhan He, Haojia Li, Juepeng Zheng, Shaojie Shen, Boyu Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:14:39Z

**Summary**: Autonomous 3D scanning of open-world target structures via drones remains challenging despite broad applications. Existing paradigms rely on restrictive assumptions or effortful human priors, limiting practicality, efficiency, and adaptability. Recent foundation models (FMs) offer great potential to bridge this gap. This paper investigates a critical research problem: What system architecture can effectively integrate FM knowledge for this task? We answer it with FlyCo, a principled FM-empowered perception-prediction-planning loop enabling fully autonomous, prompt-driven 3D target scanning in diverse unknown open-world environments. FlyCo directly translates low-effort human prompts (text, visual annotations) into precise adaptive scanning flights via three coordinated stages: (1) perception fuses streaming sensor data with vision-language FMs for robust target grounding and tracking; (2) prediction distills FM knowledge and combines multi-modal cues to infer the partially observed target's complete geometry; (3) planning leverages predictive foresight to generate efficient and safe paths with comprehensive target coverage. Building on this, we further design key components to boost open-world target grounding efficiency and robustness, enhance prediction quality in terms of shape accuracy, zero-shot generalization, and temporal stability, and balance long-horizon flight efficiency with real-time computability and online collision avoidance. Extensive challenging real-world and simulation experiments show FlyCo delivers precise scene understanding, high efficiency, and real-time safety, outperforming existing paradigms with lower human effort and verifying the proposed architecture's practicality. Comprehensive ablations validate each component's contribution. FlyCo also serves as a flexible, extensible blueprint, readily leveraging future FM and robotics advances. Code will be released.

### ThinkBrake: Mitigating Overthinking in Tool Reasoning
**Authors**: Sangjun Song, Minjae Oh, Seungkyu Lee, Sungmin Jo, Yohan Jo

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:08:29Z

**Summary**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) allocate substantial inference-time compute to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, improving performance on mathematics, scientific QA, and tool usage. However, this introduces overthinking: LRMs often reach a correct intermediate solution, continue reasoning, and overwrite it with an incorrect answer. We first demonstrate that oracle stopping--where we inject </think> at every sentence boundary and select the best stopping point in hindsight--improves average accuracy by 8\% while reducing thinking tokens by 72\%, exposing substantial overthinking. Motivated by this finding, we propose ThinkBrake, which monitors the log-probability margin between the top continuation token and </think> at sentence boundaries, stopping reasoning when this margin narrows. ThinkBrake requires no training and achieves favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs across math, scientific QA, and tool usage benchmarks, reducing thinking token usage by up to 30\%. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis showing that ThinkBrake is equivalent to test-time realignment with a reward bonus for the </think> token.

### Backpropagation-Free Test-Time Adaptation for Lightweight EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces
**Authors**: Siyang Li, Jiayi Ouyang, Zhenyao Cui, Ziwei Wang, Tianwang Jia, Feng Wan, Dongrui Wu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:08:18Z

**Summary**: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face significant deployment challenges due to inter-subject variability, signal non-stationarity, and computational constraints. While test-time adaptation (TTA) mitigates distribution shifts under online data streams without per-use calibration sessions, existing TTA approaches heavily rely on explicitly defined loss objectives that require backpropagation for updating model parameters, which incurs computational overhead, privacy risks, and sensitivity to noisy data streams. This paper proposes Backpropagation-Free Transformations (BFT), a TTA approach for EEG decoding that eliminates such issues. BFT applies multiple sample-wise transformations of knowledge-guided augmentations or approximate Bayesian inference to each test trial, generating multiple prediction scores for a single test sample. A learning-to-rank module enhances the weighting of these predictions, enabling robust aggregation for uncertainty suppression during inference under theoretical justifications. Extensive experiments on five EEG datasets of motor imagery classification and driver drowsiness regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness, versatility, robustness, and efficiency of BFT. This research enables lightweight plug-and-play BCIs on resource-constrained devices, broadening the real-world deployment of decoding algorithms for EEG-based BCI.

**Authors**: Kabir Swain, Sijie Han, Ayush Raina, Jin Zhang, Shuang Li, Michael Stopa, Antonio Torralba

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:04:38Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to improve in reasoning and decision-making, there is a growing need for realistic and interactive environments where their abilities can be rigorously evaluated. We present VirtualEnv, a next-generation simulation platform built on Unreal Engine 5 that enables fine-grained benchmarking of LLMs in embodied and interactive scenarios. VirtualEnv supports rich agent-environment interactions, including object manipulation, navigation, and adaptive multi-agent collaboration, as well as game-inspired mechanics like escape rooms and procedurally generated environments. We provide a user-friendly API built on top of Unreal Engine, allowing researchers to deploy and control LLM-driven agents using natural language instructions. We integrate large-scale LLMs and vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-based models, to generate novel environments and structured tasks from multimodal inputs. Our experiments benchmark the performance of several popular LLMs across tasks of increasing complexity, analyzing differences in adaptability, planning, and multi-agent coordination. We also describe our methodology for procedural task generation, task validation, and real-time environment control. VirtualEnv is released as an open-source platform, we aim to advance research at the intersection of AI and gaming, enable standardized evaluation of LLMs in embodied AI settings, and pave the way for future developments in immersive simulations and interactive entertainment.

### ICWLM: A Multi-Task Wireless Large Model via In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Yuxuan Wen, Xiaoming Chen, Maojun Zhang, Zhaohui Yang, Chongwen Huang, Zhaoyang Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:48:23Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of wireless communication technologies, particularly massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave), introduces significant network complexity and computational demands. Significant research efforts have been made to improve physical layer performance by resorting to deep learning (DL) methods, which, however, are usually task-specific and struggle with data scarcity and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel In-Context Wireless Large Model (ICWLM), a wireless-native foundation model designed for simultaneous multi-task learning at the physical layer. Unlike conventional methods that adapt wireless data to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), ICWLM is trained directly on large-scale, mixed wireless datasets from scratch. It jointly solves multiple classical physical layer problems, including multi-user precoding (sum-rate maximization and max-min SINR) and channel prediction. A key innovation of ICWLM is its utilization of in-context learning (ICL), enabling the model to adapt to varying system configurations and channel conditions with minimal demonstration pairs, eliminating the need for extensive retraining. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that ICWLM achieves competitive performance compared to task-specific methods while exhibiting remarkable generalization capabilities to unseen system configurations. This work offers a promising paradigm for developing unified and adaptive AI models for future wireless networks, potentially reducing deployment complexity and enhancing intelligent resource management.

### Can Reasoning Help Large Language Models Capture Human Annotator Disagreement?
**Authors**: Jingwei Ni, Yu Fan, Vilém Zouhar, Donya Rooein, Alexander Hoyle, Mrinmaya Sachan, Markus Leippold, Dirk Hovy, Elliott Ash

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:46:04Z

**Summary**: Variation in human annotation (i.e., disagreements) is common in NLP, often reflecting important information like task subjectivity and sample ambiguity. Modeling this variation is important for applications that are sensitive to such information. Although RLVR-style reasoning (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards) has improved Large Language Model (LLM) performance on many tasks, it remains unclear whether such reasoning enables LLMs to capture informative variation in human annotation. In this work, we evaluate the influence of different reasoning settings on LLM disagreement modeling. We systematically evaluate each reasoning setting across model sizes, distribution expression methods, and steering methods, resulting in 60 experimental setups across 3 tasks. Surprisingly, our results show that RLVR-style reasoning degrades performance in disagreement modeling, while naive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves the performance of RLHF LLMs (RL from human feedback). These findings underscore the potential risk of replacing human annotators with reasoning LLMs, especially when disagreements are important.

### ViewMorpher3D: A 3D-aware Diffusion Framework for Multi-Camera Novel View Synthesis in Autonomous Driving
**Authors**: Farhad G. Zanjani, Hong Cai, Amirhossein Habibian

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:44:14Z

**Summary**: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multi-view images to ensure accurate perception and robust decision-making. To effectively develop and evaluate perception stacks and planning algorithms, realistic closed-loop simulators are indispensable. While 3D reconstruction techniques such as Gaussian Splatting offer promising avenues for simulator construction, the rendered novel views often exhibit artifacts, particularly in extrapolated perspectives or when available observations are sparse.   We introduce ViewMorpher3D, a multi-view image enhancement framework based on image diffusion models, designed to elevate photorealism and multi-view coherence in driving scenes. Unlike single-view approaches, ViewMorpher3D jointly processes a set of rendered views conditioned on camera poses, 3D geometric priors, and temporally adjacent or spatially overlapping reference views. This enables the model to infer missing details, suppress rendering artifacts, and enforce cross-view consistency.   Our framework accommodates variable numbers of cameras and flexible reference/target view configurations, making it adaptable to diverse sensor setups. Experiments on real-world driving datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in image quality metrics, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving geometric fidelity.

### Functional Synthetic Control Methods for Metric Space-Valued Outcomes
**Authors**: Ryo Okano, Daisuke Kurisu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:43:40Z

**Summary**: The synthetic control method (SCM) is a widely used tool for evaluating causal effects of policy changes in panel data settings. Recent studies have extended its framework to accommodate complex outcomes that take values in metric spaces, such as distributions, functions, networks, covariance matrices, and compositional data. However, due to the lack of linear structure in general metric spaces, theoretical guarantees for estimation and inference within these extended frameworks remain underdeveloped. In this study, we propose the functional synthetic control (FSC) method as an extension of the SCM for metric space-valued outcomes. To address challenges arising from the nonlinearlity of metric spaces, we leverage isometric embeddings into Hilbert spaces. Building on this approach, we develop the FSC and augmented FSC estimators for counterfactual outcomes, with the latter being a bias-corrected version of the former. We then derive their finite-sample error bounds to establish theoretical guarantees for estimation, and construct prediction sets based on these estimators to conduct inference on causal effects. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed framework through simulation studies and three empirical applications.

### DyDiT++: Diffusion Transformers with Timestep and Spatial Dynamics for Efficient Visual Generation
**Authors**: Wangbo Zhao, Yizeng Han, Jiasheng Tang, Kai Wang, Hao Luo, Yibing Song, Gao Huang, Fan Wang, Yang You

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:42:58Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformer (DiT), an emerging diffusion model for visual generation, has demonstrated superior performance but suffers from substantial computational costs. Our investigations reveal that these costs primarily stem from the static inference paradigm, which inevitably introduces redundant computation in certain diffusion timesteps and spatial regions. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (DyDiT), an architecture that dynamically adjusts its computation along both timestep and spatial dimensions. Building on these designs, we present an extended version, DyDiT++, with improvements in three key aspects. First, it extends the generation mechanism of DyDiT beyond diffusion to flow matching, demonstrating that our method can also accelerate flow-matching-based generation, enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we enhance DyDiT to tackle more complex visual generation tasks, including video generation and text-to-image generation, thereby broadening its real-world applications. Finally, to address the high cost of full fine-tuning and democratize technology access, we investigate the feasibility of training DyDiT in a parameter-efficient manner and introduce timestep-based dynamic LoRA (TD-LoRA). Extensive experiments on diverse visual generation models, including DiT, SiT, Latte, and FLUX, demonstrate the effectiveness of DyDiT++. Remarkably, with <3% additional fine-tuning iterations, our approach reduces the FLOPs of DiT-XL by 51%, yielding 1.73x realistic speedup on hardware, and achieves a competitive FID score of 2.07 on ImageNet. The code is available at https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/DyDiT.

### Loci Similes: A Benchmark for Extracting Intertextualities in Latin Literature
**Authors**: Julian Schelb, Michael Wittweiler, Marie Revellio, Barbara Feichtinger, Andreas Spitz

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:34:49Z

**Summary**: Tracing connections between historical texts is an important part of intertextual research, enabling scholars to reconstruct the virtual library of a writer and identify the sources influencing their creative process. These intertextual links manifest in diverse forms, ranging from direct verbatim quotations to subtle allusions and paraphrases disguised by morphological variation. Language models offer a promising path forward due to their capability of capturing semantic similarity beyond lexical overlap. However, the development of new methods for this task is held back by the scarcity of standardized benchmarks and easy-to-use datasets. We address this gap by introducing Loci Similes, a benchmark for Latin intertextuality detection comprising of a curated dataset of ~172k text segments containing 545 expert-verified parallels linking Late Antique authors to a corpus of classical authors. Using this data, we establish baselines for retrieval and classification of intertextualities with state-of-the-art LLMs.

### Meta-Fair: AI-Assisted Fairness Testing of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Miguel Romero-Arjona, José A. Parejo, Juan C. Alonso, Ana B. Sánchez, Aitor Arrieta, Sergio Segura

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:30:36Z

**Summary**: Fairness--the absence of unjustified bias--is a core principle in the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, yet it remains difficult to assess and enforce. Current approaches to fairness testing in large language models (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic heuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult to scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method for testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific resources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach, Meta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to uncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled modifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second, we propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and output evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and classify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source tools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test cases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained LLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases. The results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs, achieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of executions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators, with the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although non-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through careful MR design. While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the results indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation in LLM testing.

### From RAG to Agentic RAG for Faithful Islamic Question Answering
**Authors**: Gagan Bhatia, Hamdy Mubarak, Mustafa Jarrar, George Mikros, Fadi Zaraket, Mahmoud Alhirthani, Mutaz Al-Khatib, Logan Cochrane, Kareem Darwish, Rashid Yahiaoui, Firoj Alam

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:28:28Z

**Summary**: LLMs are increasingly used for Islamic question answering, where ungrounded responses may carry serious religious consequences. Yet standard MCQ/MRC-style evaluations do not capture key real-world failure modes, notably free-form hallucinations and whether models appropriately abstain when evidence is lacking. To shed a light on this aspect we introduce ISLAMICFAITHQA, a 3,810-item bilingual (Arabic/English) generative benchmark with atomic single-gold answers, which enables direct measurement of hallucination and abstention. We additionally developed an end-to-end grounded Islamic modelling suite consisting of (i) 25K Arabic text-grounded SFT reasoning pairs, (ii) 5K bilingual preference samples for reward-guided alignment, and (iii) a verse-level Qur'an retrieval corpus of $\sim$6k atomic verses (ayat). Building on these resources, we develop an agentic Quran-grounding framework (agentic RAG) that uses structured tool calls for iterative evidence seeking and answer revision. Experiments across Arabic-centric and multilingual LLMs show that retrieval improves correctness and that agentic RAG yields the largest gains beyond standard RAG, achieving state-of-the-art performance and stronger Arabic-English robustness even with a small model (i.e., Qwen3 4B). We will make the experimental resources and datasets publicly available for the community.

### MMGRec: Multimodal Generative Recommendation with Transformer Model
**Authors**: Han Liu, Yinwei Wei, Xuemeng Song, Weili Guan, Yuan-Fang Li, Liqiang Nie

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:26:10Z

**Summary**: Multimodal recommendation aims to recommend user-preferred candidates based on her/his historically interacted items and associated multimodal information. Previous studies commonly employ an embed-and-retrieve paradigm: learning user and item representations in the same embedding space, then retrieving similar candidate items for a user via embedding inner product. However, this paradigm suffers from inference cost, interaction modeling, and false-negative issues. Toward this end, we propose a new MMGRec model to introduce a generative paradigm into multimodal recommendation. Specifically, we first devise a hierarchical quantization method Graph RQ-VAE to assign Rec-ID for each item from its multimodal and CF information. Consisting of a tuple of semantically meaningful tokens, Rec-ID serves as the unique identifier of each item. Afterward, we train a Transformer-based recommender to generate the Rec-IDs of user-preferred items based on historical interaction sequences. The generative paradigm is qualified since this model systematically predicts the tuple of tokens identifying the recommended item in an autoregressive manner. Moreover, a relation-aware self-attention mechanism is devised for the Transformer to handle non-sequential interaction sequences, which explores the element pairwise relation to replace absolute positional encoding. Extensive experiments evaluate MMGRec's effectiveness compared with state-of-the-art methods.

### Thinking Before Constraining: A Unified Decoding Framework for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ngoc Trinh Hung Nguyen, Alonso Silva, Laith Zumot, Liubov Tupikina, Armen Aghasaryan, Mehwish Alam

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:25:28Z

**Summary**: Natural generation allows Language Models (LMs) to produce free-form responses with rich reasoning, but the lack of guaranteed structure makes outputs difficult to parse or verify. Structured generation, or constrained decoding, addresses this drawback by producing content in standardized formats such as JSON, ensuring consistency and guaranteed-parsable outputs, but it can inadvertently restrict the model's reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose a simple approach that combines the advantages of both natural and structured generation. By allowing LLMs to reason freely until specific trigger tokens are generated, and then switching to structured generation, our method preserves the expressive power of natural language reasoning while ensuring the reliability of structured outputs. We further evaluate our approach on several datasets, covering both classification and reasoning tasks, to demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving a substantial gain of up to 27% in accuracy compared to natural generation, while requiring only a small overhead of 10-20 extra tokens.

**Summary**: Fully convolutional networks have become the backbone of modern medical imaging due to their ability to learn multi-scale representations and perform end-to-end inference. Yet their potential for slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), the task of jointly estimating 3D anatomy and slice poses from misaligned 2D acquisitions, remains underexplored. We introduce a fast convolutional framework that fuses multiple orthogonal 2D slice stacks to recover coherent 3D structure and refines slice alignment through lightweight model-based optimization. Applied to fetal brain MRI, our approach reconstructs high-quality 3D volumes in under 10s, with 1s slice registration and accuracy on par with state-of-the-art iterative SVR pipelines, offering more than speedup. The framework uses non-rigid displacement fields to represent transformations, generalizing to other SVR problems like fetal body and placental MRI. Additionally, the fast inference time paves the way for real-time, scanner-side volumetric feedback during MRI acquisition.

### Symbolic regression for defect interactions in 2D materials
**Authors**: Mikhail Lazarev, Andrey Ustyuzhanin

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:17:59Z

**Summary**: Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.

### Mon3tr: Monocular 3D Telepresence with Pre-built Gaussian Avatars as Amortization
**Authors**: Fangyu Lin, Yingdong Hu, Zhening Liu, Yufan Zhuang, Zehong Lin, Jun Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:17:41Z

**Summary**: Immersive telepresence aims to transform human interaction in AR/VR applications by enabling lifelike full-body holographic representations for enhanced remote collaboration. However, existing systems rely on hardware-intensive multi-camera setups and demand high bandwidth for volumetric streaming, limiting their real-time performance on mobile devices. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mon3tr, a novel Monocular 3D telepresence framework that integrates 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) based parametric human modeling into telepresence for the first time. Mon3tr adopts an amortized computation strategy, dividing the process into a one-time offline multi-view reconstruction phase to build a user-specific avatar and a monocular online inference phase during live telepresence sessions. A single monocular RGB camera is used to capture body motions and facial expressions in real time to drive the 3DGS-based parametric human model, significantly reducing system complexity and cost. The extracted motion and appearance features are transmitted at < 0.2 Mbps over WebRTC's data channel, allowing robust adaptation to network fluctuations. On the receiver side, e.g., Meta Quest 3, we develop a lightweight 3DGS attribute deformation network to dynamically generate corrective 3DGS attribute adjustments on the pre-built avatar, synthesizing photorealistic motion and appearance at ~ 60 FPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, achieving a PSNR of > 28 dB for novel poses, an end-to-end latency of ~ 80 ms, and > 1000x bandwidth reduction compared to point-cloud streaming, while supporting real-time operation from monocular inputs across diverse scenarios. Our demos can be found at https://mon3tr3d.github.io.

### IndicParam: Benchmark to evaluate LLMs on low-resource Indic Languages
**Authors**: Ayush Maheshwari, Kaushal Sharma, Vivek Patel, Aditya Maheshwari

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:16:09Z

**Summary**: While large language models excel on high-resource multilingual tasks, low- and extremely low-resource Indic languages remain severely under-evaluated. We present IndicParam, a human-curated benchmark of over 13,000 multiple-choice questions covering 11 such languages (Nepali, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia as low-resource; Dogri, Maithili, Rajasthani, Sanskrit, Bodo, Santali, Konkani as extremely low-resource) plus Sanskrit-English code-mixed set. We evaluated 20 LLMs, both proprietary and open-weights, which reveals that even the top-performing \texttt{Gemini-2.5} reaches 58\% average accuracy, followed by \texttt{GPT-5} (45) and \texttt{DeepSeek-3.2} (43.1). We additionally label each question as knowledge-oriented or purely linguistic to discriminate factual recall from grammatical proficiency. Further, we assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside conventional multiple-choice questions. \benchmark\ provides insights into limitations of cross-lingual transfer and establishes a challenging benchmark for Indic languages. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/bharatgenai/IndicParam. Scripts to run benchmark are present at https://github.com/ayushbits/IndicParam.

### Land-then-transport: A Flow Matching-Based Generative Decoder for Wireless Image Transmission
**Authors**: Jingwen Fu, Ming Xiao, Mikael Skoglund, Dong In Kim

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:09:37Z

**Summary**: Due to strict rate and reliability demands, wireless image transmission remains difficult for both classical layered designs and joint source-channel coding (JSCC), especially under low latency. Diffusion-based generative decoders can deliver strong perceptual quality by leveraging learned image priors, but iterative stochastic denoising leads to high decoding delay. To enable low-latency decoding, we propose a flow-matching (FM) generative decoder under a new land-then-transport (LTT) paradigm that tightly integrates the physical wireless channel into a continuous-time probability flow. For AWGN channels, we build a Gaussian smoothing path whose noise schedule indexes effective noise levels, and derive a closed-form teacher velocity field along this path. A neural-network student vector field is trained by conditional flow matching, yielding a deterministic, channel-aware ODE decoder with complexity linear in the number of ODE steps. At inference, it only needs an estimate of the effective noise variance to set the ODE starting time. We further show that Rayleigh fading and MIMO channels can be mapped, via linear MMSE equalization and singular-value-domain processing, to AWGN-equivalent channels with calibrated starting times. Therefore, the same probability path and trained velocity field can be reused for Rayleigh and MIMO without retraining. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and DIV2K over AWGN, Rayleigh, and MIMO demonstrate consistent gains over JPEG2000+LDPC, DeepJSCC, and diffusion-based baselines, while achieving good perceptual quality with only a few ODE steps. Overall, LTT provides a deterministic, physically interpretable, and computation-efficient framework for generative wireless image decoding across diverse channels.

### Judging Against the Reference: Uncovering Knowledge-Driven Failures in LLM-Judges on QA Evaluation
**Authors**: Dongryeol Lee, Yerin Hwang, Taegwan Kang, Minwoo Lee, Younhyung Chae, Kyomin Jung

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:05:13Z

**Summary**: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automatic judges for question answering (QA) and other reference-conditioned evaluation tasks, little is known about their ability to adhere to a provided reference. We identify a critical failure mode of such reference-based LLM QA evaluation: when the provided reference conflicts with the judge model's parametric knowledge, the resulting scores become unreliable, substantially degrading evaluation fidelity. To study this phenomenon systematically, we introduce a controlled swapped-reference QA framework that induces reference-belief conflicts. Specifically, we replace the reference answer with an incorrect entity and construct diverse pairings of original and swapped references with correspondingly aligned candidate answers. Surprisingly, grading reliability drops sharply under swapped references across a broad set of judge models. We empirically show that this vulnerability is driven by judges' over-reliance on parametric knowledge, leading judges to disregard the given reference under conflict. Finally, we find that this failure persists under common prompt-based mitigation strategies, highlighting a fundamental limitation of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and motivating reference-based protocols that enforce stronger adherence to the provided reference.

### FROAV: A Framework for RAG Observation and Agent Verification -- Lowering the Barrier to LLM Agent Research
**Authors**: Tzu-Hsuan Lin, Chih-Hsuan Kao

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:02:32Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their integration into autonomous agent systems has created unprecedented opportunities for document analysis, decision support, and knowledge retrieval. However, the complexity of developing, evaluating, and iterating on LLM-based agent workflows presents significant barriers to researchers, particularly those without extensive software engineering expertise. We present FROAV (Framework for RAG Observation and Agent Verification), an open-source research platform that democratizes LLM agent research by providing a plug-and-play architecture combining visual workflow orchestration, a comprehensive evaluation framework, and extensible Python integration. FROAV implements a multi-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline coupled with a rigorous "LLM-as-a-Judge" evaluation system, all accessible through intuitive graphical interfaces. Our framework integrates n8n for no-code workflow design, PostgreSQL for granular data management, FastAPI for flexible backend logic, and Streamlit for human-in-the-loop interaction. Through this integrated ecosystem, researchers can rapidly prototype RAG strategies, conduct prompt engineering experiments, validate agent performance against human judgments, and collect structured feedback-all without writing infrastructure code. We demonstrate the framework's utility through its application to financial document analysis, while emphasizing its material-agnostic architecture that adapts to any domain requiring semantic analysis. FROAV represents a significant step toward making LLM agent research accessible to a broader scientific community, enabling researchers to focus on hypothesis testing and algorithmic innovation rather than system integration challenges.

### Learning Design-Score Manifold to Guide Diffusion Models for Offline Optimization
**Authors**: Tailin Zhou, Zhilin Chen, Wenlong Lyu, Zhitang Chen, Danny H. K. Tsang, Jun Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:56:43Z

**Summary**: Optimizing complex systems, from discovering therapeutic drugs to designing high-performance materials, remains a fundamental challenge across science and engineering, as the underlying rules are often unknown and costly to evaluate. Offline optimization aims to optimize designs for target scores using pre-collected datasets without system interaction. However, conventional approaches may fail beyond training data, predicting inaccurate scores and generating inferior designs. This paper introduces ManGO, a diffusion-based framework that learns the design-score manifold, capturing the design-score interdependencies holistically. Unlike existing methods that treat design and score spaces in isolation, ManGO unifies forward prediction and backward generation, attaining generalization beyond training data. Key to this is its derivative-free guidance for conditional generation, coupled with adaptive inference-time scaling that dynamically optimizes denoising paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ManGO outperforms 24 single- and 10 multi-objective optimization methods across diverse domains, including synthetic tasks, robot control, material design, DNA sequence, and real-world engineering optimization.

### Graph Inference Towards ICD Coding
**Authors**: Xiaoxiao Deng

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:51:21Z

**Summary**: Automated ICD coding involves assigning standardized diagnostic codes to clinical narratives. The vast label space and extreme class imbalance continue to challenge precise prediction. To address these issues, LabGraph is introduced -- a unified framework that reformulates ICD coding as a graph generation task. By combining adversarial domain adaptation, graph-based reinforcement learning, and perturbation regularization, LabGraph effectively enhances model robustness and generalization. In addition, a label graph discriminator dynamically evaluates each generated code, providing adaptive reward feedback during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LabGraph consistently outperforms previous approaches on micro-F1, micro-AUC, and P@K.

**Authors**: Boris Sedlak, Alireza Furutanpey, Zihang Wang, Víctor Casamayor Pujol, Schahram Dustdar

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:51:01Z

**Summary**: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly, and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments and encourage future work in this research direction.

### Bridging the Linguistic Divide: A Survey on Leveraging Large Language Models for Machine Translation
**Authors**: Baban Gain, Dibyanayan Bandyopadhyay, Asif Ekbal, Trilok Nath Singh

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:46:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly reshaping machine translation (MT), particularly by introducing instruction-following, in-context learning, and preference-based alignment into what has traditionally been a supervised encoder-decoder paradigm. This survey provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of how LLMs are being leveraged for MT across data regimes, languages, and application settings. We systematically analyze prompting-based methods, parameter-efficient and full fine-tuning strategies, synthetic data generation, preference-based optimization, and reinforcement learning with human and weakly supervised feedback. Special attention is given to low-resource translation, where we examine the roles of synthetic data quality, diversity, and preference signals, as well as the limitations of current RLHF pipelines. We further review recent advances in Mixture-of-Experts models, MT-focused LLMs, and multilingual alignment, highlighting trade-offs between scalability, specialization, and accessibility. Beyond sentence-level translation, we survey emerging document-level and discourse-aware MT methods with LLMs, showing that most approaches extend sentence-level pipelines through structured context selection, post-editing, or reranking rather than requiring fundamentally new data regimes or architectures. Finally, we discuss LLM-based evaluation, its strengths and biases, and its role alongside learned metrics. Overall, this survey positions LLM-based MT as an evolution of traditional MT systems, where gains increasingly depend on data quality, preference alignment, and context utilization rather than scale alone, and outlines open challenges for building robust, inclusive, and controllable translation systems.

### Through the LLM Looking Glass: A Socratic Probing of Donkeys, Elephants, and Markets
**Authors**: Molly Kennedy, Ayyoob Imani, Timo Spinde, Akiko Aizawa, Hinrich Schütze

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:41:04Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for text generation, making it crucial to address potential bias. This study investigates ideological framing bias in LLM-generated articles, focusing on the subtle and subjective nature of such bias in journalistic contexts. We evaluate eight widely used LLMs on two datasets-POLIGEN and ECONOLEX-covering political and economic discourse where framing bias is most pronounced. Beyond text generation, LLMs are increasingly used as evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge), providing feedback that can shape human judgment or inform newer model versions. Inspired by the Socratic method, we further analyze LLMs' feedback on their own outputs to identify inconsistencies in their reasoning. Our results show that most LLMs can accurately annotate ideologically framed text, with GPT-4o achieving human-level accuracy and high agreement with human annotators. However, Socratic probing reveals that when confronted with binary comparisons, LLMs often exhibit preference toward one perspective or perceive certain viewpoints as less biased.

### JudgeFlow: Agentic Workflow Optimization via Block Judge
**Authors**: Zihan Ma, Zhikai Zhao, Chuanbo Hua, Federico Berto, Jinkyoo Park

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:30:14Z

**Summary**: Optimizing LLM-based agentic workflows is challenging for scaling AI capabilities. Current methods rely on coarse, end-to-end evaluation signals and lack fine-grained signals on where to refine, often resulting in inefficient or low-impact modifications. To address these limitations, we propose {\our{}}, an Evaluation-Judge-Optimization-Update pipeline. We incorporate reusable, configurable logic blocks into agentic workflows to capture fundamental forms of logic. On top of this abstraction, we design a dedicated Judge module that inspects execution traces -- particularly failed runs -- and assigns rank-based responsibility scores to problematic blocks. These fine-grained diagnostic signals are then leveraged by an LLM-based optimizer, which focuses modifications on the most problematic block in the workflow. Our approach improves sample efficiency, enhances interpretability through block-level diagnostics, and provides a scalable foundation for automating increasingly complex agentic workflows. We evaluate {\our{}} on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, where {\our{}} achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/ma-zihan/JudgeFlow.

### Practical do-Shapley Explanations with Estimand-Agnostic Causal Inference
**Authors**: Álvaro Parafita, Tomas Garriga, Axel Brando, Francisco J. Cazorla

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:28:25Z

**Summary**: Among explainability techniques, SHAP stands out as one of the most popular, but often overlooks the causal structure of the problem. In response, do-SHAP employs interventional queries, but its reliance on estimands hinders its practical application. To address this problem, we propose the use of estimand-agnostic approaches, which allow for the estimation of any identifiable query from a single model, making do-SHAP feasible on complex graphs. We also develop a novel algorithm to significantly accelerate its computation at a negligible cost, as well as a method to explain inaccessible Data Generating Processes. We demonstrate the estimation and computational performance of our approach, and validate it on two real-world datasets, highlighting its potential in obtaining reliable explanations.

### ARCQuant: Boosting NVFP4 Quantization with Augmented Residual Channels for LLMs
**Authors**: Haoqian Meng, Yilun Luo, Yafei Zhao, Wenyuan Liu, Peng Zhang, Xindian Ma

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:27:22Z

**Summary**: The emergence of fine-grained numerical formats like NVFP4 presents new opportunities for efficient Large Language Model (LLM) inference. However, it is difficult to adapt existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) strategies to these formats: rotation-based methods compromise fine-grained block isolation; smoothing techniques struggle with significant 4-bit quantization errors; and mixed-precision approaches often conflict with hardware constraints on unified-precision computation. To address these challenges, we propose ARCQuant, a framework that boosts NVFP4 performance via Augmented Residual Channels. Distinct from methods that compromise block isolation or hardware uniformity, ARCQuant maintains a strictly unified NVFP4 format by augmenting the activation matrix with quantized residual channels. This design integrates the error compensation process directly into the matrix reduction dimension, enabling the use of standard, highly optimized GEMM kernels with minimal overhead. Theoretical analysis confirms that the worst-case error bound of our dual-stage NVFP4 quantization is comparable to that of standard 8-bit formats such as MXFP8. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models demonstrate that ARCQuant achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, comparable to full-precision baselines in perplexity and downstream tasks. Furthermore, deployment on RTX 5090 and RTX PRO 6000 GPUs confirms practical benefits, achieving up to 3x speedup over FP16. Our code is available at https://github.com/actypedef/ARCQuant .

### Learning How to Remember: A Meta-Cognitive Management Method for Structured and Transferable Agent Memory
**Authors**: Sirui Liang, Pengfei Cao, Jian Zhao, Wenhao Teng, Xiangwen Liao, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:26:02Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on accumulated memory to solve long-horizon decision-making tasks. However, most existing approaches store memory in fixed representations and reuse it at a single or implicit level of abstraction, which limits generalization and often leads to negative transfer when distribution shift. This paper proposes the Meta-Cognitive Memory Abstraction method (MCMA), which treats memory abstraction as a learnable cognitive skill rather than a fixed design choice. MCMA decouples task execution from memory management by combining a frozen task model with a learned memory copilot. The memory copilot is trained using direct preference optimization, it determines how memories should be structured, abstracted, and reused. Memories are further organized into a hierarchy of abstraction levels, enabling selective reuse based on task similarity. When no memory is transferable, MCMA transfers the ability to abstract and manage memory by transferring the memory copilot. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and BabyAI demonstrate substantial improvements in performance, out-of-distribution generalization, and cross-task transfer over several baselines.

### Knowledge Distillation for LLM-Based Human Activity Recognition in Homes
**Authors**: Julien Cumin, Oussama Er-Rahmany, Xi Chen

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:25:53Z

**Summary**: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a central problem for context-aware applications, especially for smart homes and assisted living. A few very recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used for HAR at home, reaching high performance and addressing key challenges. In this paper, we provide new experimental results regarding the use of LLMs for HAR, on two state-of-the-art datasets. More specifically, we show how recognition performance evolves depending on the size of the LLM used. Moreover, we experiment on the use of knowledge distillation techniques to fine-tune smaller LLMs with HAR reasoning examples generated by larger LLMs. We show that such fine-tuned models can perform almost as well as the largest LLMs, while having 50 times less parameters.

### Beyond Dialogue Time: Temporal Semantic Memory for Personalized LLM Agents
**Authors**: Miao Su, Yucan Guo, Zhongni Hou, Long Bai, Zixuan Li, Yufei Zhang, Guojun Yin, Wei Lin, Xiaolong Jin, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:24:44Z

**Summary**: Memory enables Large Language Model (LLM) agents to perceive, store, and use information from past dialogues, which is essential for personalization. However, existing methods fail to properly model the temporal dimension of memory in two aspects: 1) Temporal inaccuracy: memories are organized by dialogue time rather than their actual occurrence time; 2) Temporal fragmentation: existing methods focus on point-wise memory, losing durative information that captures persistent states and evolving patterns. To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Semantic Memory (TSM), a memory framework that models semantic time for point-wise memory and supports the construction and utilization of durative memory. During memory construction, it first builds a semantic timeline rather than a dialogue one. Then, it consolidates temporally continuous and semantically related information into a durative memory. During memory utilization, it incorporates the query's temporal intent on the semantic timeline, enabling the retrieval of temporally appropriate durative memories and providing time-valid, duration-consistent context to support response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and LoCoMo show that TSM consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves up to 12.2% absolute improvement in accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Membership Inference Attacks on Tokenizers of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Meng Tong, Yuntao Du, Kejiang Chen, Weiming Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:20:50Z

**Summary**: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are widely used to assess the privacy risks associated with machine learning models. However, when these attacks are applied to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), they encounter significant challenges, including mislabeled samples, distribution shifts, and discrepancies in model size between experimental and real-world settings. To address these limitations, we introduce tokenizers as a new attack vector for membership inference. Specifically, a tokenizer converts raw text into tokens for LLMs. Unlike full models, tokenizers can be efficiently trained from scratch, thereby avoiding the aforementioned challenges. In addition, the tokenizer's training data is typically representative of the data used to pre-train LLMs. Despite these advantages, the potential of tokenizers as an attack vector remains unexplored. To this end, we present the first study on membership leakage through tokenizers and explore five attack methods to infer dataset membership. Extensive experiments on millions of Internet samples reveal the vulnerabilities in the tokenizers of state-of-the-art LLMs. To mitigate this emerging risk, we further propose an adaptive defense. Our findings highlight tokenizers as an overlooked yet critical privacy threat, underscoring the urgent need for privacy-preserving mechanisms specifically designed for them.

### IFDNS: An Iterative Feedback-Driven Neuro-Symbolic Method for Faithful Logical Reasoning
**Authors**: Xiaoheng Wang, Tongxuan Liu, Zi Gong, Xianzhe Dong, Yuting Zeng, Minhan Hu, Weizhe Huang, Jing Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:20:19Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of reasoning tasks, including logical and mathematical problem-solving. While prompt-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can enhance LLM reasoning abilities to some extent, they often suffer from a lack of faithfulness, where the derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, researchers have explored neuro-symbolic approaches to bolster LLM logical reasoning capabilities. However, existing neuro-symbolic methods still face challenges with information loss during the process. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Iterative Feedback-Driven Neuro-Symbolic (IFDNS), a novel prompt-based method that employs a multi-round feedback mechanism to address LLM limitations in handling complex logical relationships. IFDNS utilizes iterative feedback during the logic extraction phase to accurately extract causal relationship statements and translate them into propositional and logical implication expressions, effectively mitigating information loss issues. Furthermore, IFDNS is orthogonal to existing prompt methods, allowing for seamless integration with various prompting approaches. Empirical evaluations across six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IFDNS in significantly improving the performance of CoT and Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency (CoT-SC). Specifically, IFDNS achieves a +9.40% accuracy boost for CoT on the LogiQA dataset and a +11.70% improvement for CoT-SC on the PrOntoQA dataset.

### Puzzle it Out: Local-to-Global World Model for Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Sijia li, Xinran Li, Shibo Chen, Jun Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:17:11Z

**Summary**: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to solve cooperative decision-making problems in multi-agent systems using pre-collected datasets. Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning.

### ContextFocus: Activation Steering for Contextual Faithfulness in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Nikhil Anand, Shwetha Somasundaram, Anirudh Phukan, Apoorv Saxena, Koyel Mukherjee

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T11:51:25Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of parametric knowledge during pre-training. As world knowledge evolves, effective deployment increasingly depends on their ability to faithfully follow externally retrieved context. When such evidence conflicts with the model's internal knowledge, LLMs often default to memorized facts, producing unfaithful outputs. In this work, we introduce ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in such knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, our solution requires no model finetuning and incurs minimal inference-time overhead, making it highly efficient. We evaluate ContextFocus on the ConFiQA benchmark, comparing it against strong baselines including ContextDPO, COIECD, and prompting-based methods. Furthermore, we show that our method is complementary to prompting strategies and remains effective on larger models. Extensive experiments show that ContextFocus significantly improves contextual-faithfulness. Our results highlight the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of ContextFocus in improving contextual-faithfulness of LLM outputs.

### Intrinsic Memory Agents: Heterogeneous Multi-Agent LLM Systems through Structured Contextual Memory
**Authors**: Sizhe Yuen, Francisco Gomez Medina, Ting Su, Yali Du, Adam J. Sobey

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T11:46:09Z

**Summary**: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory that preserves specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information. Our approach utilises a generic memory template applicable to new problems without the need to hand-craft specific memory prompts. We benchmark our approach on the PDDL, FEVER, and ALFWorld datasets, comparing its performance to existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing state-of-the-art or comparable performance across all three, with the highest consistency. An additional evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, and we demonstrate that our approach produces higher quality designs across 5 metrics: scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness, and documentation, plus additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that addressing memory limitations through intrinsic approaches can improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning tasks.

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T11:45:46Z

**Summary**: We present photometric and spectroscopic studies of two core-collapse supernovae (SNe) 2008aq and 2019gaf in the optical wavelengths. Light curve and spectral sequence of both the SNe are similar to those of other Type IIb SNe. The pre-maximum spectrum of SN~2008aq showed prominent H $α$ lines, the He lines started appearing in the near maximum spectrum. The near maximum spectrum of SN~2019gaf shows shallow H$α$ absorption and He lines with almost similar strength. Both the SNe show transition from hydrogen-dominated spectra to helium-dominated spectra within a month after maximum brightness. The velocity evolution of SN~2008aq matches well with those of other well-studied Type IIb SNe, while SN~2019gaf shows higher velocities. Close to maximum light, the H $α$ and He I line velocities of SN~2019gaf are $\sim$ 2000 km sec$^{-1}$ and $\sim$ 4000 km sec$^{-1}$ higher than other well-studied Type IIb SNe. Semi-analytical modeling indicates SN~2019gaf to be a more energetic explosion with a smaller ejecta mass than SN~2008aq. The zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass of the progenitor estimated using the nebular spectra of SN~2008aq ranges between 13 to 20 M$_\odot$, while for SN~2019gaf, the inferred ZAMS mass is between 13 to 25 M$_\odot$. The [O I] to [Ca II] lines flux ratio favors a less massive progenitor star in a binary system for both the SNe.

### RLPO: Residual Listwise Preference Optimization for Long-Context Review Ranking
**Authors**: Hao Jiang, Zhi Yang, Annan Wang, Yichi Zhang, Weisi Lin

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T11:45:19Z

**Summary**: Review ranking is pivotal in e-commerce for prioritizing diagnostic and authentic feedback from the deluge of user-generated content. While large language models have improved semantic assessment, existing ranking paradigms face a persistent trade-off in long-context settings. Pointwise scoring is efficient but often fails to account for list-level interactions, leading to miscalibrated top-$k$ rankings. Listwise approaches can leverage global context, yet they are computationally expensive and become unstable as candidate lists grow. To address this, we propose Residual Listwise Preference Optimization (RLPO), which formulates ranking as listwise representation-level residual correction over a strong pointwise LLM scorer. RLPO first produces calibrated pointwise scores and item representations, then applies a lightweight encoder over the representations to predict listwise score residuals, avoiding full token-level listwise processing. We also introduce a large-scale benchmark for long-context review ranking with human verification. Experiments show RLPO improves NDCG@k over strong pointwise and listwise baselines and remains robust as list length increases.

### Noise enhances odor source localization
**Authors**: Francesco Marcolli, Martin James, Agnese Seminara

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T11:38:31Z

**Summary**: We address the problem of inferring the location of a target that releases odor in the presence of turbulence. Input for the inference is provided by many sensors scattered within the odor plume. Drawing inspiration from distributed chemosensation in biology, we ask whether the accuracy of the inference is affected by proprioceptive noise, i.e., noise on the perceived location of the sensors. Surprisingly, in the presence of a net fluid flow, proprioceptive noise improves Bayesian inference, rather than degrading it. An optimal noise exists that efficiently leverages additional information hidden within the geometry of the odor plume. Empirical tuning of noise functions well across a range of distances and may be implemented in practice. Other sources of noise also improve accuracy, owing to their ability to break the spatiotemporal correlations of the turbulent plume. These counterintuitive benefits of noise may be leveraged to improve sensory processing in biology and robotics.

**Authors**: Mohammed Himayath Ali, Mohammed Aqib Abdullah, Mohammed Mudassir Uddin, Shahnawaz Alam

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:59:45Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models have emerged as transformative tools for Security Operations Centers, enabling automated log analysis, phishing triage, and malware explanation; however, deployment in adversarial cybersecurity environments exposes critical vulnerabilities to prompt injection attacks where malicious instructions embedded in security artifacts manipulate model behavior. This paper introduces SecureCAI, a novel defense framework extending Constitutional AI principles with security-aware guardrails, adaptive constitution evolution, and Direct Preference Optimization for unlearning unsafe response patterns, addressing the unique challenges of high-stakes security contexts where traditional safety mechanisms prove insufficient against sophisticated adversarial manipulation. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SecureCAI reduces attack success rates by 94.7% compared to baseline models while maintaining 95.1% accuracy on benign security analysis tasks, with the framework incorporating continuous red-teaming feedback loops enabling dynamic adaptation to emerging attack strategies and achieving constitution adherence scores exceeding 0.92 under sustained adversarial pressure, thereby establishing a foundation for trustworthy integration of language model capabilities into operational cybersecurity workflows and addressing a critical gap in current approaches to AI safety within adversarial domains.

### Failure-Aware RL: Reliable Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning with Self-Recovery for Real-World Manipulation
**Authors**: Huanyu Li, Kun Lei, Sheng Zang, Kaizhe Hu, Yongyuan Liang, Bo An, Xiaoli Li, Huazhe Xu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:53:11Z

**Summary**: Post-training algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning can push the limits of robotic models for specific objectives, such as generalizability, accuracy, and robustness. However, Intervention-requiring Failures (IR Failures) (e.g., a robot spilling water or breaking fragile glass) during real-world exploration happen inevitably, hindering the practical deployment of such a paradigm. To tackle this, we introduce Failure-Aware Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (FARL), a new paradigm minimizing failures during real-world reinforcement learning. We create FailureBench, a benchmark that incorporates common failure scenarios requiring human intervention, and propose an algorithm that integrates a world-model-based safety critic and a recovery policy trained offline to prevent failures during online exploration. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FARL in significantly reducing IR Failures while improving performance and generalization during online reinforcement learning post-training. FARL reduces IR Failures by 73.1% while elevating performance by 11.3% on average during real-world RL post-training. Videos and code are available at https://failure-aware-rl.github.io.

### MixtureVitae: Open Web-Scale Pretraining Dataset With High Quality Instruction and Reasoning Data Built from Permissive-First Text Sources

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:44:30Z

**Summary**: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize legal risk while providing strong downstream performance. MixtureVitae follows a permissive-first, risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions (e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources). MixtureVitae adopts a simple, single-stage pretraining recipe that integrates a large proportion of permissive synthetic instruction and reasoning data-signals typically introduced during post-training and generally scarce in permissive web corpora. We categorize all sources into a three-tier scheme that reflects varying risk levels and provide shard-level provenance metadata to enable risk-aware usage. In controlled experiments using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures and hyperparameters; 50B and 300B token budgets across 130M-1.7B parameters), models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B-parameters/300B-tokens setting, they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM late in training. Performance is particularly strong on MMLU and on math and code benchmarks: a 1.7B model pretrained on 300B MixtureVitae tokens matches or exceeds a strong 1.7B instruction-tuned baseline on GSM8K, HumanEval, and MBPP, despite using over 36 times fewer tokens (300B vs. ~11T). Supported by a thorough decontamination analysis, these results show that permissive-first data with high instruction and reasoning density, tiered by licensing and provenance-related risk, can provide a practical and risk-mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing reliance on broad web scrapes without sacrificing competitiveness.

### The Confidence Trap: Gender Bias and Predictive Certainty in LLMs
**Authors**: Ahmed Sabir, Markus Kängsepp, Rajesh Sharma

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:38:05Z

**Summary**: The increased use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in sensitive domains leads to growing interest in how their confidence scores correspond to fairness and bias. This study examines the alignment between LLM-predicted confidence and human-annotated bias judgments. Focusing on gender bias, the research investigates probability confidence calibration in contexts involving gendered pronoun resolution. The goal is to evaluate if calibration metrics based on predicted confidence scores effectively capture fairness-related disparities in LLMs. The results show that, among the six state-of-the-art models, Gemma-2 demonstrates the worst calibration according to the gender bias benchmark. The primary contribution of this work is a fairness-aware evaluation of LLMs' confidence calibration, offering guidance for ethical deployment. In addition, we introduce a new calibration metric, Gender-ECE, designed to measure gender disparities in resolution tasks.

### Learning Through Dialogue: Unpacking the Dynamics of Human-LLM Conversations on Political Issues
**Authors**: Shaz Furniturewala, Gerard Christopher Yeo, Kokil Jaidka

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:10:21Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as conversational partners for learning, yet the interactional dynamics supporting users' learning and engagement are understudied. We analyze the linguistic and interactional features from both LLM and participant chats across 397 human-LLM conversations about socio-political issues to identify the mechanisms and conditions under which LLM explanations shape changes in political knowledge and confidence. Mediation analyses reveal that LLM explanatory richness partially supports confidence by fostering users' reflective insight, whereas its effect on knowledge gain operates entirely through users' cognitive engagement. Moderation analyses show that these effects are highly conditional and vary by political efficacy. Confidence gains depend on how high-efficacy users experience and resolve uncertainty. Knowledge gains depend on high-efficacy users' ability to leverage extended interaction, with longer conversations benefiting primarily reflective users. In summary, we find that learning from LLMs is an interactional achievement, not a uniform outcome of better explanations. The findings underscore the importance of aligning LLM explanatory behavior with users' engagement states to support effective learning in designing Human-AI interactive systems.

### Metaphors are a Source of Cross-Domain Misalignment of Large Reasoning Models
**Authors**: Zhibo Hu, Chen Wang, Yanfeng Shu, Hye-young Paik, Liming Zhu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:08:06Z

**Summary**: Earlier research has shown that metaphors influence human's decision making, which raises the question of whether metaphors also influence large language models (LLMs)' reasoning pathways, considering their training data contain a large number of metaphors. In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models. By monitoring these latent features, we design a detector that predict misaligned content with high accuracy.

### Kinship Data Benchmark for Multi-hop Reasoning
**Authors**: Tianda Sun, Dimitar Kazakov

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:07:41Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to perform multi-hop reasoning, i.e., to combine multiple pieces of information into a coherent inference. We introduce KinshipQA, a benchmark designed to probe this capability through reasoning over kinship relations. The central contribution of our work is a generative pipeline that produces, on demand, large-scale, realistic, and culture-specific genealogical data: collections of interconnected family trees that satisfy explicit marriage constraints associated with different kinship systems. This allows task difficulty, cultural assumptions, and relational depth to be systematically controlled and varied. From these genealogies, we derive textual inference tasks that require reasoning over implicit relational chains. We evaluate the resulting benchmark using six state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning both open-source and closed-source models, under a uniform zero-shot protocol with deterministic decoding. Performance is measured using exact-match and set-based metrics. Our results demonstrate that KinshipQA yields a wide spread of outcomes and exposes systematic differences in multi-hop reasoning across models and cultural settings.

### Benchmarking Small Language Models and Small Reasoning Language Models on System Log Severity Classification
**Authors**: Yahya Masri, Emily Ma, Zifu Wang, Joseph Rogers, Chaowei Yang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T18:02:33Z

**Summary**: System logs are crucial for monitoring and diagnosing modern computing infrastructure, but their scale and complexity require reliable and efficient automated interpretation. Since severity levels are predefined metadata in system log messages, having a model merely classify them offers limited standalone practical value, revealing little about its underlying ability to interpret system logs. We argue that severity classification is more informative when treated as a benchmark for probing runtime log comprehension rather than as an end task. Using real-world journalctl data from Linux production servers, we evaluate nine small language models (SLMs) and small reasoning language models (SRLMs) under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) prompting. The results reveal strong stratification. Qwen3-4B achieves the highest accuracy at 95.64% with RAG, while Gemma3-1B improves from 20.25% under few-shot prompting to 85.28% with RAG. Notably, the tiny Qwen3-0.6B reaches 88.12% accuracy despite weak performance without retrieval. In contrast, several SRLMs, including Qwen3-1.7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, degrade substantially when paired with RAG. Efficiency measurements further separate models: most Gemma and Llama variants complete inference in under 1.2 seconds per log, whereas Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning exceeds 228 seconds per log while achieving <10% accuracy. These findings suggest that (1) architectural design, (2) training objectives, and (3) the ability to integrate retrieved context under strict output constraints jointly determine performance. By emphasizing small, deployable models, this benchmark aligns with real-time requirements of digital twin (DT) systems and shows that severity classification serves as a lens for evaluating model competence and real-time deployability, with implications for root cause analysis (RCA) and broader DT integration.

### "TODO: Fix the Mess Gemini Created": Towards Understanding GenAI-Induced Self-Admitted Technical Debt
**Authors**: Abdullah Al Mujahid, Mia Mohammad Imran

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:59:34Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and Gemini become integrated into software development workflows, developers increasingly leave traces of AI involvement in their code comments. Among these, some comments explicitly acknowledge both the use of generative AI and the presence of technical shortcomings. Analyzing 6,540 LLM-referencing code comments from public Python and JavaScript-based GitHub repositories (November 2022-July 2025), we identified 81 that also self-admit technical debt(SATD). Developers most often describe postponed testing, incomplete adaptation, and limited understanding of AI-generated code, suggesting that AI assistance affects both when and why technical debt emerges. We term GenAI-Induced Self-admitted Technical debt (GIST) as a proposed conceptual lens to describe recurring cases where developers incorporate AI-generated code while explicitly expressing uncertainty about its behavior or correctness.

### Beyond Single-Shot: Multi-step Tool Retrieval via Query Planning
**Authors**: Wei Fang, James Glass

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:58:39Z

**Summary**: LLM agents operating over massive, dynamic tool libraries rely on effective retrieval, yet standard single-shot dense retrievers struggle with complex requests. These failures primarily stem from the disconnect between abstract user goals and technical documentation, and the limited capacity of fixed-size embeddings to model combinatorial tool compositions. To address these challenges, we propose TOOLQP, a lightweight framework that models retrieval as iterative query planning. Instead of single-shot matching, TOOLQP decomposes instructions into sub-tasks and dynamically generates queries to interact with the retriever, effectively bridging the semantic gap by targeting the specific sub-tasks required for composition. We train TOOLQP using synthetic query trajectories followed by optimization via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Experiments demonstrate that TOOLQP achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization, robustness across diverse retrievers, and significant improvements in downstream agentic execution.

### Enhancing Self-Correction in Large Language Models through Multi-Perspective Reflection
**Authors**: Mariana Costa, Alberlucia Rafael Soarez, Daniel Kim, Camila Ferreira

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:57:05Z

**Summary**: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting advances LLM reasoning, challenges persist in consistency, accuracy, and self-correction, especially for complex or ethically sensitive tasks. Existing single-dimensional reflection methods offer insufficient improvements. We propose MyGO Poly-Reflective Chain-of-Thought (PR-CoT), a novel methodology employing structured multi-perspective reflection. After initial CoT, PR-CoT guides the LLM to self-assess its reasoning across multiple predefined angles: logical consistency, information completeness, biases/ethics, and alternative solutions. Implemented purely via prompt engineering, this process refines the initial CoT into a more robust and accurate final answer without model retraining. Experiments across arithmetic, commonsense, ethical decision-making, and logical puzzles, using GPT-three point five and GPT-four models, demonstrate PR-CoT's superior performance. It significantly outperforms traditional CoT and existing reflection methods in logical consistency and error correction, with notable gains in nuanced domains like ethical decision-making. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and qualitative analyses further validate the contribution of each reflection perspective and the overall efficacy of our poly-reflective paradigm in fostering more reliable LLM reasoning.

### Towards Mitigating Excessive Forgetting in LLM Unlearning via Entanglement-Guidance with Proxy Constraint
**Authors**: Zhihao Liu, Jian Lou, Yuke Hu, Xiaochen Li, Yitian Chen, Tailun Chen, Zhizhen Qin, Kui Ren, Zhan Qin

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:50:04Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns, data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific data without full retraining. However, most existing methods still suffer from over-unlearning due to the lack of a principled mechanism to regulate the forgetting boundary, leading to unnecessary utility degradation and heightened privacy and robustness risks. In this work, we propose EGUP (Entanglement-Guided Unlearning with Proxy Constraint), a novel framework that leverages entanglement and proxy constraint to guide the unlearning process while mitigating over-unlearning. Within each iteration, EGUP employs inter-sample entanglement to adaptively reweight the unlearning strength, assigning greater unlearning efforts to forget samples that are semantically closer to retained knowledge. Across iterations, EGUP leverages intra-sample entanglement to track the representation shift of each forget sample and dynamically adjust its unlearning effort. In addition, we incorporate a proxy constraint that approximates the model's expected outputs after unlearning, forming a reference boundary that softly regularizes the unlearning process. EGUP is compatible with existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement. We evaluate EGUP on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements in the unlearning-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Moreover, EGUP achieves performance close to the retrained model while remaining scalable and robust.

### Are LLM Decisions Faithful to Verbal Confidence?
**Authors**: Jiawei Wang, Yanfei Zhou, Siddartha Devic, Deqing Fu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:49:51Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce surprisingly sophisticated estimates of their own uncertainty. However, it remains unclear to what extent this expressed confidence is tied to the reasoning, knowledge, or decision making of the model. To test this, we introduce $\textbf{RiskEval}$: a framework designed to evaluate whether models adjust their abstention policies in response to varying error penalties. Our evaluation of several frontier models reveals a critical dissociation: models are neither cost-aware when articulating their verbal confidence, nor strategically responsive when deciding whether to engage or abstain under high-penalty conditions. Even when extreme penalties render frequent abstention the mathematically optimal strategy, models almost never abstain, resulting in utility collapse. This indicates that calibrated verbal confidence scores may not be sufficient to create trustworthy and interpretable AI systems, as current models lack the strategic agency to convert uncertainty signals into optimal and risk-sensitive decisions.

### Contrastive Learning with Narrative Twins for Modeling Story Salience
**Authors**: Igor Sterner, Alex Lascarides, Frank Keller

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:48:46Z

**Summary**: Understanding narratives requires identifying which events are most salient for a story's progression. We present a contrastive learning framework for modeling narrative salience that learns story embeddings from narrative twins: stories that share the same plot but differ in surface form. Our model is trained to distinguish a story from both its narrative twin and a distractor with similar surface features but different plot. Using the resulting embeddings, we evaluate four narratologically motivated operations for inferring salience (deletion, shifting, disruption, and summarization). Experiments on short narratives from the ROCStories corpus and longer Wikipedia plot summaries show that contrastively learned story embeddings outperform a masked-language-model baseline, and that summarization is the most reliable operation for identifying salient sentences. If narrative twins are not available, random dropout can be used to generate the twins from a single story. Effective distractors can be obtained either by prompting LLMs or, in long-form narratives, by using different parts of the same story.

### Comparing three learn-then-test paradigms in a multivariate normal means problem
**Authors**: Abhinav Chakraborty, Junu Lee, Eugene Katsevich

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:48:22Z

**Summary**: Many modern procedures use the data to learn a structure and then leverage it to test many hypotheses. If the entire data is used at both stages, analytical or computational corrections for selection bias are required to ensure validity (post-learning adjustment). Alternatively, one can learn and/or test on masked versions of the data to avoid selection bias, either via information splitting or null augmentation}. Choosing among these three learn-then-test paradigms, and how much masking to employ for the latter two, are critical decisions impacting power that currently lack theoretical guidance. In a multivariate normal means model, we derive asymptotic power formulas for prototypical methods from each paradigm -- variants of sample splitting, conformal-style null augmentation, and resampling-based post-learning adjustment -- quantifying the power losses incurred by masking at each stage. For these paradigm representatives, we find that post-learning adjustment is most powerful, followed by null augmentation, and then information splitting. Moreover, null augmentation can be nearly as powerful as post-learning adjustment, while avoiding its challenges: the power of the former approaches that of the latter if the number of nulls used for augmentation is a vanishing fraction of the number of hypotheses. We also prove for a tractable proxy that the optimal number of nulls scales as the square root of the number of hypotheses, challenging existing heuristics. Finally, we characterize optimal tuning for information splitting by identifying an optimal split fraction and tying it to the difficulty of the learning problem. These results establish a theoretical foundation for key decisions in the deployment of learn-then-test methods.

### Structure First, Reason Next: Enhancing a Large Language Model using Knowledge Graph for Numerical Reasoning in Financial Documents
**Authors**: Aryan Mishra, Akash Anil

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:39:08Z

**Summary**: Numerical reasoning is an important task in the analysis of financial documents. It helps in understanding and performing numerical predictions with logical conclusions for the given query seeking answers from financial texts. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in multiple Question-Answering (Q-A) systems with the capability of logical reasoning. As documents related to finance often consist of long and complex financial contexts, LLMs appear well-suited for building high-quality automated financial question-answering systems. However, LLMs often face challenges in accurately processing the various numbers within financial reports. Extracting numerical data from unstructured text and semi-structured tables, and reliably performing accurate calculations, remains a significant bottleneck for numerical reasoning in most state-of-the-art LLMs. Recent studies have shown that structured data augmentations, such as Knowledge Graphs (KGs), have notably improved the predictions of LLMs along with logical explanations. Thus, it is an important requirement to consider inherent structured information in financial reports while using LLMs for various financial analytics. This paper proposes a framework to incorporate structured information using KGs along with LLM predictions for numerical reasoning tasks. The KGs are extracted using a proposed schema inherently from the document under processing. We evaluated our proposed framework over the benchmark data FinQA, using an open-source LLM, namely Llama 3.1 8B Instruct. We observed that the proposed framework improved execution accuracy by approximately 12% relative to the vanilla LLM.

### Cost-Awareness in Tree-Search LLM Planning: A Systematic Study
**Authors**: Zihao Zhang, Hui Wei, Kenan Jiang, Shijia Pan, Shu Kai, Fei Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:29:58Z

**Summary**: Planning under resource constraints is central to real-world decision making, yet most large language model (LLM) planners assume uniform action costs. We systematically analyze whether tree-search LLM planners are cost-aware and whether they efficiently generate budget-feasible plans. In contrast to black-box prompting, explicit search trees expose intermediate decisions, node evaluations, and failure modes, which allows for controlled ablations of planner behavior. We study depth-first search, breadth-first search, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and bidirectional search within a unified framework. Our experiments show that existing tree-based LLM planners often struggle to find cost-optimal plans, and that additional search computation does not reliably improve optimality. Among the methods evaluated, bidirectional search achieves the best overall efficiency and success rate. MCTS achieves the highest optimality on short-horizon tasks. Tree-search planners are especially valuable for studying LLM planning because their reasoning steps are explicit, in contrast to plain LLMs that internalize planning dynamics through post-training trajectories. Our findings suggest that improving LLM planning under resource constraints will likely require new search algorithms, rather than solely scaling inference-time compute.

### FBFL: A Field-Based Coordination Approach for Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning
**Authors**: Davide Domini, Gianluca Aguzzi, Lukas Esterle, Mirko Viroli

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T17:08:29Z

**Summary**: In the last years, Federated learning (FL) has become a popular solution to train machine learning models in domains with high privacy concerns. However, FL scalability and performance face significant challenges in real-world deployments where data across devices are non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID). The heterogeneity in data distribution frequently arises from spatial distribution of devices, leading to degraded model performance in the absence of proper handling. Additionally, FL typical reliance on centralized architectures introduces bottlenecks and single-point-of-failure risks, particularly problematic at scale or in dynamic environments. To close this gap, we propose Field-Based Federated Learning (FBFL), a novel approach leveraging macroprogramming and field coordination to address these limitations through: (i) distributed spatial-based leader election for personalization to mitigate non-IID data challenges; and (ii) construction of a self-organizing, hierarchical architecture using advanced macroprogramming patterns. Moreover, FBFL not only overcomes the aforementioned limitations, but also enables the development of more specialized models tailored to the specific data distribution in each subregion. This paper formalizes FBFL and evaluates it extensively using MNIST, FashionMNIST, and Extended MNIST datasets. We demonstrate that, when operating under IID data conditions, FBFL performs comparably to the widely-used FedAvg algorithm. Furthermore, in challenging non-IID scenarios, FBFL not only outperforms FedAvg but also surpasses other state-of-the-art methods, namely FedProx and Scaffold, which have been specifically designed to address non-IID data distributions. Additionally, we showcase the resilience of FBFL's self-organizing hierarchical architecture against server failures.

### Hiking in the Wild: A Scalable Perceptive Parkour Framework for Humanoids
**Authors**: Shaoting Zhu, Ziwen Zhuang, Mengjie Zhao, Kun-Ying Lee, Hang Zhao

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T16:50:50Z

**Summary**: Achieving robust humanoid hiking in complex, unstructured environments requires transitioning from reactive proprioception to proactive perception. However, integrating exteroception remains a significant challenge: mapping-based methods suffer from state estimation drift; for instance, LiDAR-based methods do not handle torso jitter well. Existing end-to-end approaches often struggle with scalability and training complexity; specifically, some previous works using virtual obstacles are implemented case-by-case. In this work, we present \textit{Hiking in the Wild}, a scalable, end-to-end parkour perceptive framework designed for robust humanoid hiking. To ensure safety and training stability, we introduce two key mechanisms: a foothold safety mechanism combining scalable \textit{Terrain Edge Detection} with \textit{Foot Volume Points} to prevent catastrophic slippage on edges, and a \textit{Flat Patch Sampling} strategy that mitigates reward hacking by generating feasible navigation targets. Our approach utilizes a single-stage reinforcement learning scheme, mapping raw depth inputs and proprioception directly to joint actions, without relying on external state estimation. Extensive field experiments on a full-size humanoid demonstrate that our policy enables robust traversal of complex terrains at speeds up to 2.5 m/s. The training and deployment code is open-sourced to facilitate reproducible research and deployment on real robots with minimal hardware modifications.

### Is Agentic RAG worth it? An experimental comparison of RAG approaches
**Authors**: Pietro Ferrazzi, Milica Cvjeticanin, Alessio Piraccini, Davide Giannuzzi

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T16:43:44Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are usually defined by the combination of a generator and a retrieval component that extracts textual context from a knowledge base to answer user queries. However, such basic implementations exhibit several limitations, including noisy or suboptimal retrieval, misuse of retrieval for out-of-scope queries, weak query-document matching, and variability or cost associated with the generator. These shortcomings have motivated the development of "Enhanced" RAG, where dedicated modules are introduced to address specific weaknesses in the workflow. More recently, the growing self-reflective capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new paradigm, which we refer to as "Agentic" RAG. In this approach, the LLM orchestrates the entire process-deciding which actions to perform, when to perform them, and whether to iterate-thereby reducing reliance on fixed, manually engineered modules. Despite the rapid adoption of both paradigms, it remains unclear which approach is preferable under which conditions. In this work, we conduct an extensive, empirically driven evaluation of Enhanced and Agentic RAG across multiple scenarios and dimensions. Our results provide practical insights into the trade-offs between the two paradigms, offering guidance on selecting the most effective RAG design for real-world applications, considering both costs and performance.

### Exploring the Meta-level Reasoning of Large Language Models via a Tool-based Multi-hop Tabular Question Answering Task
**Authors**: Nick Ferguson, Alan Bundy, Kwabena Nuamah

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T16:29:21Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly focused on "reasoning" ability, a concept with many overlapping definitions in the LLM discourse. We take a more structured approach, distinguishing meta-level reasoning (denoting the process of reasoning about intermediate steps required to solve a task) from object-level reasoning (which concerns the low-level execution of the aforementioned steps.) We design a novel question answering task, which is based around the values of geopolitical indicators for various countries over various years. Questions require breaking down into intermediate steps, retrieval of data, and mathematical operations over that data. The meta-level reasoning ability of LLMs is analysed by examining the selection of appropriate tools for answering questions. To bring greater depth to the analysis of LLMs beyond final answer accuracy, our task contains 'essential actions' against which we can compare the tool call output of LLMs to infer the strength of reasoning ability. We find that LLMs demonstrate good meta-level reasoning on our task, yet are flawed in some aspects of task understanding. We find that n-shot prompting has little effect on accuracy; error messages encountered do not often deteriorate performance; and provide additional evidence for the poor numeracy of LLMs. Finally, we discuss the generalisation and limitation of our findings to other task domains.

### The CASE Framework -- A New Architecture for Participatory Research and Digital Health Surveillance
**Authors**: Marco Hirsch, Peter Hevesi, Paul Lukowicz

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T16:06:36Z

**Summary**: We present CASE, an open-source framework for adaptive participatory research and disease surveillance. Unlike traditional survey platforms with static branching logic, CASE uses an event-driven architecture that adjusts survey workflows in real time based on participant responses, external data, temporal conditions, and evolving participant state. This design supports everything from simple one-time questionnaires to complex longitudinal studies with sophisticated conditional logic.   Built on over a decade of practical experience, CASE underwent major architectural changes in 2024. We replaced a complex microservice design with a streamlined monolithic architecture, significantly improving maintainability and deployment accessibility, particularly for institutions with limited technical resources.   CASE has been successfully deployed across diverse domains, powering national disease surveillance platforms, supporting post-COVID cohort studies, and enabling real-time sentiment analysis during political events. These applications, involving tens of thousands of participants, demonstrate the framework's scalability, versatility, and practical value.   This paper describes the foundations of CASE, documents its architectural evolution, and shares lessons learned from real-world deployments across diverse research domains and regulatory environments. We position CASE as a mature research infrastructure that balances sophisticated functionality with practical deployment needs for sustainable and institutionally controlled data collection systems.

### Adaptive Layer Selection for Layer-Wise Token Pruning in LLM Inference
**Authors**: Rei Taniguchi, Yuyang Dong, Makoto Onizuka, Chuan Xiao

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:47:35Z

**Summary**: Due to the prevalence of large language models (LLMs), key-value (KV) cache reduction for LLM inference has received remarkable attention. Among numerous works that have been proposed in recent years, layer-wise token pruning approaches, which select a subset of tokens at particular layers to retain in KV cache and prune others, are one of the most popular schemes. They primarily adopt a set of pre-defined layers, at which tokens are selected. Such design is inflexible in the sense that the accuracy significantly varies across tasks and deteriorates in harder tasks such as KV retrieval. In this paper, we propose ASL, a training-free method that adaptively chooses the selection layer for KV cache reduction, exploiting the variance of token ranks ordered by attention score. The proposed method balances the performance across different tasks while meeting the user-specified KV budget requirement. ASL operates during the prefilling stage and can be jointly used with existing KV cache reduction methods such as SnapKV to optimize the decoding stage. By evaluations on the InfiniteBench, RULER, and NIAH benchmarks, we show that equipped with one-shot token selection, where tokens are selected at a layer and propagated to deeper layers, ASL outperforms state-of-the-art layer-wise token selection methods in accuracy while maintaining decoding speed and KV cache reduction.

### Order in the Evaluation Court: A Critical Analysis of NLG Evaluation Trends
**Authors**: Jing Yang, Nils Feldhus, Salar Mohtaj, Leonhard Hennig, Qianli Wang, Eleni Metheniti, Sherzod Hakimov, Charlott Jakob, Veronika Solopova, Konrad Rieck, David Schlangen, Sebastian Möller, Vera Schmitt

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:27:58Z

**Summary**: Despite advances in Natural Language Generation (NLG), evaluation remains challenging. Although various new metrics and LLM-as-a-judge (LaaJ) methods are proposed, human judgment persists as the gold standard. To systematically review how NLG evaluation has evolved, we employ an automatic information extraction scheme to gather key information from NLG papers, focusing on different evaluation methods (metrics, LaaJ and human evaluation). With extracted metadata from 14,171 papers across four major conferences (ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and INLG) over the past six years, we reveal several critical findings: (1) Task Divergence: While Dialogue Generation demonstrates a rapid shift toward LaaJ (>40% in 2025), Machine Translation remains locked into n-gram metrics, and Question Answering exhibits a substantial decline in the proportion of studies conducting human evaluation. (2) Metric Inertia: Despite the development of semantic metrics, general-purpose metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) continue to be widely used across tasks without empirical justification, often lacking the discriminative power to distinguish between specific quality criteria. (3) Human-LaaJ Divergence: Our association analysis challenges the assumption that LLMs act as mere proxies for humans; LaaJ and human evaluations prioritize very different signals, and explicit validation is scarce (<8% of papers comparing the two), with only moderate to low correlation. Based on these observations, we derive practical recommendations to improve the rigor of future NLG evaluation.

### Studying the Role of Synthetic Data for Machine Learning-based Wireless Networks Traffic Forecasting
**Authors**: José Pulido, Francesc Wilhelmi, Sergio Fortes, Alfonso Fernández-Durán, Lorenzo Galati Giordano, Raquel Barco

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:27:55Z

**Summary**: Synthetic data generation is an appealing tool for augmenting and enriching datasets, playing a crucial role in advancing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Not only does synthetic data help build robust AI/ML datasets cost-effectively, but it also offers privacy-friendly solutions and bypasses the complexities of storing large data volumes. This paper proposes a novel method to generate synthetic data, based on first-order auto-regressive noise statistics, for large-scale Wi-Fi deployments. The approach operates with minimal real data requirements while producing statistically rich traffic patterns that effectively mimic real Access Point (AP) behavior. Experimental results show that ML models trained on synthetic data achieve Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values within 10 to 15 of those obtained using real data when trained on the same APs, while requiring significantly less training data. Moreover, when generalization is required, synthetic-data-trained models improve prediction accuracy by up to 50 percent compared to real-data-trained baselines, thanks to the enhanced variability and diversity of the generated traces. Overall, the proposed method bridges the gap between synthetic data generation and practical Wi-Fi traffic forecasting, providing a scalable, efficient, and real-time solution for modern wireless networks.

### Beyond Static Tools: Test-Time Tool Evolution for Scientific Reasoning
**Authors**: Jiaxuan Lu, Ziyu Kong, Yemin Wang, Rong Fu, Haiyuan Wan, Cheng Yang, Wenjie Lou, Haoran Sun, Lilong Wang, Yankai Jiang, Xiaosong Wang, Xiao Sun, Dongzhan Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:22:51Z

**Summary**: The central challenge of AI for Science is not reasoning alone, but the ability to create computational methods in an open-ended scientific world. Existing LLM-based agents rely on static, pre-defined tool libraries, a paradigm that fundamentally fails in scientific domains where tools are sparse, heterogeneous, and intrinsically incomplete. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Tool Evolution (TTE), a new paradigm that enables agents to synthesize, verify, and evolve executable tools during inference. By transforming tools from fixed resources into problem-driven artifacts, TTE overcomes the rigidity and long-tail limitations of static tool libraries. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciEvo, a benchmark comprising 1,590 scientific reasoning tasks supported by 925 automatically evolved tools. Extensive experiments show that TTE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and tool efficiency, while enabling effective cross-domain adaptation of computational tools. The code and benchmark have been released at https://github.com/lujiaxuan0520/Test-Time-Tool-Evol.

### Beyond Sharpness: A Flatness Decomposition Framework for Efficient Continual Learning
**Authors**: Yanan Chen, Tieliang Gong, Yunjiao Zhang, Wen Wen

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:17:04Z

**Summary**: Continual Learning (CL) aims to enable models to sequentially learn multiple tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. Recent studies have shown that optimizing towards flatter loss minima can improve model generalization. However, existing sharpness-aware methods for CL suffer from two key limitations: (1) they treat sharpness regularization as a unified signal without distinguishing the contributions of its components. and (2) they introduce substantial computational overhead that impedes practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose FLAD, a novel optimization framework that decomposes sharpness-aware perturbations into gradient-aligned and stochastic-noise components, and show that retaining only the noise component promotes generalization. We further introduce a lightweight scheduling scheme that enables FLAD to maintain significant performance gains even under constrained training time. FLAD can be seamlessly integrated into various CL paradigms and consistently outperforms standard and sharpness-aware optimizers in diverse experimental settings, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality in CL.

### GeoMotionGPT: Geometry-Aligned Motion Understanding with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhankai Ye, Bofan Li, Yukai Jin, Shuoqiu Li, Wei Wang, Yanfu Zhang, Shangqian Gao, Xin Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:14:29Z

**Summary**: Discrete motion tokenization has recently enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as versatile backbones for motion understanding and motion-language reasoning. However, existing pipelines typically decouple motion quantization from semantic embedding learning, linking them solely via token IDs. This approach fails to effectively align the intrinsic geometry of the motion space with the embedding space, thereby hindering the LLM's capacity for nuanced motion reasoning. We argue that alignment is most effective when both modalities share a unified geometric basis. Therefore, instead of forcing the LLM to reconstruct the complex geometry among motion tokens from scratch, we present a novel framework that explicitly enforces orthogonality on both the motion codebook and the LLM embedding space, ensuring that their relational structures naturally mirror each other. Specifically, we employ a decoder-only quantizer with Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable training and balanced codebook usage. To bridge the modalities, we use a sparse projection that maps motion codes into the LLM embedding space while preserving orthogonality. Finally, a two-stage orthonormal regularization schedule enforces soft constraints during tokenizer training and LLM fine-tuning to maintain geometric alignment without hindering semantic adaptation. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D demonstrate that our framework achieves a 20% performance improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, validating that a unified geometric basis effectively empowers the LLM for nuanced motion reasoning.

### Integrating Machine-Generated Short Descriptions into the Wikipedia Android App: A Pilot Deployment of Descartes
**Authors**: Marija Šakota, Dmitry Brant, Cooltey Feng, Shay Nowick, Amal Ramadan, Robin Schoenbaechler, Joseph Seddon, Jazmin Tanner, Isaac Johnson, Robert West

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:13:35Z

**Summary**: Short descriptions are a key part of the Wikipedia user experience, but their coverage remains uneven across languages and topics. In previous work, we introduced Descartes, a multilingual model for generating short descriptions. In this report, we present the results of a pilot deployment of Descartes in the Wikipedia Android app, where editors were offered suggestions based on outputs from Descartes while editing short descriptions. The experiment spanned 12 languages, with over 3,900 articles and 375 editors participating. Overall, 90% of accepted Descartes descriptions were rated at least 3 out of 5 in quality, and their average ratings were comparable to human-written ones. Editors adopted machine suggestions both directly and with modifications, while the rate of reverts and reports remained low. The pilot also revealed practical considerations for deployment, including latency, language-specific gaps, and the need for safeguards around sensitive topics. These results indicate that Descartes's short descriptions can support editors in reducing content gaps, provided that technical, design, and community guardrails are in place.

### A Disproof of Large Language Model Consciousness: The Necessity of Continual Learning for Consciousness
**Authors**: Erik Hoel

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:06:05Z

**Summary**: Scientific theories of consciousness should be falsifiable and non-trivial. Recent research has given us formal tools to analyze these requirements of falsifiability and non-triviality for theories of consciousness. Surprisingly, many contemporary theories of consciousness fail to pass this bar, including theories based on causal structure but also (as I demonstrate) theories based on function. Herein I show these requirements of falsifiability and non-triviality especially constrain the potential consciousness of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) because of their proximity to systems that are equivalent to LLMs in terms of input/output function; yet, for these functionally equivalent systems, there cannot be any falsifiable and non-trivial theory of consciousness that judges them conscious. This forms the basis of a disproof of contemporary LLM consciousness. I then show a positive result, which is that theories of consciousness based on (or requiring) continual learning do satisfy the stringent formal constraints for a theory of consciousness in humans. Intriguingly, this work supports a hypothesis: If continual learning is linked to consciousness in humans, the current limitations of LLMs (which do not continually learn) are intimately tied to their lack of consciousness.

### TALM: Dynamic Tree-Structured Multi-Agent Framework with Long-Term Memory for Scalable Code Generation
**Authors**: Ming-Tung Shen, Yuh-Jzer Joung

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T15:04:16Z

**Summary**: Agentic code generation requires large language models (LLMs) capable of complex context management and multi-step reasoning. Prior multi-agent frameworks attempt to address these challenges through collaboration, yet they often suffer from rigid workflows and high reasoning recovery costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose TALM (Tree-Structured Multi-Agent Framework with Long-Term Memory), a dynamic framework that integrates structured task decomposition, localized re-reasoning, and long-term memory mechanisms. TALM employs an extensible tree-based collaboration structure. The parent-child relationships, when combined with a divide-and-conquer strategy, enhance reasoning flexibility and enable efficient error correction across diverse task scopes. Furthermore, a long-term memory module enables semantic querying and integration of prior knowledge, supporting implicit self-improvement through experience reuse. Experimental results on HumanEval, BigCodeBench, and ClassEval benchmarks demonstrate that TALM consistently delivers strong reasoning performance and high token efficiency, highlighting its robustness and practical utility in complex code generation tasks.

### DIAGPaper: Diagnosing Valid and Specific Weaknesses in Scientific Papers via Multi-Agent Reasoning
**Authors**: Zhuoyang Zou, Abolfazl Ansari, Delvin Ce Zhang, Dongwon Lee, Wenpeng Yin

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:59:00Z

**Summary**: Paper weakness identification using single-agent or multi-agent LLMs has attracted increasing attention, yet existing approaches exhibit key limitations. Many multi-agent systems simulate human roles at a surface level, missing the underlying criteria that lead experts to assess complementary intellectual aspects of a paper. Moreover, prior methods implicitly assume identified weaknesses are valid, ignoring reviewer bias, misunderstanding, and the critical role of author rebuttals in validating review quality. Finally, most systems output unranked weakness lists, rather than prioritizing the most consequential issues for users. In this work, we propose DIAGPaper, a novel multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges through three tightly integrated modules. The customizer module simulates human-defined review criteria and instantiates multiple reviewer agents with criterion-specific expertise. The rebuttal module introduces author agents that engage in structured debate with reviewer agents to validate and refine proposed weaknesses. The prioritizer module learns from large-scale human review practices to assess the severity of validated weaknesses and surfaces the top-K severest ones to users. Experiments on two benchmarks, AAAR and ReviewCritique, demonstrate that DIAGPaper substantially outperforms existing methods by producing more valid and more paper-specific weaknesses, while presenting them in a user-oriented, prioritized manner.

### The Curious Case of Factual (Mis)Alignment between LLMs' Short- and Long-Form Answers
**Authors**: Saad Obaid ul Islam, Anne Lauscher, Goran Glavaš

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:54:11Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer "When was Einstein born?" yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work, we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs' trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.

### OODEval: Evaluating Large Language Models on Object-Oriented Design
**Authors**: Bingxu Xiao, Yunwei Dong, Yiqi Tang, Manqing Zhang, Yifan Zhou, Chunyan Ma, Yepang Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:51:31Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven extensive evaluations in software engineering. however, most prior work concentrates on code-level tasks, leaving software design capabilities underexplored. To fill this gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating 29 LLMs on object-oriented design (OOD) tasks. Owing to the lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics, we introduce OODEval, a manually constructed benchmark comprising 50 OOD tasks of varying difficulty, and OODEval-Human, the first human-rated OOD benchmark, which includes 940 undergraduate-submitted class diagrams evaluated by instructors. We further propose CLUE (Class Likeness Unified Evaluation), a unified metric set that assesses both global correctness and fine-grained design quality in class diagram generation. Using these benchmarks and metrics, we investigate five research questions: overall correctness, comparison with humans, model dimension analysis, task feature analysis, and bad case analysis. The results indicate that while LLMs achieve high syntactic accuracy, they exhibit substantial semantic deficiencies, particularly in method and relationship generation. Among the evaluated models, Qwen3-Coder-30B achieves the best overall performance, rivaling DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4o, while Gemma3-4B-IT outperforms GPT-4o-Mini despite its smaller parameter scale. Although top-performing LLMs nearly match the average performance of undergraduates, they remain significantly below the level of the best human designers. Further analysis shows that parameter scale, code specialization, and instruction tuning strongly influence performance, whereas increased design complexity and lower requirement readability degrade it. Bad case analysis reveals common failure modes, including keyword misuse, missing classes or relationships, and omitted methods.

### GRPO with State Mutations: Improving LLM-Based Hardware Test Plan Generation
**Authors**: Dimple Vijay Kochar, Nathaniel Pinckney, Guan-Ting Liu, Chia-Tung Ho, Chenhui Deng, Haoxing Ren, Brucek Khailany

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:42:42Z

**Summary**: RTL design often relies heavily on ad-hoc testbench creation early in the design cycle. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for RTL code generation, their ability to reason about hardware specifications and generate targeted test plans remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of LLM reasoning capabilities for RTL verification stimuli generation, establishing a two-stage framework that decomposes test plan generation from testbench execution. Our benchmark reveals that state-of-the-art models, including DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.0-Sonnet, achieve only 15.7-21.7% success rates on generating stimuli that pass golden RTL designs. To improve LLM generated stimuli, we develop a comprehensive training methodology combining supervised fine-tuning with a novel reinforcement learning approach, GRPO with State Mutation (GRPO-SMu), which enhances exploration by varying input mutations. Our approach leverages a tree-based branching mutation strategy to construct training data comprising equivalent and mutated trees, moving beyond linear mutation approaches to provide rich learning signals. Training on this curated dataset, our 7B parameter model achieves a 33.3% golden test pass rate and a 13.9% mutation detection rate, representing a 17.6% absolute improvement over baseline and outperforming much larger general-purpose models. These results demonstrate that specialized training methodologies can significantly enhance LLM reasoning capabilities for hardware verification tasks, establishing a foundation for automated sub-unit testing in semiconductor design workflows.

### LLMs Enable Bag-of-Texts Representations for Short-Text Clustering
**Authors**: I-Fan Lin, Faegheh Hasibi, Suzan Verberne

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:39:21Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we propose a training-free method for unsupervised short text clustering that relies less on careful selection of embedders than other methods. In customer-facing chatbots, companies are dealing with large amounts of user utterances that need to be clustered according to their intent. In these settings, no labeled data is typically available, and the number of clusters is not known. Recent approaches to short-text clustering in label-free settings incorporate LLM output to refine existing embeddings. While LLMs can identify similar texts effectively, the resulting similarities may not be directly represented by distances in the dense vector space, as they depend on the original embedding. We therefore propose a method for transforming LLM judgments directly into a bag-of-texts representation in which texts are initialized to be equidistant, without assuming any prior distance relationships. Our method achieves comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art methods, but without embeddings optimization or assuming prior knowledge of clusters or labels. Experiments on diverse datasets and smaller LLMs show that our method is model agnostic and can be applied to any embedder, with relatively small LLMs, and different clustering methods. We also show how our method scales to large datasets, reducing the computational cost of the LLM use. The flexibility and scalability of our method make it more aligned with real-world training-free scenarios than existing clustering methods.

### Large Language Models for Physics Instrument Design
**Authors**: Sara Zoccheddu, Shah Rukh Qasim, Patrick Owen, Nicola Serra

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:30:54Z

**Summary**: We study the use of large language models (LLMs) for physics instrument design and compare their performance to reinforcement learning (RL). Using only prompting, LLMs are given task constraints and summaries of prior high-scoring designs and propose complete detector configurations, which we evaluate with the same simulators and reward functions used in RL-based optimization. Although RL yields stronger final designs, we find that modern LLMs consistently generate valid, resource-aware, and physically meaningful configurations that draw on broad pretrained knowledge of detector design principles and particle--matter interactions, despite having no task-specific training. Based on this result, as a first step toward hybrid design workflows, we explore pairing the LLMs with a dedicated trust region optimizer, serving as a precursor to future pipelines in which LLMs propose and structure design hypotheses while RL performs reward-driven optimization. Based on these experiments, we argue that LLMs are well suited as meta-planners: they can design and orchestrate RL-based optimization studies, define search strategies, and coordinate multiple interacting components within a unified workflow. In doing so, they point toward automated, closed-loop instrument design in which much of the human effort required to structure and supervise optimization can be reduced.

### Beyond Entangled Planning: Task-Decoupled Planning for Long-Horizon Agents
**Authors**: Yunfan Li, Bingbing Xu, Xueyun Tian, Xiucheng Xu, Huawei Shen

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:30:10Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to autonomously execute complex, long-horizon tasks, yet planning remains a primary bottleneck for reliable task execution. Existing methods typically fall into two paradigms: step-wise planning, which is reactive but often short-sighted; and one-shot planning, which generates a complete plan upfront yet is brittle to execution errors. Crucially, both paradigms suffer from entangled contexts, where the agent must reason over a monolithic history spanning multiple sub-tasks. This entanglement increases cognitive load and lets local errors propagate across otherwise independent decisions, making recovery computationally expensive. To address this, we propose Task-Decoupled Planning (TDP), a training-free framework that replaces entangled reasoning with task decoupling. TDP decomposes tasks into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of sub-goals via a Supervisor. Using a Planner and Executor with scoped contexts, TDP confines reasoning and replanning to the active sub-task. This isolation prevents error propagation and corrects deviations locally without disrupting the workflow. Results on TravelPlanner, ScienceWorld, and HotpotQA show that TDP outperforms strong baselines while reducing token consumption by up to 82%, demonstrating that sub-task decoupling improves both robustness and efficiency for long-horizon agents.

### d3LLM: Ultra-Fast Diffusion LLM using Pseudo-Trajectory Distillation
**Authors**: Yu-Yang Qian, Junda Su, Lanxiang Hu, Peiyuan Zhang, Zhijie Deng, Peng Zhao, Hao Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:25:36Z

**Summary**: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer capabilities beyond those of autoregressive (AR) LLMs, such as parallel decoding and random-order generation. However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/d3LLM.

### A Unified Framework for Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis via Expert-Guided Multimodal Fusion with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jiaqi Qiao, Xiujuan Xu, Xinran Li, Yu Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:21:32Z

**Summary**: Multimodal emotion understanding requires effective integration of text, audio, and visual modalities for both discrete emotion recognition and continuous sentiment analysis. We present EGMF, a unified framework combining expert-guided multimodal fusion with large language models. Our approach features three specialized expert networks--a fine-grained local expert for subtle emotional nuances, a semantic correlation expert for cross-modal relationships, and a global context expert for long-range dependencies--adaptively integrated through hierarchical dynamic gating for context-aware feature selection. Enhanced multimodal representations are integrated with LLMs via pseudo token injection and prompt-based conditioning, enabling a single generative framework to handle both classification and regression through natural language generation. We employ LoRA fine-tuning for computational efficiency. Experiments on bilingual benchmarks (MELD, CHERMA, MOSEI, SIMS-V2) demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with superior cross-lingual robustness revealing universal patterns in multimodal emotional expressions across English and Chinese. We will release the source code publicly.

### Reducing Hallucinations in LLMs via Factuality-Aware Preference Learning
**Authors**: Sindhuja Chaduvula, Ahmed Y. Radwan, Azib Farooq, Yani Ioannou, Shaina Raza

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:16:29Z

**Summary**: Preference alignment methods such as RLHF and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) improve instruction following, but they can also reinforce hallucinations when preference judgments reward fluency and confidence over factual correctness. We introduce F-DPO (Factuality-aware Direct Preference Optimization), a simple extension of DPO that uses only binary factuality labels. F-DPO (i) applies a label-flipping transformation that corrects misordered preference pairs so the chosen response is never less factual than the rejected one, and (ii) adds a factuality-aware margin that emphasizes pairs with clear correctness differences, while reducing to standard DPO when both responses share the same factuality. We construct factuality-aware preference data by augmenting DPO pairs with binary factuality indicators and synthetic hallucinated variants. Across seven open-weight LLMs (1B-14B), F-DPO consistently improves factuality and reduces hallucination rates relative to both base models and standard DPO. On Qwen3-8B, F-DPO reduces hallucination rates by five times (from 0.424 to 0.084) while improving factuality scores by 50 percent (from 5.26 to 7.90). F-DPO also generalizes to out-of-distribution benchmarks: on TruthfulQA, Qwen2.5-14B achieves plus 17 percent MC1 accuracy (0.500 to 0.585) and plus 49 percent MC2 accuracy (0.357 to 0.531). F-DPO requires no auxiliary reward model, token-level annotations, or multi-stage training.

### Backpropagation-Free Test-Time Adaptation for Lightweight EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces
**Authors**: Siyang Li, Jiayi Ouyang, Zhenyao Cui, Ziwei Wang, Tianwang Jia, Feng Wan, Dongrui Wu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:08:18Z

**Summary**: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face significant deployment challenges due to inter-subject variability, signal non-stationarity, and computational constraints. While test-time adaptation (TTA) mitigates distribution shifts under online data streams without per-use calibration sessions, existing TTA approaches heavily rely on explicitly defined loss objectives that require backpropagation for updating model parameters, which incurs computational overhead, privacy risks, and sensitivity to noisy data streams. This paper proposes Backpropagation-Free Transformations (BFT), a TTA approach for EEG decoding that eliminates such issues. BFT applies multiple sample-wise transformations of knowledge-guided augmentations or approximate Bayesian inference to each test trial, generating multiple prediction scores for a single test sample. A learning-to-rank module enhances the weighting of these predictions, enabling robust aggregation for uncertainty suppression during inference under theoretical justifications. Extensive experiments on five EEG datasets of motor imagery classification and driver drowsiness regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness, versatility, robustness, and efficiency of BFT. This research enables lightweight plug-and-play BCIs on resource-constrained devices, broadening the real-world deployment of decoding algorithms for EEG-based BCI.

### VirtualEnv: A Platform for Embodied AI Research
**Authors**: Kabir Swain, Sijie Han, Ayush Raina, Jin Zhang, Shuang Li, Michael Stopa, Antonio Torralba

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T14:04:38Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to improve in reasoning and decision-making, there is a growing need for realistic and interactive environments where their abilities can be rigorously evaluated. We present VirtualEnv, a next-generation simulation platform built on Unreal Engine 5 that enables fine-grained benchmarking of LLMs in embodied and interactive scenarios. VirtualEnv supports rich agent-environment interactions, including object manipulation, navigation, and adaptive multi-agent collaboration, as well as game-inspired mechanics like escape rooms and procedurally generated environments. We provide a user-friendly API built on top of Unreal Engine, allowing researchers to deploy and control LLM-driven agents using natural language instructions. We integrate large-scale LLMs and vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-based models, to generate novel environments and structured tasks from multimodal inputs. Our experiments benchmark the performance of several popular LLMs across tasks of increasing complexity, analyzing differences in adaptability, planning, and multi-agent coordination. We also describe our methodology for procedural task generation, task validation, and real-time environment control. VirtualEnv is released as an open-source platform, we aim to advance research at the intersection of AI and gaming, enable standardized evaluation of LLMs in embodied AI settings, and pave the way for future developments in immersive simulations and interactive entertainment.

### ICWLM: A Multi-Task Wireless Large Model via In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Yuxuan Wen, Xiaoming Chen, Maojun Zhang, Zhaohui Yang, Chongwen Huang, Zhaoyang Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:48:23Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of wireless communication technologies, particularly massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave), introduces significant network complexity and computational demands. Significant research efforts have been made to improve physical layer performance by resorting to deep learning (DL) methods, which, however, are usually task-specific and struggle with data scarcity and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel In-Context Wireless Large Model (ICWLM), a wireless-native foundation model designed for simultaneous multi-task learning at the physical layer. Unlike conventional methods that adapt wireless data to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), ICWLM is trained directly on large-scale, mixed wireless datasets from scratch. It jointly solves multiple classical physical layer problems, including multi-user precoding (sum-rate maximization and max-min SINR) and channel prediction. A key innovation of ICWLM is its utilization of in-context learning (ICL), enabling the model to adapt to varying system configurations and channel conditions with minimal demonstration pairs, eliminating the need for extensive retraining. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that ICWLM achieves competitive performance compared to task-specific methods while exhibiting remarkable generalization capabilities to unseen system configurations. This work offers a promising paradigm for developing unified and adaptive AI models for future wireless networks, potentially reducing deployment complexity and enhancing intelligent resource management.

### Can Reasoning Help Large Language Models Capture Human Annotator Disagreement?
**Authors**: Jingwei Ni, Yu Fan, Vilém Zouhar, Donya Rooein, Alexander Hoyle, Mrinmaya Sachan, Markus Leippold, Dirk Hovy, Elliott Ash

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:46:04Z

**Summary**: Variation in human annotation (i.e., disagreements) is common in NLP, often reflecting important information like task subjectivity and sample ambiguity. Modeling this variation is important for applications that are sensitive to such information. Although RLVR-style reasoning (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards) has improved Large Language Model (LLM) performance on many tasks, it remains unclear whether such reasoning enables LLMs to capture informative variation in human annotation. In this work, we evaluate the influence of different reasoning settings on LLM disagreement modeling. We systematically evaluate each reasoning setting across model sizes, distribution expression methods, and steering methods, resulting in 60 experimental setups across 3 tasks. Surprisingly, our results show that RLVR-style reasoning degrades performance in disagreement modeling, while naive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves the performance of RLHF LLMs (RL from human feedback). These findings underscore the potential risk of replacing human annotators with reasoning LLMs, especially when disagreements are important.

### A Protocol-Aware P4 Pipeline for MQTT Security and Anomaly Mitigation in Edge IoT Systems
**Authors**: Bui Ngoc Thanh Binh, Pham Hoai Luan, Le Vu Trung Duong, Vu Tuan Hai, Yasuhiko Nakashima

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:38:59Z

**Summary**: MQTT is the dominant lightweight publish--subscribe protocol for IoT deployments, yet edge security remains inadequate. Cloud-based intrusion detection systems add latency that is unsuitable for real-time control, while CPU-bound firewalls and generic SDN controllers lack MQTT awareness to enforce session validation, topic-based authorization, and behavioral anomaly detection. We propose a P4-based data-plane enforcement scheme for protocol-aware MQTT security and anomaly detection at the network edge. The design combines parser-safe MQTT header extraction with session-order validation, byte-level topic-prefix authorization with per-client rate limiting and soft-cap enforcement, and lightweight anomaly detection based on KeepAlive and Remaining Length screening with clone-to-CPU diagnostics. The scheme leverages stateful primitives in BMv2 (registers, meters, direct counters) to enable runtime policy adaptation with minimal per-packet latency. Experiments on a Mininet/BMv2 testbed demonstrate high policy enforcement accuracy (99.8%, within 95% CI), strong anomaly detection sensitivity (98\% true-positive rate), and high delivery >99.9% for 100--5~kpps; 99.8% at 10~kpps; 99.6\% at 16~kpps) with sub-millisecond per-packet latency. These results show that protocol-aware MQTT filtering can be efficiently realized in the programmable data plane, providing a practical foundation for edge IoT security. Future work will validate the design on production P4 hardware and integrate machine learning--based threshold adaptation.

### Loci Similes: A Benchmark for Extracting Intertextualities in Latin Literature
**Authors**: Julian Schelb, Michael Wittweiler, Marie Revellio, Barbara Feichtinger, Andreas Spitz

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:34:49Z

**Summary**: Tracing connections between historical texts is an important part of intertextual research, enabling scholars to reconstruct the virtual library of a writer and identify the sources influencing their creative process. These intertextual links manifest in diverse forms, ranging from direct verbatim quotations to subtle allusions and paraphrases disguised by morphological variation. Language models offer a promising path forward due to their capability of capturing semantic similarity beyond lexical overlap. However, the development of new methods for this task is held back by the scarcity of standardized benchmarks and easy-to-use datasets. We address this gap by introducing Loci Similes, a benchmark for Latin intertextuality detection comprising of a curated dataset of ~172k text segments containing 545 expert-verified parallels linking Late Antique authors to a corpus of classical authors. Using this data, we establish baselines for retrieval and classification of intertextualities with state-of-the-art LLMs.

### Meta-Fair: AI-Assisted Fairness Testing of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Miguel Romero-Arjona, José A. Parejo, Juan C. Alonso, Ana B. Sánchez, Aitor Arrieta, Sergio Segura

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:30:36Z

**Summary**: Fairness--the absence of unjustified bias--is a core principle in the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, yet it remains difficult to assess and enforce. Current approaches to fairness testing in large language models (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic heuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult to scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method for testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific resources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach, Meta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to uncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled modifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second, we propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and output evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and classify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source tools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test cases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained LLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases. The results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs, achieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of executions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators, with the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although non-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through careful MR design. While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the results indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation in LLM testing.

### From RAG to Agentic RAG for Faithful Islamic Question Answering
**Authors**: Gagan Bhatia, Hamdy Mubarak, Mustafa Jarrar, George Mikros, Fadi Zaraket, Mahmoud Alhirthani, Mutaz Al-Khatib, Logan Cochrane, Kareem Darwish, Rashid Yahiaoui, Firoj Alam

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:28:28Z

**Summary**: LLMs are increasingly used for Islamic question answering, where ungrounded responses may carry serious religious consequences. Yet standard MCQ/MRC-style evaluations do not capture key real-world failure modes, notably free-form hallucinations and whether models appropriately abstain when evidence is lacking. To shed a light on this aspect we introduce ISLAMICFAITHQA, a 3,810-item bilingual (Arabic/English) generative benchmark with atomic single-gold answers, which enables direct measurement of hallucination and abstention. We additionally developed an end-to-end grounded Islamic modelling suite consisting of (i) 25K Arabic text-grounded SFT reasoning pairs, (ii) 5K bilingual preference samples for reward-guided alignment, and (iii) a verse-level Qur'an retrieval corpus of $\sim$6k atomic verses (ayat). Building on these resources, we develop an agentic Quran-grounding framework (agentic RAG) that uses structured tool calls for iterative evidence seeking and answer revision. Experiments across Arabic-centric and multilingual LLMs show that retrieval improves correctness and that agentic RAG yields the largest gains beyond standard RAG, achieving state-of-the-art performance and stronger Arabic-English robustness even with a small model (i.e., Qwen3 4B). We will make the experimental resources and datasets publicly available for the community.

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:25:33Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of interactive and autonomous AI systems signals our entry into the agentic era. Training and evaluating agents on complex agentic tasks such as software engineering and computer use requires not only efficient model computation but also sophisticated infrastructure capable of coordinating vast agent-environment interactions. However, no open-source infrastructure can effectively support large-scale training and evaluation on such complex agentic tasks. To address this challenge, we present MegaFlow, a large-scale distributed orchestration system that enables efficient scheduling, resource allocation, and fine-grained task management for agent-environment workloads. MegaFlow abstracts agent training infrastructure into three independent services (Model Service, Agent Service, and Environment Service) that interact through unified interfaces, enabling independent scaling and flexible resource allocation across diverse agent-environment configurations. In our agent training deployments, MegaFlow successfully orchestrates tens of thousands of concurrent agent tasks while maintaining high system stability and achieving efficient resource utilization. By enabling such large-scale agent training, MegaFlow addresses a critical infrastructure gap in the emerging agentic AI landscape.

### Thinking Before Constraining: A Unified Decoding Framework for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ngoc Trinh Hung Nguyen, Alonso Silva, Laith Zumot, Liubov Tupikina, Armen Aghasaryan, Mehwish Alam

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:25:28Z

**Summary**: Natural generation allows Language Models (LMs) to produce free-form responses with rich reasoning, but the lack of guaranteed structure makes outputs difficult to parse or verify. Structured generation, or constrained decoding, addresses this drawback by producing content in standardized formats such as JSON, ensuring consistency and guaranteed-parsable outputs, but it can inadvertently restrict the model's reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose a simple approach that combines the advantages of both natural and structured generation. By allowing LLMs to reason freely until specific trigger tokens are generated, and then switching to structured generation, our method preserves the expressive power of natural language reasoning while ensuring the reliability of structured outputs. We further evaluate our approach on several datasets, covering both classification and reasoning tasks, to demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving a substantial gain of up to 27% in accuracy compared to natural generation, while requiring only a small overhead of 10-20 extra tokens.

### IndicParam: Benchmark to evaluate LLMs on low-resource Indic Languages
**Authors**: Ayush Maheshwari, Kaushal Sharma, Vivek Patel, Aditya Maheshwari

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:16:09Z

**Summary**: While large language models excel on high-resource multilingual tasks, low- and extremely low-resource Indic languages remain severely under-evaluated. We present IndicParam, a human-curated benchmark of over 13,000 multiple-choice questions covering 11 such languages (Nepali, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia as low-resource; Dogri, Maithili, Rajasthani, Sanskrit, Bodo, Santali, Konkani as extremely low-resource) plus Sanskrit-English code-mixed set. We evaluated 20 LLMs, both proprietary and open-weights, which reveals that even the top-performing \texttt{Gemini-2.5} reaches 58\% average accuracy, followed by \texttt{GPT-5} (45) and \texttt{DeepSeek-3.2} (43.1). We additionally label each question as knowledge-oriented or purely linguistic to discriminate factual recall from grammatical proficiency. Further, we assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside conventional multiple-choice questions. \benchmark\ provides insights into limitations of cross-lingual transfer and establishes a challenging benchmark for Indic languages. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/bharatgenai/IndicParam. Scripts to run benchmark are present at https://github.com/ayushbits/IndicParam.

### Intervention Efficiency and Perturbation Validation Framework: Capacity-Aware and Robust Clinical Model Selection under the Rashomon Effect
**Authors**: Yuwen Zhang, Viet Tran, Paul Weng

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:16:09Z

**Summary**: In clinical machine learning, the coexistence of multiple models with comparable performance (a manifestation of the Rashomon Effect) poses fundamental challenges for trustworthy deployment and evaluation. Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.

### Judging Against the Reference: Uncovering Knowledge-Driven Failures in LLM-Judges on QA Evaluation
**Authors**: Dongryeol Lee, Yerin Hwang, Taegwan Kang, Minwoo Lee, Younhyung Chae, Kyomin Jung

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:05:13Z

**Summary**: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automatic judges for question answering (QA) and other reference-conditioned evaluation tasks, little is known about their ability to adhere to a provided reference. We identify a critical failure mode of such reference-based LLM QA evaluation: when the provided reference conflicts with the judge model's parametric knowledge, the resulting scores become unreliable, substantially degrading evaluation fidelity. To study this phenomenon systematically, we introduce a controlled swapped-reference QA framework that induces reference-belief conflicts. Specifically, we replace the reference answer with an incorrect entity and construct diverse pairings of original and swapped references with correspondingly aligned candidate answers. Surprisingly, grading reliability drops sharply under swapped references across a broad set of judge models. We empirically show that this vulnerability is driven by judges' over-reliance on parametric knowledge, leading judges to disregard the given reference under conflict. Finally, we find that this failure persists under common prompt-based mitigation strategies, highlighting a fundamental limitation of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and motivating reference-based protocols that enforce stronger adherence to the provided reference.

### FROAV: A Framework for RAG Observation and Agent Verification -- Lowering the Barrier to LLM Agent Research
**Authors**: Tzu-Hsuan Lin, Chih-Hsuan Kao

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T13:02:32Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their integration into autonomous agent systems has created unprecedented opportunities for document analysis, decision support, and knowledge retrieval. However, the complexity of developing, evaluating, and iterating on LLM-based agent workflows presents significant barriers to researchers, particularly those without extensive software engineering expertise. We present FROAV (Framework for RAG Observation and Agent Verification), an open-source research platform that democratizes LLM agent research by providing a plug-and-play architecture combining visual workflow orchestration, a comprehensive evaluation framework, and extensible Python integration. FROAV implements a multi-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline coupled with a rigorous "LLM-as-a-Judge" evaluation system, all accessible through intuitive graphical interfaces. Our framework integrates n8n for no-code workflow design, PostgreSQL for granular data management, FastAPI for flexible backend logic, and Streamlit for human-in-the-loop interaction. Through this integrated ecosystem, researchers can rapidly prototype RAG strategies, conduct prompt engineering experiments, validate agent performance against human judgments, and collect structured feedback-all without writing infrastructure code. We demonstrate the framework's utility through its application to financial document analysis, while emphasizing its material-agnostic architecture that adapts to any domain requiring semantic analysis. FROAV represents a significant step toward making LLM agent research accessible to a broader scientific community, enabling researchers to focus on hypothesis testing and algorithmic innovation rather than system integration challenges.

### Bridging the Linguistic Divide: A Survey on Leveraging Large Language Models for Machine Translation
**Authors**: Baban Gain, Dibyanayan Bandyopadhyay, Asif Ekbal, Trilok Nath Singh

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:46:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly reshaping machine translation (MT), particularly by introducing instruction-following, in-context learning, and preference-based alignment into what has traditionally been a supervised encoder-decoder paradigm. This survey provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of how LLMs are being leveraged for MT across data regimes, languages, and application settings. We systematically analyze prompting-based methods, parameter-efficient and full fine-tuning strategies, synthetic data generation, preference-based optimization, and reinforcement learning with human and weakly supervised feedback. Special attention is given to low-resource translation, where we examine the roles of synthetic data quality, diversity, and preference signals, as well as the limitations of current RLHF pipelines. We further review recent advances in Mixture-of-Experts models, MT-focused LLMs, and multilingual alignment, highlighting trade-offs between scalability, specialization, and accessibility. Beyond sentence-level translation, we survey emerging document-level and discourse-aware MT methods with LLMs, showing that most approaches extend sentence-level pipelines through structured context selection, post-editing, or reranking rather than requiring fundamentally new data regimes or architectures. Finally, we discuss LLM-based evaluation, its strengths and biases, and its role alongside learned metrics. Overall, this survey positions LLM-based MT as an evolution of traditional MT systems, where gains increasingly depend on data quality, preference alignment, and context utilization rather than scale alone, and outlines open challenges for building robust, inclusive, and controllable translation systems.

### Through the LLM Looking Glass: A Socratic Probing of Donkeys, Elephants, and Markets
**Authors**: Molly Kennedy, Ayyoob Imani, Timo Spinde, Akiko Aizawa, Hinrich Schütze

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:41:04Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for text generation, making it crucial to address potential bias. This study investigates ideological framing bias in LLM-generated articles, focusing on the subtle and subjective nature of such bias in journalistic contexts. We evaluate eight widely used LLMs on two datasets-POLIGEN and ECONOLEX-covering political and economic discourse where framing bias is most pronounced. Beyond text generation, LLMs are increasingly used as evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge), providing feedback that can shape human judgment or inform newer model versions. Inspired by the Socratic method, we further analyze LLMs' feedback on their own outputs to identify inconsistencies in their reasoning. Our results show that most LLMs can accurately annotate ideologically framed text, with GPT-4o achieving human-level accuracy and high agreement with human annotators. However, Socratic probing reveals that when confronted with binary comparisons, LLMs often exhibit preference toward one perspective or perceive certain viewpoints as less biased.

### R3-RECON: Radiance-Field-Free Active Reconstruction via Renderability
**Authors**: Xiaofeng Jin, Matteo Frosi, Yiran Guo, Matteo Matteucci

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:37:26Z

**Summary**: In active reconstruction, an embodied agent must decide where to look next to efficiently acquire views that support high-quality novel-view rendering. Recent work on active view planning for neural rendering largely derives next-best-view (NBV) criteria by backpropagating through radiance fields or estimating information entropy over 3D Gaussian primitives. While effective, these strategies tightly couple view selection to heavy, representation-specific mechanisms and fail to account for the computational and resource constraints required for lightweight online deployment. In this paper, we revisit active reconstruction from a renderability-centric perspective. We propose $\mathbb{R}^{3}$-RECON, a radiance-fields-free active reconstruction framework that induces an implicit, pose-conditioned renderability field over SE(3) from a lightweight voxel map. Our formulation aggregates per-voxel online observation statistics into a unified scalar renderability score that is cheap to update and can be queried in closed form at arbitrary candidate viewpoints in milliseconds, without requiring gradients or radiance-field training. This renderability field is strongly correlated with image-space reconstruction error, naturally guiding NBV selection. We further introduce a panoramic extension that estimates omnidirectional (360$^\circ$) view utility to accelerate candidate evaluation. In the standard indoor Replica dataset, $\mathbb{R}^{3}$-RECON achieves more uniform novel-view quality and higher 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) reconstruction accuracy than recent active GS baselines with matched view and time budgets.

### JudgeFlow: Agentic Workflow Optimization via Block Judge
**Authors**: Zihan Ma, Zhikai Zhao, Chuanbo Hua, Federico Berto, Jinkyoo Park

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:30:14Z

**Summary**: Optimizing LLM-based agentic workflows is challenging for scaling AI capabilities. Current methods rely on coarse, end-to-end evaluation signals and lack fine-grained signals on where to refine, often resulting in inefficient or low-impact modifications. To address these limitations, we propose {\our{}}, an Evaluation-Judge-Optimization-Update pipeline. We incorporate reusable, configurable logic blocks into agentic workflows to capture fundamental forms of logic. On top of this abstraction, we design a dedicated Judge module that inspects execution traces -- particularly failed runs -- and assigns rank-based responsibility scores to problematic blocks. These fine-grained diagnostic signals are then leveraged by an LLM-based optimizer, which focuses modifications on the most problematic block in the workflow. Our approach improves sample efficiency, enhances interpretability through block-level diagnostics, and provides a scalable foundation for automating increasingly complex agentic workflows. We evaluate {\our{}} on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, where {\our{}} achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/ma-zihan/JudgeFlow.

### Secure Digital Semantic Communications: Fundamentals, Challenges, and Opportunities
**Authors**: Weixuan Chen, Qianqian Yang, Yuanyuan Jia, Junyu Pan, Shuo Shao, Jincheng Dai, Meixia Tao, Ping Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:30:01Z

**Summary**: Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for future wireless networks by prioritizing task-relevant meaning over raw data delivery, thereby reducing communication overhead and improving efficiency. However, shifting from bit-accurate transmission to task-oriented delivery introduces new security and privacy risks. These include semantic leakage, semantic manipulation, knowledge base vulnerabilities, model-related attacks, and threats to authenticity and availability. Most existing secure SemCom studies focus on analog SemCom, where semantic features are mapped to continuous channel inputs. In contrast, digital SemCom transmits semantic information through discrete bits or symbols within practical transceiver pipelines, offering stronger compatibility with realworld systems while exposing a distinct and underexplored attack surface. In particular, digital SemCom typically represents semantic information over a finite alphabet through explicit digital modulation, following two main routes: probabilistic modulation and deterministic modulation. These discrete mechanisms and practical transmission procedures introduce additional vulnerabilities affecting bit- or symbol-level semantic information, the modulation stage, and packet-based delivery and protocol operations. Motivated by these challenges and the lack of a systematic analysis of secure digital SemCom, this paper reviews SemCom fundamentals, clarifies the architectural differences between analog and digital SemCom and their security implications, organizes the threat landscape for digital SemCom, and discusses potential defenses. Finally, we outline open research directions toward secure and deployable digital SemCom systems.

### ARCQuant: Boosting NVFP4 Quantization with Augmented Residual Channels for LLMs
**Authors**: Haoqian Meng, Yilun Luo, Yafei Zhao, Wenyuan Liu, Peng Zhang, Xindian Ma

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:27:22Z

**Summary**: The emergence of fine-grained numerical formats like NVFP4 presents new opportunities for efficient Large Language Model (LLM) inference. However, it is difficult to adapt existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) strategies to these formats: rotation-based methods compromise fine-grained block isolation; smoothing techniques struggle with significant 4-bit quantization errors; and mixed-precision approaches often conflict with hardware constraints on unified-precision computation. To address these challenges, we propose ARCQuant, a framework that boosts NVFP4 performance via Augmented Residual Channels. Distinct from methods that compromise block isolation or hardware uniformity, ARCQuant maintains a strictly unified NVFP4 format by augmenting the activation matrix with quantized residual channels. This design integrates the error compensation process directly into the matrix reduction dimension, enabling the use of standard, highly optimized GEMM kernels with minimal overhead. Theoretical analysis confirms that the worst-case error bound of our dual-stage NVFP4 quantization is comparable to that of standard 8-bit formats such as MXFP8. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models demonstrate that ARCQuant achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, comparable to full-precision baselines in perplexity and downstream tasks. Furthermore, deployment on RTX 5090 and RTX PRO 6000 GPUs confirms practical benefits, achieving up to 3x speedup over FP16. Our code is available at https://github.com/actypedef/ARCQuant .

### Learning How to Remember: A Meta-Cognitive Management Method for Structured and Transferable Agent Memory
**Authors**: Sirui Liang, Pengfei Cao, Jian Zhao, Wenhao Teng, Xiangwen Liao, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:26:02Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on accumulated memory to solve long-horizon decision-making tasks. However, most existing approaches store memory in fixed representations and reuse it at a single or implicit level of abstraction, which limits generalization and often leads to negative transfer when distribution shift. This paper proposes the Meta-Cognitive Memory Abstraction method (MCMA), which treats memory abstraction as a learnable cognitive skill rather than a fixed design choice. MCMA decouples task execution from memory management by combining a frozen task model with a learned memory copilot. The memory copilot is trained using direct preference optimization, it determines how memories should be structured, abstracted, and reused. Memories are further organized into a hierarchy of abstraction levels, enabling selective reuse based on task similarity. When no memory is transferable, MCMA transfers the ability to abstract and manage memory by transferring the memory copilot. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and BabyAI demonstrate substantial improvements in performance, out-of-distribution generalization, and cross-task transfer over several baselines.

### Knowledge Distillation for LLM-Based Human Activity Recognition in Homes
**Authors**: Julien Cumin, Oussama Er-Rahmany, Xi Chen

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:25:53Z

**Summary**: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a central problem for context-aware applications, especially for smart homes and assisted living. A few very recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used for HAR at home, reaching high performance and addressing key challenges. In this paper, we provide new experimental results regarding the use of LLMs for HAR, on two state-of-the-art datasets. More specifically, we show how recognition performance evolves depending on the size of the LLM used. Moreover, we experiment on the use of knowledge distillation techniques to fine-tune smaller LLMs with HAR reasoning examples generated by larger LLMs. We show that such fine-tuned models can perform almost as well as the largest LLMs, while having 50 times less parameters.

### Beyond Dialogue Time: Temporal Semantic Memory for Personalized LLM Agents
**Authors**: Miao Su, Yucan Guo, Zhongni Hou, Long Bai, Zixuan Li, Yufei Zhang, Guojun Yin, Wei Lin, Xiaolong Jin, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:24:44Z

**Summary**: Memory enables Large Language Model (LLM) agents to perceive, store, and use information from past dialogues, which is essential for personalization. However, existing methods fail to properly model the temporal dimension of memory in two aspects: 1) Temporal inaccuracy: memories are organized by dialogue time rather than their actual occurrence time; 2) Temporal fragmentation: existing methods focus on point-wise memory, losing durative information that captures persistent states and evolving patterns. To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Semantic Memory (TSM), a memory framework that models semantic time for point-wise memory and supports the construction and utilization of durative memory. During memory construction, it first builds a semantic timeline rather than a dialogue one. Then, it consolidates temporally continuous and semantically related information into a durative memory. During memory utilization, it incorporates the query's temporal intent on the semantic timeline, enabling the retrieval of temporally appropriate durative memories and providing time-valid, duration-consistent context to support response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and LoCoMo show that TSM consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves up to 12.2% absolute improvement in accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### A Scalable Solution for Node Mobility Problems in NDN-Based Massive LEO Constellations
**Authors**: Miguel Rodríguez-Pérez, Sergio Herrería-Alonso, J. Carlos Lopez-Ardao, Andrés Suárez-González

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:22:23Z

**Summary**: In recent years, there has been increasing investment in the deployment of massive commercial Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations to provide global Internet connectivity. These constellations, now equipped with inter-satellite links, can serve as low-latency Internet backbones, requiring LEO satellites to act not only as access nodes for ground stations, but also as in-orbit core routers. Due to their high velocity and the resulting frequent handovers of ground gateways, LEO networks highly stress mobility procedures at both the sender and receiver endpoints. On the other hand, a growing trend in networking is the use of technologies based on the Information Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm for servicing IoT networks and sensor networks in general, as its addressing, storage, and security mechanisms are usually a good match for IoT needs. Furthermore, ICN networks possess additional characteristics that are beneficial for the massive LEO scenario. For instance, the mobility of the receiver is helped by the inherent data-forwarding procedures in their architectures. However, the mobility of the senders remains an open problem. This paper proposes a comprehensive solution to the mobility problem for massive LEO constellations using the Named-Data Networking (NDN) architecture, as it is probably the most mature ICN proposal. Our solution includes a scalable method to relate content to ground gateways and a way to address traffic to the gateway that does not require cooperation from the network routing algorithm. Moreover, our solution works without requiring modifications to the actual NDN protocol itself, so it is easy to test and deploy. Our results indicate that, for long enough handover lengths, traffic losses are negligible even for ground stations with just one satellite in sight.

### Membership Inference Attacks on Tokenizers of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Meng Tong, Yuntao Du, Kejiang Chen, Weiming Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:20:50Z

**Summary**: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are widely used to assess the privacy risks associated with machine learning models. However, when these attacks are applied to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), they encounter significant challenges, including mislabeled samples, distribution shifts, and discrepancies in model size between experimental and real-world settings. To address these limitations, we introduce tokenizers as a new attack vector for membership inference. Specifically, a tokenizer converts raw text into tokens for LLMs. Unlike full models, tokenizers can be efficiently trained from scratch, thereby avoiding the aforementioned challenges. In addition, the tokenizer's training data is typically representative of the data used to pre-train LLMs. Despite these advantages, the potential of tokenizers as an attack vector remains unexplored. To this end, we present the first study on membership leakage through tokenizers and explore five attack methods to infer dataset membership. Extensive experiments on millions of Internet samples reveal the vulnerabilities in the tokenizers of state-of-the-art LLMs. To mitigate this emerging risk, we further propose an adaptive defense. Our findings highlight tokenizers as an overlooked yet critical privacy threat, underscoring the urgent need for privacy-preserving mechanisms specifically designed for them.

### IFDNS: An Iterative Feedback-Driven Neuro-Symbolic Method for Faithful Logical Reasoning
**Authors**: Xiaoheng Wang, Tongxuan Liu, Zi Gong, Xianzhe Dong, Yuting Zeng, Minhan Hu, Weizhe Huang, Jing Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T12:20:19Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of reasoning tasks, including logical and mathematical problem-solving. While prompt-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can enhance LLM reasoning abilities to some extent, they often suffer from a lack of faithfulness, where the derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, researchers have explored neuro-symbolic approaches to bolster LLM logical reasoning capabilities. However, existing neuro-symbolic methods still face challenges with information loss during the process. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Iterative Feedback-Driven Neuro-Symbolic (IFDNS), a novel prompt-based method that employs a multi-round feedback mechanism to address LLM limitations in handling complex logical relationships. IFDNS utilizes iterative feedback during the logic extraction phase to accurately extract causal relationship statements and translate them into propositional and logical implication expressions, effectively mitigating information loss issues. Furthermore, IFDNS is orthogonal to existing prompt methods, allowing for seamless integration with various prompting approaches. Empirical evaluations across six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IFDNS in significantly improving the performance of CoT and Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency (CoT-SC). Specifically, IFDNS achieves a +9.40% accuracy boost for CoT on the LogiQA dataset and a +11.70% improvement for CoT-SC on the PrOntoQA dataset.

### ContextFocus: Activation Steering for Contextual Faithfulness in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Nikhil Anand, Shwetha Somasundaram, Anirudh Phukan, Apoorv Saxena, Koyel Mukherjee

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T11:51:25Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of parametric knowledge during pre-training. As world knowledge evolves, effective deployment increasingly depends on their ability to faithfully follow externally retrieved context. When such evidence conflicts with the model's internal knowledge, LLMs often default to memorized facts, producing unfaithful outputs. In this work, we introduce ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in such knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, our solution requires no model finetuning and incurs minimal inference-time overhead, making it highly efficient. We evaluate ContextFocus on the ConFiQA benchmark, comparing it against strong baselines including ContextDPO, COIECD, and prompting-based methods. Furthermore, we show that our method is complementary to prompting strategies and remains effective on larger models. Extensive experiments show that ContextFocus significantly improves contextual-faithfulness. Our results highlight the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of ContextFocus in improving contextual-faithfulness of LLM outputs.

### Intrinsic Memory Agents: Heterogeneous Multi-Agent LLM Systems through Structured Contextual Memory
**Authors**: Sizhe Yuen, Francisco Gomez Medina, Ting Su, Yali Du, Adam J. Sobey

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T11:46:09Z

**Summary**: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory that preserves specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information. Our approach utilises a generic memory template applicable to new problems without the need to hand-craft specific memory prompts. We benchmark our approach on the PDDL, FEVER, and ALFWorld datasets, comparing its performance to existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing state-of-the-art or comparable performance across all three, with the highest consistency. An additional evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, and we demonstrate that our approach produces higher quality designs across 5 metrics: scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness, and documentation, plus additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that addressing memory limitations through intrinsic approaches can improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning tasks.

### RLPO: Residual Listwise Preference Optimization for Long-Context Review Ranking
**Authors**: Hao Jiang, Zhi Yang, Annan Wang, Yichi Zhang, Weisi Lin

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T11:45:19Z

**Summary**: Review ranking is pivotal in e-commerce for prioritizing diagnostic and authentic feedback from the deluge of user-generated content. While large language models have improved semantic assessment, existing ranking paradigms face a persistent trade-off in long-context settings. Pointwise scoring is efficient but often fails to account for list-level interactions, leading to miscalibrated top-$k$ rankings. Listwise approaches can leverage global context, yet they are computationally expensive and become unstable as candidate lists grow. To address this, we propose Residual Listwise Preference Optimization (RLPO), which formulates ranking as listwise representation-level residual correction over a strong pointwise LLM scorer. RLPO first produces calibrated pointwise scores and item representations, then applies a lightweight encoder over the representations to predict listwise score residuals, avoiding full token-level listwise processing. We also introduce a large-scale benchmark for long-context review ranking with human verification. Experiments show RLPO improves NDCG@k over strong pointwise and listwise baselines and remains robust as list length increases.

### OptRot: Mitigating Weight Outliers via Data-Free Rotations for Post-Training Quantization
**Authors**: Advait Gadhikar, Riccardo Grazzi, James Hensman

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T11:31:36Z

**Summary**: The presence of outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) weights and activations makes them difficult to quantize. Recent work has leveraged rotations to mitigate these outliers. In this work, we propose methods that learn fusible rotations by minimizing principled and cheap proxy objectives to the weight quantization error. We primarily focus on GPTQ as the quantization method. Our main method is OptRot, which reduces weight outliers simply by minimizing the element-wise fourth power of the rotated weights. We show that OptRot outperforms both Hadamard rotations and more expensive, data-dependent methods like SpinQuant and OSTQuant for weight quantization. It also improves activation quantization in the W4A8 setting. We also propose a data-dependent method, OptRot$^{+}$, that further improves performance by incorporating information on the activation covariance. In the W4A4 setting, we see that both OptRot and OptRot$^{+}$ perform worse, highlighting a trade-off between weight and activation quantization.

### Robust and Efficient Zeroth-Order LLM Fine-Tuning via Adaptive Bayesian Subspace Optimizer
**Authors**: Jian Feng, Zhihong Huang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T11:20:01Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with zeroth-order (ZO) optimization reduces memory by approximating gradients through function evaluations. However, existing methods essentially perform updates in a one-dimensional space, and suffer from collapse or substantial performance degradation under low-precision training. We introduce BSZO, an adaptive \textbf{B}ayesian \textbf{S}ubspace \textbf{Z}eroth-Order \textbf{O}ptimizer, which applies Kalman filtering to combine finite-difference information across multiple perturbation directions within a subspace. By treating each finite-difference measurement as a noisy observation, BSZO builds a posterior distribution over the subspace-projected gradient and updates it through Bayesian inference, with a residual-based adaptive mechanism to adapt to noise variations. Theoretical analysis shows that BSZO improves the convergence rate by a factor of $k/γ$ compared to standard ZO methods. Experiments on RoBERTa, Mistral, and OPT models show that BSZO outperforms the baselines across various tasks, achieving up to 6.67\% absolute average improvement on OPT-13B while remaining robust under fp16/bf16 precision and keeping memory usage close to inference-only baselines (1.00$\times$--1.08$\times$ of MeZO).

### KALE: Enhancing Knowledge Manipulation in Large Language Models via Knowledge-aware Learning
**Authors**: Qitan Lv, Tianyu Liu, Qiaosheng Zhang, Xingcheng Xu, Chaochao Lu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T11:19:42Z

**Summary**: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) pretrained on vast knowledge corpora, advancing their knowledge manipulation-the ability to effectively recall, reason, and transfer relevant knowledge-remains challenging. Existing methods mainly leverage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on labeled datasets to enhance LLMs' knowledge manipulation ability. However, we observe that SFT models still exhibit the known&incorrect phenomenon, where they explicitly possess relevant knowledge for a given question but fail to leverage it for correct answers. To address this challenge, we propose KALE (Knowledge-Aware LEarning)-a post-training framework that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate high-quality rationales and enhance LLMs' knowledge manipulation ability. Specifically, KALE first introduces a Knowledge-Induced (KI) data synthesis method that efficiently extracts multi-hop reasoning paths from KGs to generate high-quality rationales for question-answer pairs. Then, KALE employs a Knowledge-Aware (KA) fine-tuning paradigm that enhances knowledge manipulation by internalizing rationale-guided reasoning through minimizing the KL divergence between predictions with and without rationales. Extensive experiments on eight popular benchmarks across six different LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of KALE, achieving accuracy improvements of up to 11.72% and an average of 4.18%.

### Two Pathways to Truthfulness: On the Intrinsic Encoding of LLM Hallucinations
**Authors**: Wen Luo, Guangyue Peng, Wei Li, Shaohang Wei, Feifan Song, Liang Wang, Nan Yang, Xingxing Zhang, Jing Jin, Furu Wei, Houfeng Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T11:10:43Z

**Summary**: Despite their impressive capabilities, large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations. Previous work shows that their internal states encode rich signals of truthfulness, yet the origins and mechanisms of these signals remain unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that truthfulness cues arise from two distinct information pathways: (1) a Question-Anchored pathway that depends on question-answer information flow, and (2) an Answer-Anchored pathway that derives self-contained evidence from the generated answer itself. First, we validate and disentangle these pathways through attention knockout and token patching. Afterwards, we uncover notable and intriguing properties of these two mechanisms. Further experiments reveal that (1) the two mechanisms are closely associated with LLM knowledge boundaries; and (2) internal representations are aware of their distinctions. Finally, building on these insightful findings, two applications are proposed to enhance hallucination detection performance. Overall, our work provides new insight into how LLMs internally encode truthfulness, offering directions for more reliable and self-aware generative systems.

### SPEC-RL: Accelerating On-Policy Reinforcement Learning with Speculative Rollouts
**Authors**: Bingshuai Liu, Ante Wang, Zijun Min, Liang Yao, Haibo Zhang, Yang Liu, Xu Han, Peng Li, Anxiang Zeng, Jinsong Su

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T11:06:46Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization, objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations. We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including AIME24, MATH-500, OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large reasoning models.

### SCALPEL: Selective Capability Ablation via Low-rank Parameter Editing for Large Language Model Interpretability Analysis
**Authors**: Zihao Fu, Xufeng Duan, Zhenguang G. Cai

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T10:54:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models excel across diverse domains, yet their deployment in healthcare, legal systems, and autonomous decision-making remains limited by incomplete understanding of their internal mechanisms. As these models integrate into high-stakes systems, understanding how they encode capabilities has become fundamental to interpretability research. Traditional approaches identify important modules through gradient attribution or activation analysis, assuming specific capabilities map to specific components. However, this oversimplifies neural computation: modules may contribute to multiple capabilities simultaneously, while single capabilities may distribute across multiple modules. These coarse-grained analyses fail to capture fine-grained, distributed capability encoding. We present SCALPEL (Selective Capability Ablation via Low-rank Parameter Editing for Large language models), a framework representing capabilities as low-rank parameter subspaces rather than discrete modules. Our key insight is that capabilities can be characterized by low-rank modifications distributed across layers and modules, enabling precise capability removal without affecting others. By training LoRA adapters to reduce distinguishing correct from incorrect answers while preserving general language modeling quality, SCALPEL identifies low-rank representations responsible for particular capabilities while remaining disentangled from others. Experiments across diverse capability and linguistic tasks from BLiMP demonstrate that SCALPEL successfully removes target capabilities while preserving general capabilities, providing fine-grained insights into capability distribution across parameter space. Results reveal that capabilities exhibit low-rank structure and can be selectively ablated through targeted parameter-space interventions, offering nuanced understanding of capability encoding in LLMs.

### Outcome-Grounded Advantage Reshaping for Fine-Grained Credit Assignment in Mathematical Reasoning
**Authors**: Ziheng Li, Liu Kang, Feng Xiao, Luxi Xing, Qingyi Si, Zhuoran Li, Weikang Gong, Deqing Yang, Yanghua Xiao, Hongcheng Guo

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T10:48:02Z

**Summary**: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a promising critic-free reinforcement learning paradigm for reasoning tasks. However, standard GRPO employs a coarse-grained credit assignment mechanism that propagates group-level rewards uniformly to to every token in a sequence, neglecting the varying contribution of individual reasoning steps. We address this limitation by introducing Outcome-grounded Advantage Reshaping (OAR), a fine-grained credit assignment mechanism that redistributes advantages based on how much each token influences the model's final answer. We instantiate OAR via two complementary strategies: (1) OAR-P, which estimates outcome sensitivity through counterfactual token perturbations, serving as a high-fidelity attribution signal; (2) OAR-G, which uses an input-gradient sensitivity proxy to approximate the influence signal with a single backward pass. These importance signals are integrated with a conservative Bi-Level advantage reshaping scheme that suppresses low-impact tokens and boosts pivotal ones while preserving the overall advantage mass. Empirical results on extensive mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that while OAR-P sets the performance upper bound, OAR-G achieves comparable gains with negligible computational overhead, both significantly outperforming a strong GRPO baseline, pushing the boundaries of critic-free LLM reasoning.

### Generative Diffusion Receivers: Achieving Pilot-Efficient MIMO-OFDM Communications
**Authors**: Yuzhi Yang, Omar Alhussein, Atefeh Arani, Zhaoyang Zhang, Mérouane Debbah

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T10:32:17Z

**Summary**: This paper focuses on wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) receivers. Traditional wireless receivers have relied on mathematical modeling and Bayesian inference, achieving remarkable success in most areas but falling short in their ability to characterize channel matrices. Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated significant potential in this aspect. Nevertheless, integrating traditional inference methods with NNs presents challenges, particularly in tracking the error progression. Given the inevitable presence of noise in wireless systems, generative models that are more resilient to noise are garnering increased attention. In this paper, we propose re-evaluating the MIMO-OFDM receiver using diffusion models, which is a common generative approach. With diffusion models, we can effectively leverage prior knowledge of channel matrices and incorporate traditional signal estimation components. Specifically, we explore the diffusion system and introduce an imagination-screening strategy to guide the diffusion process. Furthermore, diffusion models enable adaptation to varying noise levels and pilot schemes using the same NN, significantly reducing training and deployment costs. Simulated results reveal that, for pilot densities ranging from 4-6 pilots per 64-subcarrier block and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) from -4 dB to 0 dB, our proposed receiver reduces channel-reconstruction error by up to two times compared to leading deep-learning models, with the most pronounced improvements observed in low-pilot conditions. Additionally, performance enhancements can be achieved with a larger imagination size, despite increased computational complexity.

### MCP-ITP: An Automated Framework for Implicit Tool Poisoning in MCP
**Authors**: Ruiqi Li, Zhiqiang Wang, Yunhao Yao, Xiang-Yang Li

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T10:28:46Z

**Summary**: To standardize interactions between LLM-based agents and their environments, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) was proposed and has since been widely adopted. However, integrating external tools expands the attack surface, exposing agents to tool poisoning attacks. In such attacks, malicious instructions embedded in tool metadata are injected into the agent context during MCP registration phase, thereby manipulating agent behavior. Prior work primarily focuses on explicit tool poisoning or relied on manually crafted poisoned tools. In contrast, we focus on a particularly stealthy variant: implicit tool poisoning, where the poisoned tool itself remains uninvoked. Instead, the instructions embedded in the tool metadata induce the agent to invoke a legitimate but high-privilege tool to perform malicious operations. We propose MCP-ITP, the first automated and adaptive framework for implicit tool poisoning within the MCP ecosystem. MCP-ITP formulates poisoned tool generation as a black-box optimization problem and employs an iterative optimization strategy that leverages feedback from both an evaluation LLM and a detection LLM to maximize Attack Success Rate (ASR) while evading current detection mechanisms. Experimental results on the MCPTox dataset across 12 LLM agents demonstrate that MCP-ITP consistently outperforms the manually crafted baseline, achieving up to 84.2% ASR while suppressing the Malicious Tool Detection Rate (MDR) to as low as 0.3%.

### Software-Hardware Co-optimization for Modular E2E AV Paradigm: A Unified Framework of Optimization Approaches, Simulation Environment and Evaluation Metrics
**Authors**: Chengzhi Ji, Xingfeng Li, Zhaodong Lv, Hao Sun, Pan Liu, Hao Frank Yang, Ziyuan Pu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T10:22:50Z

**Summary**: Modular end-to-end (ME2E) autonomous driving paradigms combine modular interpretability with global optimization capability and have demonstrated strong performance. However, existing studies mainly focus on accuracy improvement, while critical system-level factors such as inference latency and energy consumption are often overlooked, resulting in increasingly complex model designs that hinder practical deployment. Prior efforts on model compression and acceleration typically optimize either the software or hardware side in isolation. Software-only optimization cannot fundamentally remove intermediate tensor access and operator scheduling overheads, whereas hardware-only optimization is constrained by model structure and precision. As a result, the real-world benefits of such optimizations are often limited. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a reusable software and hardware co-optimization and closed-loop evaluation framework for ME2E autonomous driving inference. The framework jointly integrates software-level model optimization with hardware-level computation optimization under a unified system-level objective. In addition, a multidimensional evaluation metric is introduced to assess system performance by jointly considering safety, comfort, efficiency, latency, and energy, enabling quantitative comparison of different optimization strategies. Experiments across multiple ME2E autonomous driving stacks show that the proposed framework preserves baseline-level driving performance while significantly reducing inference latency and energy consumption, achieving substantial overall system-level improvements. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides practical and actionable guidance for efficient deployment of ME2E autonomous driving systems.

### OpenTinker: Separating Concerns in Agentic Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Siqi Zhu, Jiaxuan You

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T09:57:46Z

**Summary**: We introduce OpenTinker, an infrastructure for reinforcement learning (RL) of large language model (LLM) agents built around a separation of concerns across algorithm design, execution, and agent-environment interaction. Rather than relying on monolithic, end-to-end RL pipelines, OpenTinker decomposes agentic learning systems into lightweight, composable components with clearly defined abstraction boundaries. Users specify agents, environments, and interaction protocols, while inference and training are delegated to a managed execution runtime. OpenTinker introduces a centralized scheduler for managing training and inference workloads, including LoRA-based and full-parameter RL, supervised fine-tuning, and inference, over shared resources. We further discuss design principles for extending OpenTinker to multi-agent training. Finally, we present a set of RL use cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in practical agentic learning scenarios.

### GROKE: Vision-Free Navigation Instruction Evaluation via Graph Reasoning on OpenStreetMap
**Authors**: Farzad Shami, Subhrasankha Dey, Nico Van de Weghe, Henrikki Tenkanen

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T09:56:47Z

**Summary**: The evaluation of navigation instructions remains a persistent challenge in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) research. Traditional reference-based metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture the functional utility of spatial directives, specifically whether an instruction successfully guides a navigator to the intended destination. Although existing VLN agents could serve as evaluators, their reliance on high-fidelity visual simulators introduces licensing constraints and computational costs, and perception errors further confound linguistic quality assessment. This paper introduces GROKE(Graph-based Reasoning over OSM Knowledge for instruction Evaluation), a vision-free training-free hierarchical LLM-based framework for evaluating navigation instructions using OpenStreetMap data. Through systematic ablation studies, we demonstrate that structured JSON and textual formats for spatial information substantially outperform grid-based and visual graph representations. Our hierarchical architecture combines sub-instruction planning with topological graph navigation, reducing navigation error by 68.5% compared to heuristic and sampling baselines on the Map2Seq dataset. The agent's execution success, trajectory fidelity, and decision patterns serve as proxy metrics for functional navigability given OSM-visible landmarks and topology, establishing a scalable and interpretable evaluation paradigm without visual dependencies. Code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/groke.

### Interpretable Text Classification Applied to the Detection of LLM-generated Creative Writing
**Authors**: Minerva Suvanto, Andrea McGlinchey, Mattias Wahde, Peter J Barclay

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T09:50:15Z

**Summary**: We consider the problem of distinguishing human-written creative fiction (excerpts from novels) from similar text generated by an LLM. Our results show that, while human observers perform poorly (near chance levels) on this binary classification task, a variety of machine-learning models achieve accuracy in the range 0.93 - 0.98 over a previously unseen test set, even using only short samples and single-token (unigram) features. We therefore employ an inherently interpretable (linear) classifier (with a test accuracy of 0.98), in order to elucidate the underlying reasons for this high accuracy. In our analysis, we identify specific unigram features indicative of LLM-generated text, one of the most important being that the LLM tends to use a larger variety of synonyms, thereby skewing the probability distributions in a manner that is easy to detect for a machine learning classifier, yet very difficult for a human observer. Four additional explanation categories were also identified, namely, temporal drift, Americanisms, foreign language usage, and colloquialisms. As identification of the AI-generated text depends on a constellation of such features, the classification appears robust, and therefore not easy to circumvent by malicious actors intent on misrepresenting AI-generated text as human work.

### From Human Bias to Robot Choice: How Occupational Contexts and Racial Priming Shape Robot Selection
**Authors**: Jiangen He, Wanqi Zhang, Jessica Barfield

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T09:47:56Z

**Summary**: As artificial agents increasingly integrate into professional environments, fundamental questions have emerged about how societal biases influence human-robot selection decisions. We conducted two comprehensive experiments (N = 1,038) examining how occupational contexts and stereotype activation shape robotic agent choices across construction, healthcare, educational, and athletic domains. Participants made selections from artificial agents that varied systematically in skin tone and anthropomorphic characteristics. Our study revealed distinct context-dependent patterns. Healthcare and educational scenarios demonstrated strong favoritism toward lighter-skinned artificial agents, while construction and athletic contexts showed greater acceptance of darker-toned alternatives. Participant race was associated with systematic differences in selection patterns across professional domains. The second experiment demonstrated that exposure to human professionals from specific racial backgrounds systematically shifted later robotic agent preferences in stereotype-consistent directions. These findings show that occupational biases and color-based discrimination transfer directly from human-human to human-robot evaluation contexts. The results highlight mechanisms through which robotic deployment may unintentionally perpetuate existing social inequalities.

### FOCAL: A Novel Benchmarking Technique for Multi-modal Agents
**Authors**: Aditya Choudhary, Anupam Purwar

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T09:46:06Z

**Summary**: With the recent advancements in reasoning capabilities, tool calling using MCP servers and Audio Language Models (ALMs), development and integration of multi-modal agents (with voice and text support) has come to the industry forefront. Cascading pipelines for voice agents still play a central role in the industry owing to their superior reasoning capabilities facilitated by LLMs. Although, cascading pipelines often present error propagation through the pipeline. We propose a framework, FOCAL to benchmark end-to-end reasoning, component-wise error propagation and error analysis for automated as well as human-assisted testing of multi-modal agents (voice to voice + text input). We also share two novel metrics viz. Reasoning and Semantic scores to evaluate efficacy of the agent in having meaningful conversations in voice mode.

### Review of Passenger Flow Modelling Approaches Based on a Bibliometric Analysis
**Authors**: Jonathan Hecht, Weilian Li, Ziyue Li, Youness Dehbi

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T09:43:42Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the field of short-term passenger flow forecasting within local public transit, covering 814 publications that span from 1984 to 2024. In addition to common bibliometric analysis tools, a variant of a citation network was developed, and topic modelling was conducted. The analysis reveals that research activity exhibited sporadic patterns prior to 2008, followed by a marked acceleration, characterised by a shift from conventional statistical and machine learning methodologies (e.g., ARIMA, SVM, and basic neural networks) to specialised deep learning architectures. Based on this insight, a connection to more general fields such as machine learning and time series modelling was established. In addition to modelling, spatial, linguistic, and modal biases were identified and findings from existing secondary literature were validated and quantified. This revealed existing gaps, such as constrained data fusion, open (multivariate) data, and underappreciated challenges related to model interpretability, cost-efficiency, and a balance between algorithmic performance and practical deployment considerations. In connection with the superordinate fields, the growth in relevance of foundation models is also noteworthy.

### Topology Matters: Measuring Memory Leakage in Multi-Agent LLMs
**Authors**: Jinbo Liu, Defu Cao, Yifei Wei, Tianyao Su, Yuan Liang, Yushun Dong, Yan Liu, Yue Zhao, Xiyang Hu

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T09:40:51Z

**Summary**: Graph topology is a fundamental determinant of memory leakage in multi-agent LLM systems, yet its effects remain poorly quantified. We introduce MAMA (Multi-Agent Memory Attack), a framework that measures how network structure shapes leakage. MAMA operates on synthetic documents containing labeled Personally Identifiable Information (PII) entities, from which we generate sanitized task instructions. We execute a two-phase protocol: Engram (seeding private information into a target agent's memory) and Resonance (multi-round interaction where an attacker attempts extraction). Over 10 rounds, we measure leakage as exact-match recovery of ground-truth PII from attacker outputs. We evaluate six canonical topologies (complete, ring, chain, tree, star, star-ring) across $n\in\{4,5,6\}$, attacker-target placements, and base models. Results are consistent: denser connectivity, shorter attacker-target distance, and higher target centrality increase leakage; most leakage occurs in early rounds and then plateaus; model choice shifts absolute rates but preserves topology ordering; spatiotemporal/location attributes leak more readily than identity credentials or regulated identifiers. We distill practical guidance for system design: favor sparse or hierarchical connectivity, maximize attacker-target separation, and restrict hub/shortcut pathways via topology-aware access control.

### LogitSpec: Accelerating Retrieval-based Speculative Decoding via Next Next Token Speculation
**Authors**: Tianyu Liu, Qitan Lv, Hao Li, Xing Gao, Xiao Sun, Xiaoyan Sun

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T09:32:48Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding (SD), where a small draft model is employed to propose draft tokens in advance and then the target model validates them in parallel, has emerged as a promising technique for LLM inference acceleration. Many endeavors to improve SD are to eliminate the need for a draft model and generate draft tokens in a retrieval-based manner in order to further alleviate the drafting overhead and significantly reduce the difficulty in deployment and applications. However, retrieval-based SD relies on a matching paradigm to retrieval the most relevant reference as the draft tokens, where these methods often fail to find matched and accurate draft tokens. To address this challenge, we propose LogitSpec to effectively expand the retrieval range and find the most relevant reference as drafts. Our LogitSpec is motivated by the observation that the logit of the last token can not only predict the next token, but also speculate the next next token. Specifically, LogitSpec generates draft tokens in two steps: (1) utilizing the last logit to speculate the next next token; (2) retrieving relevant reference for both the next token and the next next token. LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which can be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks. Extensive experiments on a wide range of text generation benchmarks demonstrate that LogitSpec can achieve up to 2.61 $\times$ speedup and 3.28 mean accepted tokens per decoding step. Our code is available at https://github.com/smart-lty/LogitSpec.

### Semantic Compression of LLM Instructions via Symbolic Metalanguages
**Authors**: Ernst van Gassen

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T09:26:46Z

**Summary**: We introduce MetaGlyph, a symbolic language for compressing prompts by encoding instructions as mathematical symbols rather than prose. Unlike systems requiring explicit decoding rules, MetaGlyph uses symbols like $\in$ (membership) and $\Rightarrow$ (implication) that models already understand from their training data. We test whether these symbols work as ''instruction shortcuts'' that models can interpret without additional teaching.   We evaluate eight models across two dimensions relevant to practitioners: scale (3B-1T parameters) and accessibility (open-source for local deployment vs. proprietary APIs). MetaGlyph achieves 62-81% token reduction across all task types. For API-based deployments, this translates directly to cost savings; for local deployments, it reduces latency and memory pressure.   Results vary by model. Gemini 2.5 Flash achieves 75% semantic equivalence between symbolic and prose instructions on selection tasks, with 49.9% membership operator fidelity. Kimi K2 reaches 98.1% fidelity for implication ($\Rightarrow$) and achieves perfect (100%) accuracy on selection tasks with symbolic prompts. GPT-5.2 Chat shows the highest membership fidelity observed (91.3%), though with variable parse success across task types. Claude Haiku 4.5 achieves 100% parse success with 26% membership fidelity. Among mid-sized models, Qwen 2.5 7B shows 62% equivalence on extraction tasks. Mid-sized open-source models (7B-12B) show near-zero operator fidelity, suggesting a U-shaped relationship where sufficient scale overcomes instruction-tuning biases.

### TALON: Confidence-Aware Speculative Decoding with Adaptive Token Trees
**Authors**: Tianyu Liu, Qitan Lv, Yuhao Shen, Xiao Sun, Xiaoyan Sun

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T09:26:45Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding (SD) has become a standard technique for accelerating LLM inference without sacrificing output quality. Recent advances in speculative decoding have shifted from sequential chain-based drafting to tree-structured generation, where the draft model constructs a tree of candidate tokens to explore multiple possible drafts in parallel. However, existing tree-based SD methods typically build a fixed-width, fixed-depth draft tree, which fails to adapt to the varying difficulty of tokens and contexts. As a result, the draft model cannot dynamically adjust the tree structure to early stop on difficult tokens and extend generation for simple ones. To address these challenges, we introduce TALON, a training-free, budget-driven adaptive tree expansion framework that can be plugged into existing tree-based methods. Unlike static methods, TALON constructs the draft tree iteratively until a fixed token budget is met, using a hybrid expansion strategy that adaptively allocates the node budget to each layer of the draft tree. This framework naturally shapes the draft tree into a "deep-and-narrow" form for deterministic contexts and a "shallow-and-wide" form for uncertain branches, effectively optimizing the trade-off between exploration width and generation depth under a given budget. Extensive experiments across 5 models and 6 datasets demonstrate that TALON consistently outperforms state-of-the-art EAGLE-3, achieving up to 5.16x end-to-end speedup over auto-regressive decoding.

### Controlled Self-Evolution for Algorithmic Code Optimization
**Authors**: Tu Hu, Ronghao Chen, Shuo Zhang, Jianghao Yin, Mou Xiao Feng, Jingping Liu, Shaolei Zhang, Wenqi Jiang, Yuqi Fang, Sen Hu, Yi Xu, Huacan Wang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T09:23:13Z

**Summary**: Self-evolution methods enhance code generation through iterative "generate-verify-refine" cycles, yet existing approaches suffer from low exploration efficiency, failing to discover solutions with superior complexity within limited budgets. This inefficiency stems from initialization bias trapping evolution in poor solution regions, uncontrolled stochastic operations lacking feedback guidance, and insufficient experience utilization across tasks.To address these bottlenecks, we propose Controlled Self-Evolution (CSE), which consists of three key components. Diversified Planning Initialization generates structurally distinct algorithmic strategies for broad solution space coverage. Genetic Evolution replaces stochastic operations with feedback-guided mechanisms, enabling targeted mutation and compositional crossover. Hierarchical Evolution Memory captures both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels.Experiments on EffiBench-X demonstrate that CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones. Furthermore, CSE achieves higher efficiency from early generations and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/EvoControl.

### DiffER: Diffusion Entity-Relation Modeling for Reversal Curse in Diffusion Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shaokai He, Kaiwen Wei, Xinyi Zeng, Xiang Chen, Xue Yang, Zhenyang Li, Jiang Zhong, Yu Tian

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T09:22:10Z

**Summary**: The "reversal curse" refers to the phenomenon where large language models (LLMs) exhibit predominantly unidirectional behavior when processing logically bidirectional relationships. Prior work attributed this to autoregressive training -- predicting the next token inherently favors left-to-right information flow over genuine bidirectional knowledge associations. However, we observe that Diffusion LLMs (DLLMs), despite being trained bidirectionally, also suffer from the reversal curse. To investigate the root causes, we conduct systematic experiments on DLLMs and identify three key reasons: 1) entity fragmentation during training, 2) data asymmetry, and 3) missing entity relations. Motivated by the analysis of these reasons, we propose Diffusion Entity-Relation Modeling (DiffER), which addresses the reversal curse through entity-aware training and balanced data construction. Specifically, DiffER introduces whole-entity masking, which mitigates entity fragmentation by predicting complete entities in a single step. DiffER further employs distribution-symmetric and relation-enhanced data construction strategies to alleviate data asymmetry and missing relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffER effectively alleviates the reversal curse in Diffusion LLMs, offering new perspectives for future research.

### Agentic Diagnostic Reasoning over Telecom and Datacenter Infrastructure
**Authors**: Nicolas Tacheny

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T09:13:04Z

**Summary**: Large-scale telecom and datacenter infrastructures rely on multi-layered service and resource models, where failures propagate across physical and logical components and affect multiple customers. Traditional approaches to root cause analysis(RCA) rely on hard-coded graph traversal algorithms or rule-based correlation engines, which are costly to maintain and tightly coupled to the infrastructure model.   In this work, we introduce an agentic diagnostic framework where a Large Language Model (LLM) performs step-wise investigation using a constrained tool space exposed through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Instead of embedding causal logic or traversal algorithms into the application, the agent autonomously navigates the infrastructure model by invoking tools for service lookup, dependency retrieval, structured and unstructured data, and event analysis, and impact discovery. We define an investigation protocol that structures the agent's reasoning and ensures grounding, reproducibility, and safe handling of missing or ambiguous information.   This work lays the foundation for autonomous incident resolution and change impact mitigation. Future systems will not only diagnose and remediate infrastructure failures, but also predict the impact of planned changes on services and customers, enabling operators to mitigate risks before executing maintenance operations.

### Beyond Literal Mapping: Benchmarking and Improving Non-Literal Translation Evaluation
**Authors**: Yanzhi Tian, Cunxiang Wang, Zeming Liu, Heyan Huang, Wenbo Yu, Dawei Song, Jie Tang, Yuhang Guo

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T09:03:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced Machine Translation (MT), applying them to linguistically complex domains-such as Social Network Services, literature etc. In these scenarios, translations often require handling non-literal expressions, leading to the inaccuracy of MT metrics. To systematically investigate the reliability of MT metrics, we first curate a meta-evaluation dataset focused on non-literal translations, namely MENT. MENT encompasses four non-literal translation domains and features source sentences paired with translations from diverse MT systems, with 7,530 human-annotated scores on translation quality. Experimental results reveal the inaccuracies of traditional MT metrics and the limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge, particularly the knowledge cutoff and score inconsistency problem. To mitigate these limitations, we propose RATE, a novel agentic translation evaluation framework, centered by a reflective Core Agent that dynamically invokes specialized sub-agents. Experimental results indicate the efficacy of RATE, achieving an improvement of at least 3.2 meta score compared with current metrics. Further experiments demonstrate the robustness of RATE to general-domain MT evaluation. Code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/BITHLP/RATE.

**Summary**: The recent rapid deployment of datacenter infrastructures for performing large language models (LLMs) and related artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the clouds is predicted to incur an exponentially growing energy consumption in the near-term future. In this paper, we propose and analyze the implementation of the transformer model, which is the cornerstone of the modern LLMs, with novel large-scale optoelectronic neurons (OENs) constructed over a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible platform. With all of the required optoelectronic devices and electronic circuits integrated in a chiplet only about 2 cm by 3 cm in size, 175 billon parameters in the case of GPT-3 are shown to perform inference at an unprecedented speed of 12.6 POPS using only 40 nm CMOS process node, orchestrated by an optoelectronic version of systolic array with no data skew and negligible propagation delay, along with a high power efficiency of 74 TOPS/W and a high area efficiency of 19 TOPS/mm^2. The influence of the quantization formats and the hardware induced errors are numerically investigated, and are shown to have a minimal impact. Our study presents a new yet practical path toward analog neural processing units (NPUs) to complement existing digital processing units.

**Summary**: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have been widely applied in real-time scenarios, such as in-car assistants and online meeting comprehension. In practice, audio inputs are often corrupted by device and environmental noise, leading to performance degradation. However, existing LALM studies on noise lack quantitative analysis and rely mainly on intuition and empirical observation, thus failing to understand practical robustness. To address this issue, we introduce Signal Embedding Energy (SEE), a method for quantifying the impact of noise intensity on LALM inputs, enabling the differentiation of LALM robustness in real-world deployments. SEE introduces a perspective based on structured activation subspaces derived from the model's internal representations, which more accurately captures its perception of noise than raw audio features. Across experiments, SEE exhibits a strong correlation with LALM performance, achieving a correlation of 0.98. Surprisingly, traditional audio denoising methods are only marginally effective for LALMs, and, in some cases, even increase SEE and impair performance. This suggests a mismatch between speech-centric denoising objectives and the noise sensitivity of modern LALMs. Therefore, we propose a mitigation strategy derived from SEE to denoise LALM inputs, outperforming existing denoising methods. This paper introduces a novel metric for noise quantification in LALMs, providing guidance for robustness improvements in real-world deployments.

### BayesRAG: Probabilistic Mutual Evidence Corroboration for Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Xuan Li, Yining Wang, Haocai Luo, Shengping Liu, Jerry Liang, Ying Fu, Weihuang, Jun Yu, Junnan Zhu

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a pivotal paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet current approaches struggle with visually rich documents by treating text and images as isolated retrieval targets. Existing methods relying solely on cosine similarity often fail to capture the semantic reinforcement provided by cross-modal alignment and layout-induced coherence. To address these limitations, we propose BayesRAG, a novel multimodal retrieval framework grounded in Bayesian inference and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. Unlike traditional approaches that rank candidates strictly by similarity, BayesRAG models the intrinsic consistency of retrieved candidates across modalities as probabilistic evidence to refine retrieval confidence. Specifically, our method computes the posterior association probability for combinations of multimodal retrieval results, prioritizing text-image pairs that mutually corroborate each other in terms of both semantics and layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BayesRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on challenging multimodal benchmarks. This study establishes a new paradigm for multimodal retrieval fusion that effectively resolves the isolation of heterogeneous modalities through an evidence fusion mechanism and enhances the robustness of retrieval outcomes. Our code is available at https://github.com/TioeAre/BayesRAG.

### From static to adaptive: immune memory-based jailbreak detection for large language models
**Authors**: Jun Leng, Yu Liu, Litian Zhang, Ruihan Hu, Zhuting Fang, Xi Zhang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T08:45:25Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as the backbone of modern AI systems, yet they remain susceptible to adversarial jailbreak attacks. Consequently, robust detection of such malicious inputs is paramount for ensuring model safety. Traditional detection methods typically rely on external models trained on fixed, large-scale datasets, which often incur significant computational overhead. While recent methods shift toward leveraging internal safety signals of models to enable more lightweight and efficient detection. However, these methods remain inherently static and struggle to adapt to the evolving nature of jailbreak attacks. Drawing inspiration from the biological immune mechanism, we introduce the Immune Memory Adaptive Guard (IMAG) framework. By distilling and encoding safety patterns into a persistent, evolvable memory bank, IMAG enables adaptive generalization to emerging threats. Specifically, the framework orchestrates three synergistic components: Immune Detection, which employs retrieval for high-efficiency interception of known jailbreak attacks; Active Immunity, which performs proactive behavioral simulation to resolve ambiguous unknown queries; Memory Updating, which integrates validated attack patterns back into the memory bank. This closed-loop architecture transitions LLM defense from rigid filtering to autonomous adaptive mitigation. Extensive evaluations across five representative open-source LLMs demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, achieving a superior average detection accuracy of 94\% across diverse and complex attack types.

### Segmental Advantage Estimation: Enhancing PPO for Long-Context LLM Training
**Authors**: Xue Gong, Qi Yi, Ziyuan Nan, Guanhua Huang, Kejiao Li, Yuhao Jiang, Ruibin Xiong, Zenan Xu, Jiaming Guo, Shaohui Peng, Bo Zhou

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T08:41:47Z

**Summary**: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks is increasingly driven by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), where Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) provides a principled framework for stable policy updates. However, the practical application of PPO is hindered by unreliable advantage estimation in the sparse-reward RLVR regime. This issue arises because the sparse rewards in RLVR lead to inaccurate intermediate value predictions, which in turn introduce significant bias when aggregated at every token by Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE). To address this, we introduce Segmental Advantage Estimation (SAE), which mitigates the bias that GAE can incur in RLVR. Our key insight is that aggregating $n$-step advantages at every token(as in GAE) is unnecessary and often introduces excessive bias, since individual tokens carry minimal information. Instead, SAE first partitions the generated sequence into coherent sub-segments using low-probability tokens as heuristic boundaries. It then selectively computes variance-reduced advantage estimates only from these information-rich segment transitions, effectively filtering out noise from intermediate tokens. Our experiments demonstrate that SAE achieves superior performance, with marked improvements in final scores, training stability, and sample efficiency. These gains are shown to be consistent across multiple model sizes, and a correlation analysis confirms that our proposed advantage estimator achieves a higher correlation with an approximate ground-truth advantage, justifying its superior performance.

### Ultralow-noise microwave oscillator via optical frequency division with a co-self-injection-locked miniature Fabry-Perot reference
**Authors**: Runlin Miao, Chao Zhou, Pan Han, Mingxin Yang, Xing Zou, Ke Wei, Ke Yin, Tian Jiang

**Updated**: 2026-01-12T08:41:46Z

**Summary**: Optical frequency division (OFD) provides the purest microwaves by down-converting the stability of optical cavity references. State-of-the-art references typically rely on electronic co-Pound-Drever-Hall locking to ultrahigh-Q microresonators-a complex approach that introduces servo bumps and increases footprint. Alternatively, optical co-self-injection-locking (co-SIL) offers inherent simplicity but is limited by the large thermo-refractive noise and confined mode volumes of integrated cavities. Here, we demonstrate a two-point OFD-based microwave oscillator that combines an ultrahigh-Q miniature Fabry-Perot cavity with optical co-SIL. Leveraging its low relative phase noise optical reference and combing with an integrated soliton microcomb, the system generates a microwave with phase noise of -147 dBc/Hz at 4 kHz offset (scaled to 10 GHz)-performance rivalling most electronically stabilized systems. This work marries the superior noise floor of ultrahigh-Q cavities with the simplicity of optical locking, providing a compact, cost-effective, and field-deployable path to pure microwaves for next-generation communications, radar and metrology.
