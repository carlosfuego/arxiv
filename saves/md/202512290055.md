**Summary**: High-resolution video generation, while crucial for digital media and film, is computationally bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of diffusion models, making practical inference infeasible. To address this, we introduce HiStream, an efficient autoregressive framework that systematically reduces redundancy across three axes: i) Spatial Compression: denoising at low resolution before refining at high resolution with cached features; ii) Temporal Compression: a chunk-by-chunk strategy with a fixed-size anchor cache, ensuring stable inference speed; and iii) Timestep Compression: applying fewer denoising steps to subsequent, cache-conditioned chunks. On 1080p benchmarks, our primary HiStream model (i+ii) achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while demonstrating up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to the Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. Our faster variant, HiStream+, applies all three optimizations (i+ii+iii), achieving a 107.5x acceleration over the baseline, offering a compelling trade-off between speed and quality, thereby making high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable.

### Enhancing Grid Resilience for Giga-Watt Scale Data Centers Using High Voltage Circuit Breaker Operated Braking Resistors
**Authors**: Soham Ghosh, Mohammad Ashraf Hossain Sadi

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T17:23:48Z

**Summary**: As hyperscale and co-located data centers scale, the electric grid sees an increase in large, voltage-sensitive IT loads with these data center plant size ranging between 500 MW to 2 GW. A sudden loss of these loads as they switch to onsite UPS during grid voltage excursion events causes a grid frequency rise from generation and load imbalance, and a voltage rise because less power is flowing through the network. This paper proposes and theoretically demonstrates the use of high voltage circuit breaker operated braking resistors at data center transmission substations as an effective strategy in enhancing grid resilience under such large load loss scenarios. We developed a test bed to illustrate the dynamic behavior of the system with resistive braking on a gigawatt scale data center load cluster connected to a 345 kV network. The braking resistor(s), which in the case of inverter rich system comes in a multi-stage configuration, are connected or disconnected via high-speed circuit breaker(s). Results show that insertion for 0.25 to 0.85 seconds sufficiently reduce rate of change of frequency and provides time for primary governor response and capacitor switching to restore steady state. Sensitivity across different synchronous machines and inverter-based resource mix are tested and confirms robustness. We conclude circuit breaker controlled resistive braking is a practical means to enhance Bulk Electric System (BES) resilience for gigawatt scale data centers. The approach integrates with protection, needs no generator changes, and can be scaled with cluster size or growth of the data center facility load.

### CAKE: Cascading and Adaptive KV Cache Eviction with Layer Preferences
**Authors**: Ziran Qin, Yuchen Cao, Mingbao Lin, Wen Hu, Shixuan Fan, Ke Cheng, Weiyao Lin, Jianguo Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T13:21:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing long sequences, boosting demand for key-value (KV) caching. While recent efforts to evict KV cache have alleviated the inference burden, they often fail to allocate resources rationally across layers with different attention patterns. In this paper, we introduce Cascading and Adaptive KV cache Eviction (CAKE), a novel approach that frames KV cache eviction as a "cake-slicing problem." CAKE assesses layer-specific preferences by considering attention dynamics in both spatial and temporal dimensions, allocates rational cache size for layers accordingly, and manages memory constraints in a cascading manner. This approach enables a global view of cache allocation, adaptively distributing resources across diverse attention mechanisms while maintaining memory budgets. CAKE also employs a new eviction indicator that considers the shifting importance of tokens over time, addressing limitations in existing methods that overlook temporal dynamics. Comprehensive experiments on LongBench and NeedleBench show that CAKE maintains model performance with only 3.2% of the KV cache and consistently outperforms current baselines across various models and memory constraints, particularly in low-memory settings. Additionally, CAKE achieves over 10x speedup in decoding latency compared to full cache when processing contexts of 128K tokens with FlashAttention-2. Our code is available at https://github.com/antgroup/cakekv.

### V-Rex: Real-Time Streaming Video LLM Acceleration via Dynamic KV Cache Retrieval
**Authors**: Donghyuk Kim, Sejeong Yang, Wonjin Shin, Joo-Young Kim

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:46:59Z

**Summary**: Streaming video large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for real-time multimodal tasks such as video captioning, question answering, conversational agents, and augmented reality. However, these models face fundamental memory and computational challenges because their key-value (KV) caches grow substantially with continuous streaming video input. This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Due to its iterative prefill stage, it suffers from significant limitations, including extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in accuracy. Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment, which is the primary target for these models.   In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. At its core, V-Rex introduces ReSV, a training-free dynamic KV cache retrieval algorithm. ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames. To fully realize these algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring bit-level and early-exit based computing units. V-Rex achieves unprecedented real-time of 3.9-8.3 FPS and energy-efficient streaming video LLM inference on edge deployment with negligible accuracy loss. While DRE only accounts for 2.2% power and 2.0% area, the system delivers 1.9-19.7x speedup and 3.1-18.5x energy efficiency improvements over AGX Orin GPU. This work is the first to comprehensively tackle KV cache retrieval across algorithms and hardware, enabling real-time streaming video LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices.

### RevFFN: Memory-Efficient Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning of Mixture-of-Experts LLMs with Reversible Blocks
**Authors**: Ningyuan Liu, Jing Yang, Kaitong Cai, Keze Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T03:56:58Z

**Summary**: Full parameter fine tuning is a key technique for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, but it incurs substantial memory overhead due to the need to cache extensive intermediate activations for backpropagation. This bottleneck makes full fine tuning of contemporary large scale LLMs challenging in practice. Existing distributed training frameworks such as DeepSpeed alleviate this issue using techniques like ZeRO and FSDP, which rely on multi GPU memory or CPU offloading, but often require additional hardware resources and reduce training speed. We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory. While preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures, this approach significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine tuning. As a result, RevFFN enables efficient full fine tuning on a single consumer grade or server grade GPU.

### DiffusionVL: Translating Any Autoregressive Models into Diffusion Vision Language Models
**Authors**: Lunbin Zeng, Jingfeng Yao, Bencheng Liao, Hongyuan Tao, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T03:37:34Z

**Summary**: In recent multimodal research, the diffusion paradigm has emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm (AR), owing to its unique decoding advantages. However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup. The model and code are released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionVL.

### The Silent Scholar Problem: A Probabilistic Framework for Breaking Epistemic Asymmetry in LLM Agents
**Authors**: Zan-Kai Chong, Hiroyuki Ohsaki, Bryan Ng

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T02:02:25Z

**Summary**: Autonomous agents powered by LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are proficient consumers of digital content but remain unidirectional, a limitation we term epistemic asymmetry. This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($γ$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $γ$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\mathbb{E}[θ]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Simulation results validate that this uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous (Zipfian) environments, maintaining high adaptability to concept drift.

### Memorize-and-Generate: Towards Long-Term Consistency in Real-Time Video Generation
**Authors**: Tianrui Zhu, Shiyi Zhang, Zhirui Sun, Jingqi Tian, Yansong Tang

**Updated**: 2025-12-23T16:47:46Z

**Summary**: Frame-level autoregressive (frame-AR) models have achieved significant progress, enabling real-time video generation comparable to bidirectional diffusion models and serving as a foundation for interactive world models and game engines. However, current approaches in long video generation typically rely on window attention, which naively discards historical context outside the window, leading to catastrophic forgetting and scene inconsistency; conversely, retaining full history incurs prohibitive memory costs. To address this trade-off, we propose Memorize-and-Generate (MAG), a framework that decouples memory compression and frame generation into distinct tasks. Specifically, we train a memory model to compress historical information into a compact KV cache, and a separate generator model to synthesize subsequent frames utilizing this compressed representation. Furthermore, we introduce MAG-Bench to strictly evaluate historical memory retention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAG achieves superior historical scene consistency while maintaining competitive performance on standard video generation benchmarks.

### ActionFlow: A Pipelined Action Acceleration for Vision Language Models on Edge
**Authors**: Yuntao Dai, Hang Gu, Teng Wang, Qianyu Cheng, Yifei Zheng, Zhiyong Qiu, Lei Gong, Wenqi Lou, Xuehai Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-12-23T11:29:03Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a unified paradigm for robotic perception and control, enabling emergent generalization and long-horizon task execution. However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

### Memory as Resonance: A Biomimetic Architecture for Infinite Context Memory on Ergodic Phonetic Manifolds
**Authors**: Tarik Houichime, Abdelghani Souhar, Younes El Amrani

**Updated**: 2025-12-23T10:55:32Z

**Summary**: The memory of contemporary Large Language Models is bound by a physical paradox: as they learn, they fill up. The linear accumulation (O(N)) of Key-Value states treats context as a warehouse of static artifacts, eventually forcing a destructive choice between amnesia and latency. We challenge this discrete orthodoxy, proposing that long-term memory is not the storage of items, but the persistence of a trajectory. We introduce Phonetic Trajectory Memory (PTM), a neuro-symbolic architecture that encodes language not as a sequence of tensors, but as a continuous path on an ergodic manifold governed by irrational rotation matrices. By decoupling the navigation (an invariant O(1) geometric signal) from the reconstruction (a probabilistic generative act), PTM achieves a compression magnitude of greater than 3,000x relative to dense caches. We demonstrate that retrieval becomes a process of resonance: the phonetic trace stabilizes the model against hallucination via "Signal Consensus" mechanism, securing up to approximately 92% factual accuracy. While this aggressive abstraction alters generative texture, it unlocks immediate access latency (approximately 34ms) independent of depth. Our results suggest that infinite context does not require infinite silicon; it requires treating memory not as data to be stored, but as a reconstructive process acting on a conserved, undying physical signal.

### Joint Design of Embedded Index Coding and Beamforming for MIMO-based Distributed Computing via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Heekang Song, Wan Choi

**Updated**: 2025-12-23T09:49:25Z

**Summary**: In distributed computing systems, reducing the communication load during the data shuffling phase is a critical challenge, as excessive inter-node transmissions are a major performance bottleneck. One promising approach to alleviate this burden is Embedded Index Coding (EIC), which exploits cached data at user nodes to encode transmissions more efficiently. However, most prior work on EIC has focused on minimizing code length in wired, error-free environments-an objective often suboptimal for wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where channel conditions and spatial multiplexing gains must be considered. This paper investigates the joint design of EIC and transmit beamforming in MIMO systems to minimize total transmission time, an NP-hard problem. We first present a conventional optimization method that determines the optimal EIC via exhaustive search. To address its prohibitive complexity and adapt to dynamic wireless environments, we propose a novel, low-complexity multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The proposed framework enables decentralized agents to act on local observations while effectively managing the hybrid action space of discrete EIC selection and continuous beamforming design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MARL-based approach achieves near-optimal performance with significantly reduced complexity, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for real-world wireless systems.

### Efficient Low Rank Attention for Long-Context Inference in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Tenghui Li, Guoxu Zhou, Xuyang Zhao, Yuning Qiu, Qibin Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-12-23T08:47:31Z

**Summary**: As the length of input text increases, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning, reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal retention of key-value pairs. In this work, Low Rank Query and Key attention (LRQK) is introduced, a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes full-precision query and key matrices into compact rank-\(r\) factors during the prefill stage, and then employs these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores in \(\mathcal{O}(lr)\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the top-\(k\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism where only missing full-precision KV pairs are transferred, thereby preserving exact attention outputs while reducing CPU-GPU data movement. Extensive experiments on the RULER and LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that LRQK matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings, while delivering significant memory savings with minimal accuracy loss. Our code is available at https://github.com/tenghuilee/LRQK.

### Ultrahigh Charge-to-Spin Conversion and Tunneling Magnetoresistance in Quasi-Two-Dimensional d-wave Altermagnet
**Authors**: Qing Zhang, Siyun Wang, Jianting Dong, Jia Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-23T05:52:45Z

**Summary**: The emergence of altermagnets has driven groundbreaking advances in spintronics. Notably, d-wave altermagnets support non-relativistic spin transport, efficient charge-to-spin conversion, and T-odd spin currents. In addition, their integration as electrodes in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) enables a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, allowing electrical detection of Néel vectors for next-generation memory devices. In this work, we investigate the non-relativistic spin transport properties of the quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) d-wave altermagnet KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O and the TMR effect in KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O-based AFMTJs via first-principles calculations. Our results reveal that KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O exhibits a non-relativistic longitudinal spin polarization and a spin Hall angle both exceeding 60\% at room temperature, while KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O-based AFMTJs achieve a giant TMR reaching approximately $10^{12}$\%, which remains robust against Fermi level shifts. These findings highlight the anisotropic spin polarization inherent to d-wave staggered magnetism and underscore the critical role of Fermi surface topology in enhancing T-odd spin transport and the TMR effect in AFMTJs.

### VNF-Cache: An In-Network Key-Value Store Cache Based on Network Function Virtualization
**Authors**: Bruno E. Farias, José Flauzino, Elias P. Duarte

**Updated**: 2025-12-23T01:25:21Z

**Summary**: With the exponential growth of the amount of data available on the Internet, optimizing the response time and resource usage for data access becomes essential. Caches are an effective solution that brings data closer to clients, eliminating repetitive requests to servers. This paper presents VNF-Cache, a caching service for geographically remote key-value databases. VNF-Cache is an NFV-COIN (Network Function Virtualization-Computing In The Network) service, a technology undergoing standardization by the IETF that enables the implementation of arbitrary services directly in the network. VNF-Cache intercepts network packets, processes, stores, and sends values directly to clients when possible. Through a proof-of-concept implementation and experiments conducted with geographically dispersed servers in Brazil, the United States, and Japan, significant reductions in response time and increases in the number of requests processed per second were observed.

### PHOTON: Hierarchical Autoregressive Modeling for Lightspeed and Memory-Efficient Language Generation
**Authors**: Yuma Ichikawa, Naoya Takagi, Takumi Nakagawa, Yuzi Kanazawa, Akira Sakai

**Updated**: 2025-12-22T19:26:59Z

**Summary**: Transformers operate as horizontal token-by-token scanners; at each generation step, the model attends to an ever-growing sequence of token-level states. This access pattern increases prefill latency and makes long-context decoding increasingly memory-bound, as KV-cache reads and writes dominate inference throughput rather than arithmetic computation. We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, offering significant advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks. This reduces decode-time KV-cache traffic, yielding up to $10^{3}\times$ higher throughput per unit memory.

### WorldWarp: Propagating 3D Geometry with Asynchronous Video Diffusion
**Authors**: Hanyang Kong, Xingyi Yang, Xiaoxu Zheng, Xinchao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-22T18:53:50Z

**Summary**: Generating long-range, geometrically consistent video presents a fundamental dilemma: while consistency demands strict adherence to 3D geometry in pixel space, state-of-the-art generative models operate most effectively in a camera-conditioned latent space. This disconnect causes current methods to struggle with occluded areas and complex camera trajectories. To bridge this gap, we propose WorldWarp, a framework that couples a 3D structural anchor with a 2D generative refiner. To establish geometric grounding, WorldWarp maintains an online 3D geometric cache built via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly warping historical content into novel views, this cache acts as a structural scaffold, ensuring each new frame respects prior geometry. However, static warping inevitably leaves holes and artifacts due to occlusions. We address this using a Spatio-Temporal Diffusion (ST-Diff) model designed for a "fill-and-revise" objective. Our key innovation is a spatio-temporal varying noise schedule: blank regions receive full noise to trigger generation, while warped regions receive partial noise to enable refinement. By dynamically updating the 3D cache at every step, WorldWarp maintains consistency across video chunks. Consequently, it achieves state-of-the-art fidelity by ensuring that 3D logic guides structure while diffusion logic perfects texture.

### Neutron-Assisted Breakdown Enhancement in $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Schottky Diodes
**Authors**: Saleh Ahmed Khan, Sudipto Saha, Ahmed Ibreljic, Stephen Margiotta, Jiawei Liu, Walid Amir, Surajit Chakraborty, Uttam Singisetti, A F M Anhar Uddin Bhuiyan

**Updated**: 2025-12-22T16:32:07Z

**Summary**: This study demonstrates a substantial enhancement of breakdown voltage in $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Schottky diodes through an approach that combines fast neutron irradiation with controlled post-irradiation electro-thermal annealing. Devices irradiated with 1 MeV neutrons at a high fluence of 1E15 n/cm^2 exhibited substantial degradation, including a drastic reduction in on-current and an increase in on-resistance. Electrothermal testing, conducted through simultaneous current-voltage (J-V) measurements and thermal annealing, resulted in significant recovery. After four cycles of electro-thermal testing, the devices demonstrated significant improvements in performance, with a substantial recovery of on-current and a reduction in on-resistance compared to the post-radiation condition, approaching pre-radiation levels. Most recovery occurred during the first two cycles, with diminishing improvements in later cycles, indicating that most thermally recoverable traps were mitigated early. Capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements revealed a substantial reduction in carrier concentration, decreasing from 3.2E16 cm^-3 pre-radiation to 5.5E15 cm^-3 after the first electro-thermal testing cycle, indicating an over 82% reduction. Following the third cycle, the carrier concentration partially recovered to 9.9E15 cm^-3, reflecting a carrier removal rate of ~22 cm^-1. The breakdown voltage exhibited a remarkable enhancement, increasing from approximately 300 V to 1.28 kV (a ~325% improvement) after the first electro-thermal testing, attributed to the reduction in carrier concentration by compensating radiation-induced traps. Subsequent testing reduced breakdown voltage slightly to 940 V due to partial recovery of carrier concentration, but it remained significantly higher than pre-radiation levels.

**Summary**: The PTOLEMY project is prototyping a novel electromagnetic filter for high-precision $β$ spectroscopy, with the ultimate and ambitious long-term goal of detecting the cosmic neutrino background through electron capture on tritium bound to graphene. Intermediate small-scale prototypes can achieve competitive sensitivity to the effective neutrino mass, even with reduced energy resolution. To reach an energy resolution better than \SI{500}{meV} at the tritium $β$-spectrum endpoint of \SI{18.6}{keV}, and accounting for all uncertainties in the filtering chain, the electrode voltage must be controlled at the level of a few parts per million and monitored in real time. In this work, we present the first results obtained in this effort, using a chain of commercial ultra-high-precision voltage references, read out by precision multimeters and a \emph{field mill} device. The currently available precision on high voltage is, in the conservative case, as low as \SI{0.2}{ppm} per \SI{1}{kV} single board and $\lesssim$ \SI{50}{mV} over the \SI{10}{kV} series, presently limited by field mill read-out noise. However, assuming uncorrelated Gaussian noise extrapolation, the real precision could in principle be as low as \SI{0.05}{ppm} over \SI{20}{kV}.

**Updated**: 2025-12-22T14:32:19Z

**Summary**: Cockcroft-Walton (CW) voltage multipliers suffer from output ripple that classical analytical models underestimate due to neglected non-idealities like diode drops and capacitor ESR, particularly in high-stage, low-frequency and heavy-load regimes. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that generates a comprehensive 324-case MATLAB/Simulink dataset varying stages (2-8), input voltage (5-25 kV), capacitance (1-10 μF), frequency (50-500 Hz) and load (6-60 MΩ), then trains a Random Forest model to predict residuals between simulated and theoretical peak-to-peak ripple. The approach achieves 70.6% RMSE reduction (131 V vs. 448 V) globally and 66.7% in critical regimes, with near-zero bias, enabling physically interpretable design optimization while outperforming pure ML in extrapolation reliability.

### Learning What to Write: Write-Gated KV for Efficient Long-Context Inference
**Authors**: Yen-Chieh Huang, Pi-Cheng Hsiu, Rui Fang, Ming-Syan Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-22T10:23:36Z

**Summary**: Long-context LLM inference is bottlenecked by the quadratic attention complexity and linear KV cache growth. Prior approaches mitigate this via post-hoc selection or eviction but overlook the root inefficiency: indiscriminate writing to persistent memory. In this paper, we formalize KV cache management as a causal system of three primitives: KV Admission, Selection, and Eviction. We instantiate KV Admission via Write-Gated KV, a lightweight mechanism that learns to predict token utility before it enters the cache. By filtering out low-utility states early to maintain a compact global cache alongside a sliding local cache, Write-Gated KV reduces memory usage by 46-57% and delivers 3.03-3.45$\times$ prefill and 1.89-2.56$\times$ decode speedups on Llama model with negligible accuracy loss, all while remaining compatible with FlashAttention and paged-KV systems. These results demonstrate that learning what to write, is a principled and practical recipe for efficient long-context inference. Code is available at https://github.com/EMCLab-Sinica/WG-KV .

### MixKVQ: Query-Aware Mixed-Precision KV Cache Quantization for Long-Context Reasoning
**Authors**: Tao Zhang, Ziqian Zeng, Hao Peng, Huiping Zhuang, Cen Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-22T09:44:26Z

**Summary**: Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), but this progress is accompanied by substantial memory and latency overhead from the extensive Key-Value (KV) cache. Although KV cache quantization is a promising compression technique, existing low-bit quantization methods often exhibit severe performance degradation on complex reasoning tasks. Fixed-precision quantization struggles to handle outlier channels in the key cache, while current mixed-precision strategies fail to accurately identify components requiring high-precision representation. We find that an effective low-bit KV cache quantization strategy must consider two factors: a key channel's intrinsic quantization difficulty and its relevance to the query. Based on this insight, we propose MixKVQ, a novel plug-and-play method that introduces a lightweight, query-aware algorithm to identify and preserve critical key channels that need higher precision, while applying per-token quantization for value cache. Experiments on complex reasoning datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing low-bit methods, achieving performance comparable to a full-precision baseline at a substantially reduced memory footprint.

**Updated**: 2025-12-22T04:40:04Z

**Summary**: In recent years, while cloud-based MLLMs such as QwenVL, InternVL, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude Sonnet have demonstrated outstanding performance with enormous model sizes reaching hundreds of billions of parameters, they significantly surpass the limitations in memory, power consumption, and computing capacity of edge devices such as mobile phones. This paper introduces AndesVL, a suite of mobile-side MLLMs with 0.6B to 4B parameters based on Qwen3's LLM and various visual encoders. We comprehensively outline the model architectures, training pipeline, and training data of AndesVL, which achieves first-tier performance across a wide range of open-source benchmarks, including fields such as text-rich image understanding, reasoning and math, multi-image comprehension, general VQA, hallucination mitigation, multilingual understanding, and GUI-related tasks when compared with state-of-the-art models of a similar scale. Furthermore, we introduce a 1+N LoRA architecture alongside a Quantization-Aware LoRA Fine-Tuning (QALFT) framework to facilitate efficient task adaptation and model compression during mobile-side deployment of AndesVL. Moreover, utilizing our cache eviction algorithm -- OKV -- along with customized speculative decoding and compression strategies, we achieve a 6.7x peak decoding speedup ratio, up to 30.9% memory reduction, and 1.8 bits-per-weight when deploying AndesVL-4B on MediaTek Dimensity 9500 chips. We release all models on https://huggingface.co/OPPOer.

### Memory-Efficient Training with In-Place FFT Implementation
**Authors**: Xinyu Ding, Bangtian Liu, Siyu Liao, Zhongfeng Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-22T02:25:29Z

**Summary**: Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) are widely used to reduce memory and computational costs in deep learning. However, existing implementations, including standard FFT and real FFT (rFFT), cannot achieve true in-place computation. In particular, rFFT maps an input of size n to a complex output of size n/2+1, causing dimensional mismatch and requiring additional memory allocation. We propose the first real-domain, fully in-place FFT framework (rdFFT) that preserves input-output memory space consistency. By leveraging butterfly operation symmetry and conjugate properties in the frequency domain, we design an implicit complex encoding scheme that eliminates intermediate cache usage entirely. Experiments on multiple natural language understanding tasks demonstrate the method effectiveness in reducing training memory cost, offering a promising direction for frequency-domain lightweight adaptation.

### Remoe: Towards Efficient and Low-Cost MoE Inference in Serverless Computing
**Authors**: Wentao Liu, Yuhao Hu, Ruiting Zhou, Baochun Li, Ne Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-21T10:27:50Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture in large language models (LLMs) due to its ability to scale model capacity via sparse expert activation. Meanwhile, serverless computing, with its elasticity and pay-per-use billing, is well-suited for deploying MoEs with bursty workloads. However, the large number of experts in MoE models incurs high inference costs due to memory-intensive parameter caching. These costs are difficult to mitigate via simple model partitioning due to input-dependent expert activation. To address these issues, we propose Remoe, a heterogeneous MoE inference system tailored for serverless computing. Remoe assigns non-expert modules to GPUs and expert modules to CPUs, and further offloads infrequently activated experts to separate serverless functions to reduce memory overhead and enable parallel execution. We incorporate three key techniques: (1) a Similar Prompts Searching (SPS) algorithm to predict expert activation patterns based on semantic similarity of inputs; (2) a Main Model Pre-allocation (MMP) algorithm to ensure service-level objectives (SLOs) via worst-case memory estimation; and (3) a joint memory and replica optimization framework leveraging Lagrangian duality and the Longest Processing Time (LPT) algorithm. We implement Remoe on Kubernetes and evaluate it across multiple LLM benchmarks. Experimental results show that Remoe reduces inference cost by up to 57% and cold start latency by 47% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

### JFR: An Efficient Jump Frontier Relaxation Strategy for Bellman-Ford
**Authors**: Xin Wang, Xi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-20T14:13:44Z

**Summary**: We propose JFR, a Bellman-Ford-based optimization framework leveraging frontier contraction and abstract multi-hop jump propagation to accelerate shortest-path computation while strictly preserving correctness. JFR achieves substantial reductions in relaxation operations, ranging from -31 to 99 percent, across sparse, dense, and negative-edge graphs, ensuring robust performance even under adversarial or highly connected topologies. On ultra-large graphs with up to N=10,000 nodes and 55,000,000 edges, JFR maintains strong operational reductions and comparable or improved runtime relative to SPFA-SLF, demonstrating consistent robustness across graph size and density. Lower relaxation counts imply reduced memory-access overheads and computational effort; this normalized work reduction highlights JFR's suitability for scenarios requiring high throughput or energy-conscious operation. Future work focuses on integrating high-performance queue structures, adaptive frontier strategies, and cache-aware techniques to further reduce constant-factor overheads and fully realize JFR's practical runtime potential.

### Theodosian: A Deep Dive into Memory-Hierarchy-Centric FHE Acceleration
**Authors**: Wonseok Choi, Hyunah Yu, Jongmin Kim, Hyesung Ji, Jaiyoung Park, Jung Ho Ahn

**Updated**: 2025-12-20T12:18:29Z

**Summary**: Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables secure computation on encrypted data, mitigating privacy concerns in cloud and edge environments. However, due to its high compute and memory demands, extensive acceleration research has been pursued across diverse hardware platforms, especially GPUs. In this paper, we perform a microarchitectural analysis of CKKS, a popular FHE scheme, on modern GPUs. We focus on on-chip cache behavior, and show that the dominant kernels remain bound by memory bandwidth despite a high-bandwidth L2 cache, exposing a persistent memory wall. We further discover that the overall CKKS pipeline throughput is constrained by low per-kernel hardware utilization, caused by insufficient intra-kernel parallelism. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Theodosian, a set of complementary, memory-aware optimizations that improve cache efficiency and reduce runtime overheads. Our approach delivers consistent speedups across various CKKS workloads. On an RTX 5090, we reduce the bootstrapping latency for 32,768 complex numbers to 15.2ms with Theodosian, and further to 12.8ms with additional algorithmic optimizations, establishing new state-of-the-art GPU performance to the best of our knowledge.

### Towards Efficient Agents: A Co-Design of Inference Architecture and System

**Updated**: 2025-12-20T12:06:13Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of large language model (LLM)-based agents has unlocked new possibilities for autonomous multi-turn reasoning and tool-augmented decision-making. However, their real-world deployment is hindered by severe inefficiencies that arise not from isolated model inference, but from the systemic latency accumulated across reasoning loops, context growth, and heterogeneous tool interactions. This paper presents AgentInfer, a unified framework for end-to-end agent acceleration that bridges inference optimization and architectural design. We decompose the problem into four synergistic components: AgentCollab, a hierarchical dual-model reasoning framework that balances large- and small-model usage through dynamic role assignment; AgentSched, a cache-aware hybrid scheduler that minimizes latency under heterogeneous request patterns; AgentSAM, a suffix-automaton-based speculative decoding method that reuses multi-session semantic memory to achieve low-overhead inference acceleration; and AgentCompress, a semantic compression mechanism that asynchronously distills and reorganizes agent memory without disrupting ongoing reasoning. Together, these modules form a Self-Evolution Engine capable of sustaining efficiency and cognitive stability throughout long-horizon reasoning tasks. Experiments on the BrowseComp-zh and DeepDiver benchmarks demonstrate that through the synergistic collaboration of these methods, AgentInfer reduces ineffective token consumption by over 50%, achieving an overall 1.8-2.5 times speedup with preserved accuracy. These results underscore that optimizing for agentic task completion-rather than merely per-token throughput-is the key to building scalable, efficient, and self-improving intelligent systems.

### BARD: Reducing Write Latency of DDR5 Memory by Exploiting Bank-Parallelism
**Authors**: Suhas Vittal, Moinuddin Qureshi

**Updated**: 2025-12-20T10:11:47Z

**Summary**: This paper studies the impact of DRAM writes on DDR5-based system. To efficiently perform DRAM writes, modern systems buffer write requests and try to complete multiple write operations whenever the DRAM mode is switched from read to write. When the DRAM system is performing writes, it is not available to service read requests, thus increasing read latency and reducing performance. We observe that, given the presence of on-die ECC in DDR5 devices, the time to perform a write operation varies significantly: from 1x (for writes to banks of different bankgroups) to 6x (for writes to banks within the same bankgroup) to 24x (for conflicting requests to the same bank). If we can orchestrate the write stream to favor write requests that incur lower latency, then we can reduce the stall time from DRAM writes and improve performance. However, for current systems, the write stream is dictated by the cache replacement policy, which makes eviction decisions without being aware of the variable latency of DRAM writes. The key insight of our work is to improve performance by modifying the cache replacement policy to increase bank-parallelism of DRAM writes.   Our paper proposes {\em BARD (Bank-Aware Replacement Decisions)}, which modifies the cache replacement policy to favor dirty lines that belong to banks without pending writes. We analyze two variants of BARD: BARD-E (Eviction-based), which changes the eviction policy to evict low-cost dirty lines, and BARD-C (Cleansing-Based), which proactively cleans low-cost dirty lines without modifying the eviction decisions. We develop a hybrid policy (BARD-H), which uses a selective combination of both eviction and writeback. Our evaluations across workloads from SPEC2017, LIGRA, STREAM, and Google server traces show that BARD-H improves performance by 4.3\% on average and up-to 8.5\%. BARD requires only 8 bytes of SRAM per LLC slice.

### TraCT: Disaggregated LLM Serving with CXL Shared Memory KV Cache at Rack-Scale
**Authors**: Dongha Yoon, Younghoon Min, Hoshik Kim, Sam H. Noh, Jongryool Kim

**Updated**: 2025-12-20T03:42:19Z

**Summary**: Disaggregated LLM serving improves resource efficiency by separating the compute-intensive prefill phase from the latency-critical decode phase. However, this architecture introduces a fundamental bottleneck: key/value (KV) tensors generated during prefill must be transferred to decode workers, and existing systems rely on RDMA-based network paths for this exchange. As model sizes and context lengths increase, KV transfer dominates both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and peak throughput, and remains highly sensitive to network contention even when prefix reuse is high. This paper presents TraCT, a rack-scale LLM serving system that uses CXL shared memory as both a KV-transfer substrate and a rack-wide prefix-aware KV cache. TraCT enables GPUs to write and read KV blocks directly through CXL load/store and DMA operations, eliminating the NIC hop that constrains existing disaggregated pipelines. However, to realize this design, multiple new challenges such as synchronization, consistency, and data management on non-coherent CXL memory need to be addressed. TraCT proposes various software solutions such as the two-tier inter-node synchronization mechanism to address these challenges. We implement TraCT on the Dynamo LLM inference framework and show that, across static and synthetic workloads, TraCT reduces average TTFT by up to 9.8x, lowers P99 latency by up to 6.2x, and improves peak throughput by up to 1.6x compared to RDMA and DRAM-based caching baselines.

### Continuum: Efficient and Robust Multi-Turn LLM Agent Scheduling with KV Cache Time-to-Live
**Authors**: Hanchen Li, Qiuyang Mang, Runyuan He, Qizheng Zhang, Huanzhi Mao, Xiaokun Chen, Hangrui Zhou, Alvin Cheung, Joseph Gonzalez, Ion Stoica

**Updated**: 2025-12-20T01:17:03Z

**Summary**: KV cache management is essential for efficient LLM inference. To maximize utilization, existing inference engines evict finished requests' KV cache if new requests are waiting. This policy breaks for agentic workloads, which interleave LLM calls with tools, introducing pauses that prevent effective KV reuse across turns. Since some tool calls have much shorter durations than human response multi-turn chatbot, it would be promising to retain the KV cache in during these tools. However, there are many challenges. First, we need to consider both the potential cost of recomputation or reloading (if CPU offloading enabled) and the increasing queueing delays after eviction from GPU. Second, due to the internal variance of tool call durations, we need the method to remain robust under limited predictability of tool call durations.   We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for multi-turn agent workloads by introducing time-to-live mechanism for KV cache retaining. For LLM request that generates a tool call, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a time-to-live value determined by considering both the reload cost and ordering preserve benefit of retaining KV cache. Moreover, when the TTL expires, the KV cache can be automatically evicted to free up GPU memory, providing robust performance under edge cases. When combined with program-level first-come-first-serve, Continuum preserves multi-turn continuity, and reduces delay for complex agentic workflows. Our evaluation on real-world agentic workloads (SWE-Bench and BFCL) with Llama-3.1 8B/70B shows that Continuum significantly improves the average job completion times and its improvement scales with turn number increase.

### Factorized Transport Alignment for Multimodal and Multiview E-commerce Representation Learning
**Authors**: Xiwen Chen, Yen-Chieh Lien, Susan Liu, María Castaños, Abolfazl Razi, Xiaoting Zhao, Congzhe Su

**Updated**: 2025-12-19T22:50:49Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of e-commerce requires robust multimodal representations that capture diverse signals from user-generated listings. Existing vision-language models (VLMs) typically align titles with primary images, i.e., single-view, but overlook non-primary images and auxiliary textual views that provide critical semantics in open marketplaces such as Etsy or Poshmark. To this end, we propose a framework that unifies multimodal and multi-view learning through Factorized Transport, a lightweight approximation of optimal transport, designed for scalability and deployment efficiency. During training, the method emphasizes primary views while stochastically sampling auxiliary ones, reducing training cost from quadratic in the number of views to constant per item. At inference, all views are fused into a single cached embedding, preserving the efficiency of two-tower retrieval with no additional online overhead. On an industrial dataset of 1M product listings and 0.3M interactions, our approach delivers consistent improvements in cross-view and query-to-item retrieval, achieving up to +7.9% Recall@500 over strong multimodal baselines. Overall, our framework bridges scalability with optimal transport-based learning, making multi-view pretraining practical for large-scale e-commerce search.

**Updated**: 2025-12-19T15:04:24Z

**Summary**: Robotic arm manipulation in data-scarce settings is a highly challenging task due to the complex embodiment dynamics and diverse contexts. Recent video-based approaches have shown great promise in capturing and transferring the temporal and physical interactions by pre-training on Internet-scale video data. However, such methods are often not optimized for the embodiment-specific closed-loop control, typically suffering from high latency and insufficient grounding. In this paper, we present Vidarc (Video Diffusion for Action Reasoning and Closed-loop Control), a novel autoregressive embodied video diffusion approach augmented by a masked inverse dynamics model. By grounding video predictions with action-relevant masks and incorporating real-time feedback through cached autoregressive generation, Vidarc achieves fast, accurate closed-loop control. Pre-trained on one million cross-embodiment episodes, Vidarc surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving at least a 15% higher success rate in real-world deployment and a 91% reduction in latency. We also highlight its robust generalization and error correction capabilities across previously unseen robotic platforms.

### xGR: Efficient Generative Recommendation Serving at Scale
**Authors**: Qingxiao Sun, Tongxuan Liu, Shen Zhang, Siyu Wu, Peijun Yang, Haotian Liang, Menxin Li, Xiaolong Ma, Zhiwei Liang, Ziyi Ren, Minchao Zhang, Xinyu Liu, Ke Zhang, Depei Qian, Hailong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-19T11:20:16Z

**Summary**: Recommendation system delivers substantial economic benefits by providing personalized predictions. Generative recommendation (GR) integrates LLMs to enhance the understanding of long user-item sequences. Despite employing attention-based architectures, GR's workload differs markedly from that of LLM serving. GR typically processes long prompt while producing short, fixed-length outputs, yet the computational cost of each decode phase is especially high due to the large beam width. In addition, since the beam search involves a vast item space, the sorting overhead becomes particularly time-consuming. We propose xGR, a GR-oriented serving system that meets strict low-latency requirements under highconcurrency scenarios. First, xGR unifies the processing of prefill and decode phases through staged computation and separated KV cache. Second, xGR enables early sorting termination and mask-based item filtering with data structure reuse. Third, xGR reconstructs the overall pipeline to exploit multilevel overlap and multi-stream parallelism. Our experiments with real-world recommendation service datasets demonstrate that xGR achieves at least 3.49x throughput compared to the state-of-the-art baseline under strict latency constraints.

### ProCache: Constraint-Aware Feature Caching with Selective Computation for Diffusion Transformer Acceleration
**Authors**: Fanpu Cao, Yaofo Chen, Zeng You, Wei Luo, Cen Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-19T07:27:19Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling, yet their high computational cost hinders real-time deployment. While feature caching offers a promising training-free acceleration solution by exploiting temporal redundancy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) uniform caching intervals fail to align with the non-uniform temporal dynamics of DiT, and (2) naive feature reuse with excessively large caching intervals can lead to severe error accumulation. In this work, we analyze the evolution of DiT features during denoising and reveal that both feature changes and error propagation are highly time- and depth-varying. Motivated by this, we propose ProCache, a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that addresses these issues via two core components: (i) a constraint-aware caching pattern search module that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling, tailored to the model's temporal characteristics; and (ii) a selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on PixArt-alpha and DiT demonstrate that ProCache achieves up to 1.96x and 2.90x acceleration with negligible quality degradation, significantly outperforming prior caching-based methods.

### CodeGEMM: A Codebook-Centric Approach to Efficient GEMM in Quantized LLMs
**Authors**: Gunho Park, Jeongin Bae, Byeongwook Kim, Baeseong park, Jiwon Ryu, Hoseung Kim, Se Jung Kwon, Dongsoo Lee

**Updated**: 2025-12-19T06:16:32Z

**Summary**: Weight-only quantization is widely used to mitigate the memory-bound nature of LLM inference. Codebook-based methods extend this trend by achieving strong accuracy in the extremely low-bit regime (e.g., 2-bit). However, current kernels rely on dequantization, which repeatedly fetches centroids and reconstructs weights, incurring substantial latency and cache pressure. We present CodeGEMM, a codebook-centric GEMM kernel that replaces dequantization with precomputed inner products between centroids and activations stored in a lightweight Psumbook. At inference, code indices directly gather these partial sums, eliminating per-element lookups and reducing the on-chip footprint. The kernel supports the systematic exploration of latency-memory-accuracy trade-offs under a unified implementation. On Llama-3 models, CodeGEMM delivers 1.83x (8B) and 8.93x (70B) speedups in the 2-bit configuration compared to state-of-the-art codebook-based quantization at comparable accuracy and further improves computing efficiency and memory subsystem utilization.

**Updated**: 2025-12-19T02:09:53Z

**Summary**: Efficient container image distribution is crucial for enabling machine learning inference at the network edge, where resource limitations and dynamic network conditions create significant challenges. In this paper, we present PeerSync, a decentralized P2P-based system designed to optimize image distribution in edge environments. PeerSync employs a popularity- and network-aware download engine that dynamically adapts to content popularity and real-time network conditions. PeerSync further integrates automated tracker election for rapid peer discovery and dynamic cache management for efficient storage utilization. We implement PeerSync with 8000+ lines of Rust code and test its performance extensively on both large-scale Docker-based emulations and physical edge devices. Experimental results show that PeerSync delivers a remarkable speed increase of 2.72$\times$, 1.79$\times$, and 1.28$\times$ compared to the Baseline solution, Dragonfly, and Kraken, respectively, while significantly reducing cross-network traffic by 90.72% under congested and varying network conditions.

### LLMCache: Layer-Wise Caching Strategies for Accelerated Reuse in Transformer Inference
**Authors**: Harsh Vardhan Bansal

**Updated**: 2025-12-18T18:18:57Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based language models have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet their high inference latency poses a significant challenge for real-timeand large-scale deployment. While existing caching mechanisms,such as token-level key-value caches, offer speedups in autore-gressive decoding, they are limited in scope and applicability. In this paper, we present LLMCache, a novel layer-wise caching framework that accelerates transformer inference by reusing intermediate activations based on semantic similarity of input sequences. Unlike prior work, LLMCache is model-agnostic,operates across both encoder and decoder architectures, and supports caching at arbitrary transformer layers. We introduce a lightweight fingerprinting mechanism for matching seman-tically similar inputs and propose adaptive eviction strategies to manage cache staleness. Experiments on BERT and GPT-2 across SQuAD, WikiText-103, and OpenBookQA show up to 3.1 X speedup in inference time with <0.5% accuracy degradation. Our results highlight LLMCache as a practical and general-purpose solution for optimizing transformer inference in real-world applications

### MEPIC: Memory Efficient Position Independent Caching for LLM Serving
**Authors**: Qian Wang, Zahra Yousefijamarani, Morgan Lindsay Heisler, Rongzhi Gu, Bai Xiaolong, Shan Yizhou, Wei Zhang, Wang Lan, Ying Xiong, Yong Zhang, Zhenan Fan

**Updated**: 2025-12-18T18:04:01Z

**Summary**: Modern LLM applications such as deep-research assistants, coding agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, repeatedly process long prompt histories containing shared document or code chunks, creating significant pressure on the Key Value (KV) cache, which must operate within limited memory while sustaining high throughput and low latency. Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.   We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes.

### Prefix Probing: Lightweight Harmful Content Detection for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jirui Yang, Hengqi Guo, Zhihui Lu, Yi Zhao, Yuansen Zhang, Shijing Hu, Qiang Duan, Yinggui Wang, Tao Wei

**Updated**: 2025-12-18T15:22:14Z

**Summary**: Large language models often face a three-way trade-off among detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost when used in real-world safety-sensitive applications. This paper introduces Prefix Probing, a black-box harmful content detection method that compares the conditional log-probabilities of "agreement/execution" versus "refusal/safety" opening prefixes and leverages prefix caching to reduce detection overhead to near first-token latency. During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prefix Probing achieves detection effectiveness comparable to mainstream external safety models while incurring only minimal computational cost and requiring no extra model deployment, highlighting its strong practicality and efficiency.

### Trainable Log-linear Sparse Attention for Efficient Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Yifan Zhou, Zeqi Xiao, Tianyi Wei, Shuai Yang, Xingang Pan

**Updated**: 2025-12-18T14:53:12Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) set the state of the art in visual generation, yet their quadratic self-attention cost fundamentally limits scaling to long token sequences. Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality. The results demonstrate that LLSA offers a promising direction for training long-sequence DiTs efficiently. Code is available at: https://github.com/SingleZombie/LLSA

**Authors**: Yubo Huang, Hailong Guo, Fangtai Wu, Shifeng Zhang, Shijie Huang, Qijun Gan, Lin Liu, Sirui Zhao, Enhong Chen, Jiaming Liu, Steven Hoi

**Updated**: 2025-12-18T13:02:34Z

**Summary**: Existing diffusion-based video generation methods are fundamentally constrained by sequential computation and long-horizon inconsistency, limiting their practical adoption in real-time, streaming audio-driven avatar synthesis. We present Live Avatar, an algorithm-system co-designed framework that enables efficient, high-fidelity, and infinite-length avatar generation using a 14-billion-parameter diffusion model. Our approach introduces Timestep-forcing Pipeline Parallelism (TPP), a distributed inference paradigm that pipelines denoising steps across multiple GPUs, effectively breaking the autoregressive bottleneck and ensuring stable, low-latency real-time streaming. To further enhance temporal consistency and mitigate identity drift and color artifacts, we propose the Rolling Sink Frame Mechanism (RSFM), which maintains sequence fidelity by dynamically recalibrating appearance using a cached reference image. Additionally, we leverage Self-Forcing Distribution Matching Distillation to facilitate causal, streamable adaptation of large-scale models without sacrificing visual quality. Live Avatar demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, reaching 20 FPS end-to-end generation on 5 H800 GPUs, and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve practical, real-time, high-fidelity avatar generation at this scale. Our work establishes a new paradigm for deploying advanced diffusion models in industrial long-form video synthesis applications.

### Efficient CPU-GPU Collaborative Inference for MoE-based LLMs on Memory-Limited Systems
**Authors**: En-Ming Huang, Li-Shang Lin, Chun-Yi Lee

**Updated**: 2025-12-18T12:45:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across various tasks, yet their high computational demands pose deployment challenges, especially on consumer-grade hardware. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models provide an efficient solution through selective activation of parameter subsets, which reduces computation requirements. Despite this efficiency, state-of-the-art MoE models still require substantial memory beyond typical consumer GPU capacities. Traditional offloading methods that transfer model weights between CPU and GPU introduce latency, limiting inference performance. This paper presents a novel CPU-GPU collaborative inference framework that incorporates an expert caching mechanism on the GPU to reduce data transfer requirements and enable faster inference through cache hits. Computations are offloaded to CPU for efficient cache miss handling, which benefits from CPU multithreading optimizations. The evaluations of our framework demonstrate performance improvements and highlight the potential of CPU-GPU collaboration to maximize hardware utilization for single-request inference scenarios on consumer-grade systems. The implementation of our framework is available at https://github.com/elsa-lab/MoE-CPU-GPU-Collaborative-Inference.

### FlexKV: Flexible Index Offloading for Memory-Disaggregated Key-Value Store
**Authors**: Zhisheng Hu, Jiacheng Shen, Ming-Chang Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-18T04:03:01Z

**Summary**: Disaggregated memory (DM) is a promising data center architecture that decouples CPU and memory into independent resource pools to improve resource utilization. Building on DM, memory-disaggregated key-value (KV) stores are adopted to efficiently manage remote data. Unfortunately, existing approaches suffer from poor performance due to two critical issues: 1) the overdependence on one-sided atomic operations in index processing, and 2) the constrained efficiency in compute-side caches. To address these issues, we propose FlexKV, a memory-disaggregated KV store with index proxying. Our key idea is to dynamically offload the index to compute nodes, leveraging their powerful CPUs to accelerate index processing and maintain high-performance compute-side caches. Three challenges have to be addressed to enable efficient index proxying on DM, i.e., the load imbalance across compute nodes, the limited memory of compute nodes, and the expensive cache coherence overhead. FlexKV proposes: 1) a rank-aware hotness detection algorithm to continuously balance index load across compute nodes, 2) a two-level CN memory optimization scheme to efficiently utilize compute node memory, and 3) an RPC-aggregated cache management mechanism to reduce cache coherence overhead. The experimental results show that FlexKV improves throughput by up to 2.94$\times$ and reduces latency by up to 85.2%, compared with the state-of-the-art memory-disaggregated KV stores.

### VLCache: Computing 2% Vision Tokens and Reusing 98% for Vision-Language Inference
**Authors**: Shengling Qin, Hao Yu, Chenxin Wu, Zheng Li, Yizhong Cao, Zhengyang Zhuge, Yuxin Zhou, Wentao Yao, Yi Zhang, Zhengheng Wang, Shuai Bai, Jianwei Zhang, Junyang Lin

**Updated**: 2025-12-18T02:59:27Z

**Summary**: This paper presents VLCache, a cache reuse framework that exploits both Key-Value (KV) cache and encoder cache from prior multimodal inputs to eliminate costly recomputation when the same multimodal inputs recur. Unlike previous heuristic approaches, we formally identify the cumulative reuse error effect and demonstrate how to minimize the non-prefix cache reuse error effectively. We further analyze the varying importance of model layers and propose a dynamic, layer-aware recomputation strategy to balance accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that VLCache achieves an accuracy on par with full recomputation, while requiring only 2-5% of the tokens to compute, yielding 1.2x-16x TTFT speedups. We develop an experimental implementation of the proposed VLCache pipeline based on SGLang, enabling significantly faster inference in practical deployments.

### MultiPath Transfer Engine: Breaking GPU and Host-Memory Bandwidth Bottlenecks in LLM Services
**Authors**: Lingfeng Tang, Daoping Zhang, Junjie Chen, Peihao Huang, Feng Jin, Chengguang Xu, Yuxin Chen, Feiqiang Sun, Guo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-18T00:45:00Z

**Summary**: The limited bandwidth of PCIe has emerged as the critical bottleneck for large language model (LLM) performance, such as prefix cache fetching and model switching. Although intra-server multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory is theoretically possible, heterogeneous protocols such as PCIe and NVLink currently limit the bandwidth between host memory and GPUs to that of a single PICe link. This limitation resuals in underutilized intra-server bandwidth. To address this issue, we propose Multipath Memory Access (MMA), a scheme that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to enalbe efficient multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory. MMA supports seamless deployment via dynamic library injection, enabling LLM applications to benefit from MMA without requiring any code modification. In our testbed, MMA significantly improves the data transfer bandwidth between the GPU and memory, achieving a peak bandwidth of 245 GB/s-representing a 4.62x speedup compared to the natice single-path bandwidth. End-to-end evaluations demonstrate that MMA reduces the time-to-first-token (TTFT) for LLM serving by 1.14x to 2.38x and decreases model-switching latency in vLLM's sleep mode by 1.12x to 2.48x.

**Authors**: Myunghyun Rhee, Joonseop Sim, Taeyoung Ahn, Seungyong Lee, Daegun Yoon, Euiseok Kim, Kyoung Park, Youngpyo Joo, Hoshik Kim

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T21:40:17Z

**Summary**: The attention layer, a core component of Transformer-based LLMs, brings out inefficiencies in current GPU systems due to its low operational intensity and the substantial memory requirements of KV caches. We propose a High-bandwidth Processing Unit (HPU), a memoryintensive co-processor that enhances GPU resource utilization during large-batched LLM inference. By offloading memory-bound operations, the HPU allows the GPU to focus on compute-intensive tasks, increasing overall efficiency. Also, the HPU, as an add-on card, scales out to accommodate surging memory demands driven by large batch sizes and extended sequence lengths. In this paper, we show the HPU prototype implemented with PCIe-based FPGA cards mounted on a GPU system. Our novel GPU-HPU heterogeneous system demonstrates up to 4.1x performance gains and 4.6x energy efficiency improvements over a GPUonly system, providing scalability without increasing the number of GPUs.

### Dynamic Rebatching for Efficient Early-Exit Inference with DREX
**Authors**: Xuting Liu, Daniel Alexander, Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla, Behnaz Arzani, Vincent Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T18:55:45Z

**Summary**: Early-Exit (EE) is a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture that accelerates inference by allowing easier tokens to be generated using only a subset of the model's layers. However, traditional batching frameworks are ill-suited for EE LLMs, as not all requests in a batch may be ready to exit at the same time. Existing solutions either force a uniform decision on the batch, which overlooks EE opportunities, or degrade output quality by forcing premature exits. We propose Dynamic Rebatching, a solution where we dynamically reorganize the batch at each early-exit point. Requests that meet the exit criteria are immediately processed, while those that continue are held in a buffer, re-grouped into a new batch, and forwarded to deeper layers. We introduce DREX, an early-exit inference system that implements Dynamic Rebatching with two key optimizations: 1) a copy-free rebatching buffer that avoids physical data movement, and 2) an EE and SLA-aware scheduler that analytically predicts whether a given rebatching operation will be profitable. DREX also efficiently handles the missing KV cache from skipped layers using memory-efficient state-copying. Our evaluation shows that DREX improves throughput by 2-12% compared to baseline approaches while maintaining output quality. Crucially, DREX completely eliminates involuntary exits, providing a key guarantee for preserving the output quality intended by the EE model.

### Optimizing Agentic Language Model Inference via Speculative Tool Calls
**Authors**: Daniel Nichols, Prajwal Singhania, Charles Jekel, Abhinav Bhatele, Harshitha Menon

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T18:22:44Z

**Summary**: Language models (LMs) are becoming increasingly dependent on external tools. LM-based agentic frameworks frequently interact with their environment via such tools to search files, run code, call APIs, etc. Further, modern reasoning-based LMs use tools such as web search and Python code execution to enhance their reasoning capabilities. While tools greatly improve the capabilities of LMs, they also introduce performance bottlenecks during the inference process. In this paper, we introduce novel systems optimizations to address such performance bottlenecks by speculating tool calls and forcing sequences to remain resident in the inference engine to minimize overheads. Our optimizations lead to throughput improvements of several hundred tokens per second when hosting inference for LM agents. We provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithms to provide insights into speculation configurations that will yield the best performance. Further, we recommend a new "tool cache" API endpoint to enable LM providers to easily adopt these optimizations.

### Optimizing Bloom Filters for Modern GPU Architectures
**Authors**: Daniel Jünger, Kevin Kristensen, Yunsong Wang, Xiangyao Yu, Bertil Schmidt

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T17:01:55Z

**Summary**: Bloom filters are a fundamental data structure for approximate membership queries, with applications ranging from data analytics to databases and genomics. Several variants have been proposed to accommodate parallel architectures. GPUs, with massive thread-level parallelism and high-bandwidth memory, are a natural fit for accelerating these Bloom filter variants potentially to billions of operations per second. Although CPU-optimized implementations have been well studied, GPU designs remain underexplored. We close this gap by exploring the design space on GPUs along three dimensions: vectorization, thread cooperation, and compute latency.   Our evaluation shows that the combination of these optimization points strongly affects throughput, with the largest gains achieved when the filter fits within the GPU's cache domain. We examine how the hardware responds to different parameter configurations and relate these observations to measured performance trends. Crucially, our optimized design overcomes the conventional trade-off between speed and precision, delivering the throughput typically restricted to high-error variants while maintaining the superior accuracy of high-precision configurations. At iso error rate, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by $11.35\times$ ($15.4\times$) for bulk filter lookup (construction), respectively, achieving above $92\%$ of the practical speed-of-light across a wide range of configurations on a B200 GPU. We propose a modular CUDA/C++ implementation, which will be openly available soon.

### Radial electric field and density fluctuations measured by Doppler reflectometry during the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase in W7-X

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T16:34:07Z

**Summary**: Radial profiles of density fluctuations and radial electric field, $E_r$, have been measured using Doppler reflectometry during the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase achieved, under different heating power levels and magnetic configurations, along the 2018 W7-X experimental campaign. A pronounced $E_r$-well is measured with local values as high as -40 kV/m in the radial range $ρ\sim 0.7-0.8$ during the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase. The maximum $E_r$ intensity scales with both plasma density and Electron Cyclotron Heating (ECH) power level following a similar trend as the plasma energy content. A good agreement is found when the experimental $E_r$ profiles are compared to simulations carried out using the neoclassical codes DKES and KNOSOS. The density fluctuation level decreases from the plasma edge toward the plasma core and the drop is more pronounced in the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase than in reference gas fuelled plasmas. Besides, in the post-pellet phase, the density fluctuation level is lower in the high iota magnetic configuration than in the standard one. In order to discriminate whether this difference is related to the differences in the plasma profiles or in the stability properties of the two configurations, gyrokinetic simulations have been carried out using the codes \texttt{stella} and EUTERPE. The simulation results point to the plasma profile evolution after the pellet injection and the stabilization effect of the radial electric field profile as the dominant players in the stabilization of the plasma turbulence.

### CTkvr: KV Cache Retrieval for Long-Context LLMs via Centroid then Token Indexing
**Authors**: Kuan Lu, Shuhang Lin, Sai Wu, Yichen Yao, Junhan Yang, Huan Li, Wei Chu, Xu Yinghui, Yuan Qi, Gang Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T15:56:32Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in long-context scenarios such as multi-turn conversations. However, long contexts pose significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory overhead from Key-Value (KV) cache and increased latency due to excessive memory accesses. Recent methods for dynamic KV selection struggle with trade-offs: block-level indexing degrades accuracy by retrieving irrelevant KV entries, while token-level indexing incurs high latency from inefficient retrieval mechanisms. In this paper, we propose CTKVR, a novel centroid-then-token KV retrieval scheme that addresses these limitations. CTKVR leverages a key observation: query vectors adjacent in position exhibit high similarity after Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and share most of their top-k KV cache entries. Based on this insight, CTKVR employs a two-stage retrieval strategy: lightweight centroids are precomputed during prefilling for centroid-grained indexing, followed by token-level refinement for precise KV retrieval. This approach balances retrieval efficiency and accuracy. To further enhance performance, we implement an optimized system for indexing construction and search using CPU-GPU co-execution. Experimentally, CTKVR achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks with less than 1% accuracy degradation. Meanwhile, CTKVR delivers 3 times and 4 times throughput speedups on Llama-3-8B and Yi-9B at 96K context length across diverse GPU hardware.

### Chorus: Harmonizing Context and Sensing Signals for Data-Free Model Customization in IoT
**Authors**: Liyu Zhang, Yejia Liu, Kwun Ho Liu, Runxi Huang, Xiaomin Ouyang

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T08:56:21Z

**Summary**: In real-world IoT applications, sensor data is usually collected under diverse and dynamic contextual conditions where factors such as sensor placements or ambient environments can significantly affect data patterns and downstream performance. Traditional domain adaptation or generalization methods often ignore such context information or use simplistic integration strategies, making them ineffective in handling unseen context shifts after deployment. In this paper, we propose Chorus, a context-aware, data-free model customization approach that adapts models to unseen deployment conditions without requiring target-domain data. The key idea is to learn effective context representations that capture their influence on sensor data patterns and to adaptively integrate them based on the degree of context shift. Specifically, Chorus first performs unsupervised cross-modal reconstruction between unlabeled sensor data and language-based context embeddings, while regularizing the context embedding space to learn robust, generalizable context representations. Then, it trains a lightweight gated head on limited labeled samples to dynamically balance sensor and context contributions-favoring context when sensor evidence is ambiguous and vice versa. To further reduce inference latency, Chorus employs a context-caching mechanism that reuses cached context representations and updates only upon detected context shifts. Experiments on IMU, speech, and WiFi sensing tasks under diverse context shifts show that Chorus outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 11.3% in unseen contexts, while maintaining comparable latency on smartphone and edge devices.

### Artificial Hippocampus Networks for Efficient Long-Context Modeling
**Authors**: Yunhao Fang, Weihao Yu, Shu Zhong, Qinghao Ye, Xuehan Xiong, Lai Wei

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T07:08:49Z

**Summary**: Long-sequence modeling faces a fundamental trade-off between the efficiency of compressive fixed-size memory in RNN-like models and the fidelity of lossless growing memory in attention-based Transformers. Inspired by the Multi-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework of artificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of the Transformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module termed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses out-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To validate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like architectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and GatedDeltaNet to augment open-weight LLMs. We also propose an efficient self-distillation training method where the base model's all parameters are frozen and only the parameters from AHNs are optimized. For inference, our method sets a default large sliding window size of 32k for attention, and AHNs activate only when the sequence length exceeds the 32k window, addressing the quadratic-complexity issue of attention that emerges at that scale. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate that AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and achieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while substantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance, augmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5% and memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k sequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88.

### Context-Driven Performance Modeling for Causal Inference Operators on Neural Processing Units
**Authors**: Neelesh Gupta, Rakshith Jayanth, Dhruv Parikh, Viktor Prasanna

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T05:01:59Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of large language models has driven demand for long-context inference on resource-constrained edge platforms. However, deploying these models on Neural Processing Units (NPUs) presents significant challenges due to architectural mismatch: the quadratic complexity of standard attention conflicts with NPU memory and compute patterns. This paper presents a comprehensive performance analysis of causal inference operators on a modern NPU, benchmarking quadratic attention against sub-quadratic alternatives including structured state-space models and causal convolutions. Our analysis reveals a spectrum of critical bottlenecks: quadratic attention becomes severely memory-bound with catastrophic cache inefficiency, while sub-quadratic variants span from compute-bound on programmable vector cores to memory-bound by data movement. These findings provide essential insights for co-designing hardware-aware models and optimization strategies to enable efficient long-context inference on edge platforms.

### Uncovering hidden protein conformations with high bandwidth nanopore measurements
**Authors**: Kyril Kavetsky, Sabine Hong, Chih-Yuan Lin, Roger Yang, Marija Drndic

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T02:14:04Z

**Summary**: Advanced nanopore measurements allow structural probing of molecules with high spatial and temporal resolution. We report high signal-to-noise, 1-10 MHz bandwidth, translocation measurements of the multi-state folding of heme protein cytochrome c in KCl solution through optimally designed silicon nitride pores of 2.3-3.3 nm diameter and 3.6-3.8 nm effective thickness, and an optimal concentration of a denaturant (Gdm-Cl). The pore diameter is slightly smaller than the protein size, forcing the protein to squeeze through the pore. The sufficiently large pore thickness allows enough time for protein probing at an applied field of approximately 250 kV/cm. Through Bayesian Information Criterion score analysis, current blockades reveal six distinct levels, attributed to specific protein states. We calculate the transition probabilities between the states and the conditional probabilities of the protein leaving the pore from each state. We validate the model by simulating events and comparing them to experimental data.

**Updated**: 2025-12-17T00:04:30Z

**Summary**: The cryogenic approach to the search for the neutron electric dipole moment--performing the experiment in superfluid liquid helium--holds promise for a substantial increase in sensitivity, potentially enabling a sensitivity level of $10^{-28}$ e-cm. A crucial component in realizing such an experiment is the high voltage and electrode system capable of providing an electric field of 75 kV/cm. This, in turn, requires an electric potential of 635 kV to be applied to the high voltage electrode, while simultaneously satisfying other experimental constraints, such as those on heat load and magnetic noise requirements. This paper describes the outcome of a comprehensive development program addressing these challenges. It outlines the system requirements, discusses new insights into relevant physical phenomena, and details selected technical solutions with their corresponding experimental demonstrations and expected performance. The results collectively demonstrate the successful development of the necessary technology for the high-voltage and electrode system for this approach.

### SemShareKV: Efficient KVCache Sharing for Semantically Similar Prompts via Token-Level LSH Matching
**Authors**: Xinye Zhao, Spyridon Mastorakis

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T22:36:44Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, the memory footprint of key-value (KV) caches during inference has become a significant bottleneck. Existing approaches primarily focus on compressing KV caches within a single prompt or reusing shared prefixes or frequently ocurred text segments across prompts. However, such strategies are limited in scenarios where prompts are semantically similar but lexically different, which frequently occurs in tasks such as multi-document summarization and conversational agents. We propose \textit{SemShareKV}, a KV cache sharing and compression framework that accelerates LLM inference by reusing KVCache in semantically similar prompts. Instead of relying on exact token matches, SemShareKV applies fuzzy token matching using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to better preserve positional information. By selectively reusing relevant key-value pairs from a reference prompt's cache, SemShareKV reduces redundant computation while maintaining output quality. Experiments on diverse summarization datasets show up to 6.25$\times$ speedup and 42\% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input, with negligible quality degradation. These results highlight the potential of semantic-aware cache sharing for efficient LLM inference.

**Summary**: Reusing KV cache is essential for high efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) inference systems. With more LLM users, the KV cache footprint can easily exceed GPU memory capacity, so prior work has proposed to either evict KV cache to lower-tier storage devices, or compress KV cache so that more KV cache can be fit in the fast memory. However, prior work misses an important opportunity: jointly optimizing the eviction and compression decisions across all KV caches to minimize average generation latency without hurting quality.   We propose EVICPRESS, a KV-cache management system that applies lossy compression and adaptive eviction to KV cache across multiple storage tiers. Specifically, for each KV cache of a context, EVICPRESS considers the effect of compression and eviction of the KV cache on the average generation quality and delay across all contexts as a whole. To achieve this, EVICPRESS proposes a unified utility function that quantifies the effect of quality and delay of the lossy compression or eviction. To this end, EVICPRESS's profiling module periodically updates the utility function scores on all possible eviction-compression configurations for all contexts and places KV caches using a fast heuristic to rearrange KV caches on all storage tiers, with the goal of maximizing the utility function scores on each storage tier. Compared to the baselines that evict KV cache or compress KV cache, EVICPRESS achieves higher KV-cache hit rates on fast devices, i.e., lower delay, while preserving high generation quality by applying conservative compression to contexts that are sensitive to compression errors. Evaluation on 12 datasets and 5 models demonstrates that EVICPRESS achieves up to 2.19x faster time-to-first-token (TTFT) at equivalent generation quality.

**Summary**: Current experiments seeking first-ever observation of Ultra-High Energy Neutrinos (UHEN) typically utilize radio frequency (RF) receiver antennas deployed in cold, radio-transparent polar ice, to measure the coherent RF signals resulting from neutrino interactions with ice molecules. Accurate calibration of the receiver response, sampling the full range of possible neutrino geometries, is necessary to estimate the energy and incoming direction of the incident neutrino. Herein, we detail the design and performance of a custom radio-frequency calibration transmitter, consisting of a battery-powered, kiloVolt-scale signal generator (`IDL' pulser) driving an antenna (South Pole UNiversity of Kansas antenna, or `SPUNK') capable of operating at pressures of 200 atmospheres. Performance was validated by lowering the transmitter into a borehole at the South Pole to a depth of 1740 m, yielding high Signal-to-Noise ratio signals at a distance of 5 km from the source.

### MemFlow: Flowing Adaptive Memory for Consistent and Efficient Long Video Narratives
**Authors**: Sihui Ji, Xi Chen, Shuai Yang, Xin Tao, Pengfei Wan, Hengshuang Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:59:59Z

**Summary**: The core challenge for streaming video generation is maintaining the content consistency in long context, which poses high requirement for the memory design. Most existing solutions maintain the memory by compressing historical frames with predefined strategies. However, different to-generate video chunks should refer to different historical cues, which is hard to satisfy with fixed strategies. In this work, we propose MemFlow to address this problem. Specifically, before generating the coming chunk, we dynamically update the memory bank by retrieving the most relevant historical frames with the text prompt of this chunk. This design enables narrative coherence even if new event happens or scenario switches in future frames. In addition, during generation, we only activate the most relevant tokens in the memory bank for each query in the attention layers, which effectively guarantees the generation efficiency. In this way, MemFlow achieves outstanding long-context consistency with negligible computation burden (7.9% speed reduction compared with the memory-free baseline) and keeps the compatibility with any streaming video generation model with KV cache.

### Fast and Accurate Causal Parallel Decoding using Jacobi Forcing
**Authors**: Lanxiang Hu, Siqi Kou, Yichao Fu, Samyam Rajbhandari, Tajana Rosing, Yuxiong He, Zhijie Deng, Hao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:45:18Z

**Summary**: Multi-token generation has emerged as a promising paradigm for accelerating transformer-based large model inference. Recent efforts primarily explore diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) for parallel decoding to reduce inference latency. To achieve AR-level generation quality, many techniques adapt AR models into dLLMs to enable parallel decoding. However, they suffer from limited speedup compared to AR models due to a pretrain-to-posttrain mismatch. Specifically, the masked data distribution in post-training deviates significantly from the real-world data distribution seen during pretraining, and dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which conflicts with the causal prior learned during pretraining and hinders the integration of exact KV cache reuse. To address this, we introduce Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation paradigm where models are trained on their own generated parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly shifting AR models into efficient parallel decoders while preserving their pretrained causal inference property. The models trained under this paradigm, Jacobi Forcing Model, achieves 3.8x wall-clock speedup on coding and math benchmarks with minimal loss in performance. Based on Jacobi Forcing Models' trajectory characteristics, we introduce multi-block decoding with rejection recycling, which enables up to 4.5x higher token acceptance count per iteration and nearly 4.0x wall-clock speedup, effectively trading additional compute for lower inference latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/JacobiForcing.

### Tensor Product Attention Is All You Need
**Authors**: Yifan Zhang, Yifeng Liu, Huizhuo Yuan, Zhen Qin, Yang Yuan, Quanquan Gu, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:24:22Z

**Summary**: Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, substantially shrinking the KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components and seamlessly integrating with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation on language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 surpasses or matches the performance of standard Transformer baselines including Multi-Head Attention (MHA), Multi-Query Attention (MQA), Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of established evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency and computational efficiency at decoding stage enables processing longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

### Hybrid Cognitive IoT with Cooperative Caching and SWIPT-EH: A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework
**Authors**: Nadia Abdolkhani, Walaa Hamouda

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:18:50Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm for hybrid underlay-overlay cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-energy harvesting (EH) and cooperative caching. Unlike prior hierarchical DRL approaches that focus primarily on spectrum access or power control, our work jointly optimizes EH, hybrid access coordination, power allocation, and caching in a unified framework. The joint optimization problem is formulated as a weighted-sum multi-objective task, designed to maximize throughput and cache hit ratio while simultaneously minimizing transmission delay. In the proposed model, CIoT agents jointly optimize EH and data transmission using a learnable time switching (TS) factor. They also coordinate spectrum access under hybrid overlay-underlay paradigms and make power control and cache placement decisions while considering energy, interference, and storage constraints. Specifically, in this work, cooperative caching is used to enable overlay access, while power control is used for underlay access. A novel three-level hierarchical SAC (H-SAC) agent decomposes the mixed discrete-continuous action space into modular subproblems, improving scalability and convergence over flat DRL methods. The high-level policy adjusts the TS factor, the mid-level policy manages spectrum access coordination and cache sharing, and the low-level policy decides transmit power and caching actions for both the CIoT agent and PU content. Simulation results show that the proposed hierarchical SAC approach significantly outperforms benchmark and greedy strategies. It achieves better performance in terms of average sum rate, delay, cache hit ratio, and energy efficiency, even under channel fading and uncertain conditions.

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:04:14Z

**Summary**: We introduce the Kimina Lean Server, an open-source project designed as a high-performance verifier for reinforcement learning pipelines. Built on top of the Lean REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) maintained by the Lean FRO, our server combines server-side parallelism by managing multiple Lean processes in parallel with a Least Recently Used (LRU) caching mechanism that reuses Lean imports across requests. On the client side, a lightweight Python package enables submitting proof batches and receiving Lean feedback, including extracted tactics and tactic states.   Together, these features enable a scalable workflow for large-scale verification and data extraction. In our experiments, the Kimina Lean Server outperforms previous Lean interaction tools, achieving a 1.5 to 2 times speedup in verification time. Moreover, its improved efficiency has enabled its use in the large-scale training of state-of-the-art models such as Kimina-Prover.   We hope that our open-source project will support the neural theorem proving community and accelerate future progress by enabling efficient large-scale verification and proof data extraction.

### Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS): Learning to Route Between MHA, GQA, and MQA
**Authors**: Esmail Gumaan

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T09:57:18Z

**Summary**: The choice of attention mechanism in Transformer models involves a critical trade-off between modeling quality and inference efficiency. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers the best quality but suffers from large Key-Value (KV) cache memory requirements during inference. Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) reduce memory usage but often at the cost of model performance. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), a novel architecture that dynamically selects the optimal attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) for each token via a learned router. We demonstrate that dynamic routing performs better than static averaging of schemes and achieves performance competitive with the MHA baseline while offering potential for conditional compute efficiency. Experimental results on WikiText-2 show that dynamic routing (val loss 2.3074) outperforms a static mixture (2.3093), validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Esmail-ibraheem/Mixture-of-Attention-Schemes-MoAS.

### Adaptive Cache Pollution Control for Large Language Model Inference Workloads Using Temporal CNN-Based Prediction and Priority-Aware Replacement
**Authors**: Songze Liu, Hongkun Du, Shaowen Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T07:16:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT and LLaMA, introduce unique memory access characteristics during inference due to frequent token sequence lookups and embedding vector retrievals. These workloads generate highly irregular and bursty access patterns, causing traditional prefetching and replacement policies to mispredict and trigger severe cache pollution, thereby degrading system performance. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Adaptive Cache Pollution Control (ACPC) mechanism tailored for LLM inference workloads, integrating Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)-based access prediction with a priority-aware replacement strategy. The TCN module learns temporal dependencies in token access sequences to identify potential high-reuse cache lines, while the replacement policy dynamically adjusts eviction priorities based on predicted reuse likelihood and cache occupancy. The proposed framework is implemented and evaluated on representative transformer-based inference traces, including GPT-style autoregressive decoding and embedding retrieval workloads. Experimental results demonstrate that ACPC reduces cache pollution by 41.7 percent, improves cache hit rate by 8.9 percent, and achieves a 60.0 percent reduction in L2 miss penalty, compared with state-of-the-art machine-learning-based replacement baselines. Additionally, the proposed Temporal CNN-based ACPC framework increases token generation throughput by 15.9 percent and achieves the lowest final loss of 0.21, confirming its superior efficiency and stability under complex LLM inference workloads. These results highlight ACPC's effectiveness in recognizing useful cache lines and mitigating redundant prefetches under dynamic LLM access behaviors. The proposed approach provides a scalable, learning-driven solution for optimizing memory efficiency and latency in large-scale LLM serving and inference systems.

### Astraea: A State-Aware Scheduling Engine for LLM-Powered Agents
**Authors**: Hongqiu Ni, Jiabao Zhang, Guopeng Li, Zilong Wang, Ruiqi Wu, Chi Zhang, Haisheng Tan

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T06:55:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as intelligent agents. Their multi-stage workflows, which alternate between local computation and calls to external network services like Web APIs, introduce a mismatch in their execution pattern and the scheduling granularity of existing inference systems such as vLLM. Existing systems typically focus on per-segment optimization which prevents them from minimizing the end-to-end latency of the complete agentic workflow, i.e., the global Job Completion Time (JCT) over the entire request lifecycle. To address this limitation, we propose Astraea, a service engine designed to shift the optimization from local segments to the global request lifecycle. Astraea employs a state-aware, hierarchical scheduling algorithm that integrates a request's historical state with future predictions. It dynamically classifies requests by their I/O and compute intensive nature and uses an enhanced HRRN policy to balance efficiency and fairness. Astraea also implements an adaptive KV cache manager that intelligently handles the agent state during I/O waits based on the system memory pressure. Extensive experiments show that Astraea reduces average JCT by up to 25.5\% compared to baseline methods. Moreover, our approach demonstrates strong robustness and stability under high load across various model scales.

### PAT: Accelerating LLM Decoding via Prefix-Aware Attention with Resource Efficient Multi-Tile Kernel
**Authors**: Jinjun Yi, Zhixin Zhao, Yitao Hu, Ke Yan, Weiwei Sun, Hao Wang, Laiping Zhao, Yuhao Zhang, Wenxin Li, Keqiu Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T05:44:34Z

**Summary**: LLM serving is increasingly dominated by decode attention, which is a memory-bound operation due to massive KV cache loading from global memory. Meanwhile, real-world workloads exhibit substantial, hierarchical shared prefixes across requests (e.g., system prompts, tools/templates, RAG). Existing attention implementations fail to fully exploit prefix sharing: one-query-per-CTA execution repeatedly loads shared prefix KV cache, while one-size-fits-all tiling leaves on-chip resources idle and exacerbates bubbles for uneven KV lengths. These choices amplify memory bandwidth pressure and stall memory-bound decode attention.   This paper introduces PAT, a prefix-aware attention kernel implementation for LLM decoding that organizes execution with a pack-forward-merge paradigm. PAT packs queries by shared prefix to reduce repeated memory accesses, runs a customized multi-tile kernel to achieve high resource efficiency. It further applies practical multi-stream forwarding and KV splitting to reduce resource bubbles. The final merge performs online softmax with negligible overhead. We implement PAT as an off-the-shelf plugin for vLLM. Evaluation on both real-world and synthetic workloads shows that PAT reduces attention latency by 53.5% on average and TPOT by 17.0-93.1% under the same configurations against state-of-the-art attention kernels. PAT's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/flashserve/PAT.

### OUSAC: Optimized Guidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching for DiT Acceleration
**Authors**: Ruitong Sun, Tianze Yang, Wei Niu, Jin Sun

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T05:11:54Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for high-quality image generation, yet their computational expense remains substantial due to iterative denoising. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances generation quality and controllability but doubles the computation by requiring both conditional and unconditional forward passes at every timestep. We present OUSAC (Optimized gUidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching), a framework that accelerates diffusion transformers (DiT) through systematic optimization. Our key insight is that variable guidance scales enable sparse computation: adjusting scales at certain timesteps can compensate for skipping CFG at others, enabling both fewer total sampling steps and fewer CFG steps while maintaining quality. However, variable guidance patterns introduce denoising deviations that undermine standard caching methods, which assume constant CFG scales across steps. Moreover, different transformer blocks are affected at different levels under dynamic conditions. This paper develops a two-stage approach leveraging these insights. Stage-1 employs evolutionary algorithms to jointly optimize which timesteps to skip and what guidance scale to use, eliminating up to 82% of unconditional passes. Stage-2 introduces adaptive rank allocation that tailors calibration efforts per transformer block, maintaining caching effectiveness under variable guidance. Experiments demonstrate that OUSAC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art acceleration methods, achieving 53% computational savings with 15% quality improvement on DiT-XL/2 (ImageNet 512x512), 60% savings with 16.1% improvement on PixArt-alpha (MSCOCO), and 5x speedup on FLUX while improving CLIP Score over the 50-step baseline.

### FreeKV: Boosting KV Cache Retrieval for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Guangda Liu, Chengwei Li, Zhenyu Ning, Jing Lin, Yiwu Yao, Danning Ke, Minyi Guo, Jieru Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T04:58:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.

### SonicMoE: Accelerating MoE with IO and Tile-aware Optimizations
**Authors**: Wentao Guo, Mayank Mishra, Xinle Cheng, Ion Stoica, Tri Dao

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T04:39:10Z

**Summary**: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as the de facto architecture for scaling up language models without significantly increasing the computational cost. Recent MoE models demonstrate a clear trend towards high expert granularity (smaller expert intermediate dimension) and higher sparsity (constant number of activated experts with higher number of total experts), which improve model quality per FLOP. However, fine-grained MoEs suffer from increased activation memory footprint and reduced hardware efficiency due to higher IO costs, while sparser MoEs suffer from wasted computations due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. In response, we propose a memory-efficient algorithm to compute the forward and backward passes of MoEs with minimal activation caching for the backward pass. We also design GPU kernels that overlap memory IO with computation benefiting all MoE architectures. Finally, we propose a novel "token rounding" method that minimizes the wasted compute due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. As a result, our method SonicMoE reduces activation memory by 45% and achieves a 1.86x compute throughput improvement on Hopper GPUs compared to ScatterMoE's BF16 MoE kernel for a fine-grained 7B MoE. Concretely, SonicMoE on 64 H100s achieves a training throughput of 213 billion tokens per day comparable to ScatterMoE's 225 billion tokens per day on 96 H100s for a 7B MoE model training with FSDP-2 using the lm-engine codebase. Under high MoE sparsity settings, our tile-aware token rounding algorithm yields an additional 1.16x speedup on kernel execution time compared to vanilla top-$K$ routing while maintaining similar downstream performance. We open-source all our kernels to enable faster MoE model training.

### Efficient-DLM: From Autoregressive to Diffusion Language Models, and Beyond in Speed
**Authors**: Yonggan Fu, Lexington Whalen, Zhifan Ye, Xin Dong, Shizhe Diao, Jingyu Liu, Chengyue Wu, Hao Zhang, Enze Xie, Song Han, Maksim Khadkevich, Jan Kautz, Yingyan Celine Lin, Pavlo Molchanov

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T04:12:17Z

**Summary**: Diffusion language models (dLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm that enables parallel, non-autoregressive generation, but their learning efficiency lags behind that of autoregressive (AR) language models when trained from scratch. To this end, we study AR-to-dLM conversion to transform pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs that excel in speed while preserving AR models' task accuracy. We achieve this by identifying limitations in the attention patterns and objectives of existing AR-to-dLM methods and then proposing principles and methodologies for more effective AR-to-dLM conversion. Specifically, we first systematically compare different attention patterns and find that maintaining pretrained AR weight distributions is critical for effective AR-to-dLM conversion. As such, we introduce a continuous pretraining scheme with a block-wise attention pattern, which remains causal across blocks while enabling bidirectional modeling within each block. We find that this approach can better preserve pretrained AR models' weight distributions than fully bidirectional modeling, in addition to its known benefit of enabling KV caching, and leads to a win-win in accuracy and efficiency. Second, to mitigate the training-test gap in mask token distributions (uniform vs. highly left-to-right), we propose a position-dependent token masking strategy that assigns higher masking probabilities to later tokens during training to better mimic test-time behavior. Leveraging this framework, we conduct extensive studies of dLMs' attention patterns, training dynamics, and other design choices, providing actionable insights into scalable AR-to-dLM conversion. These studies lead to the Efficient-DLM family, which outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and dLMs, e.g., our Efficient-DLM 8B achieves +5.4%/+2.7% higher accuracy with 4.5x/2.7x higher throughput compared to Dream 7B and Qwen3 4B, respectively.

### Cooperative Caching Towards Efficient Spectrum Utilization in Cognitive-IoT Networks
**Authors**: Nadia Abdolkhani, Walaa Hamouda

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T02:49:43Z

**Summary**: In cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks, efficient spectrum sharing is essential to address increasing wireless demands. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for joint cooperative caching and spectrum access coordination in CIoT networks, enabling the CIoT agents to collaborate with primary users (PUs) by caching PU content and serving their requests, fostering mutual benefits. The proposed DRL framework jointly optimizes caching policy and spectrum access under challenging conditions. Unlike traditional cognitive radio (CR) methods, where CIoT agents vacate the spectrum for PUs, or relaying techniques, which merely support spectrum sharing, caching brings data closer to the edge, reducing latency by minimizing retrieval distance. Simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms others in lowering latency, increasing CIoT and PU cache hit rates, and enhancing network throughput. This approach redefines spectrum sharing, offering a fresh perspective on CIoT network design and illustrating the potential of DRL-guided caching to highlight the benefits of collaboration over dynamic spectrum access scenarios, elevating CIoT performance under constrained resources.

### Hyper-Minrank: A Unified Hypergraph Characterization of Multi-Sender Index Coding
**Authors**: Ali Khalesi, Petros Elia

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T18:08:09Z

**Summary**: This work introduces a hypergraph formulation that generalizes the classical paradigm of Bar-Yossef et al. to the multi-sender index coding (MSIC) setting. Central to the model is a 4-regular side-information hypergraph G, a new adjacency representation A_G = [A_1 ... A_N], and a simple fitting criterion for sub-hypergraph validity, in the presence of specially designed hyperedges that capture both side information and cross-sender signal cancellation. This formulation establishes a tight achievability-converse equivalence for the general N-sender, K-receiver problem: every valid fitting induces a valid linear multi-sender index code, every linear code induces a valid fitting, and the optimal scalar linear broadcast length equals the hyper-minrank l**lin(G) = hyperminrank(G) = min*{A fits G} sum_{n=1}^N rank(A_n). Beyond this exact characterization, the approach yields hypergraph analogues of Haemers-type bounds on the broadcast length, including a clique-cover upper bound and a lower bound via the clique number of a carefully defined complement hypergraph. Algorithmically, we provide an exact procedure to compute hyperminrank(G), and show that in certain regimes its complexity is asymptotically better than approximate LT-CMAR solutions. The framework captures well-known settings such as embedded index coding, and applies directly to multi-sender cache-aided communications, coded computation, distributed storage, and edge/satellite systems, where hyperminrank can serve as a unified design target.

### ReFusion: A Diffusion Large Language Model with Parallel Autoregressive Decoding
**Authors**: Jia-Nan Li, Jian Guan, Wei Wu, Chongxuan Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T17:41:19Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive models (ARMs) are hindered by slow sequential inference. While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\times$ average speedup.

### Uncovering the Role of Initial Saliency in U-Shaped Attention Bias: Scaling Initial Token Weight for Enhanced Long-Text Processing
**Authors**: Zewen Qiang, Sendong Zhao, Haochun Wang, Bing Qin, Ting Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T09:04:06Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, they often struggle with long-text sequences due to the ``lost in the middle'' phenomenon. This issue has been shown to arise from a U-shaped attention bias, where attention is disproportionately focused on the beginning and end of a text, leaving the middle section underrepresented. While previous studies have attributed this bias to position encoding, our research first identifies an additional factor: initial saliency. It means that in the attention computation for each token, tokens with higher attention weights relative to the initial token tend to receive more attention in the prediction of the next token. We further find that utilizing this property by scaling attention weight between the initial token and others improves the model's ability to process long contexts, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.6\% in MDQA dataset. Moreover, combining this approach with existing methods to reduce position encoding bias further enhances performance, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.4\% in KV-Retrieval tasks.

### CHIMERA: Adaptive Cache Injection and Semantic Anchor Prompting for Zero-shot Image Morphing with Morphing-oriented Metrics
**Authors**: Dahyeon Kye, Jeahun Sung, Mingyu Jeon, Jihyong Oh

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T08:33:55Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models exhibit remarkable generative ability, yet achieving smooth and semantically consistent image morphing remains a challenge. Existing approaches often yield abrupt transitions or over-saturated appearances due to the lack of adaptive structural and semantic alignments. We propose CHIMERA, a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that formulates morphing as a cached inversion-guided denoising process. To handle large semantic and appearance disparities, we propose Adaptive Cache Injection and Semantic Anchor Prompting. Adaptive Cache Injection (ACI) caches down, mid, and up blocks features from both inputs during DDIM inversion and re-injects them adaptively during denoising, enabling spatial and semantic alignment in depth- and time-adaptive manners and enabling natural feature fusion and smooth transitions. Semantic Anchor Prompting (SAP) leverages a vision-language model to generate a shared anchor prompt that serves as a semantic anchor, bridging dissimilar inputs and guiding the denoising process toward coherent results. Finally, we introduce the Global-Local Consistency Score (GLCS), a morphing-oriented metric that simultaneously evaluates the global harmonization of the two inputs and the smoothness of the local morphing transition. Extensive experiments and user studies show that CHIMERA achieves smoother and more semantically aligned transitions than existing methods, establishing a new state of the art in image morphing. The code and project page will be publicly released.

**Authors**: Cheeun Hong, German Barquero, Fadime Sener, Markos Georgopoulos, Edgar Schönfeld, Stefan Popov, Yuming Du, Oscar Mañas, Albert Pumarola

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T06:32:57Z

**Summary**: Instructional video generation is an emerging task that aims to synthesize coherent demonstrations of procedural activities from textual descriptions. Such capability has broad implications for content creation, education, and human-AI interaction, yet existing video diffusion models struggle to maintain temporal consistency and controllability across long sequences of multiple action steps. We introduce a pipeline for future-driven streaming instructional video generation, dubbed SneakPeek, a diffusion-based autoregressive framework designed to generate precise, stepwise instructional videos conditioned on an initial image and structured textual prompts. Our approach introduces three key innovations to enhance consistency and controllability: (1) predictive causal adaptation, where a causal model learns to perform next-frame prediction and anticipate future keyframes; (2) future-guided self-forcing with a dual-region KV caching scheme to address the exposure bias issue at inference time; (3) multi-prompt conditioning, which provides fine-grained and procedural control over multi-step instructions. Together, these components mitigate temporal drift, preserve motion consistency, and enable interactive video generation where future prompt updates dynamically influence ongoing streaming video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces temporally coherent and semantically faithful instructional videos that accurately follow complex, multi-step task descriptions.

### SliceMoE: Bit-Sliced Expert Caching under Miss-Rate Constraints for Efficient MoE Inference
**Authors**: Yuseon Choi, Sangjin Kim, Jungjun Oh, Gwangtae Park, Byeongcheol Kim, Hoi-Jun Yoo

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T05:33:07Z

**Summary**: MoE models offer efficient scaling through conditional computation, but their large parameter size and expensive expert offloading make on-device deployment challenging. Existing acceleration techniques such as prefetching or expert clustering often increase energy usage or reduce expert diversity. We present SliceMoE, an energy-efficient MoE inference framework for miss-rate-constrained deployment. SliceMoE introduces Dynamic Bit-Sliced Caching (DBSC), which caches experts at slice-level granularity and assigns precision on demand to expand effective expert capacity. To support mixed-precision experts without memory duplication, we propose Calibration-Free Asymmetric Matryoshka Quantization (AMAT), a truncation-based scheme that maintains compatibility between low-bit and high-bit slices. We further introduce Predictive Cache Warmup (PCW) to reduce early-decode cold misses by reshaping cache contents during prefill. Evaluated on DeepSeek-V2-Lite and Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, SliceMoE reduces decode-stage energy consumption by up to 2.37x and 2.85x, respectively, and improves decode latency by up to 1.81x and 1.64x, while preserving near-high-bit accuracy. These results demonstrate that slice-level caching enables an efficient on-device MoE deployment.

### AutoRefiner: Improving Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models via Reflective Refinement Over the Stochastic Sampling Path
**Authors**: Zhengyang Yu, Akio Hayakawa, Masato Ishii, Qingtao Yu, Takashi Shibuya, Jing Zhang, Yuki Mitsufuji

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T05:13:40Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive video diffusion models (AR-VDMs) show strong promise as scalable alternatives to bidirectional VDMs, enabling real-time and interactive applications. Yet there remains room for improvement in their sample fidelity. A promising solution is inference-time alignment, which optimizes the noise space to improve sample fidelity without updating model parameters. Yet, optimization- or search-based methods are computationally impractical for AR-VDMs. Recent text-to-image (T2I) works address this via feedforward noise refiners that modulate sampled noises in a single forward pass. Can such noise refiners be extended to AR-VDMs? We identify the failure of naively extending T2I noise refiners to AR-VDMs and propose AutoRefiner-a noise refiner tailored for AR-VDMs, with two key designs: pathwise noise refinement and a reflective KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate that AutoRefiner serves as an efficient plug-in for AR-VDMs, effectively enhancing sample fidelity by refining noise along stochastic denoising paths.

### SCAdapter: Content-Style Disentanglement for Diffusion Style Transfer
**Authors**: Luan Thanh Trinh, Kenji Doi, Atsuki Osanai

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T04:02:14Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for style transfer, yet they struggle with photo-realistic transfers, often producing painting-like results or missing detailed stylistic elements. Current methods inadequately address unwanted influence from original content styles and style reference content features. We introduce SCAdapter, a novel technique leveraging CLIP image space to effectively separate and integrate content and style features. Our key innovation systematically extracts pure content from content images and style elements from style references, ensuring authentic transfers. This approach is enhanced through three components: Controllable Style Adaptive Instance Normalization (CSAdaIN) for precise multi-style blending, KVS Injection for targeted style integration, and a style transfer consistency objective maintaining process coherence. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate SCAdapter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both conventional and diffusion-based baselines. By eliminating DDIM inversion and inference-stage optimization, our method achieves at least $2\times$ faster inference than other diffusion-based approaches, making it both more effective and efficient for practical applications.

### RollMux: Phase-Level Multiplexing for Disaggregated RL Post-Training
**Authors**: Tianyuan Wu, Lunxi Cao, Yining Wei, Wei Gao, Yuheng Zhao, Dakai An, Shaopan Xiong, Zhiqiang Lv, Ju Huang, Siran Yang, Yinghao Yu, Jiamang Wang, Lin Qu, Wei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T02:21:28Z

**Summary**: Rollout-training disaggregation is emerging as the standard architecture for Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training, where memory-bound rollout and compute-bound training are physically disaggregated onto purpose-built clusters to maximize hardware efficiency. However, the strict synchronization required by on-policy algorithms introduces severe dependency bubbles, forcing one cluster to idle while the dependent phase is running on the other. We present RollMux, a cluster scheduling framework that reclaims these bubbles through cross-cluster orchestration. RollMux is built on the insight that the structural idleness of one job can be effectively utilized by the active phase of another. To realize this, we introduce the co-execution group abstraction, which partitions the cluster into isolated locality domains. This abstraction enables a two-tier scheduling architecture: an inter-group scheduler that optimizes job placement using conservative stochastic planning, and an intra-group scheduler that orchestrates a provably optimal round-robin schedule. The group abstraction also imposes a residency constraint, ensuring that massive model states remain cached in host memory to enable "warm-star" context switching. We evaluate RollMux on a production-scale testbed with 328 H20 and 328 H800 GPUs. RollMux improves cost efficiency by 1.84x over standard disaggregation and 1.38x over state-of-the-art co-located baselines, all while achieving 100% SLO attainment.

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T17:45:53Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative tasks (e.g., image and video generation), and the demand for high-quality content (e.g., 2K/4K videos) is rapidly increasing across various domains. However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and memory costs. To this end, we introduce SUPERGEN, an efficient tile-based framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SUPERGEN features a novel training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SUPERGEN incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps and spatial regions. SUPERGEN also integrates cache-guided, communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized latency. Evaluations show that SUPERGEN maximizes performance gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.

### Think, Speak, Decide: Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Economic Decision-Making
**Authors**: Heyang Ma, Qirui Mi, Qipeng Yang, Zijun Fan, Bo Li, Haifeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T15:38:21Z

**Summary**: Economic decision-making depends not only on structured signals such as prices and taxes, but also on unstructured language, including peer dialogue and media narratives. While multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise in optimizing economic decisions, it struggles with the semantic ambiguity and contextual richness of language. We propose LAMP (Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Policy), a framework that integrates language into economic decision-making and narrows the gap to real-world settings. LAMP follows a Think-Speak-Decide pipeline: (1) Think interprets numerical observations to extract short-term shocks and long-term trends, caching high-value reasoning trajectories; (2) Speak crafts and exchanges strategic messages based on reasoning, updating beliefs by parsing peer communications; and (3) Decide fuses numerical data, reasoning, and reflections into a MARL policy to optimize language-augmented decision-making. Experiments in economic simulation show that LAMP outperforms both MARL and LLM-only baselines in cumulative return (+63.5%, +34.0%), robustness (+18.8%, +59.4%), and interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of language-augmented policies to deliver more effective and robust economic strategies.

### Lethe: Layer- and Time-Adaptive KV Cache Pruning for Reasoning-Intensive LLM Serving
**Authors**: Hui Zeng, Daming Zhao, Pengfei Yang, WenXuan Hou, Tianyang Zheng, Hui Li, Weiye Ji, Jidong Zhai

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T14:18:27Z

**Summary**: Generative reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often involves long decoding sequences, leading to substantial memory and latency overheads from accumulating key-value (KV) caches. While existing KV compression methods primarily focus on reducing prefill memory from long input sequences, they fall short in addressing the dynamic and layer-sensitive nature of long-form generation, which is central to reasoning tasks. We propose Lethe, a dynamic KV cache management framework that introduces adaptivity along both the spatial and temporal dimensions of decoding. Along the spatial dimension, Lethe performs layerwise sparsity-aware allocation, assigning token pruning budgets to each transformer layer based on estimated attention redundancy. Along the temporal dimension, Lethe conducts multi-round token pruning during generation, driven by a Recency-Aware Selective Retention} (RASR) mechanism. RASR extends traditional recency-based heuristics by also considering token relevance derived from evolving attention patterns, enabling informed decisions about which tokens to retain or evict. Empirical results demonstrate that Lethe achieves a favorable balance between efficiency and generation quality across diverse models and tasks, increases throughput by up to 2.56x.

### Random Reshuffling for Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
**Authors**: Luke Shaw, Peter A. Whalley

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T11:12:56Z

**Summary**: We examine the use of different randomisation policies for stochastic gradient algorithms used in sampling, based on first-order (or overdamped) Langevin dynamics, the most popular of which is known as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics. Conventionally, this algorithm is combined with a specific stochastic gradient strategy, called Robbins-Monro. In this work, we study an alternative strategy, Random Reshuffling, and show convincingly that it leads to improved performance via: a) a proof of reduced bias in the Wasserstein metric for strongly convex, gradient Lipschitz potentials; b) an analytical demonstration of reduced bias for a Gaussian model problem; and c) an empirical demonstration of reduced bias in numerical experiments for some logistic regression problems. This is especially important since Random Reshuffling is typically more efficient due to memory access and cache reasons. Such acceleration for the Random Reshuffling policy is familiar from the optimisation literature on stochastic gradient descent.

### No Cache Left Idle: Accelerating diffusion model via Extreme-slimming Caching
**Authors**: Tingyan Wen, Haoyu Li, Yihuang Chen, Xing Zhou, Lifei Zhu, Xueqian Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T09:02:18Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models achieve remarkable generative quality, but computational overhead scales with step count, model depth, and sequence length. Feature caching is effective since adjacent timesteps yield highly similar features. However, an inherent trade-off remains: aggressive timestep reuse offers large speedups but can easily cross the critical line, hurting fidelity, while block- or token-level reuse is safer but yields limited computational savings. We present X-Slim (eXtreme-Slimming Caching), a training-free, cache-based accelerator that, to our knowledge, is the first unified framework to exploit cacheable redundancy across timesteps, structure (blocks), and space (tokens). Rather than simply mixing levels, X-Slim introduces a dual-threshold controller that turns caching into a push-then-polish process: it first pushes reuse at the timestep level up to an early-warning line, then switches to lightweight block- and token-level refresh to polish the remaining redundancy, and triggers full inference once the critical line is crossed to reset accumulated error. At each level, context-aware indicators decide when and where to cache. Across diverse tasks, X-Slim advances the speed-quality frontier. On FLUX.1-dev and HunyuanVideo, it reduces latency by up to 4.97x and 3.52x with minimal perceptual loss. On DiT-XL/2, it reaches 3.13x acceleration and improves FID by 2.42 over prior methods.

### Vision-Enhanced Large Language Models for High-Resolution Image Synthesis and Multimodal Data Interpretation
**Authors**: Karthikeya KV

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T08:28:50Z

**Summary**: This research introduces a transformative framework for integrating Vision-Enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced transformer-based architectures to tackle challenges in high-resolution image synthesis and multimodal data interpretation. The proposed model incorporates a rectified flow mechanism that connects noise and data with linear paths, enabling efficient and high-quality generation. A bidirectional tokenization strategy is employed to seamlessly merge inputs from text, image, and video modalities, fostering a unified understanding across diverse data types. By embedding spatial-temporal features and leveraging a hybrid text-image sequence modeling approach, the framework achieves unparalleled fidelity in synthesized images and coherent multimodal representations. The architecture is optimized with a noise-aware learning algorithm, addressing discrepancies in noisy data distributions and improving generative performance under varying input conditions. Rigorous evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate a 25% increase in image resolution clarity and a 20% reduction in computational requirements compared to diffusion-based methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits robust scalability and adaptability, showcasing its potential in applications like autonomous systems, creative content generation, and advanced video analysis. This work underscores the role of vision-centric LLMs in redefining capabilities in computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence.

### NSNQuant: A Double Normalization Approach for Calibration-Free Low-Bit Vector Quantization of KV Cache
**Authors**: Donghyun Son, Euntae Choi, Sungjoo Yoo

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T08:17:35Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is typically memory-intensive, especially when processing large batch sizes and long sequences, due to the large size of key-value (KV) cache. Vector Quantization (VQ) is recently adopted to alleviate this issue, but we find that the existing approach is susceptible to distribution shift due to its reliance on calibration datasets. To address this limitation, we introduce NSNQuant, a calibration-free Vector Quantization (VQ) technique designed for low-bit compression of the KV cache. By applying a three-step transformation-1) a token-wise normalization (Normalize), 2) a channel-wise centering (Shift), and 3) a second token-wise normalization (Normalize)-with Hadamard transform, NSNQuant effectively aligns the token distribution with the standard normal distribution. This alignment enables robust, calibration-free vector quantization using a single reusable codebook. Extensive experiments show that NSNQuant consistently outperforms prior methods in both 1-bit and 2-bit settings, offering strong generalization and up to 3$\times$ throughput gain over full-precision baselines.

### Advancing Cache-Based Few-Shot Classification via Patch-Driven Relational Gated Graph Attention
**Authors**: Tasweer Ahmad, Arindam Sikdar, Sandip Pradhan, Ardhendu Behera

**Updated**: 2025-12-13T23:53:00Z

**Summary**: Few-shot image classification remains difficult under limited supervision and visual domain shift. Recent cache-based adaptation approaches (e.g., Tip-Adapter) address this challenge to some extent by learning lightweight residual adapters over frozen features, yet they still inherit CLIP's tendency to encode global, general-purpose representations that are not optimally discriminative to adapt the generalist to the specialist's domain in low-data regimes. We address this limitation with a novel patch-driven relational refinement that learns cache adapter weights from intra-image patch dependencies rather than treating an image embedding as a monolithic vector. Specifically, we introduce a relational gated graph attention network that constructs a patch graph and performs edge-aware attention to emphasize informative inter-patch interactions, producing context-enriched patch embeddings. A learnable multi-aggregation pooling then composes these into compact, task-discriminative representations that better align cache keys with the target few-shot classes. Crucially, the proposed graph refinement is used only during training to distil relational structure into the cache, incurring no additional inference cost beyond standard cache lookup. Final predictions are obtained by a residual fusion of cache similarity scores with CLIP zero-shot logits. Extensive evaluations on 11 benchmarks show consistent gains over state-of-the-art CLIP adapter and cache-based baselines while preserving zero-shot efficiency. We further validate battlefield relevance by introducing an Injured vs. Uninjured Soldier dataset for casualty recognition. It is motivated by the operational need to support triage decisions within the "platinum minutes" and the broader "golden hour" window in time-critical UAV-driven search-and-rescue and combat casualty care.

### CAR-CHASE: Car-Like Robot Conflict-Aware Heuristic Adaptive Search Enhancement
**Authors**: HT To, S Nguyen, NH Pham

**Updated**: 2025-12-13T08:42:18Z

**Summary**: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) for car-like robots, addressed by algorithms such as Conflict-Based Search with Continuous Time (CL-CBS), faces significant computational challenges due to expensive kinematic heuristic calculations. Traditional heuristic caching assumes that the heuristic function depends only on the state, which is incorrect in CBS where constraints from conflict resolution make the search space context-dependent. We propose \textbf{CAR-CHASE} (Car-Like Robot Conflict-Aware Heuristic Adaptive Search Enhancement), a novel approach that combines \textbf{conflict-aware heuristic caching} -- which caches heuristic values based on both state and relevant constraint context -- with an \textbf{adaptive hybrid heuristic} that intelligently switches between fast approximate and exact computations. Our key innovations are (1) a compact \emph{conflict fingerprint} that efficiently encodes which constraints affect a state's heuristic, (2) a relevance filter using spatial, temporal, and geometric criteria, and (3) an adaptive switching strategy with theoretical quality bounds. Experimental evaluation on 480 benchmark instances with varying agent counts (10 to 30) and obstacle densities (0\% and 50\%) demonstrates a geometric mean speedup of 2.46$\times$ over the baseline CL-CBS implementation while maintaining solution optimality. The optimizations improve success rate from 77.9\% to 84.8\% (+6.9 percentage points), reduce total runtime by 70.1\%, and enable solving 33 additional instances that previously timed out. Performance gains scale with problem complexity, reaching up to 4.06$\times$ speedup for challenging 30-agent obstacle scenarios. Our techniques are general and applicable to other CBS variants.

### cMPI: Using CXL Memory Sharing for MPI One-Sided and Two-Sided Inter-Node Communications
**Authors**: Xi Wang, Bin Ma, Jongryool Kim, Byungil Koh, Hoshik Kim, Dong Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-13T06:18:18Z

**Summary**: Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a foundational programming model for high-performance computing. MPI libraries traditionally employ network interconnects (e.g., Ethernet and InfiniBand) and network protocols (e.g., TCP and RoCE) with complex software stacks for cross-node communication. We present cMPI, the first work to optimize MPI point-to-point communication (both one-sided and two-sided) using CXL memory sharing on a real CXL platform, transforming cross-node communication into memory transactions and data copies within CXL memory, bypassing traditional network protocols. We analyze performance across various interconnects and find that CXL memory sharing achieves 7.2x-8.1x lower latency than TCP-based interconnects deployed in small- and medium-scale clusters. We address challenges of CXL memory sharing for MPI communication, including data object management over the dax representation [50], cache coherence, and atomic operations. Overall, cMPI outperforms TCP over standard Ethernet NIC and high-end SmartNIC by up to 49x and 72x in latency and bandwidth, respectively, for small messages.

### GraphPerf-RT: A Graph-Driven Performance Model for Hardware-Aware Scheduling of OpenMP Codes
**Authors**: Mohammad Pivezhandi, Mahdi Banisharif, Saeed Bakhshan, Abusayeed Saifullah, Ali Jannesari

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T23:46:05Z

**Summary**: Performance prediction for OpenMP workloads on heterogeneous embedded SoCs is challenging due to complex interactions between task DAG structure, control-flow irregularity, cache   and branch behavior, and thermal dynamics; classical heuristics struggle under workload irregularity, tabular regressors discard structural information, and model-free RL risks   overheating resource-constrained devices. We introduce GraphPerf-RT, the first surrogate that unifies task DAG topology, CFG-derived code semantics, and runtime context (per-core   DVFS, thermal state, utilization) in a heterogeneous graph representation with typed edges encoding precedence, placement, and contention. Multi-task evidential heads predict   makespan, energy, cache and branch misses, and utilization with calibrated uncertainty (Normal-Inverse-Gamma), enabling risk-aware scheduling that filters low-confidence rollouts.   We validate GraphPerf-RT on three embedded ARM platforms (Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RUBIK Pi), achieving R^2 > 0.95 with well-calibrated uncertainty (ECE < 0.05). To   demonstrate end-to-end scheduling utility, we integrate the surrogate with four RL methods on Jetson TX2: single-agent model-free (SAMFRL), single-agent model-based (SAMBRL),   multi-agent model-free (MAMFRL-D3QN), and multi-agent model-based (MAMBRL-D3QN). Experiments across 5 seeds (200 episodes each) show that MAMBRL-D3QN with GraphPerf-RT as the   world model achieves 66% makespan reduction (0.97 +/- 0.35s) and 82% energy reduction (0.006 +/- 0.005J) compared to model-free baselines, demonstrating that accurate,   uncertainty-aware surrogates enable effective model-based planning on thermally constrained embedded systems.

### Multipole Attention for Efficient Long Context Reasoning
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sebastian Zhao, Luca Manolache, Sehoon Kim, Michael W. Mahoney, Yakun Sophia Shao, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T19:51:26Z

**Summary**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown promising accuracy improvements on complex problem-solving tasks. While these models have attained high accuracy by leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long chain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires generating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce the KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these methods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally, prior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the important prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this pre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning tokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention, which accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention for the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations for the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group together semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids both to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key vectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update process to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens, thereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We evaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our approach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive attention sparsity settings. We also provide kernel implementations to demonstrate the practical efficiency gains from our method, achieving up to 4.5$\times$ speedup for attention in long-context reasoning applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/MultipoleAttention.

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on long-context tasks, but are often bottlenecked by memory constraints. Namely, the KV cache, which is used to significantly speed up attention computations, grows linearly with context length. A suite of compression algorithms has been introduced to alleviate cache growth by evicting unimportant tokens. However, several popular strategies are targeted towards the prefill phase, i.e., processing long prompt context, and their performance is rarely assessed on reasoning tasks requiring long decoding. In particular, short but complex prompts, such as those in benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH500, often benefit from multi-step reasoning and self-reflection, resulting in thinking sequences thousands of tokens long. In this work, we benchmark the performance of several popular compression strategies on long-reasoning tasks. For the non-reasoning Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we determine that no singular strategy fits all, and that performance is heavily influenced by dataset type. However, we discover that H2O and our decoding-enabled variant of SnapKV are dominant strategies for reasoning models, indicating the utility of heavy-hitter tracking for reasoning traces. We also find that eviction strategies at low budgets can produce longer reasoning traces, revealing a tradeoff between cache size and inference costs.

### BLURR: A Boosted Low-Resource Inference for Vision-Language-Action Models
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Ma, Zhengqing Yuan, Zheyuan Zhang, Kaiwen Shi, Lichao Sun, Yanfang Ye

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T18:30:45Z

**Summary**: Vision-language-action (VLA) models enable impressive zero shot manipulation, but their inference stacks are often too heavy for responsive web demos or high frequency robot control on commodity GPUs. We present BLURR, a lightweight inference wrapper that can be plugged into existing VLA controllers without retraining or changing model checkpoints. Instantiated on the pi-zero VLA controller, BLURR keeps the original observation interfaces and accelerates control by combining an instruction prefix key value cache, mixed precision execution, and a single step rollout schedule that reduces per step computation. In our SimplerEnv based evaluation, BLURR maintains task success rates comparable to the original controller while significantly lowering effective FLOPs and wall clock latency. We also build an interactive web demo that allows users to switch between controllers and toggle inference options in real time while watching manipulation episodes. This highlights BLURR as a practical approach for deploying modern VLA policies under tight compute budgets.

### PD-Swap: Prefill-Decode Logic Swapping for End-to-End LLM Inference on Edge FPGAs via Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration
**Authors**: Yifan Zhang, Zhiheng Chen, Ye Qiao, Sitao Huang

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T13:35:09Z

**Summary**: Aggressively quantized large language models (LLMs), such as BitNet-style 1.58-bit Transformers with ternary weights, make it feasible to deploy generative AI on low-power edge FPGAs. However, as prompts grow to tens of thousands of tokens, edge hardware performance drops sharply with sequence length due to quadratic prefill cost and rapidly increasing KV-cache bandwidth demands, making inference latency of longer context length a first-order system concern. Recent studies on LLMs expose a fundamental prefill-decode asymmetry: prefill is compute-bound and dominated by dense matrix-matrix operations, whereas decoding is memory-bandwidth-bound and dominated by KV-cache traffic. A static accelerator must provision resources and a single dataflow for both regimes, leading to duplicated attention logic, underutilized fabric, and tight LUT/URAM limits that cap model size and usable context. We propose a prefill--decode disaggregated LLM accelerator, PD-Swap, that uses Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) to time-multiplex the attention module on edge FPGAs. The core table-lookup ternary matrix multiplication and weight-buffering engines remain static, while the attention subsystem is a reconfigurable partition with two phase-specialized architectures: a compute-heavy, token-parallel prefill engine and a bandwidth-optimized, KV-cache-centric decoding engine. A roofline-inspired model and design space exploration jointly optimize reconfigurable-region size, parallelism under reconfiguration and routability constraints, and reconfiguration latency is hidden by computation latency. PD-Swap achieves up to 27~tokens/s decoding throughput, outperforming prior state-of-the-art works by 1.3x--2.1x (larger gains at longer context lengths), without extra area cost.

### Drinfeld associators and Kashiwara-Vergne associators in higher genera
**Authors**: Toyo Taniguchi

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T11:32:39Z

**Summary**: For $g\geq 0$, a genus $g$ Kashiwara-Vergne associator, introduced by Alekseev-Kawazumi-Kuno-Naef as a solution to the generalised KV equations in relation to the formality problem of the Goldman-Turaev Lie bialgebra on an oriented surface with a framing, is directly constructed from a genus $g$ analogue of a Drinfeld associator formulated by Gonzalez, which we call a Gonzalez-Drinfeld associator. The proof is based on Massuyeau's work in genus 0. The framing is automatically determined from the choice of a Gonzalez-Drinfeld associator, and in the case of genus 1, we show that only one particular framing is realised by our construction.

### Boosting Skeleton-based Zero-Shot Action Recognition with Training-Free Test-Time Adaptation
**Authors**: Jingmin Zhu, Anqi Zhu, Hossein Rahmani, Jun Liu, Mohammed Bennamoun, Qiuhong Ke

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T10:53:51Z

**Summary**: We introduce Skeleton-Cache, the first training-free test-time adaptation framework for skeleton-based zero-shot action recognition (SZAR), aimed at improving model generalization to unseen actions during inference. Skeleton-Cache reformulates inference as a lightweight retrieval process over a non-parametric cache that stores structured skeleton representations, combining both global and fine-grained local descriptors. To guide the fusion of descriptor-wise predictions, we leverage the semantic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assign class-specific importance weights. By integrating these structured descriptors with LLM-guided semantic priors, Skeleton-Cache dynamically adapts to unseen actions without any additional training or access to training data. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD II demonstrate that Skeleton-Cache consistently boosts the performance of various SZAR backbones under both zero-shot and generalized zero-shot settings. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Alchemist0754/Skeleton-Cache.

### Proving DNSSEC Correctness: A Formal Approach to Secure Domain Name Resolution
**Authors**: Qifan Zhang, Zilin Shen, Imtiaz Karim, Elisa Bertino, Zhou Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T10:12:06Z

**Summary**: The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are critical for preventing DNS spoofing, yet its specifications contain ambiguities and vulnerabilities that elude traditional "break-and-fix" approaches. A holistic, foundational security analysis of the protocol has thus remained an open problem. This paper introduces DNSSECVerif, the first framework for comprehensive, automated formal security analysis of the DNSSEC protocol suite. Built on the SAPIC+ symbolic verifier, our high-fidelity model captures protocol-level interactions, including cryptographic operations and stateful caching with fine-grained concurrency control. Using DNSSECVerif, we formally prove four of DNSSEC's core security guarantees and uncover critical ambiguities in the standards--notably, the insecure coexistence of NSEC and NSEC3. Our model also automatically rediscovers three classes of known attacks, demonstrating fundamental weaknesses in the protocol design. To bridge the model-to-reality gap, we validate our findings through targeted testing of mainstream DNS software and a large-scale measurement study of over 2.2 million open resolvers, confirming the real-world impact of these flaws. Our work provides crucial, evidence-based recommendations for hardening DNSSEC specifications and implementations.

 ### HiStream: Efficient High-Resolution Video Generation via Redundancy-Eliminated Streaming
**Authors**: Haonan Qiu, Shikun Liu, Zijian Zhou, Zhaochong An, Weiming Ren, Zhiheng Liu, Jonas Schult, Sen He, Shoufa Chen, Yuren Cong, Tao Xiang, Ziwei Liu, Juan-Manuel Perez-Rua

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T18:59:58Z

**Summary**: High-resolution video generation, while crucial for digital media and film, is computationally bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of diffusion models, making practical inference infeasible. To address this, we introduce HiStream, an efficient autoregressive framework that systematically reduces redundancy across three axes: i) Spatial Compression: denoising at low resolution before refining at high resolution with cached features; ii) Temporal Compression: a chunk-by-chunk strategy with a fixed-size anchor cache, ensuring stable inference speed; and iii) Timestep Compression: applying fewer denoising steps to subsequent, cache-conditioned chunks. On 1080p benchmarks, our primary HiStream model (i+ii) achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while demonstrating up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to the Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. Our faster variant, HiStream+, applies all three optimizations (i+ii+iii), achieving a 107.5x acceleration over the baseline, offering a compelling trade-off between speed and quality, thereby making high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable.

### Autonomous Uncertainty Quantification for Computational Point-of-care Sensors
**Authors**: Artem Goncharov, Rajesh Ghosh, Hyou-Arm Joung, Dino Di Carlo, Aydogan Ozcan

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T18:59:47Z

**Summary**: Computational point-of-care (POC) sensors enable rapid, low-cost, and accessible diagnostics in emergency, remote and resource-limited areas that lack access to centralized medical facilities. These systems can utilize neural network-based algorithms to accurately infer a diagnosis from the signals generated by rapid diagnostic tests or sensors. However, neural network-based diagnostic models are subject to hallucinations and can produce erroneous predictions, posing a risk of misdiagnosis and inaccurate clinical decisions. To address this challenge, here we present an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique developed for POC diagnostics. As our testbed, we used a paper-based, computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) platform developed for rapid POC diagnosis of Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne disease globally. The xVFA platform integrates a disposable paper-based assay, a handheld optical reader and a neural network-based inference algorithm, providing rapid and cost-effective Lyme disease diagnostics in under 20 min using only 20 uL of patient serum. By incorporating a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification approach into the diagnostics pipeline, we identified and excluded erroneous predictions with high uncertainty, significantly improving the sensitivity and reliability of the xVFA in an autonomous manner, without access to the ground truth diagnostic information of patients. Blinded testing using new patient samples demonstrated an increase in diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7%, indicating the effectiveness of MCDO-based uncertainty quantification in enhancing the robustness of neural network-driven computational POC sensing systems.

### Streaming Video Instruction Tuning
**Authors**: Jiaer Xia, Peixian Chen, Mengdan Zhang, Xing Sun, Kaiyang Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T18:59:36Z

**Summary**: We present Streamo, a real-time streaming video LLM that serves as a general-purpose interactive assistant. Unlike existing online video models that focus narrowly on question answering or captioning, Streamo performs a broad spectrum of streaming video tasks, including real-time narration, action understanding, event captioning, temporal event grounding, and time-sensitive question answering. To develop such versatility, we construct Streamo-Instruct-465K, a large-scale instruction-following dataset tailored for streaming video understanding. The dataset covers diverse temporal contexts and multi-task supervision, enabling unified training across heterogeneous streaming tasks. After training end-to-end on the instruction-following dataset through a streamlined pipeline, Streamo exhibits strong temporal reasoning, responsive interaction, and broad generalization across a variety of streaming benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that Streamo bridges the gap between offline video perception models and real-time multimodal assistants, making a step toward unified, intelligent video understanding in continuous video streams.

### Fast SAM2 with Text-Driven Token Pruning
**Authors**: Avilasha Mandal, Chaoning Zhang, Fachrina Dewi Puspitasari, Xudong Wang, Jiaquan Zhang, Caiyan Qin, Guoqing Wang, Yang Yang, Heng Tao Shen

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T18:59:05Z

**Summary**: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), a vision foundation model has significantly advanced in prompt-driven video object segmentation, yet their practical deployment remains limited by the high computational and memory cost of processing dense visual tokens across time. The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance. These results highlight the potential of early token selection to improve the scalability of transformer-based video segmentation systems for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

### C2LLM Technical Report: A New Frontier in Code Retrieval via Adaptive Cross-Attention Pooling
**Authors**: Jin Qin, Zihan Liao, Ziyin Zhang, Hang Yu, Peng Di, Rui Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T18:59:01Z

**Summary**: We present C2LLM - Contrastive Code Large Language Models, a family of code embedding models in both 0.5B and 7B sizes. Building upon Qwen-2.5-Coder backbones, C2LLM adopts a Pooling by Multihead Attention (PMA) module for generating sequence embedding from token embeddings, effectively 1) utilizing the LLM's causal representations acquired during pretraining, while also 2) being able to aggregate information from all tokens in the sequence, breaking the information bottleneck in EOS-based sequence embeddings, and 3) supporting flexible adaptation of embedding dimension, serving as an alternative to MRL. Trained on three million publicly available data, C2LLM models set new records on MTEB-Code among models of similar sizes, with C2LLM-7B ranking 1st on the overall leaderboard.

### Measuring all the noises of LLM Evals
**Authors**: Sida Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T18:54:37Z

**Summary**: Separating signal from noise is central to experimental science. Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments.

### Scaling Laws for Economic Productivity: Experimental Evidence in LLM-Assisted Consulting, Data Analyst, and Management Tasks
**Authors**: Ali Merali

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T18:24:29Z

**Summary**: This paper derives `Scaling Laws for Economic Impacts' -- empirical relationships between the training compute of Large Language Models (LLMs) and professional productivity. In a preregistered experiment, over 500 consultants, data analysts, and managers completed professional tasks using one of 13 LLMs. We find that each year of AI model progress reduced task time by 8%, with 56% of gains driven by increased compute and 44% by algorithmic progress. However, productivity gains were significantly larger for non-agentic analytical tasks compared to agentic workflows requiring tool use. These findings suggest continued model scaling could boost U.S. productivity by approximately 20% over the next decade.

### Learning to Solve PDEs on Neural Shape Representations
**Authors**: Lilian Welschinger, Yilin Liu, Zican Wang, Niloy Mitra

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T18:14:02Z

**Summary**: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on shapes underpins many shape analysis and engineering tasks; yet, prevailing PDE solvers operate on polygonal/triangle meshes while modern 3D assets increasingly live as neural representations. This mismatch leaves no suitable method to solve surface PDEs directly within the neural domain, forcing explicit mesh extraction or per-instance residual training, preventing end-to-end workflows. We present a novel, mesh-free formulation that learns a local update operator conditioned on neural (local) shape attributes, enabling surface PDEs to be solved directly where the (neural) data lives. The operator integrates naturally with prevalent neural surface representations, is trained once on a single representative shape, and generalizes across shape and topology variations, enabling accurate, fast inference without explicit meshing or per-instance optimization while preserving differentiability. Across analytic benchmarks (heat equation and Poisson solve on sphere) and real neural assets across different representations, our method slightly outperforms CPM while remaining reasonably close to FEM, and, to our knowledge, delivers the first end-to-end pipeline that solves surface PDEs on both neural and classical surface representations. Code will be released on acceptance.

### A Plan Reuse Mechanism for LLM-Driven Agent
**Authors**: Guopeng Li, Ruiqi Wu, Haisheng Tan

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T18:08:03Z

**Summary**: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into personal assistants, like Xiao Ai and Blue Heart V, effectively enhances their ability to interact with humans, solve complex tasks, and manage IoT devices. Such assistants are also termed LLM-driven agents. Upon receiving user requests, the LLM-driven agent generates plans using an LLM, executes these plans through various tools, and then returns the response to the user. During this process, the latency for generating a plan with an LLM can reach tens of seconds, significantly degrading user experience. Real-world dataset analysis shows that about 30% of the requests received by LLM-driven agents are identical or similar, which allows the reuse of previously generated plans to reduce latency. However, it is difficult to accurately define the similarity between the request texts received by the LLM-driven agent through directly evaluating the original request texts. Moreover, the diverse expressions of natural language and the unstructured format of plan texts make implementing plan reuse challenging. To address these issues, we present and implement a plan reuse mechanism for LLM-driven agents called AgentReuse. AgentReuse leverages the similarities and differences among requests' semantics and uses intent classification to evaluate the similarities between requests and enable the reuse of plans. Experimental results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AgentReuse achieves a 93% effective plan reuse rate, an F1 score of 0.9718, and an accuracy of 0.9459 in evaluating request similarities, reducing latency by 93.12% compared with baselines without using the reuse mechanism.

### When F1 Fails: Granularity-Aware Evaluation for Dialogue Topic Segmentation
**Authors**: Michael H. Coen

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T18:05:57Z

**Summary**: Dialogue topic segmentation supports summarization, retrieval, memory management, and conversational continuity. Despite decades of work, evaluation practice remains dominated by strict boundary matching and F1-based metrics. Modern large language model (LLM) based conversational systems increasingly rely on segmentation to manage conversation history beyond fixed context windows. In such systems, unstructured context accumulation degrades efficiency and coherence.   This paper introduces an evaluation framework that reports boundary density and segment alignment diagnostics (purity and coverage) alongside window-tolerant F1 (W-F1). By separating boundary scoring from boundary selection, we evaluate segmentation quality across density regimes rather than at a single operating point. Cross-dataset evaluation shows that reported performance differences often reflect annotation granularity mismatch rather than boundary placement quality alone.   We evaluate structurally distinct segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Boundary-based metrics are strongly coupled to boundary density: threshold sweeps produce larger W-F1 changes than switching between methods. These findings support viewing topic segmentation as a granularity selection problem rather than prediction of a single correct boundary set. This motivates separating boundary scoring from boundary selection for analyzing and tuning segmentation under varying annotation granularities.

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T17:22:00Z

**Summary**: Traditional control interfaces for quadruped robots often impose a high barrier to entry, requiring specialized technical knowledge for effective operation. To address this, this paper presents a novel control framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable intuitive, natural language-based navigation. We propose a distributed architecture where high-level instruction processing is offloaded to an external server to overcome the onboard computational constraints of the DeepRobotics Jueying Lite 3 platform. The system grounds LLM-generated plans into executable ROS navigation commands using real-time sensor fusion (LiDAR, IMU, and Odometry). Experimental validation was conducted in a structured indoor environment across four distinct scenarios, ranging from single-room tasks to complex cross-zone navigation. The results demonstrate the system's robustness, achieving an aggregate success rate of over 90\% across all scenarios, validating the feasibility of offloaded LLM-based planning for autonomous quadruped deployment in real-world settings.

### Post-detection inference for sequential changepoint localization
**Authors**: Aytijhya Saha, Aaditya Ramdas

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T17:17:29Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses a fundamental but largely unexplored challenge in sequential changepoint analysis: conducting inference following a detected change. We develop a very general framework to construct confidence sets for the unknown changepoint using only the data observed up to a data-dependent stopping time at which an arbitrary sequential detection algorithm declares a change. Our framework is nonparametric, making no assumption on the composite post-change class, the observation space, or the sequential detection procedure used, and is non-asymptotically valid. We also extend it to handle composite pre-change classes under a suitable assumption, and also derive confidence sets for the change magnitude in parametric settings. We provide theoretical guarantees on the width of our confidence intervals. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the produced sets have reasonable size, and slightly conservative coverage. In summary, we present the first general method for sequential changepoint localization, which is theoretically sound and broadly applicable in practice.

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T17:16:37Z

**Summary**: Recent progress in diffusion-based Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) demonstrates strong expressiveness but remains limited by data scarcity and model scalability. We introduce a two-stage pipeline: a compact seed set of human-sung recordings is constructed by pairing fixed melodies with diverse LLM-generated lyrics, and melody-specific models are trained to synthesize over 500 hours of high-quality Chinese singing data. Building on this corpus, we propose DiTSinger, a Diffusion Transformer with RoPE and qk-norm, systematically scaled in depth, width, and resolution for enhanced fidelity. Furthermore, we design an implicit alignment mechanism that obviates phoneme-level duration labels by constraining phoneme-to-acoustic attention within character-level spans, thereby improving robustness under noisy or uncertain alignments. Extensive experiments validate that our approach enables scalable, alignment-free, and high-fidelity SVS.

### Surgical Scene Segmentation using a Spike-Driven Video Transformer with Real-Time Potential
**Authors**: Shihao Zou, Jingjing Li, Wei Ji, Jincai Huang, Kai Wang, Guo Dan, Weixin Si, Yi Pan

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T17:05:09Z

**Summary**: Modern surgical systems increasingly rely on intelligent scene understanding to provide timely situational awareness for enhanced intra-operative safety. Within this pipeline, surgical scene segmentation plays a central role in accurately perceiving operative events. Although recent deep learning models, particularly large-scale foundation models, achieve remarkable segmentation accuracy, their substantial computational demands and power consumption hinder real-time deployment in resource-constrained surgical environments. To address this limitation, we explore the emerging SNN as a promising paradigm for highly efficient surgical intelligence. However, their performance is still constrained by the scarcity of labeled surgical data and the inherently sparse nature of surgical video representations. To this end, we propose \textit{SpikeSurgSeg}, the first spike-driven video Transformer framework tailored for surgical scene segmentation with real-time potential on non-GPU platforms. To address the limited availability of surgical annotations, we introduce a surgical-scene masked autoencoding pretraining strategy for SNNs that enables robust spatiotemporal representation learning via layer-wise tube masking. Building on this pretrained backbone, we further adopt a lightweight spike-driven segmentation head that produces temporally consistent predictions while preserving the low-latency characteristics of SNNs. Extensive experiments on EndoVis18 and our in-house SurgBleed dataset demonstrate that SpikeSurgSeg achieves mIoU comparable to SOTA ANN-based models while reducing inference latency by at least $8\times$. Notably, it delivers over $20\times$ acceleration relative to most foundation-model baselines, underscoring its potential for time-critical surgical scene segmentation.

### SMART SLM: Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer, A Small Language Model for Accurate Document Assistance
**Authors**: Divij Dudeja, Mayukha Pal

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T16:59:04Z

**Summary**: The user of Engineering Manuals (EM) finds it difficult to read EM s because they are long, have a dense format which includes written documents, step by step procedures, and standard parameter lists for engineering equipment. Off the shelf transformers, especially compact ones, treat this material as a flat stream of tokens. This approach leads to confident but incorrect numeric answers and forces the models to memorize separate facts inefficiently. SMART (Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer) offers a different and practical solution to the above problem. SMART structures its processing by using a hierarchical approach, and is based upon three main job categories (1) A syntax-aware Fact Extractor (Grammarian) Tree LSTM which extracts facts as subject relation object relations from EM sentences (2) A compact indexed memory MANN (Memory Augmented Neural Network) that indexes these Rational Subject Relation Objects as 384 dimensional vectors that are associated with the source of the information, and (3) A 6 layer Transformer that learns to fuse the previously retrieved facts into its generated response. The entire SMART model utilizes 45.51M parameters, which is 64% less than GPT-2 (124M) and 69% less than BERT (133M), and it achieves a 21.3% higher accuracy than GPT-2, indicating that SMART fits the data better with the least amount of processing requirements. SMART employs dual modes of inference an indexed fast path for known documents (sub-second answer times) and an indexed dynamic path assisted by RAGs for new uploads (FAISS Top 20 results with memory severed at 64 slots). In real world deployment, this framework leads to more well supported results with reduced hallucinations than comparable small transformer models.

### GriDiT: Factorized Grid-Based Diffusion for Efficient Long Image Sequence Generation
**Authors**: Snehal Singh Tomar, Alexandros Graikos, Arjun Krishna, Dimitris Samaras, Klaus Mueller

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T16:46:04Z

**Summary**: Modern deep learning methods typically treat image sequences as large tensors of sequentially stacked frames. However, is this straightforward representation ideal given the current state-of-the-art (SoTA)? In this work, we address this question in the context of generative models and aim to devise a more effective way of modeling image sequence data. Observing the inefficiencies and bottlenecks of current SoTA image sequence generation methods, we showcase that rather than working with large tensors, we can improve the generation process by factorizing it into first generating the coarse sequence at low resolution and then refining the individual frames at high resolution. We train a generative model solely on grid images comprising subsampled frames. Yet, we learn to generate image sequences, using the strong self-attention mechanism of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to capture correlations between frames. In effect, our formulation extends a 2D image generator to operate as a low-resolution 3D image-sequence generator without introducing any architectural modifications. Subsequently, we super-resolve each frame individually to add the sequence-independent high-resolution details. This approach offers several advantages and can overcome key limitations of the SoTA in this domain. Compared to existing image sequence generation models, our method achieves superior synthesis quality and improved coherence across sequences. It also delivers high-fidelity generation of arbitrary-length sequences and increased efficiency in inference time and training data usage. Furthermore, our straightforward formulation enables our method to generalize effectively across diverse data domains, which typically require additional priors and supervision to model in a generative context. Our method consistently outperforms SoTA in quality and inference speed (at least twice-as-fast) across datasets.

**Authors**: Changwei Wu, Yifei Chen, Yuxin Du, Mingxuan Liu, Jinying Zong, Beining Wu, Jie Dong, Feiwei Qin, Yunkang Cao, Qiyuan Tian

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T16:16:09Z

**Summary**: Reliable anomaly detection in brain MRI remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated abnormal cases and the frequent absence of key imaging modalities in real clinical workflows. Existing single-class or multi-class anomaly detection (AD) models typically rely on fixed modality configurations, require repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations, limiting their clinical scalability. In this work, we present a unified Any-Modality AD framework that performs robust anomaly detection and localization under arbitrary MRI modality availability. The framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with a feature distribution alignment mechanism that statistically aligns incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations, enabling stable inference even with severe modality dropout. To further enhance semantic consistency, we introduce an Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and an INP-guided decoder that reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while naturally amplifying abnormal deviations. Through randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training, the model learns to adapt to all modality configurations without re-training. Extensive experiments on BraTS2018, MU-Glioma-Post, and Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art industrial and medical AD baselines across 7 modality combinations, achieving superior generalization. This study establishes a scalable paradigm for multimodal medical AD under real-world, imperfect modality conditions. Our source code is available at https://github.com/wuchangw/AnyAD.

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T16:06:20Z

**Summary**: Industrial recommender systems face two fundamental limitations under the log-driven paradigm: (1) knowledge poverty in ID-based item representations that causes brittle interest modeling under data sparsity, and (2) systemic blindness to beyond-log user interests that constrains model performance within platform boundaries. These limitations stem from an over-reliance on shallow interaction statistics and close-looped feedback while neglecting the rich world knowledge about product semantics and cross-domain behavioral patterns that Large Language Models have learned from vast corpora.   To address these challenges, we introduce ReaSeq, a reasoning-enhanced framework that leverages world knowledge in Large Language Models to address both limitations through explicit and implicit reasoning. Specifically, ReaSeq employs explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning via multi-agent collaboration to distill structured product knowledge into semantically enriched item representations, and latent reasoning via Diffusion Large Language Models to infer plausible beyond-log behaviors. Deployed on Taobao's ranking system serving hundreds of millions of users, ReaSeq achieves substantial gains: >6.0% in IPV and CTR, >2.9% in Orders, and >2.5% in GMV, validating the effectiveness of world-knowledge-enhanced reasoning over purely log-driven approaches.

**Summary**: The "one-shot" technique represents a distinct and sophisticated aesthetic in filmmaking. However, its practical realization is often hindered by prohibitive costs and complex real-world constraints. Although emerging video generation models offer a virtual alternative, existing approaches typically rely on naive clip concatenation, which frequently fails to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence. In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content. (iii) To facilitate the production of extended sequences, we design a Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy that operates in a memory-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves visually striking and seamlessly coherent one-shot effects while maintaining computational efficiency, empowering users to transform fragmented visual materials into vivid, cohesive one-shot cinematic experiences.

### CoTDeceptor:Adversarial Code Obfuscation Against CoT-Enhanced LLM Code Agents
**Authors**: Haoyang Li, Mingjin Li, Jinxin Zuo, Siqi Li, Xiao Li, Hao Wu, Yueming Lu, Xiaochuan He

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T15:55:42Z

**Summary**: LLM-based code agents(e.g., ChatGPT Codex) are increasingly deployed as detector for code review and security auditing tasks. Although CoT-enhanced LLM vulnerability detectors are believed to provide improved robustness against obfuscated malicious code, we find that their reasoning chains and semantic abstraction processes exhibit exploitable systematic weaknesses.This allows attackers to covertly embed malicious logic, bypass code review, and propagate backdoored components throughout real-world software supply chains.To investigate this issue, we present CoTDeceptor, the first adversarial code obfuscation framework targeting CoT-enhanced LLM detectors. CoTDeceptor autonomously constructs evolving, hard-to-reverse multi-stage obfuscation strategy chains that effectively disrupt CoT-driven detection logic.We obtained malicious code provided by security enterprise, experimental results demonstrate that CoTDeceptor achieves stable and transferable evasion performance against state-of-the-art LLMs and vulnerability detection agents. CoTDeceptor bypasses 14 out of 15 vulnerability categories, compared to only 2 bypassed by prior methods. Our findings highlight potential risks in real-world software supply chains and underscore the need for more robust and interpretable LLM-powered security analysis systems.

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T15:52:31Z

**Summary**: As LLMs shift toward autonomous agents, Deep Research has emerged as a pivotal metric. However, existing academic benchmarks like BrowseComp often fail to meet real-world demands for open-ended research, which requires robust skills in intent recognition, long-horizon decision-making, and cross-source verification. To address this, we introduce Step-DeepResearch, a cost-effective, end-to-end agent. We propose a Data Synthesis Strategy Based on Atomic Capabilities to reinforce planning and report writing, combined with a progressive training path from agentic mid-training to SFT and RL. Enhanced by a Checklist-style Judger, this approach significantly improves robustness. Furthermore, to bridge the evaluation gap in the Chinese domain, we establish ADR-Bench for realistic deep research scenarios. Experimental results show that Step-DeepResearch (32B) scores 61.4% on Scale AI Research Rubrics. On ADR-Bench, it significantly outperforms comparable models and rivals SOTA closed-source models like OpenAI and Gemini DeepResearch. These findings prove that refined training enables medium-sized models to achieve expert-level capabilities at industry-leading cost-efficiency.

### LookPlanGraph: Embodied Instruction Following Method with VLM Graph Augmentation
**Authors**: Anatoly O. Onishchenko, Alexey K. Kovalev, Aleksandr I. Panov

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T15:36:21Z

**Summary**: Methods that use Large Language Models (LLM) as planners for embodied instruction following tasks have become widespread. To successfully complete tasks, the LLM must be grounded in the environment in which the robot operates. One solution is to use a scene graph that contains all the necessary information. Modern methods rely on prebuilt scene graphs and assume that all task-relevant information is available at the start of planning. However, these approaches do not account for changes in the environment that may occur between the graph construction and the task execution. We propose LookPlanGraph - a method that leverages a scene graph composed of static assets and object priors. During plan execution, LookPlanGraph continuously updates the graph with relevant objects, either by verifying existing priors or discovering new entities. This is achieved by processing the agents egocentric camera view using a Vision Language Model. We conducted experiments with changed object positions VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulated environments, demonstrating that LookPlanGraph outperforms methods based on predefined static scene graphs. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we also conducted experiments in a real-world setting. Additionally, we introduce the GraSIF (Graph Scenes for Instruction Following) dataset with automated validation framework, comprising 514 tasks drawn from SayPlan Office, BEHAVIOR-1K, and VirtualHome RobotHow.

### Improving the Convergence Rate of Ray Search Optimization for Query-Efficient Hard-Label Attacks
**Authors**: Xinjie Xu, Shuyu Cheng, Dongwei Xu, Qi Xuan, Chen Ma

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T15:35:03Z

**Summary**: In hard-label black-box adversarial attacks, where only the top-1 predicted label is accessible, the prohibitive query complexity poses a major obstacle to practical deployment. In this paper, we focus on optimizing a representative class of attacks that search for the optimal ray direction yielding the minimum $\ell_2$-norm perturbation required to move a benign image into the adversarial region. Inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG), we propose a momentum-based algorithm, ARS-OPT, which proactively estimates the gradient with respect to a future ray direction inferred from accumulated momentum. We provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, showing that ARS-OPT enables more accurate directional updates and achieves faster, more stable optimization. To further accelerate convergence, we incorporate surrogate-model priors into ARS-OPT's gradient estimation, resulting in PARS-OPT with enhanced performance. The superiority of our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method surpasses 13 state-of-the-art approaches in query efficiency.

### Assessing the Software Security Comprehension of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Mohammed Latif Siddiq, Natalie Sekerak, Antonio Karam, Maria Leal, Arvin Islam-Gomes, Joanna C. S. Santos

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T15:29:54Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development, but their level of software security expertise remains unclear. This work systematically evaluates the security comprehension of five leading LLMs: GPT-4o-Mini, GPT-5-Mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.1, and Qwen-2.5, using Blooms Taxonomy as a framework. We assess six cognitive dimensions: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. Our methodology integrates diverse datasets, including curated multiple-choice questions, vulnerable code snippets (SALLM), course assessments from an Introduction to Software Security course, real-world case studies (XBOW), and project-based creation tasks from a Secure Software Engineering course. Results show that while LLMs perform well on lower-level cognitive tasks such as recalling facts and identifying known vulnerabilities, their performance degrades significantly on higher-order tasks that require reasoning, architectural evaluation, and secure system creation. Beyond reporting aggregate accuracy, we introduce a software security knowledge boundary that identifies the highest cognitive level at which a model consistently maintains reliable performance. In addition, we identify 51 recurring misconception patterns exhibited by LLMs across Blooms levels.

### Casting a SPELL: Sentence Pairing Exploration for LLM Limitation-breaking
**Authors**: Yifan Huang, Xiaojun Jia, Wenbo Guo, Yuqiang Sun, Yihao Huang, Chong Wang, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T15:25:31Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized software development through AI-assisted coding tools, enabling developers with limited programming expertise to create sophisticated applications. However, this accessibility extends to malicious actors who may exploit these powerful tools to generate harmful software. Existing jailbreaking research primarily focuses on general attack scenarios against LLMs, with limited exploration of malicious code generation as a jailbreak target. To address this gap, we propose SPELL, a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed to evaluate the weakness of security alignment in malicious code generation. Our framework employs a time-division selection strategy that systematically constructs jailbreaking prompts by intelligently combining sentences from a prior knowledge dataset, balancing exploration of novel attack patterns with exploitation of successful techniques. Extensive evaluation across three advanced code models (GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5, and Qwen2.5-Coder) demonstrates SPELL's effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 83.75%, 19.38%, and 68.12% respectively across eight malicious code categories. The generated prompts successfully produce malicious code in real-world AI development tools such as Cursor, with outputs confirmed as malicious by state-of-the-art detection systems at rates exceeding 73%. These findings reveal significant security gaps in current LLM implementations and provide valuable insights for improving AI safety alignment in code generation applications.

### Rethinking Memory in LLM based Agents: Representations, Operations, and Emerging Topics
**Authors**: Yiming Du, Wenyu Huang, Danna Zheng, Zhaowei Wang, Sebastien Montella, Mirella Lapata, Kam-Fai Wong, Jeff Z. Pan

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T15:24:04Z

**Summary**: Memory is fundamental to large language model (LLM)-based agents, but existing surveys emphasize application-level use (e.g., personalized dialogue), while overlooking the atomic operations governing memory dynamics. This work categorizes memory into parametric (implicit in model weights) and contextual (explicit external data, structured/unstructured) forms, and defines six core operations: Consolidation, Updating, Indexing, Forgetting, Retrieval, and Condensation. Mapping these dimensions reveals four key research topics: long-term, long-context, parametric modification, and multi-source memory. The taxonomy provides a structured view of memory-related research, benchmarks, and tools, clarifying functional interactions in LLM-based agents and guiding future advancements. The datasets, papers, and tools are publicly available at https://github.com/Elvin-Yiming-Du/Survey_Memory_in_AI.

### Assessing systematic uncertainties from spectral re-analysis of Cyg X-1 with different coronal geometries
**Authors**: Abdurakhmon Nosirov, Jiachen Jiang, Cosimo Bambi, John A. Tomsick

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T15:11:44Z

**Summary**: In this work, we carry out a new spectral reanalysis of NuSTAR and Suzaku observations of the disk reflection spectra in the stellar-mass black hole X-ray binary Cyg~X-1. We compare three types of models: a broken power-law disk emissivity profile with no assumption about the coronal shape used in the previous work of the same observations, a compact lamppost corona, and an extended disk-like corona motivated by recent X-ray polarization results. Our goal is to measure the systematic uncertainties caused by the assumed geometry, with a focus on key parameters such as the black hole spin and the inclination of the inner accretion disk. We find that the disk-like corona gives a fit that is statistically similar to the broken power-law and lamppost models, but it leads to more physically reasonable results, such as a lower inclination angle of about $30^{\circ}$. By using a variable disk density model, we measure the disk density to be $n_{\rm e}\approx10^{20}$\,cm$^{-3}$, which is similar to earlier results. While the extended corona model infers a wider allowed parameter space for black hole spin and the inner radius of the disk-shaped coronal region, this reflects the additional physical freedom of the model. Even so, the disk-like corona remains a strong and physically well-motivated candidate for explaining the X-ray emission from Cyg~X-1.

### Bayesian mixture modeling using a mixture of finite mixtures with normalized inverse Gaussian weights
**Authors**: Fumiya Iwashige, Shintaro Hashimoto

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T15:09:19Z

**Summary**: In Bayesian inference for mixture models with an unknown number of components, a finite mixture model is usually employed that assumes prior distributions for mixing weights and the number of components. This model is called a mixture of finite mixtures (MFM). As a prior distribution for the weights, a (symmetric) Dirichlet distribution is widely used for conjugacy and computational simplicity, while the selection of the concentration parameter influences the estimate of the number of components. In this paper, we focus on estimating the number of components. As a robust alternative Dirichlet weights, we present a method based on a mixture of finite mixtures with normalized inverse Gaussian weights. The motivation is similar to the use of normalized inverse Gaussian processes instead of Dirichlet processes for infinite mixture modeling. Introducing latent variables, the posterior computation is carried out using block Gibbs sampling without using the reversible jump algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated through some numerical experiments and real data examples, including clustering, density estimation, and community detection.

### RoboSafe: Safeguarding Embodied Agents via Executable Safety Logic
**Authors**: Le Wang, Zonghao Ying, Xiao Yang, Quanchen Zou, Zhenfei Yin, Tianlin Li, Jian Yang, Yaodong Yang, Aishan Liu, Xianglong Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T15:01:26Z

**Summary**: Embodied agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly capable of executing complex real-world tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to hazardous instructions that may trigger unsafe behaviors. Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance.

### USE: A Unified Model for Universal Sound Separation and Extraction
**Authors**: Hongyu Wang, Chenda Li, Xin Zhou, Shuai Wang, Yanmin Qian

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T14:57:15Z

**Summary**: Sound separation (SS) and target sound extraction (TSE) are fundamental techniques for addressing complex acoustic scenarios. While existing SS methods struggle with determining the unknown number of sound sources, TSE approaches require precisely specified clues to achieve optimal performance. This paper proposes a unified framework that synergistically combines SS and TSE to overcome their individual limitations. Our architecture employs two complementary components: 1) An Encoder-Decoder Attractor (EDA) network that automatically infers both the source count and corresponding acoustic clues for SS, and 2) A multi-modal fusion network that precisely interprets diverse user-provided clues (acoustic, semantic, or visual) for TSE. Through joint training with cross-task consistency constraints, we establish a unified latent space that bridges both paradigms. During inference, the system adaptively operates in either fully autonomous SS mode or clue-driven TSE mode. Experiments demonstrate remarkable performance in both tasks, with notable improvements of 1.4 dB SDR improvement in SS compared to baseline and 86\% TSE accuracy.

### ChainReaction: Causal Chain-Guided Reasoning for Modular and Explainable Causal-Why Video Question Answering
**Authors**: Paritosh Parmar, Eric Peh, Basura Fernando

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T14:52:45Z

**Summary**: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular paradigm that explicitly decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs, and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that derives answers grounded in these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a scalable method for generating accurate causal chains from existing datasets. We construct human verified causal chains for 46K samples. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine across diverse domains.

### Causal-driven attribution (CDA): Estimating channel influence without user-level data
**Authors**: Georgios Filippou, Boi Mai Quach, Diana Lenghel, Arthur White, Ashish Kumar Jha

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T14:51:12Z

**Summary**: Attribution modelling lies at the heart of marketing effectiveness, yet most existing approaches depend on user-level path data, which are increasingly inaccessible due to privacy regulations and platform restrictions. This paper introduces a Causal-Driven Attribution (CDA) framework that infers channel influence using only aggregated impression-level data, avoiding any reliance on user identifiers or click-path tracking. CDA integrates temporal causal discovery (using PCMCI) with causal effect estimation via a Structural Causal Model to recover directional channel relationships and quantify their contributions to conversions. Using large-scale synthetic data designed to replicate real marketing dynamics, we show that CDA achieves an average relative RMSE of 9.50% when given the true causal graph, and 24.23% when using the predicted graph, demonstrating strong accuracy under correct structure and meaningful signal recovery even under structural uncertainty. CDA captures cross-channel interdependencies while providing interpretable, privacy-preserving attribution insights, offering a scalable and future-proof alternative to traditional path-based models.

### Hearing to Translate: The Effectiveness of Speech Modality Integration into LLMs
**Authors**: Sara Papi, Javier Garcia Gilabert, Zachary Hopton, Vilém Zouhar, Carlos Escolano, Gerard I. Gállego, Jorge Iranzo-Sánchez, Ahrii Kim, Dominik Macháček, Patricia Schmidtova, Maike Züfle

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T14:39:27Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) expand beyond text, integrating speech as a native modality has given rise to SpeechLLMs, which aim to translate spoken language directly, thereby bypassing traditional transcription-based pipelines. Whether this integration improves speech-to-text translation quality over established cascaded architectures, however, remains an open question. We present Hearing to Translate, the first comprehensive test suite rigorously benchmarking 5 state-of-the-art SpeechLLMs against 16 strong direct and cascade systems that couple leading speech foundation models (SFM), with multilingual LLMs. Our analysis spans 16 benchmarks, 13 language pairs, and 9 challenging conditions, including disfluent, noisy, and long-form speech. Across this extensive evaluation, we find that cascaded systems remain the most reliable overall, while current SpeechLLMs only match cascades in selected settings and SFMs lag behind both, highlighting that integrating an LLM, either within the model or in a pipeline, is essential for high-quality speech translation.

### VisRes Bench: On Evaluating the Visual Reasoning Capabilities of VLMs
**Authors**: Brigitta Malagurski Törtei, Yasser Dahou, Ngoc Dung Huynh, Wamiq Reyaz Para, Phúc H. Lê Khac, Ankit Singh, Sofian Chaybouti, Sanath Narayan

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T14:18:38Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. Yet, the extent to which these models perform visual reasoning as opposed to relying on linguistic priors remains unclear. To address this, we introduce VisRes Bench, a benchmark designed to study visual reasoning in naturalistic settings without contextual language supervision. Analyzing model behavior across three levels of complexity, we uncover clear limitations in perceptual and relational visual reasoning capacities. VisRes isolates distinct reasoning abilities across its levels. Level 1 probes perceptual completion and global image matching under perturbations such as blur, texture changes, occlusion, and rotation; Level 2 tests rule-based inference over a single attribute (e.g., color, count, orientation); and Level 3 targets compositional reasoning that requires integrating multiple visual attributes. Across more than 19,000 controlled task images, we find that state-of-the-art VLMs perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations, revealing limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition. We conclude by discussing how VisRes provides a unified framework for advancing abstract visual reasoning in multimodal research.

### FERA: A Pose-Based Semantic Pipeline for Automated Foil Fencing Refereeing
**Authors**: Ziwen Chen, Zhong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T14:04:28Z

**Summary**: Many multimedia tasks map raw video into structured semantic representations for downstream decision-making. Sports officiating is a representative case, where fast, subtle interactions must be judged via symbolic rules. We present FERA (FEncing Referee Assistant), a pose-based framework that turns broadcast foil fencing video into action tokens and rule-grounded explanations. From monocular footage, FERA extracts 2D poses, converts them into a 101-dimensional kinematic representation, and applies an encoder-only transformer (FERA-MDT) to recognize per-fencer footwork, blade actions, and blade-line position. To obtain a consistent single-fencer representation for both athletes, FERA processes each clip and a horizontally flipped copy, yielding time-aligned left/right predictions without requiring a multi-person pose pipeline. A dynamic temporal windowing scheme enables inference on untrimmed pose tracks. These structured predictions serve as tokens for a language model (FERA-LM) that applies simplified right-of-way rules to generate textual decisions. On 1,734 clips (2,386 annotated actions), FERA-MDT achieves a macro-F1 of 0.549 under 5-fold cross-validation, outperforming BiLSTM and TCN baselines. Combined with FERA-LM, the full pipeline recovers referee priority with 77.7% accuracy on 969 exchanges. FERA provides a case-study benchmark for pose-based semantic grounding in a two-person sport and illustrates a general pipeline for connecting video understanding with rule-based reasoning.

### Equivariant Multiscale Learned Invertible Reconstruction for Cone Beam CT: From Simulated to Real Data
**Authors**: Nikita Moriakov, Efstratios Gavves, Jonathan H. Mason, Carmen Seller-Oria, Jonas Teuwen, Jan-Jakob Sonke

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T13:59:43Z

**Summary**: Cone Beam CT (CBCT) is an important imaging modality nowadays, however lower image quality of CBCT compared to more conventional Computed Tomography (CT) remains a limiting factor in CBCT applications. Deep learning reconstruction methods are a promising alternative to classical analytical and iterative reconstruction methods, but applying such methods to CBCT is often difficult due to the lack of ground truth data, memory limitations and the need for fast inference at clinically-relevant resolutions. In this work we propose LIRE++, an end-to-end rotationally-equivariant multiscale learned invertible primal-dual scheme for fast and memory-efficient CBCT reconstruction. Memory optimizations and multiscale reconstruction allow for fast training and inference, while rotational equivariance improves parameter efficiency. LIRE++ was trained on simulated projection data from a fast quasi-Monte Carlo CBCT projection simulator that we developed as well. Evaluated on synthetic data, LIRE++ gave an average improvement of 1 dB in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio over alternative deep learning baselines. On real clinical data, LIRE++ improved the average Mean Absolute Error between the reconstruction and the corresponding planning CT by 10 Hounsfield Units with respect to current proprietary state-of-the-art hybrid deep-learning/iterative method.

### TrackNetV5: Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement and Motion Direction Decoupling for Fast Object Tracking
**Authors**: Haonan Tang, Yanjun Chen, Lezhi Jiang, Qianfei Li, Xinyu Guo

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T13:57:31Z

**Summary**: The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.

### Bootstrapping LLMs via Preference-Based Policy Optimization
**Authors**: Chen Jia

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T13:31:20Z

**Summary**: Bootstrapping large language models (LLMs) through preference-based policy optimization offers a promising direction for aligning model behavior with human preferences without relying on extensive manual annotations. In this work, we propose a novel preference-based policy optimization (PbPO) framework that formulates the learning process as a min-max game between the main policy and a reward model (RM). The RM is constrained within a confidence set derived from preference data to ensure reliable exploitation. Our iterative online algorithm actively collects preference data through guided exploration of the evolving policy, enabling continual self-improvement of both the policy and the RM. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method, establishing high-probability regret bounds for both settings with sequence-level RM and token-level RM, demonstrating its effectiveness in bootstrapping LLMs. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art preference optimization techniques.

### CAKE: Cascading and Adaptive KV Cache Eviction with Layer Preferences
**Authors**: Ziran Qin, Yuchen Cao, Mingbao Lin, Wen Hu, Shixuan Fan, Ke Cheng, Weiyao Lin, Jianguo Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T13:21:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing long sequences, boosting demand for key-value (KV) caching. While recent efforts to evict KV cache have alleviated the inference burden, they often fail to allocate resources rationally across layers with different attention patterns. In this paper, we introduce Cascading and Adaptive KV cache Eviction (CAKE), a novel approach that frames KV cache eviction as a "cake-slicing problem." CAKE assesses layer-specific preferences by considering attention dynamics in both spatial and temporal dimensions, allocates rational cache size for layers accordingly, and manages memory constraints in a cascading manner. This approach enables a global view of cache allocation, adaptively distributing resources across diverse attention mechanisms while maintaining memory budgets. CAKE also employs a new eviction indicator that considers the shifting importance of tokens over time, addressing limitations in existing methods that overlook temporal dynamics. Comprehensive experiments on LongBench and NeedleBench show that CAKE maintains model performance with only 3.2% of the KV cache and consistently outperforms current baselines across various models and memory constraints, particularly in low-memory settings. Additionally, CAKE achieves over 10x speedup in decoding latency compared to full cache when processing contexts of 128K tokens with FlashAttention-2. Our code is available at https://github.com/antgroup/cakekv.

### Coherence in the brain unfolds across separable temporal regimes
**Authors**: Davide Stauba, Finn Rabe, Akhil Misra, Yves Pauli, Roya Hüppi, Ni Yang, Nils Lang, Lars Michels, Victoria Edkins, Sascha Frühholz, Iris Sommer, Wolfram Hinzen, Philipp Homan

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T12:51:11Z

**Summary**: Coherence in language requires the brain to satisfy two competing temporal demands: gradual accumulation of meaning across extended context and rapid reconfiguration of representations at event boundaries. Despite their centrality to language and thought, how these processes are implemented in the human brain during naturalistic listening remains unclear. Here, we tested whether these two processes can be captured by annotation-free drift and shift signals and whether their neural expression dissociates across large-scale cortical systems. These signals were derived from a large language model (LLM) and formalized contextual drift and event shifts directly from the narrative input. To enable high-precision voxelwise encoding models with stable parameter estimates, we densely sampled one healthy adult across more than 7 hours of listening to thirteen crime stories while collecting ultra high-field (7T) BOLD data. We then modeled the feature-informed hemodynamic response using a regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories. Drift predictions were prevalent in default-mode network hubs, whereas shift predictions were evident bilaterally in the primary auditory cortex and language association cortex. Furthermore, activity in default-mode and parietal networks was best explained by a signal capturing how meaning accumulates and gradually fades over the course of the narrative. Together, these findings show that coherence during language comprehension is implemented through dissociable neural regimes of slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reconfiguration, offering a mechanistic entry point for understanding disturbances of language coherence in psychiatric disorders.

### SESR-Eval: Dataset for Evaluating LLMs in the Title-Abstract Screening of Systematic Reviews
**Authors**: Aleksi Huotala, Miikka Kuutila, Mika Mäntylä

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T12:40:01Z

**Summary**: Background: The use of large language models (LLMs) in the title-abstract screening process of systematic reviews (SRs) has shown promising results, but suffers from limited performance evaluation. Aims: Create a benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of LLMs in the title-abstract screening process of SRs. Provide evidence whether using LLMs in title-abstract screening in software engineering is advisable. Method: We start with 169 SR research artifacts and find 24 of those to be suitable for inclusion in the dataset. Using the dataset we benchmark title-abstract screening using 9 LLMs. Results: We present the SESR-Eval (Software Engineering Systematic Review Evaluation) dataset containing 34,528 labeled primary studies, sourced from 24 secondary studies published in software engineering (SE) journals. Most LLMs performed similarly and the differences in screening accuracy between secondary studies are greater than differences between LLMs. The cost of using an LLM is relatively low - less than $40 per secondary study even for the most expensive model. Conclusions: Our benchmark enables monitoring AI performance in the screening task of SRs in software engineering. At present, LLMs are not yet recommended for automating the title-abstract screening process, since accuracy varies widely across secondary studies, and no LLM managed a high recall with reasonable precision. In future, we plan to investigate factors that influence LLM screening performance between studies.

### Intersectional Fairness in Vision-Language Models for Medical Image Disease Classification
**Authors**: Yupeng Zhang, Adam G. Dunn, Usman Naseem, Jinman Kim

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T12:33:48Z

**Summary**: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly multimodal vision-language models (VLM), often exhibit intersectional biases where models are systematically less confident in diagnosing marginalised patient subgroups. Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $Δ$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $Δ$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline). This establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and can perform equitably across diverse patient subgroups, ensuring reliable performance without increasing privacy risks.

### Encrypted Traffic Detection in Resource Constrained IoT Networks: A Diffusion Model and LLM Integrated Framework
**Authors**: Hongjuan Li, Hui Kang, Chenbang Liu, Ruolin Wang, Jiahui Li, Geng Sun, Jiacheng Wang, Shuang Liang, Shiwen Mao

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T12:25:28Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of Internet-of-things (IoT) infrastructures and the widespread adoption of traffic encryption present significant challenges, particularly in environments characterized by dynamic traffic patterns, constrained computational capabilities, and strict latency constraints. In this paper, we propose DMLITE, a diffusion model and large language model (LLM) integrated traffic embedding framework for network traffic detection within resource-limited IoT environments. The DMLITE overcomes these challenges through a tri-phase architecture including traffic visual preprocessing, diffusion-based multi-level feature extraction, and LLM-guided feature optimization. Specifically, the framework utilizes self-supervised diffusion models to capture both fine-grained and abstract patterns in encrypted traffic through multi-level feature fusion and contrastive learning with representative sample selection, thus enabling rapid adaptation to new traffic patterns with minimal labeled data. Furthermore, DMLITE incorporates LLMs to dynamically adjust particle swarm optimization parameters for intelligent feature selection by implementing a dual objective function that minimizes both classification error and variance across data distributions. Comprehensive experimental validation on benchmark datasets confirms the effectiveness of DMLITE, achieving classification accuracies of 98.87\%, 92.61\%, and 99.83\% on USTC-TFC, ISCX-VPN, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively. This improves classification accuracy by an average of 3.7\% and reduces training time by an average of 41.9\% compared to the representative deep learning model.

### Emotion Diffusion in Real and Simulated Social Graphs: Structural Limits of LLM-Based Social Simulation
**Authors**: Qiqi Qiang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T12:14:56Z

**Summary**: Understanding how emotions diffuse through social networks is central to computational social science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to simulate social media interactions, raising the question of whether LLM-generated data can realistically reproduce emotion diffusion patterns observed in real online communities. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison between emotion diffusion in real-world social graphs and in LLM-simulated interaction networks. We construct diffusion graphs from Reddit discussion data and compare them with synthetic social graphs generated through LLM-driven conversational simulations. Emotion states are inferred using established sentiment analysis pipelines, and both real and simulated graphs are analyzed from structural, behavioral, and predictive perspectives. Our results reveal substantial structural and dynamic discrepancies between real and simulated diffusion processes. Real-world emotion diffusion exhibits dense connectivity, repeated interactions, sentiment shifts, and emergent community structures, whereas LLM-simulated graphs largely consist of isolated linear chains with monotonic emotional trajectories. These structural limitations significantly affect downstream tasks such as graph-based emotion prediction, leading to reduced emotional diversity and class imbalance in simulated settings. Our findings highlight current limitations of LLM-based social simulation in capturing the interactive complexity and emotional heterogeneity of real social networks. This work provides empirical evidence for the cautious use of LLM-generated data in social science research and suggests directions for improving future simulation frameworks.

### SparScene: Efficient Traffic Scene Representation via Sparse Graph Learning for Large-Scale Trajectory Generation
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Mo, Jintian Ge, Zifan Wang, Chen Lv, Karl Henrik Johansson

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T12:02:35Z

**Summary**: Multi-agent trajectory generation is a core problem for autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems. However, efficiently modeling the dynamic interactions between numerous road users and infrastructures in complex scenes remains an open problem. Existing methods typically employ distance-based or fully connected dense graph structures to capture interaction information, which not only introduces a large number of redundant edges but also requires complex and heavily parameterized networks for encoding, thereby resulting in low training and inference efficiency, limiting scalability to large and complex traffic scenes. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose SparScene, a sparse graph learning framework designed for efficient and scalable traffic scene representation. Instead of relying on distance thresholds, SparScene leverages the lane graph topology to construct structure-aware sparse connections between agents and lanes, enabling efficient yet informative scene graph representation. SparScene adopts a lightweight graph encoder that efficiently aggregates agent-map and agent-agent interactions, yielding compact scene representations with substantially improved efficiency and scalability. On the motion prediction benchmark of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), SparScene achieves competitive performance with remarkable efficiency. It generates trajectories for more than 200 agents in a scene within 5 ms and scales to more than 5,000 agents and 17,000 lanes with merely 54 ms of inference time with a GPU memory of 2.9 GB, highlighting its superior scalability for large-scale traffic scenes.

### AutoBaxBuilder: Bootstrapping Code Security Benchmarking
**Authors**: Tobias von Arx, Niels Mündler, Mark Vero, Maximilian Baader, Martin Vechev

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T12:02:00Z

**Summary**: As LLMs see wide adoption in software engineering, the reliable assessment of the correctness and security of LLM-generated code is crucial. Notably, prior work has demonstrated that security is often overlooked, exposing that LLMs are prone to generating code with security vulnerabilities. These insights were enabled by specialized benchmarks, crafted through significant manual effort by security experts. However, relying on manually-crafted benchmarks is insufficient in the long term, because benchmarks (i) naturally end up contaminating training data, (ii) must extend to new tasks to provide a more complete picture, and (iii) must increase in difficulty to challenge more capable LLMs. In this work, we address these challenges and present AutoBaxBuilder, a framework that generates tasks and tests for code security benchmarking from scratch. We introduce a robust pipeline with fine-grained plausibility checks, leveraging the code understanding capabilities of LLMs to construct functionality tests and end-to-end security-probing exploits. To confirm the quality of the generated benchmark, we conduct both a qualitative analysis and perform quantitative experiments, comparing it against tasks constructed by human experts. We use AutoBaxBuilder to construct entirely new tasks and release them to the public as AutoBaxBench, together with a thorough evaluation of the security capabilities of LLMs on these tasks. We find that a new task can be generated in under 2 hours, costing less than USD 10.

### Active inference and artificial reasoning
**Authors**: Karl Friston, Lancelot Da Costa, Alexander Tschantz, Conor Heins, Christopher Buckley, Tim Verbelen, Thomas Parr

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:59:36Z

**Summary**: This technical note considers the sampling of outcomes that provide the greatest amount of information about the structure of underlying world models. This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a 'three-ball' paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and 'aha moments' via (synthetic) introspection or sleep. We focus on the sample efficiency afforded by seeking outcomes that resolve the greatest uncertainty about the world model, under which outcomes are generated.

### A Real-World Evaluation of LLM Medication Safety Reviews in NHS Primary Care
**Authors**: Oliver Normand, Esther Borsi, Mitch Fruin, Lauren E Walker, Jamie Heagerty, Chris C. Holmes, Anthony J Avery, Iain E Buchan, Harry Coppock

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:58:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often match or exceed clinician-level performance on medical benchmarks, yet very few are evaluated on real clinical data or examined beyond headline metrics. We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\% [95\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\% [95\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\% [95\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations. We provide 45 detailed vignettes that comprehensively cover all identified failure cases. This work highlights shortcomings that must be addressed before LLM-based clinical AI can be safely deployed. It also begs larger-scale, prospective evaluations and deeper study of LLM behaviours in clinical contexts.

### MarineEval: Assessing the Marine Intelligence of Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: YuK-Kwan Wong, Tuan-An To, Jipeng Zhang, Ziqiang Zheng, Sai-Kit Yeung

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:57:50Z

**Summary**: We have witnessed promising progress led by large language models (LLMs) and further vision language models (VLMs) in handling various queries as a general-purpose assistant. VLMs, as a bridge to connect the visual world and language corpus, receive both visual content and various text-only user instructions to generate corresponding responses. Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs. During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements. We hope our new benchmark and observations will facilitate future research. Project Page: http://marineeval.hkustvgd.com/

### ClarifyMT-Bench: Benchmarking and Improving Multi-Turn Clarification for Conversational Large Language Models
**Authors**: Sichun Luo, Yi Huang, Mukai Li, Shichang Meng, Fengyuan Liu, Zefa Hu, Junlan Feng, Qi Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:39:00Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as conversational assistants in open-domain, multi-turn settings, where users often provide incomplete or ambiguous information. However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions. ClarifyMT-Bench establishes a reproducible foundation for studying when LLMs should ask, when they should answer, and how to navigate ambiguity in real-world human-LLM interactions.

### STLDM: Spatio-Temporal Latent Diffusion Model for Precipitation Nowcasting
**Authors**: Shi Quan Foo, Chi-Ho Wong, Zhihan Gao, Dit-Yan Yeung, Ka-Hing Wong, Wai-Kin Wong

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:34:44Z

**Summary**: Precipitation nowcasting is a critical spatio-temporal prediction task for society to prevent severe damage owing to extreme weather events. Despite the advances in this field, the complex and stochastic nature of this task still poses challenges to existing approaches. Specifically, deterministic models tend to produce blurry predictions while generative models often struggle with poor accuracy. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective model architecture termed STLDM, a diffusion-based model that learns the latent representation from end to end alongside both the Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network. STLDM decomposes this task into two stages: a deterministic forecasting stage handled by the conditioning network, and an enhancement stage performed by the latent diffusion model. Experimental results on multiple radar datasets demonstrate that STLDM achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art, while also improving inference efficiency. The code is available in https://github.com/sqfoo/stldm_official.

### Large lepton asymmetry from axion inflation and helium abundance hinted by ACT
**Authors**: Di Wu, Yifan Hu, Kohei Kamada

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:34:28Z

**Summary**: The generation of helical magnetic fields and the associated chiral asymmetry via the chiral anomaly is a generic feature in pseudoscalar inflation. In the presence of a Chern--Simons coupling between the inflaton and a U(1) gauge field, the homogeneous evolution of the inflaton induces a tachyonic instability in one circular polarization of the gauge field, resulting in the production of helical magnetic fields. In this work, we show that, in the case of a gauged lepton flavor symmetry, U(1)$_{L_i-L_j}$, this mechanism can lead to the generation of a sizable lepton asymmetry. In a simple setup, however, the resulting lepton asymmetry is typically too small to have an observational consequences, even setting aside constraints from baryon overproduction via sphaleron processes, due to the backreaction of the produced gauge fields and fermions on the inflationary dynamics. We demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by implementing a mechanism to suppress fermion production during inflation. As a result, a much larger lepton asymmetry can be generated from the subsequent decay of magnetic helicity. Remarkably, for the gauged U(1)$_{L_μ-L_τ}$ symmetry, the generated asymmetry can be sufficiently large to suppress the primordial helium abundance, as may be inferred from recent cosmic microwave background observations by ACT.

### Sequence to Sequence Reward Modeling: Improving RLHF by Language Feedback
**Authors**: Jiayi Zhou, Jiaming Ji, Juntao Dai, Dong Li, Yaodong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:32:24Z

**Summary**: Aligning the behavior of Large language models (LLMs) with human intentions and values remains a critical challenge. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) aligns LLMs by training a reward model (RM) on human preferences and fine-tuning the LLMs to maximize RM feedback. Despite its effectiveness and popularity, RLHF is prone to biased local optimization. It means RM fails to provide feedback that accurately aligns with human preference, causing LLMs to explore unexpected generalizations, and failing to achieve alignment objectives. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel \textit{sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) reward modeling} method. Its key insight is that learning from language feedback rather than scalar feedback improves RLHF without additional annotations. We replaced the reward modeling target from binary maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with sequence MLE. This method enables richer and fine-grained language feedback without additional annotations, models, or training stages. Our experiments demonstrated its effectiveness, specifically, reducing the refusal-to-response paradigm in single-turn safety dialogues and the long-response bias in text summarization tasks. We provide further analysis that seq2seq RM improves RLHF performance across 2B and 7B LLMs on 3 NLP tasks, achieving an average win rate of 76.9\%. We further show that seq2seq RM can still improve the performance of RLHF under out-of-distribution prompts.

### Beyond Consensus: Mitigating the Agreeableness Bias in LLM Judge Evaluations
**Authors**: Suryaansh Jain, Umair Z. Ahmed, Shubham Sahai, Ben Leong

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:22:59Z

**Summary**: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw: LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often leads to inflated reliability scores.   While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366 high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

### From ANN to BNN: Inferring Reionization Parameters using Uncertainty-aware Emulators of 21-cm Summaries
**Authors**: Yashrajsinh Mahida, Sanjay Kumar Yadav, Suman Majumdar, Leon Noble, Chandra Shekhar Murmu, Saswata Dasgupta, Sohini Dutta, Himanshu Tiwari, Abinash Kumar Shaw

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:19:01Z

**Summary**: Inferring astrophysical parameters from radio interferometric observations of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a challenging yet crucial task. The 21-cm signal from EoR is expected to be highly non-Gaussian; therefore, we need to use higher-order statistics, e.g., bispectrum. Moreover, the forward modeling of the signal and its statistics for a varying set of model parameters requires rerunning the simulations many times, which is computationally very expensive. To overcome this challenge, many artificial neural network (ANN) based emulators have been introduced, which produce the 21-cm summaries in a fraction of the time. However, ANN emulators have a drawback: they can only produce point-value predictions; thus, they fail to capture the uncertainty associated with their predictions. Therefore, when such emulators are used in the Bayesian inference pipeline, they cannot naturally propagate their prediction uncertainties to the estimated model parameters. To address this problem, we have developed Bayesian neural network (BNN) emulators for the 21-cm signal statistics, which provide the posterior distribution of the predicted signal statistics, including their prediction uncertainty. We use these BNN emulators in our Bayesian inference pipeline to infer the EoR parameters through 21-cm summaries of the mock observation of 21-cm signal with telescopic noise for $1000$ hr of SKA-LOW observation. We show that BNN emulators can capture the prediction uncertainty for the 21-cm power spectrum and bispectrum, and using these emulators in the inference pipeline provides better and tighter constraints on them. We reduced the training dataset and showed that, for smaller training datasets, BNN outperforms the ANN emulators. We also show that using the bispectrum as a summary statistic gives better constraints on EoR parameters than the power spectrum.

### Beyond Context: Large Language Models Failure to Grasp Users Intent
**Authors**: Ahmed M. Hussain, Salahuddin Salahuddin, Panos Papadimitratos

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:15:57Z

**Summary**: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) safety approaches focus on explicitly harmful content while overlooking a critical vulnerability: the inability to understand context and recognize user intent. This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms. We empirically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases. This pattern reveals that current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities. These limitations require paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc protective mechanisms.

### Semi-Supervised Learning for Large Language Models Safety and Content Moderation
**Authors**: Eduard Stefan Dinuta, Iustin Sirbu, Traian Rebedea

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:12:09Z

**Summary**: Safety for Large Language Models (LLMs) has been an ongoing research focus since their emergence and is even more relevant nowadays with the increasing capacity of those models. Currently, there are several guardrails in place for all public LLMs and multiple proposed datasets for training safety classifiers. However, training these safety classifiers relies on large quantities of labeled data, which can be problematic to acquire, prone to labeling errors, or often include synthetic data. To address these issues, we suggest a different approach: utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, to improve the performance on the safety task. We analyze the improvements that these techniques can offer for both prompts given to Large Language Models and the responses to those requests. Moreover, since augmentation is the central part of semi-supervised algorithms, we demonstrate the importance of using task-specific augmentations, which significantly increase the performance when compared to general-purpose augmentation techniques.

### Semantic Refinement with LLMs for Graph Representations
**Authors**: Safal Thapaliya, Zehong Wang, Jiazheng Li, Ziming Li, Yanfang Ye, Chuxu Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:10:28Z

**Summary**: Graph-structured data exhibit substantial heterogeneity in where their predictive signals originate: in some domains, node-level semantics dominate, while in others, structural patterns play a central role. This structure-semantics heterogeneity implies that no graph learning model with a fixed inductive bias can generalize optimally across diverse graph domains. However, most existing methods address this challenge from the model side by incrementally injecting new inductive biases, which remains fundamentally limited given the open-ended diversity of real-world graphs. In this work, we take a data-centric perspective and treat node semantics as a task-adaptive variable. We propose a Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement framework DAS for graph representation learning, which couples a fixed graph neural network (GNN) and a large language model (LLM) in a closed feedback loop. The GNN provides implicit supervisory signals to guide the semantic refinement of LLM, and the refined semantics are fed back to update the same graph learner. We evaluate our approach on both text-rich and text-free graphs. Results show consistent improvements on structure-dominated graphs while remaining competitive on semantics-rich graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-centric semantic adaptation under structure-semantics heterogeneity.

### FreeInpaint: Tuning-free Prompt Alignment and Visual Rationality Enhancement in Image Inpainting
**Authors**: Chao Gong, Dong Li, Yingwei Pan, Jingjing Chen, Ting Yao, Tao Mei

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:06:26Z

**Summary**: Text-guided image inpainting endeavors to generate new content within specified regions of images using textual prompts from users. The primary challenge is to accurately align the inpainted areas with the user-provided prompts while maintaining a high degree of visual fidelity. While existing inpainting methods have produced visually convincing results by leveraging the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, they still struggle to uphold both prompt alignment and visual rationality simultaneously. In this work, we introduce FreeInpaint, a plug-and-play tuning-free approach that directly optimizes the diffusion latents on the fly during inference to improve the faithfulness of the generated images. Technically, we introduce a prior-guided noise optimization method that steers model attention towards valid inpainting regions by optimizing the initial noise. Furthermore, we meticulously design a composite guidance objective tailored specifically for the inpainting task. This objective efficiently directs the denoising process, enhancing prompt alignment and visual rationality by optimizing intermediate latents at each step. Through extensive experiments involving various inpainting diffusion models and evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed FreeInpaint.

### Hierarchical Modeling Approach to Fast and Accurate Table Recognition
**Authors**: Takaya Kawakatsu

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T09:58:30Z

**Summary**: The extraction and use of diverse knowledge from numerous documents is a pressing challenge in intelligent information retrieval. Documents contain elements that require different recognition methods. Table recognition typically consists of three subtasks, namely table structure, cell position and cell content recognition. Recent models have achieved excellent recognition with a combination of multi-task learning, local attention, and mutual learning. However, their effectiveness has not been fully explained, and they require a long period of time for inference. This paper presents a novel multi-task model that utilizes non-causal attention to capture the entire table structure, and a parallel inference algorithm for faster cell content inference. The superiority is demonstrated both visually and statistically on two large public datasets.

### LLM Personas as a Substitute for Field Experiments in Method Benchmarking
**Authors**: Enoch Hyunwook Kang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T09:56:00Z

**Summary**: Field experiments (A/B tests) are often the most credible benchmark for methods in societal systems, but their cost and latency create a major bottleneck for iterative method development. LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.

### Defining Cost Function of Steganography with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Hanzhou Wu, Yige Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T09:53:41Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we make the first attempt towards defining cost function of steganography with large language models (LLMs), which is totally different from previous works that rely heavily on expert knowledge or require large-scale datasets for cost learning. To achieve this goal, a two-stage strategy combining LLM-guided program synthesis with evolutionary search is applied in the proposed method. In the first stage, a certain number of cost functions in the form of computer programs are synthesized from LLM responses to structured prompts. These cost functions are then evaluated with pretrained steganalysis models so that candidate cost functions suited to steganography can be collected. In the second stage, by retraining a steganalysis model for each candidate cost function, the optimal cost function(s) can be determined according to the detection accuracy. This two-stage strategy is performed by an iterative fashion so that the best cost function can be collected at the last iteration. Experiments show that the proposed method enables LLMs to design new cost functions of steganography that significantly outperform existing works in terms of resisting steganalysis tools, which verifies the superiority of the proposed method. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first work applying LLMs to the design of advanced cost function of steganography, which presents a novel perspective for steganography design and may shed light on further research.

### Blurb-Refined Inference from Crowdsourced Book Reviews using Hierarchical Genre Mining with Dual-Path Graph Convolutions
**Authors**: Suraj Kumar, Utsav Kumar Nareti, Soumi Chattopadhyay, Chandranath Adak, Prolay Mallick

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T09:49:56Z

**Summary**: Accurate book genre classification is fundamental to digital library organization, content discovery, and personalized recommendation. Existing approaches typically model genre prediction as a flat, single-label task, ignoring hierarchical genre structure and relying heavily on noisy, subjective user reviews, which often degrade classification reliability. We propose HiGeMine, a two-phase hierarchical genre mining framework that robustly integrates user reviews with authoritative book blurbs. In the first phase, HiGeMine employs a zero-shot semantic alignment strategy to filter reviews, retaining only those semantically consistent with the corresponding blurb, thereby mitigating noise, bias, and irrelevance. In the second phase, we introduce a dual-path, two-level graph-based classification architecture: a coarse-grained Level-1 binary classifier distinguishes fiction from non-fiction, followed by Level-2 multi-label classifiers for fine-grained genre prediction. Inter-genre dependencies are explicitly modeled using a label co-occurrence graph, while contextual representations are derived from pretrained language models applied to the filtered textual content. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we curate a new hierarchical book genre dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiGeMine consistently outperformed strong baselines across hierarchical genre classification tasks. The proposed framework offers a principled and effective solution for leveraging both structured and unstructured textual data in hierarchical book genre analysis.

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T09:40:00Z

**Summary**: Code generation has emerged as a critical research area at the intersection of Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), attracting significant attention from both academia and industry. Within this broader landscape, Verilog, as a representative hardware description language (HDL), plays a fundamental role in digital circuit design and verification, making its automated generation particularly significant for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Consequently, recent research has increasingly focused on applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to Verilog code generation, particularly at the Register Transfer Level (RTL), exploring how these AI-driven techniques can be effectively integrated into hardware design workflows. Despite substantial research efforts have explored LLM applications in this domain, a comprehensive survey synthesizing these developments remains absent from the literature. This review fill addresses this gap by providing a systematic literature review of LLM-based methods for Verilog code generation, examining their effectiveness, limitations, and potential for advancing automated hardware design. The review encompasses research work from conferences and journals in the fields of SE, AI, and EDA, encompassing 70 papers published on venues, along with 32 high-quality preprint papers, bringing the total to 102 papers. By answering four key research questions, we aim to (1) identify the LLMs used for Verilog generation, (2) examine the datasets and metrics employed in evaluation, (3) categorize the techniques proposed for Verilog generation, and (4) analyze LLM alignment approaches for Verilog generation. Based on our findings, we have identified a series of limitations of existing studies. Finally, we have outlined a roadmap highlighting potential opportunities for future research endeavors in LLM-assisted hardware design.

### Agentic Explainable Artificial Intelligence (Agentic XAI) Approach To Explore Better Explanation
**Authors**: Tomoaki Yamaguchi, Yutong Zhou, Masahiro Ryo, Keisuke Katsura

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T09:19:15Z

**Summary**: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.

### Cognitive Constructivism and the Epistemic Significance of Sharp Statistical Hypotheses in Natural Sciences
**Authors**: J. M. Stern

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T09:07:31Z

**Summary**: This book presents our case in defense of a constructivist epistemological framework and the use of compatible statistical theory and inference tools. The basic metaphor of decision theory is the maximization of a gambler's expected fortune, according to his own subjective utility, prior beliefs an learned experiences. This metaphor has proven to be very useful, leading the development of Bayesian statistics since its XX-th century revival, rooted on the work of de Finetti, Savage and others. The basic metaphor presented in this text, as a foundation for cognitive constructivism, is that of an eigen-solution, and the verification of its objective epistemic status. The FBST - Full Bayesian Significance Test - is the cornerstone of a set of statistical tolls conceived to assess the epistemic value of such eigen-solutions, according to their four essential attributes, namely, sharpness, stability, separability and composability. We believe that this alternative perspective, complementary to the one ofered by decision theory, can provide powerful insights and make pertinent contributions in the context of scientific research.

**Authors**: Jingjing Qu, Kejia Hu, Jun Zhu, Yulei Ye, Wenhao Li, Teng Wang, Zhiyun Chen, Chaochao Lu, Aimin Zhou, Xiangfeng Wang, Xia Hu, James Evans

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:52:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable unprecedented social science experimentation by creating controlled hybrid human-AI environments. We introduce Epitome (www.epitome-ai.com), an open experimental platform that operationalizes this paradigm through Matrix-like social worlds where researchers can study isolated human subjects and groups interacting with LLM agents. This maintains ecological validity while enabling precise manipulation of social dynamics. Epitome approaches three frontiers: (1) methodological innovation using LLM confederates to reduce complexity while scaling interactions; (2) empirical investigation of human behavior in AI-saturated environments; and (3) exploration of emergent properties in hybrid collectives. Drawing on interdisciplinary foundations from management, communication, sociology, psychology, and ethics, the platform's modular architecture spans foundation model deployment through data collection. We validate Epitome through replication of three seminal experiments, demonstrating capacity to generate robust findings while reducing experimental complexity. This tool provides crucial insights for understanding how humans navigate AI-mediated social realities, knowledge essential for policy, education, and human-centered AI design.

### Rethinking Direct Preference Optimization in Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Junyong Kang, Seohyun Lim, Kyungjune Baek, Hyunjung Shim

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:49:27Z

**Summary**: Aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences has emerged as a critical research challenge. While recent advances in this area have extended preference optimization techniques from large language models (LLMs) to the diffusion setting, they often struggle with limited exploration. In this work, we propose a novel and orthogonal approach to enhancing diffusion-based preference optimization. First, we introduce a stable reference model update strategy that relaxes the frozen reference model, encouraging exploration while maintaining a stable optimization anchor through reference model regularization. Second, we present a timestep-aware training strategy that mitigates the reward scale imbalance problem across timesteps. Our method can be integrated into various preference optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that our approach improves the performance of state-of-the-art methods on human preference evaluation benchmarks. The code is available at the Github: https://github.com/kaist-cvml/RethinkingDPO_Diffusion_Models.

### Making AI Work: An Autoethnography of a Workaround in Higher Education
**Authors**: Shang Chieh Lee, Bhuva Narayan, Simon Buckingham Shum, Stella Ng, A. Baki Kocaballi

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:48:18Z

**Summary**: Research on the implementation of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in higher education often focuses on strategic goals, overlooking the hidden, and often politically charged, labour required to make it functional. This paper provides an insider's account of the sociotechnical friction that arises when an institutional goal of empowering non-technical staff conflicts with the technical limitations of enterprise Large Language Models (LLMs). Through analytic autoethnography, this study examines a GenAI project pushed to an impasse, focusing on a workaround developed to navigate not only technical constraints but also the combined challenge of organisational territoriality and assertions of positional power. Drawing upon Alter's (2014) theory of workarounds, the analysis interprets "articulation work" as a form of "invisible labour". By engaging with the Information Systems (IS) domains of user innovation and technology-in-practice, this study argues that such user-driven workarounds should be understood not as deviations, but as integral acts of sociotechnical integration. This integration, however, highlights the central paradoxes of modern GenAI where such workarounds for "unfinished" systems can simultaneously create unofficial "shadow" systems and obscure the crucial, yet invisible, sociotechnical labour involved. The findings suggest that the invisible labour required to integrate GenAI within complex organisational politics is an important, rather than peripheral, component of how it becomes functional in practice.

### Stochastic activations

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:45:34Z

**Summary**: We introduce stochastic activations. This novel strategy randomly selects between several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large language model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a Bernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated with RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the gradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways:   (1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors. This reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup on CPU and GPU. This leads to better results than training from scratch with the RELU activation function.   (2) We evaluate stochastic activations for sequence generation. This strategy performs reasonably well: it has higher diversity and has only slightly inferior performance to the best deterministic non-linearity, SILU, combined with temperature sampling. This provides an alternative way to increase the diversity of generated text.

### Case Prompting to Mitigate Large Language Model Bias for ICU Mortality Prediction
**Authors**: Gangxiong Zhang, Yongchao Long, Yong Zhang, Yuxi Zhou, Shenda Hong

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:34:41Z

**Summary**: Accurate mortality risk prediction for intensive care unit (ICU) patients is essential for clinical decision-making. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction, and that a carefully designed prompting framework can effectively co-optimize fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support.

### Redefining Information Theory: From Quantization and Rate--Distortion to a Foundational Mathematical Framework
**Authors**: Bruno Macchiavello

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:31:48Z

**Summary**: This paper redefines information theory as a foundational mathematical discipline, extending beyond its traditional role in engineering applications. Building on Shannon's entropy, rate'--distortion theory, and Wyner'--Ziv coding, we show that all optimization methods can be interpreted as projections of continuous information onto discrete binary spaces. Numbers are not intrinsic carriers of meaning but codes of information, with binary digits (0 and 1) serving as universal symbols sufficient for all mathematical structures. Rate'--distortion optimization via Lagrangian multipliers connects quantization error directly to fundamental limits of representation, while Wyner'--Ziv coding admits a path integral interpretation over probability manifolds, unifying quantization, inference, geometry, and error. We further extend this framework into category theory, topological data analysis, and universal coding, situating computation and game theory as complementary perspectives. The result is a set of postulates that elevate information theory to the status of a universal mathematical language.

### zkFL-Health: Blockchain-Enabled Zero-Knowledge Federated Learning for Medical AI Privacy
**Authors**: Savvy Sharma, George Petrovic, Sarthak Kaushik

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:29:28Z

**Summary**: Healthcare AI needs large, diverse datasets, yet strict privacy and governance constraints prevent raw data sharing across institutions. Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by training where data reside and exchanging only model updates, but practical deployments still face two core risks: (1) privacy leakage via gradients or updates (membership inference, gradient inversion) and (2) trust in the aggregator, a single point of failure that can drop, alter, or inject contributions undetected. We present zkFL-Health, an architecture that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deliver privacy-preserving, verifiably correct collaborative training for medical AI. Clients locally train and commit their updates; the aggregator operates within a TEE to compute the global update and produces a succinct ZK proof (via Halo2/Nova) that it used exactly the committed inputs and the correct aggregation rule, without revealing any client update to the host. Verifier nodes validate the proof and record cryptographic commitments on-chain, providing an immutable audit trail and removing the need to trust any single party. We outline system and threat models tailored to healthcare, the zkFL-Health protocol, security/privacy guarantees, and a performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost. This framework enables multi-institutional medical AI with strong confidentiality, integrity, and auditability, key properties for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance.

### Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable yet Noisy Rewards under Imperfect Verifiers
**Authors**: Xin-Qiang Cai, Wei Wang, Feng Liu, Tongliang Liu, Gang Niu, Masashi Sugiyama

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:25:26Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) replaces costly human labeling with automated verifiers. To reduce verifier hacking, many RLVR systems binarize rewards to $\{0,1\}$, but imperfect verifiers inevitably introduce \emph{false negatives} (rejecting correct answers) and \emph{false positives} (accepting incorrect ones). We formalize verifier unreliability as a stochastic reward channel with asymmetric noise rates $ρ_0$ and $ρ_1$ -- the FP rate and the FN rate, respectively. From this abstraction we derive two lightweight corrections: (i) a \emph{backward} correction that yields an unbiased surrogate reward and thus an unbiased policy-gradient estimator in expectation, and (ii) a \emph{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so the expected update aligns with the clean gradient direction and requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group relative policy optimization pipeline, both corrections improve RLVR for math reasoning under synthetic and real verifier noise, with the forward variant being more stable under heavier noise. Finally, an appeals mechanism with a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate online and further improves performance.

### Tracing Energy Flow: Learning Tactile-based Grasping Force Control to Prevent Slippage in Dynamic Object Interaction
**Authors**: Cheng-Yu Kuo, Hirofumi Shin, Takamitsu Matsubara

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:19:25Z

**Summary**: Regulating grasping force to reduce slippage during dynamic object interaction remains a fundamental challenge in robotic manipulation, especially when objects are manipulated by multiple rolling contacts, have unknown properties (such as mass or surface conditions), and when external sensing is unreliable. In contrast, humans can quickly regulate grasping force by touch, even without visual cues. Inspired by this ability, we aim to enable robotic hands to rapidly explore objects and learn tactile-driven grasping force control under motion and limited sensing. We propose a physics-informed energy abstraction that models the object as a virtual energy container. The inconsistency between the fingers' applied power and the object's retained energy provides a physically grounded signal for inferring slip-aware stability. Building on this abstraction, we employ model-based learning and planning to efficiently model energy dynamics from tactile sensing and perform real-time grasping force optimization. Experiments in both simulation and hardware demonstrate that our method can learn grasping force control from scratch within minutes, effectively reduce slippage, and extend grasp duration across diverse motion-object pairs, all without relying on external sensing or prior object knowledge.

### Hillclimb-Causal Inference: A Data-Driven Approach to Identify Causal Pathways Among Parental Behaviors, Genetic Risk, and Externalizing Behaviors in Children
**Authors**: Mengman Wei, Qian Peng

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:10:23Z

**Summary**: Motivation: Externalizing behaviors in children, such as aggression, hyperactivity, and defiance, are influenced by complex interplays between genetic predispositions and environmental factors, particularly parental behaviors. Unraveling these intricate causal relationships can benefit from the use of robust data-driven methods.   Methods: We developed a method called Hillclimb-Causal Inference, a causal discovery approach that integrates the Hill Climb Search algorithm with a customized Linear Gaussian Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This method was applied to data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, which included parental behavior assessments, children's genotypes, and externalizing behavior measures. We performed dimensionality reduction to address multicollinearity among parental behaviors and assessed children's genetic risk for externalizing disorders using polygenic risk scores (PRS), which were computed based on GWAS summary statistics from independent cohorts. Once the causal pathways were identified, we employed structural equation modeling (SEM) to quantify the relationships within the model.   Results: We identified prominent causal pathways linking parental behaviors to children's externalizing outcomes. Parental alcohol misuse and broader behavioral issues exhibited notably stronger direct effects (0.33 and 0.20, respectively) compared to children's polygenic risk scores (0.07). Moreover, when considering both direct and indirect paths, parental substance misuse (alcohol, drug, and tobacco) collectively resulted in a total effect exceeding 1.1 on externalizing behaviors. Bootstrap and sensitivity analyses further validated the robustness of these findings.

### When LLMs fall short in Deductive Coding: Model Comparison and Human AI Collaboration Workflow Design
**Authors**: Zijian Li, Luzhen Tang, Mengyu Xia, Xinyu Li, Naping Chen, Dragan Gašević, Yizhou Fan

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:10:02Z

**Summary**: With generative artificial intelligence driving the growth of dialogic data in education, automated coding is a promising direction for learning analytics to improve efficiency. This surge highlights the need to understand the nuances of student-AI interactions, especially those rare yet crucial. However, automated coding may struggle to capture these rare codes due to imbalanced data, while human coding remains time-consuming and labour-intensive. The current study examined the potential of large language models (LLMs) to approximate or replace humans in deductive, theory-driven coding, while also exploring how human-AI collaboration might support such coding tasks at scale. We compared the coding performance of small transformer classifiers (e.g., BERT) and LLMs in two datasets, with particular attention to imbalanced head-tail distributions in dialogue codes. Our results showed that LLMs did not outperform BERT-based models and exhibited systematic errors and biases in deductive coding tasks. We designed and evaluated a human-AI collaborative workflow that improved coding efficiency while maintaining coding reliability. Our findings reveal both the limitations of LLMs -- especially their difficulties with semantic similarity and theoretical interpretations and the indispensable role of human judgment -- while demonstrating the practical promise of human-AI collaborative workflows for coding.

### Agentic Multi-Persona Framework for Evidence-Aware Fake News Detection
**Authors**: Roopa Bukke, Soumya Pandey, Suraj Kumar, Soumi Chattopadhyay, Chandranath Adak

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:06:52Z

**Summary**: The rapid proliferation of online misinformation poses significant risks to public trust, policy, and safety, necessitating reliable automated fake news detection. Existing methods often struggle with multimodal content, domain generalization, and explainability. We propose AMPEND-LS, an agentic multi-persona evidence-grounded framework with LLM-SLM synergy for multimodal fake news detection. AMPEND-LS integrates textual, visual, and contextual signals through a structured reasoning pipeline powered by LLMs, augmented with reverse image search, knowledge graph paths, and persuasion strategy analysis. To improve reliability, we introduce a credibility fusion mechanism combining semantic similarity, domain trustworthiness, and temporal context, and a complementary SLM classifier to mitigate LLM uncertainty and hallucinations. Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMPEND-LS consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy, F1 score, and robustness. Qualitative case studies further highlight its transparent reasoning and resilience against evolving misinformation. This work advances the development of adaptive, explainable, and evidence-aware systems for safeguarding online information integrity.

### Thinking-Free Policy Initialization Makes Distilled Reasoning Models More Effective and Efficient Reasoners
**Authors**: Xin Xu, Cliveb AI, Kai Yang, Tianhao Chen, Yang Wang, Saiyong Yang, Can Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:05:31Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training, leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce **T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation, explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling, and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0% accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

### Larger Is Not Always Better: Leveraging Structured Code Diffs for Comment Inconsistency Detection
**Authors**: Phong Nguyen, Anh M. T. Bui, Phuong T. Nguyen

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:58:28Z

**Summary**: Ensuring semantic consistency between source code and its accompanying comments is crucial for program comprehension, effective debugging, and long-term maintainability. Comment inconsistency arises when developers modify code but neglect to update the corresponding comments, potentially misleading future maintainers and introducing errors. Recent approaches to code-comment inconsistency (CCI) detection leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and rely on capturing the semantic relationship between code changes and outdated comments. However, they often ignore the structural complexity of code evolution, including historical change activities, and introduce privacy and resource challenges. In this paper, we propose a Just-In-Time CCI detection approach built upon the CodeT5+ backbone. Our method decomposes code changes into ordered sequences of modification activities such as replacing, deleting, and adding to more effectively capture the correlation between these changes and the corresponding outdated comments. Extensive experiments conducted on publicly available benchmark datasets-JITDATA and CCIBENCH--demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art models by up to 13.54% in F1-Score and achieves an improvement ranging from 4.18% to 10.94% over fine-tuned LLMs including DeepSeek-Coder, CodeLlama and Qwen2.5-Coder.

### Multi-Attribute guided Thermal Face Image Translation based on Latent Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Mingshu Cai, Osamu Yoshie, Yuya Ieiri

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:55:54Z

**Summary**: Modern surveillance systems increasingly rely on multi-wavelength sensors and deep neural networks to recognize faces in infrared images captured at night. However, most facial recognition models are trained on visible light datasets, leading to substantial performance degradation on infrared inputs due to significant domain shifts. Early feature-based methods for infrared face recognition proved ineffective, prompting researchers to adopt generative approaches that convert infrared images into visible light images for improved recognition. This paradigm, known as Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR), faces challenges such as model and modality discrepancies, leading to distortion and feature loss in generated images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel latent diffusion-based model designed to generate high-quality visible face images from thermal inputs while preserving critical identity features. A multi-attribute classifier is incorporated to extract key facial attributes from visible images, mitigating feature loss during infrared-to-visible image restoration. Additionally, we propose the Self-attn Mamba module, which enhances global modeling of cross-modal features and significantly improves inference speed. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both image quality and identity preservation.

### Learning the Macroeconomic Language
**Authors**: Siddhartha Chib, Fei Tan

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:55:31Z

**Summary**: We show how state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), seemingly inapplicable to the small samples typical of macroeconomics, can be trained to learn the language of macroeconomy. We estimate a large-scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model on an initial segment of the data and obtain a posterior distribution over structural parameters. We sample from this posterior to generate millions of theory-consistent synthetic panels that, when mixed with actual macroeconomic data, form the training corpus for a time-series transformer with attention. The trained model is then used to forecast out-of-sample through 2025. The results show that this hybrid forecaster, which combines the theoretical coherence of DSGE models with the representational power of modern LLMs, successfully learns the macroeconomic language.

### Artificial or Just Artful? Do LLMs Bend the Rules in Programming?
**Authors**: Oussama Ben Sghaier, Kevin Delcourt, Houari Sahraoui

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:51:15Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation, yet their apparent successes often mask a tension between pretraining objectives and alignment choices. While pretraining encourages models to exploit all available signals to maximize success, alignment, whether through fine-tuning or prompting, may restrict their use. This conflict is especially salient in agentic AI settings, for instance when an agent has access to unit tests that, although intended for validation, act as strong contextual signals that can be leveraged regardless of explicit prohibitions. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs adapt their code generation strategies when exposed to test cases under different prompting conditions. Using the BigCodeBench (Hard) dataset, we design five prompting conditions that manipulate test visibility and impose explicit or implicit restrictions on their use. We evaluate five LLMs (four open-source and one closed-source) across correctness, code similarity, program size, and code churn, and analyze cross-model consistency to identify recurring adaptation strategies. Our results show that test visibility dramatically alters performance, correctness nearly doubles for some models, while explicit restrictions or partial exposure only partially mitigate this effect. Beyond raw performance, we identify four recurring adaptation strategies, with test-driven refinement emerging as the most frequent. These results highlight how LLMs adapt their behavior when exposed to contextual signals that conflict with explicit instructions, providing useful insight into how models reconcile pretraining objectives with alignment constraints.

### Learning to Compress: Unlocking the Potential of Large Language Models for Text Representation
**Authors**: Yeqin Zhang, Yizheng Zhao, Chen Hu, Binxing Jiao, Daxin Jiang, Ruihang Miao, Cam-Tu Nguyen

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:50:00Z

**Summary**: Text representation plays a critical role in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and other downstream applications. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data. Code is available at https://github.com/longtaizi13579/LLM2Comp.

### V-Rex: Real-Time Streaming Video LLM Acceleration via Dynamic KV Cache Retrieval
**Authors**: Donghyuk Kim, Sejeong Yang, Wonjin Shin, Joo-Young Kim

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:46:59Z

**Summary**: Streaming video large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for real-time multimodal tasks such as video captioning, question answering, conversational agents, and augmented reality. However, these models face fundamental memory and computational challenges because their key-value (KV) caches grow substantially with continuous streaming video input. This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Due to its iterative prefill stage, it suffers from significant limitations, including extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in accuracy. Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment, which is the primary target for these models.   In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. At its core, V-Rex introduces ReSV, a training-free dynamic KV cache retrieval algorithm. ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames. To fully realize these algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring bit-level and early-exit based computing units. V-Rex achieves unprecedented real-time of 3.9-8.3 FPS and energy-efficient streaming video LLM inference on edge deployment with negligible accuracy loss. While DRE only accounts for 2.2% power and 2.0% area, the system delivers 1.9-19.7x speedup and 3.1-18.5x energy efficiency improvements over AGX Orin GPU. This work is the first to comprehensively tackle KV cache retrieval across algorithms and hardware, enabling real-time streaming video LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices.

### Policy-Conditioned Policies for Multi-Agent Task Solving
**Authors**: Yue Lin, Shuhui Zhu, Wenhao Li, Ang Li, Dan Qiao, Pascal Poupart, Hongyuan Zha, Baoxiang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:42:10Z

**Summary**: In multi-agent tasks, the central challenge lies in the dynamic adaptation of strategies. However, directly conditioning on opponents' strategies is intractable in the prevalent deep reinforcement learning paradigm due to a fundamental ``representational bottleneck'': neural policies are opaque, high-dimensional parameter vectors that are incomprehensible to other agents. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift that bridges this gap by representing policies as human-interpretable source code and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as approximate interpreters. This programmatic representation allows us to operationalize the game-theoretic concept of \textit{Program Equilibrium}. We reformulate the learning problem by utilizing LLMs to perform optimization directly in the space of programmatic policies. The LLM functions as a point-wise best-response operator that iteratively synthesizes and refines the ego agent's policy code to respond to the opponent's strategy. We formalize this process as \textit{Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR)}, an algorithm where the policy code is optimized by textual gradients, using structured feedback derived from game utility and runtime unit tests. We demonstrate that this approach effectively solves several standard coordination matrix games and a cooperative Level-Based Foraging environment.

### Towards Better Search with Domain-Aware Text Embeddings for C2C Marketplaces
**Authors**: Andre Rusli, Miao Cao, Shoma Ishimoto, Sho Akiyama, Max Frenzel

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:35:17Z

**Summary**: Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplaces pose distinct retrieval challenges: short, ambiguous queries; noisy, user-generated listings; and strict production constraints. This paper reports our experiment to build a domain-aware Japanese text-embedding approach to improve the quality of search at Mercari, Japan's largest C2C marketplace. We experimented with fine-tuning on purchase-driven query-title pairs, using role-specific prefixes to model query-item asymmetry. To meet production constraints, we apply Matryoshka Representation Learning to obtain compact, truncation-robust embeddings. Offline evaluation on historical search logs shows consistent gains over a strong generic encoder, with particularly large improvements when replacing PCA compression with Matryoshka truncation. A manual assessment further highlights better handling of proper nouns, marketplace-specific semantics, and term-importance alignment. Additionally, an initial online A/B test demonstrates statistically significant improvements in revenue per user and search-flow efficiency, with transaction frequency maintained. Results show that domain-aware embeddings improve relevance and efficiency at scale and form a practical foundation for richer LLM-era search experiences.

### LLM4Perf: Large Language Models Are Effective Samplers for Multi-Objective Performance Modeling
**Authors**: Xin Wang, Zhenhao Li, Zishuo Ding

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:33:31Z

**Summary**: The performance of modern software systems is critically dependent on their complex configuration options. Building accurate performance models to navigate this vast space requires effective sampling strategies, yet existing methods often struggle with multi-objective optimization and cannot leverage semantic information from documentation. The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) motivates the central question of this work: Can LLMs serve as effective samplers for multi-objective performance modeling? To explore this, we present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the capabilities and characteristics of LLM-driven sampling. We design and implement LLM4Perf, a feedback-based framework, and use it to systematically evaluate the LLM-guided sampling process across four highly configurable, real-world systems. Our study reveals that the LLM-guided approach outperforms traditional baselines in most cases. Quantitatively, LLM4Perf achieves the best performance in nearly 68.8% (77 out of 112) of all evaluation scenarios, demonstrating its superior effectiveness. We find this effectiveness stems from the LLM's dual capabilities of configuration space pruning and feedback-driven strategy refinement. The effectiveness of this pruning is further validated by the fact that it also improves the performance of the baseline methods in nearly 91.5% (410 out of 448) of cases. Furthermore, we show how the LLM choices for each component and hyperparameters within LLM4Perf affect its effectiveness. Overall, this paper provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of LLMs in performance engineering and offers concrete insights into the mechanisms that drive their success.

### Rethinking Supervised Fine-Tuning: Emphasizing Key Answer Tokens for Improved LLM Accuracy
**Authors**: Xiaofeng Shi, Qian Kou, Yuduo Li, Hua Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:24:31Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) component has become significant for complex reasoning tasks. However, in conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), the model could allocate disproportionately more attention to CoT sequences with excessive length. This reduces focus on the much shorter but essential Key portion-the final answer, whose correctness directly determines task success and evaluation quality. To address this limitation, we propose SFTKey, a two-stage training scheme. In the first stage, conventional SFT is applied to ensure proper output format, while in the second stage, only the Key portion is fine-tuned to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families demonstrate that SFTKey achieves an average accuracy improvement exceeding 5\% over conventional SFT, while preserving the ability to generate correct formats. Overall, this study advances LLM fine-tuning by explicitly balancing CoT learning with additional optimization on answer-relevant tokens.

### LLM Swiss Round: Aggregating Multi-Benchmark Performance via Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics
**Authors**: Jiashuo Liu, Jiayun Wu, Chunjie Wu, Jingkai Liu, Zaiyuan Wang, Huan Zhou, Wenhao Huang, Hongseok Namkoong

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:14:31Z

**Summary**: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and diverse specialized benchmarks necessitates a shift from fragmented, task-specific metrics to a holistic, competitive ranking system that effectively aggregates performance across multiple ability dimensions. Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation.

### GateBreaker: Gate-Guided Attacks on Mixture-of-Expert LLMs
**Authors**: Lichao Wu, Sasha Behrouzi, Mohamadreza Rostami, Stjepan Picek, Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:13:24Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have advanced the scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) by activating only a sparse subset of parameters per input, enabling state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational cost. As these models are increasingly deployed in critical domains, understanding and strengthening their alignment mechanisms is essential to prevent harmful outputs. However, existing LLM safety research has focused almost exclusively on dense architectures, leaving the unique safety properties of MoEs largely unexamined. The modular, sparsely-activated design of MoEs suggests that safety mechanisms may operate differently than in dense models, raising questions about their robustness.   In this paper, we present GateBreaker, the first training-free, lightweight, and architecture-agnostic attack framework that compromises the safety alignment of modern MoE LLMs at inference time. GateBreaker operates in three stages: (i) gate-level profiling, which identifies safety experts disproportionately routed on harmful inputs, (ii) expert-level localization, which localizes the safety structure within safety experts, and (iii) targeted safety removal, which disables the identified safety structure to compromise the safety alignment. Our study shows that MoE safety concentrates within a small subset of neurons coordinated by sparse routing. Selective disabling of these neurons, approximately 3% of neurons in the targeted expert layers, significantly increases the averaged attack success rate (ASR) from 7.4% to 64.9% against the eight latest aligned MoE LLMs with limited utility degradation. These safety neurons transfer across models within the same family, raising ASR from 17.9% to 67.7% with one-shot transfer attack. Furthermore, GateBreaker generalizes to five MoE vision language models (VLMs) with 60.9% ASR on unsafe image inputs.

### Distilling the Essence: Efficient Reasoning Distillation via Sequence Truncation
**Authors**: Wei-Rui Chen, Vignesh Kothapalli, Ata Fatahibaarzi, Hejian Sang, Shao Tang, Qingquan Song, Zhipeng Wang, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:57:35Z

**Summary**: Distilling the reasoning capabilities from a large language model (LLM) to a smaller student model often involves training on substantial amounts of reasoning data. However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\approx94\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\%$ each.

**Authors**: Xudong Wang, Lei Feng, Ruichen Zhang, Fanqin Zhou, Hongyang Du, Wenjing Li, Dusit Niyato, Abbas Jamalipour, Ping Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:49:43Z

**Summary**: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requires networks that deliver ultra-low latency, high reliability, and cost efficiency, which traditional optimization methods and deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approaches struggle to provide under dynamic and heterogeneous workloads. To address this gap, large language model (LLM)-empowered agentic AI has emerged as a promising paradigm, integrating reasoning, planning, and adaptation to enable QoE-aware network management. In this paper, we explore the integration of agentic AI into QoE-aware network slicing for IIoT. We first review the network slicing management architecture, QoE metrics for IIoT applications, and the challenges of dynamically managing heterogeneous network slices, while highlighting the motivations and advantages of adopting agentic AI. We then present the workflow of agentic AI-based slicing management, illustrating the full lifecycle of AI agents from processing slice requests to constructing slice instances and performing dynamic adjustments. Furthermore, we propose an LLM-empowered agentic AI approach for slicing management, which integrates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for semantic intent inference, a DRL-based orchestrator for slicing configuration, and an incremental memory mechanism for continual learning and adaptation. Through a case study on heterogeneous slice management, we demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other baselines in balancing latency, reliability, and cost, and achieves up to a 19% improvement in slice availability ratio.

### TrafficSimAgent: A Hierarchical Agent Framework for Autonomous Traffic Simulation with MCP Control
**Authors**: Yuwei Du, Jun Zhang, Jie Feng, Zhicheng Liu, Jian Yuan, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:48:04Z

**Summary**: Traffic simulation is important for transportation optimization and policy making. While existing simulators such as SUMO and MATSim offer fully-featured platforms and utilities, users without too much knowledge about these platforms often face significant challenges when conducting experiments from scratch and applying them to their daily work. To solve this challenge, we propose TrafficSimAgent, an LLM-based agent framework that serves as an expert in experiment design and decision optimization for general-purpose traffic simulation tasks. The framework facilitates execution through cross-level collaboration among expert agents: high-level expert agents comprehend natural language instructions with high flexibility, plan the overall experiment workflow, and invoke corresponding MCP-compatible tools on demand; meanwhile, low-level expert agents select optimal action plans for fundamental elements based on real-time traffic conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios show that TrafficSimAgent effectively executes simulations under various conditions and consistently produces reasonable outcomes even when user instructions are ambiguous. Besides, the carefully designed expert-level autonomous decision-driven optimization in TrafficSimAgent yields superior performance when compared with other systems and SOTA LLM based methods.

### PUFM++: Point Cloud Upsampling via Enhanced Flow Matching
**Authors**: Zhi-Song Liu, Chenhang He, Roland Maier, Andreas Rupp

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:30:42Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in generative modeling have demonstrated strong promise for high-quality point cloud upsampling. In this work, we present PUFM++, an enhanced flow-matching framework for reconstructing dense and accurate point clouds from sparse, noisy, and partial observations. PUFM++ improves flow matching along three key axes: (i) geometric fidelity, (ii) robustness to imperfect input, and (iii) consistency with downstream surface-based tasks. We introduce a two-stage flow-matching strategy that first learns a direct, straight-path flow from sparse inputs to dense targets, and then refines it using noise-perturbed samples to approximate the terminal marginal distribution better. To accelerate and stabilize inference, we propose a data-driven adaptive time scheduler that improves sampling efficiency based on interpolation behavior. We further impose on-manifold constraints during sampling to ensure that generated points remain aligned with the underlying surface. Finally, we incorporate a recurrent interface network~(RIN) to strengthen hierarchical feature interactions and boost reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world scans show that PUFM++ sets a new state of the art in point cloud upsampling, delivering superior visual fidelity and quantitative accuracy across a wide range of tasks. Code and pretrained models are publicly available at https://github.com/Holmes-Alan/Enhanced_PUFM.

### AegisAgent: An Autonomous Defense Agent Against Prompt Injection Attacks in LLM-HARs
**Authors**: Yihan Wang, Huanqi Yang, Shantanu Pal, Weitao Xu

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:29:24Z

**Summary**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into wearable sensing is creating a new class of mobile applications capable of nuanced human activity understanding. However, the reliability of these systems is critically undermined by their vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, where attackers deliberately input deceptive instructions into LLMs. Traditional defenses, based on static filters and rigid rules, are insufficient to address the semantic complexity of these new attacks. We argue that a paradigm shift is needed -- from passive filtering to active protection and autonomous reasoning. We introduce AegisAgent, an autonomous agent system designed to ensure the security of LLM-driven HAR systems. Instead of merely blocking threats, AegisAgent functions as a cognitive guardian. It autonomously perceives potential semantic inconsistencies, reasons about the user's true intent by consulting a dynamic memory of past interactions, and acts by generating and executing a multi-step verification and repair plan. We implement AegisAgent as a lightweight, full-stack prototype and conduct a systematic evaluation on 15 common attacks with five state-of-the-art LLM-based HAR systems on three public datasets. Results show it reduces attack success rate by 30\% on average while incurring only 78.6 ms of latency overhead on a GPU workstation. Our work makes the first step towards building secure and trustworthy LLM-driven HAR systems.

### Estimation and Inference for Causal Explainability
**Authors**: Weihan Zhang, Zijun Gao

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:22:45Z

**Summary**: Understanding how much each variable contributes to an outcome is a central question across disciplines. A causal view of explainability is favorable for its ability in uncovering underlying mechanisms and generalizing to new contexts. Based on a family of causal explainability quantities, we develop methods for their estimation and inference. In particular, we construct a one-step correction estimator using semi-parametric efficiency theory, which explicitly leverages the independence structure of variables to reduce the asymptotic variance. For a null hypothesis on the boundary, i.e., zero explainability, we show its equivalence to Fisher's sharp null, which motivates a randomization-based inference procedure. Finally, we illustrate the empirical efficacy of our approach through simulations as well as an immigration experiment dataset, where we investigate how features and their interactions shape public opinion toward admitting immigrants.

### Automatic Replication of LLM Mistakes in Medical Conversations
**Authors**: Oleksii Proniakin, Diego Fajardo, Ruslan Nazarenko, Razvan Marinescu

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:17:21Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in clinical settings using multi-dimensional rubrics which quantify reasoning quality, safety, and patient-centeredness. Yet, replicating specific mistakes in other LLM models is not straightforward and often requires manual effort. We introduce MedMistake, an automatic pipeline that extracts mistakes LLMs make in patient-doctor conversations and converts them into a benchmark of single-shot QA pairs. Our pipeline (1) creates complex, conversational data between an LLM patient and LLM doctor, (2) runs an evaluation with a committee of 2 LLM judges across a variety of dimensions and (3) creates simplified single-shot QA scenarios from those mistakes. We release MedMistake-All, a dataset of 3,390 single-shot QA pairs where GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are currently failing to answer correctly, as judged by two LLM judges. We used medical experts to validate a subset of 211/3390 questions (MedMistake-Bench), which we used to run a final evaluation of 12 frontier LLMs: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek-Chat, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Grok 4, Grok 4.1, Mistral Large. We found that GPT models, Claude and Grok obtained the best performance on MedMistake-Bench. We release both the doctor-validated benchmark (MedMistake-Bench), as well as the full dataset (MedMistake-All) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheLumos/MedicalMistakeBenchmark.

### GenTSE: Enhancing Target Speaker Extraction via a Coarse-to-Fine Generative Language Model
**Authors**: Haoyang Li, Xuyi Zhuang, Azmat Adnan, Ye Ni, Wei Rao, Shreyas Gopal, Eng Siong Chng

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:13:02Z

**Summary**: Language Model (LM)-based generative modeling has emerged as a promising direction for TSE, offering potential for improved generalization and high-fidelity speech. We present GenTSE, a two-stage decoder-only generative LM approach for TSE: Stage-1 predicts coarse semantic tokens, and Stage-2 generates fine acoustic tokens. Separating semantics and acoustics stabilizes decoding and yields more faithful, content-aligned target speech. Both stages use continuous SSL or codec embeddings, offering richer context than discretized-prompt methods. To reduce exposure bias, we employ a Frozen-LM Conditioning training strategy that conditions the LMs on predicted tokens from earlier checkpoints to reduce the gap between teacher-forcing training and autoregressive inference. We further employ DPO to better align outputs with human perceptual preferences. Experiments on Libri2Mix show that GenTSE surpasses previous LM-based systems in speech quality, intelligibility, and speaker consistency.

### Divergence-based Robust Generalised Bayesian Inference for Directional Data via von Mises-Fisher models
**Authors**: Tomoyuki Nakagawa, Yasuhito Tsuruta, Sho Kazari, Kouji Tahata

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:07:39Z

**Summary**: This paper focusses on robust estimation of location and concentration parameters of the von Mises-Fisher distribution in the Bayesian framework. The von Mises-Fisher (or Langevin) distribution has played a central role in directional statistics. Directional data have been investigated for many decades, and more recently, they have gained increasing attention in diverse areas such as bioinformatics and text data analysis. Although outliers can significantly affect the estimation results even for directional data, the treatment of outliers remains an unresolved and challenging problem. In the frequentist framework, numerous studies have developed robust estimation methods for directional data with outliers, but, in contrast, only a few robust estimation methods have been proposed in the Bayesian framework. In this paper, we propose Bayesian inference based on the density power divergence and the $γ$-divergence and establish their asymptotic properties and robustness. In addition, the Bayesian approach naturally provides a way to assess estimation uncertainty through the posterior distribution, which is particularly useful for small samples. Furthermore, to carry out the posterior computation, we develop the posterior computation algorithm based on the weighted Bayesian bootstrap for estimating parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through simulation studies. Using two real datasets, we further show that the proposed method provides reliable and robust estimation even in the presence of outliers or data contamination.

 ### Streaming Video Instruction Tuning
**Authors**: Jiaer Xia, Peixian Chen, Mengdan Zhang, Xing Sun, Kaiyang Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T18:59:36Z

**Summary**: We present Streamo, a real-time streaming video LLM that serves as a general-purpose interactive assistant. Unlike existing online video models that focus narrowly on question answering or captioning, Streamo performs a broad spectrum of streaming video tasks, including real-time narration, action understanding, event captioning, temporal event grounding, and time-sensitive question answering. To develop such versatility, we construct Streamo-Instruct-465K, a large-scale instruction-following dataset tailored for streaming video understanding. The dataset covers diverse temporal contexts and multi-task supervision, enabling unified training across heterogeneous streaming tasks. After training end-to-end on the instruction-following dataset through a streamlined pipeline, Streamo exhibits strong temporal reasoning, responsive interaction, and broad generalization across a variety of streaming benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that Streamo bridges the gap between offline video perception models and real-time multimodal assistants, making a step toward unified, intelligent video understanding in continuous video streams.

### Fast SAM2 with Text-Driven Token Pruning
**Authors**: Avilasha Mandal, Chaoning Zhang, Fachrina Dewi Puspitasari, Xudong Wang, Jiaquan Zhang, Caiyan Qin, Guoqing Wang, Yang Yang, Heng Tao Shen

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T18:59:05Z

**Summary**: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), a vision foundation model has significantly advanced in prompt-driven video object segmentation, yet their practical deployment remains limited by the high computational and memory cost of processing dense visual tokens across time. The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance. These results highlight the potential of early token selection to improve the scalability of transformer-based video segmentation systems for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

### C2LLM Technical Report: A New Frontier in Code Retrieval via Adaptive Cross-Attention Pooling
**Authors**: Jin Qin, Zihan Liao, Ziyin Zhang, Hang Yu, Peng Di, Rui Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T18:59:01Z

**Summary**: We present C2LLM - Contrastive Code Large Language Models, a family of code embedding models in both 0.5B and 7B sizes. Building upon Qwen-2.5-Coder backbones, C2LLM adopts a Pooling by Multihead Attention (PMA) module for generating sequence embedding from token embeddings, effectively 1) utilizing the LLM's causal representations acquired during pretraining, while also 2) being able to aggregate information from all tokens in the sequence, breaking the information bottleneck in EOS-based sequence embeddings, and 3) supporting flexible adaptation of embedding dimension, serving as an alternative to MRL. Trained on three million publicly available data, C2LLM models set new records on MTEB-Code among models of similar sizes, with C2LLM-7B ranking 1st on the overall leaderboard.

### Measuring all the noises of LLM Evals
**Authors**: Sida Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T18:54:37Z

**Summary**: Separating signal from noise is central to experimental science. Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments.

### Scaling Laws for Economic Productivity: Experimental Evidence in LLM-Assisted Consulting, Data Analyst, and Management Tasks
**Authors**: Ali Merali

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T18:24:29Z

**Summary**: This paper derives `Scaling Laws for Economic Impacts' -- empirical relationships between the training compute of Large Language Models (LLMs) and professional productivity. In a preregistered experiment, over 500 consultants, data analysts, and managers completed professional tasks using one of 13 LLMs. We find that each year of AI model progress reduced task time by 8%, with 56% of gains driven by increased compute and 44% by algorithmic progress. However, productivity gains were significantly larger for non-agentic analytical tasks compared to agentic workflows requiring tool use. These findings suggest continued model scaling could boost U.S. productivity by approximately 20% over the next decade.

### A Plan Reuse Mechanism for LLM-Driven Agent
**Authors**: Guopeng Li, Ruiqi Wu, Haisheng Tan

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T18:08:03Z

**Summary**: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into personal assistants, like Xiao Ai and Blue Heart V, effectively enhances their ability to interact with humans, solve complex tasks, and manage IoT devices. Such assistants are also termed LLM-driven agents. Upon receiving user requests, the LLM-driven agent generates plans using an LLM, executes these plans through various tools, and then returns the response to the user. During this process, the latency for generating a plan with an LLM can reach tens of seconds, significantly degrading user experience. Real-world dataset analysis shows that about 30% of the requests received by LLM-driven agents are identical or similar, which allows the reuse of previously generated plans to reduce latency. However, it is difficult to accurately define the similarity between the request texts received by the LLM-driven agent through directly evaluating the original request texts. Moreover, the diverse expressions of natural language and the unstructured format of plan texts make implementing plan reuse challenging. To address these issues, we present and implement a plan reuse mechanism for LLM-driven agents called AgentReuse. AgentReuse leverages the similarities and differences among requests' semantics and uses intent classification to evaluate the similarities between requests and enable the reuse of plans. Experimental results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AgentReuse achieves a 93% effective plan reuse rate, an F1 score of 0.9718, and an accuracy of 0.9459 in evaluating request similarities, reducing latency by 93.12% compared with baselines without using the reuse mechanism.

### When F1 Fails: Granularity-Aware Evaluation for Dialogue Topic Segmentation
**Authors**: Michael H. Coen

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T18:05:57Z

**Summary**: Dialogue topic segmentation supports summarization, retrieval, memory management, and conversational continuity. Despite decades of work, evaluation practice remains dominated by strict boundary matching and F1-based metrics. Modern large language model (LLM) based conversational systems increasingly rely on segmentation to manage conversation history beyond fixed context windows. In such systems, unstructured context accumulation degrades efficiency and coherence.   This paper introduces an evaluation framework that reports boundary density and segment alignment diagnostics (purity and coverage) alongside window-tolerant F1 (W-F1). By separating boundary scoring from boundary selection, we evaluate segmentation quality across density regimes rather than at a single operating point. Cross-dataset evaluation shows that reported performance differences often reflect annotation granularity mismatch rather than boundary placement quality alone.   We evaluate structurally distinct segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Boundary-based metrics are strongly coupled to boundary density: threshold sweeps produce larger W-F1 changes than switching between methods. These findings support viewing topic segmentation as a granularity selection problem rather than prediction of a single correct boundary set. This motivates separating boundary scoring from boundary selection for analyzing and tuning segmentation under varying annotation granularities.

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T17:22:00Z

**Summary**: Traditional control interfaces for quadruped robots often impose a high barrier to entry, requiring specialized technical knowledge for effective operation. To address this, this paper presents a novel control framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable intuitive, natural language-based navigation. We propose a distributed architecture where high-level instruction processing is offloaded to an external server to overcome the onboard computational constraints of the DeepRobotics Jueying Lite 3 platform. The system grounds LLM-generated plans into executable ROS navigation commands using real-time sensor fusion (LiDAR, IMU, and Odometry). Experimental validation was conducted in a structured indoor environment across four distinct scenarios, ranging from single-room tasks to complex cross-zone navigation. The results demonstrate the system's robustness, achieving an aggregate success rate of over 90\% across all scenarios, validating the feasibility of offloaded LLM-based planning for autonomous quadruped deployment in real-world settings.

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T17:16:37Z

**Summary**: Recent progress in diffusion-based Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) demonstrates strong expressiveness but remains limited by data scarcity and model scalability. We introduce a two-stage pipeline: a compact seed set of human-sung recordings is constructed by pairing fixed melodies with diverse LLM-generated lyrics, and melody-specific models are trained to synthesize over 500 hours of high-quality Chinese singing data. Building on this corpus, we propose DiTSinger, a Diffusion Transformer with RoPE and qk-norm, systematically scaled in depth, width, and resolution for enhanced fidelity. Furthermore, we design an implicit alignment mechanism that obviates phoneme-level duration labels by constraining phoneme-to-acoustic attention within character-level spans, thereby improving robustness under noisy or uncertain alignments. Extensive experiments validate that our approach enables scalable, alignment-free, and high-fidelity SVS.

### Surgical Scene Segmentation using a Spike-Driven Video Transformer with Real-Time Potential
**Authors**: Shihao Zou, Jingjing Li, Wei Ji, Jincai Huang, Kai Wang, Guo Dan, Weixin Si, Yi Pan

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T17:05:09Z

**Summary**: Modern surgical systems increasingly rely on intelligent scene understanding to provide timely situational awareness for enhanced intra-operative safety. Within this pipeline, surgical scene segmentation plays a central role in accurately perceiving operative events. Although recent deep learning models, particularly large-scale foundation models, achieve remarkable segmentation accuracy, their substantial computational demands and power consumption hinder real-time deployment in resource-constrained surgical environments. To address this limitation, we explore the emerging SNN as a promising paradigm for highly efficient surgical intelligence. However, their performance is still constrained by the scarcity of labeled surgical data and the inherently sparse nature of surgical video representations. To this end, we propose \textit{SpikeSurgSeg}, the first spike-driven video Transformer framework tailored for surgical scene segmentation with real-time potential on non-GPU platforms. To address the limited availability of surgical annotations, we introduce a surgical-scene masked autoencoding pretraining strategy for SNNs that enables robust spatiotemporal representation learning via layer-wise tube masking. Building on this pretrained backbone, we further adopt a lightweight spike-driven segmentation head that produces temporally consistent predictions while preserving the low-latency characteristics of SNNs. Extensive experiments on EndoVis18 and our in-house SurgBleed dataset demonstrate that SpikeSurgSeg achieves mIoU comparable to SOTA ANN-based models while reducing inference latency by at least $8\times$. Notably, it delivers over $20\times$ acceleration relative to most foundation-model baselines, underscoring its potential for time-critical surgical scene segmentation.

### SMART SLM: Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer, A Small Language Model for Accurate Document Assistance
**Authors**: Divij Dudeja, Mayukha Pal

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T16:59:04Z

**Summary**: The user of Engineering Manuals (EM) finds it difficult to read EM s because they are long, have a dense format which includes written documents, step by step procedures, and standard parameter lists for engineering equipment. Off the shelf transformers, especially compact ones, treat this material as a flat stream of tokens. This approach leads to confident but incorrect numeric answers and forces the models to memorize separate facts inefficiently. SMART (Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer) offers a different and practical solution to the above problem. SMART structures its processing by using a hierarchical approach, and is based upon three main job categories (1) A syntax-aware Fact Extractor (Grammarian) Tree LSTM which extracts facts as subject relation object relations from EM sentences (2) A compact indexed memory MANN (Memory Augmented Neural Network) that indexes these Rational Subject Relation Objects as 384 dimensional vectors that are associated with the source of the information, and (3) A 6 layer Transformer that learns to fuse the previously retrieved facts into its generated response. The entire SMART model utilizes 45.51M parameters, which is 64% less than GPT-2 (124M) and 69% less than BERT (133M), and it achieves a 21.3% higher accuracy than GPT-2, indicating that SMART fits the data better with the least amount of processing requirements. SMART employs dual modes of inference an indexed fast path for known documents (sub-second answer times) and an indexed dynamic path assisted by RAGs for new uploads (FAISS Top 20 results with memory severed at 64 slots). In real world deployment, this framework leads to more well supported results with reduced hallucinations than comparable small transformer models.

### Future-Proofing Authentication Against Insecure Bootstrapping for 5G Networks: Feasibility, Resiliency, and Accountability
**Authors**: Saleh Darzi, Mirza Masfiqur Rahman, Imtiaz Karim, Rouzbeh Behnia, Attila A Yavuz, Elisa Bertino

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T16:07:16Z

**Summary**: The 5G protocol lacks a robust base station (BS) authentication mechanism during the initial bootstrapping phase, leaving it susceptible to threats such as fake BSs, spoofed broadcasts, and large-scale manipulation of System Information Blocks (SIBs). Despite real-world 5G deployments increasingly relying on multi-BS communication and user multi-connectivity, existing solutions incur high communication overheads, rely on centralized trust, and lack accountability and long-term breach resiliency. Given the inevitability of BS compromise and the severe impact of forged SIBs as the root of trust (e.g., fake alerts, tracking, false roaming), distributed trust, verifiable forgery detection, and audit logging are essential, yet remain largely unexplored in 5G authentication. These challenges are further amplified by the emergence of quantum-capable adversaries. While integration of NIST PQC standards is widely viewed as a path toward long-term security and future-proofing 5G authentication, their feasibility under strict packet size, latency, and broadcast constraints has not been systematically studied. This work presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive network-level performance characterization of integrating NIST-PQC standards and conventional digital signatures into 5G BS authentication, showing that direct PQC adoption is impractical due to protocol constraints, delays, and large signature sizes. To address these challenges, we propose BORG, a future-proof authentication framework based on a hierarchical identity-based threshold signature with fail-stop properties. BORG distributes trust across multiple BSs, enables post-mortem forgery detection, and provides tamper-evident, post-quantum secure audit logging, while maintaining compact signatures, avoiding fragmentation, and incurring minimal UE overhead, as shown in our 5G testbed implementation.

**Authors**: Haoyang Li, Mingjin Li, Jinxin Zuo, Siqi Li, Xiao Li, Hao Wu, Yueming Lu, Xiaochuan He

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T15:55:42Z

**Summary**: LLM-based code agents(e.g., ChatGPT Codex) are increasingly deployed as detector for code review and security auditing tasks. Although CoT-enhanced LLM vulnerability detectors are believed to provide improved robustness against obfuscated malicious code, we find that their reasoning chains and semantic abstraction processes exhibit exploitable systematic weaknesses.This allows attackers to covertly embed malicious logic, bypass code review, and propagate backdoored components throughout real-world software supply chains.To investigate this issue, we present CoTDeceptor, the first adversarial code obfuscation framework targeting CoT-enhanced LLM detectors. CoTDeceptor autonomously constructs evolving, hard-to-reverse multi-stage obfuscation strategy chains that effectively disrupt CoT-driven detection logic.We obtained malicious code provided by security enterprise, experimental results demonstrate that CoTDeceptor achieves stable and transferable evasion performance against state-of-the-art LLMs and vulnerability detection agents. CoTDeceptor bypasses 14 out of 15 vulnerability categories, compared to only 2 bypassed by prior methods. Our findings highlight potential risks in real-world software supply chains and underscore the need for more robust and interpretable LLM-powered security analysis systems.

**Summary**: As LLMs shift toward autonomous agents, Deep Research has emerged as a pivotal metric. However, existing academic benchmarks like BrowseComp often fail to meet real-world demands for open-ended research, which requires robust skills in intent recognition, long-horizon decision-making, and cross-source verification. To address this, we introduce Step-DeepResearch, a cost-effective, end-to-end agent. We propose a Data Synthesis Strategy Based on Atomic Capabilities to reinforce planning and report writing, combined with a progressive training path from agentic mid-training to SFT and RL. Enhanced by a Checklist-style Judger, this approach significantly improves robustness. Furthermore, to bridge the evaluation gap in the Chinese domain, we establish ADR-Bench for realistic deep research scenarios. Experimental results show that Step-DeepResearch (32B) scores 61.4% on Scale AI Research Rubrics. On ADR-Bench, it significantly outperforms comparable models and rivals SOTA closed-source models like OpenAI and Gemini DeepResearch. These findings prove that refined training enables medium-sized models to achieve expert-level capabilities at industry-leading cost-efficiency.

### LookPlanGraph: Embodied Instruction Following Method with VLM Graph Augmentation
**Authors**: Anatoly O. Onishchenko, Alexey K. Kovalev, Aleksandr I. Panov

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T15:36:21Z

**Summary**: Methods that use Large Language Models (LLM) as planners for embodied instruction following tasks have become widespread. To successfully complete tasks, the LLM must be grounded in the environment in which the robot operates. One solution is to use a scene graph that contains all the necessary information. Modern methods rely on prebuilt scene graphs and assume that all task-relevant information is available at the start of planning. However, these approaches do not account for changes in the environment that may occur between the graph construction and the task execution. We propose LookPlanGraph - a method that leverages a scene graph composed of static assets and object priors. During plan execution, LookPlanGraph continuously updates the graph with relevant objects, either by verifying existing priors or discovering new entities. This is achieved by processing the agents egocentric camera view using a Vision Language Model. We conducted experiments with changed object positions VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulated environments, demonstrating that LookPlanGraph outperforms methods based on predefined static scene graphs. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we also conducted experiments in a real-world setting. Additionally, we introduce the GraSIF (Graph Scenes for Instruction Following) dataset with automated validation framework, comprising 514 tasks drawn from SayPlan Office, BEHAVIOR-1K, and VirtualHome RobotHow.

### Improving the Convergence Rate of Ray Search Optimization for Query-Efficient Hard-Label Attacks
**Authors**: Xinjie Xu, Shuyu Cheng, Dongwei Xu, Qi Xuan, Chen Ma

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T15:35:03Z

**Summary**: In hard-label black-box adversarial attacks, where only the top-1 predicted label is accessible, the prohibitive query complexity poses a major obstacle to practical deployment. In this paper, we focus on optimizing a representative class of attacks that search for the optimal ray direction yielding the minimum $\ell_2$-norm perturbation required to move a benign image into the adversarial region. Inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG), we propose a momentum-based algorithm, ARS-OPT, which proactively estimates the gradient with respect to a future ray direction inferred from accumulated momentum. We provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, showing that ARS-OPT enables more accurate directional updates and achieves faster, more stable optimization. To further accelerate convergence, we incorporate surrogate-model priors into ARS-OPT's gradient estimation, resulting in PARS-OPT with enhanced performance. The superiority of our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method surpasses 13 state-of-the-art approaches in query efficiency.

### Assessing the Software Security Comprehension of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Mohammed Latif Siddiq, Natalie Sekerak, Antonio Karam, Maria Leal, Arvin Islam-Gomes, Joanna C. S. Santos

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T15:29:54Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development, but their level of software security expertise remains unclear. This work systematically evaluates the security comprehension of five leading LLMs: GPT-4o-Mini, GPT-5-Mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.1, and Qwen-2.5, using Blooms Taxonomy as a framework. We assess six cognitive dimensions: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. Our methodology integrates diverse datasets, including curated multiple-choice questions, vulnerable code snippets (SALLM), course assessments from an Introduction to Software Security course, real-world case studies (XBOW), and project-based creation tasks from a Secure Software Engineering course. Results show that while LLMs perform well on lower-level cognitive tasks such as recalling facts and identifying known vulnerabilities, their performance degrades significantly on higher-order tasks that require reasoning, architectural evaluation, and secure system creation. Beyond reporting aggregate accuracy, we introduce a software security knowledge boundary that identifies the highest cognitive level at which a model consistently maintains reliable performance. In addition, we identify 51 recurring misconception patterns exhibited by LLMs across Blooms levels.

### Casting a SPELL: Sentence Pairing Exploration for LLM Limitation-breaking
**Authors**: Yifan Huang, Xiaojun Jia, Wenbo Guo, Yuqiang Sun, Yihao Huang, Chong Wang, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T15:25:31Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized software development through AI-assisted coding tools, enabling developers with limited programming expertise to create sophisticated applications. However, this accessibility extends to malicious actors who may exploit these powerful tools to generate harmful software. Existing jailbreaking research primarily focuses on general attack scenarios against LLMs, with limited exploration of malicious code generation as a jailbreak target. To address this gap, we propose SPELL, a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed to evaluate the weakness of security alignment in malicious code generation. Our framework employs a time-division selection strategy that systematically constructs jailbreaking prompts by intelligently combining sentences from a prior knowledge dataset, balancing exploration of novel attack patterns with exploitation of successful techniques. Extensive evaluation across three advanced code models (GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5, and Qwen2.5-Coder) demonstrates SPELL's effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 83.75%, 19.38%, and 68.12% respectively across eight malicious code categories. The generated prompts successfully produce malicious code in real-world AI development tools such as Cursor, with outputs confirmed as malicious by state-of-the-art detection systems at rates exceeding 73%. These findings reveal significant security gaps in current LLM implementations and provide valuable insights for improving AI safety alignment in code generation applications.

### Rethinking Memory in LLM based Agents: Representations, Operations, and Emerging Topics
**Authors**: Yiming Du, Wenyu Huang, Danna Zheng, Zhaowei Wang, Sebastien Montella, Mirella Lapata, Kam-Fai Wong, Jeff Z. Pan

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T15:24:04Z

**Summary**: Memory is fundamental to large language model (LLM)-based agents, but existing surveys emphasize application-level use (e.g., personalized dialogue), while overlooking the atomic operations governing memory dynamics. This work categorizes memory into parametric (implicit in model weights) and contextual (explicit external data, structured/unstructured) forms, and defines six core operations: Consolidation, Updating, Indexing, Forgetting, Retrieval, and Condensation. Mapping these dimensions reveals four key research topics: long-term, long-context, parametric modification, and multi-source memory. The taxonomy provides a structured view of memory-related research, benchmarks, and tools, clarifying functional interactions in LLM-based agents and guiding future advancements. The datasets, papers, and tools are publicly available at https://github.com/Elvin-Yiming-Du/Survey_Memory_in_AI.

### Hearing to Translate: The Effectiveness of Speech Modality Integration into LLMs
**Authors**: Sara Papi, Javier Garcia Gilabert, Zachary Hopton, Vilém Zouhar, Carlos Escolano, Gerard I. Gállego, Jorge Iranzo-Sánchez, Ahrii Kim, Dominik Macháček, Patricia Schmidtova, Maike Züfle

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T14:39:27Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) expand beyond text, integrating speech as a native modality has given rise to SpeechLLMs, which aim to translate spoken language directly, thereby bypassing traditional transcription-based pipelines. Whether this integration improves speech-to-text translation quality over established cascaded architectures, however, remains an open question. We present Hearing to Translate, the first comprehensive test suite rigorously benchmarking 5 state-of-the-art SpeechLLMs against 16 strong direct and cascade systems that couple leading speech foundation models (SFM), with multilingual LLMs. Our analysis spans 16 benchmarks, 13 language pairs, and 9 challenging conditions, including disfluent, noisy, and long-form speech. Across this extensive evaluation, we find that cascaded systems remain the most reliable overall, while current SpeechLLMs only match cascades in selected settings and SFMs lag behind both, highlighting that integrating an LLM, either within the model or in a pipeline, is essential for high-quality speech translation.

### Bootstrapping LLMs via Preference-Based Policy Optimization
**Authors**: Chen Jia

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T13:31:20Z

**Summary**: Bootstrapping large language models (LLMs) through preference-based policy optimization offers a promising direction for aligning model behavior with human preferences without relying on extensive manual annotations. In this work, we propose a novel preference-based policy optimization (PbPO) framework that formulates the learning process as a min-max game between the main policy and a reward model (RM). The RM is constrained within a confidence set derived from preference data to ensure reliable exploitation. Our iterative online algorithm actively collects preference data through guided exploration of the evolving policy, enabling continual self-improvement of both the policy and the RM. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method, establishing high-probability regret bounds for both settings with sequence-level RM and token-level RM, demonstrating its effectiveness in bootstrapping LLMs. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art preference optimization techniques.

### CAKE: Cascading and Adaptive KV Cache Eviction with Layer Preferences
**Authors**: Ziran Qin, Yuchen Cao, Mingbao Lin, Wen Hu, Shixuan Fan, Ke Cheng, Weiyao Lin, Jianguo Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T13:21:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing long sequences, boosting demand for key-value (KV) caching. While recent efforts to evict KV cache have alleviated the inference burden, they often fail to allocate resources rationally across layers with different attention patterns. In this paper, we introduce Cascading and Adaptive KV cache Eviction (CAKE), a novel approach that frames KV cache eviction as a "cake-slicing problem." CAKE assesses layer-specific preferences by considering attention dynamics in both spatial and temporal dimensions, allocates rational cache size for layers accordingly, and manages memory constraints in a cascading manner. This approach enables a global view of cache allocation, adaptively distributing resources across diverse attention mechanisms while maintaining memory budgets. CAKE also employs a new eviction indicator that considers the shifting importance of tokens over time, addressing limitations in existing methods that overlook temporal dynamics. Comprehensive experiments on LongBench and NeedleBench show that CAKE maintains model performance with only 3.2% of the KV cache and consistently outperforms current baselines across various models and memory constraints, particularly in low-memory settings. Additionally, CAKE achieves over 10x speedup in decoding latency compared to full cache when processing contexts of 128K tokens with FlashAttention-2. Our code is available at https://github.com/antgroup/cakekv.

### Coherence in the brain unfolds across separable temporal regimes
**Authors**: Davide Stauba, Finn Rabe, Akhil Misra, Yves Pauli, Roya Hüppi, Ni Yang, Nils Lang, Lars Michels, Victoria Edkins, Sascha Frühholz, Iris Sommer, Wolfram Hinzen, Philipp Homan

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T12:51:11Z

**Summary**: Coherence in language requires the brain to satisfy two competing temporal demands: gradual accumulation of meaning across extended context and rapid reconfiguration of representations at event boundaries. Despite their centrality to language and thought, how these processes are implemented in the human brain during naturalistic listening remains unclear. Here, we tested whether these two processes can be captured by annotation-free drift and shift signals and whether their neural expression dissociates across large-scale cortical systems. These signals were derived from a large language model (LLM) and formalized contextual drift and event shifts directly from the narrative input. To enable high-precision voxelwise encoding models with stable parameter estimates, we densely sampled one healthy adult across more than 7 hours of listening to thirteen crime stories while collecting ultra high-field (7T) BOLD data. We then modeled the feature-informed hemodynamic response using a regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories. Drift predictions were prevalent in default-mode network hubs, whereas shift predictions were evident bilaterally in the primary auditory cortex and language association cortex. Furthermore, activity in default-mode and parietal networks was best explained by a signal capturing how meaning accumulates and gradually fades over the course of the narrative. Together, these findings show that coherence during language comprehension is implemented through dissociable neural regimes of slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reconfiguration, offering a mechanistic entry point for understanding disturbances of language coherence in psychiatric disorders.

### SESR-Eval: Dataset for Evaluating LLMs in the Title-Abstract Screening of Systematic Reviews
**Authors**: Aleksi Huotala, Miikka Kuutila, Mika Mäntylä

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T12:40:01Z

**Summary**: Background: The use of large language models (LLMs) in the title-abstract screening process of systematic reviews (SRs) has shown promising results, but suffers from limited performance evaluation. Aims: Create a benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of LLMs in the title-abstract screening process of SRs. Provide evidence whether using LLMs in title-abstract screening in software engineering is advisable. Method: We start with 169 SR research artifacts and find 24 of those to be suitable for inclusion in the dataset. Using the dataset we benchmark title-abstract screening using 9 LLMs. Results: We present the SESR-Eval (Software Engineering Systematic Review Evaluation) dataset containing 34,528 labeled primary studies, sourced from 24 secondary studies published in software engineering (SE) journals. Most LLMs performed similarly and the differences in screening accuracy between secondary studies are greater than differences between LLMs. The cost of using an LLM is relatively low - less than $40 per secondary study even for the most expensive model. Conclusions: Our benchmark enables monitoring AI performance in the screening task of SRs in software engineering. At present, LLMs are not yet recommended for automating the title-abstract screening process, since accuracy varies widely across secondary studies, and no LLM managed a high recall with reasonable precision. In future, we plan to investigate factors that influence LLM screening performance between studies.

### Encrypted Traffic Detection in Resource Constrained IoT Networks: A Diffusion Model and LLM Integrated Framework
**Authors**: Hongjuan Li, Hui Kang, Chenbang Liu, Ruolin Wang, Jiahui Li, Geng Sun, Jiacheng Wang, Shuang Liang, Shiwen Mao

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T12:25:28Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of Internet-of-things (IoT) infrastructures and the widespread adoption of traffic encryption present significant challenges, particularly in environments characterized by dynamic traffic patterns, constrained computational capabilities, and strict latency constraints. In this paper, we propose DMLITE, a diffusion model and large language model (LLM) integrated traffic embedding framework for network traffic detection within resource-limited IoT environments. The DMLITE overcomes these challenges through a tri-phase architecture including traffic visual preprocessing, diffusion-based multi-level feature extraction, and LLM-guided feature optimization. Specifically, the framework utilizes self-supervised diffusion models to capture both fine-grained and abstract patterns in encrypted traffic through multi-level feature fusion and contrastive learning with representative sample selection, thus enabling rapid adaptation to new traffic patterns with minimal labeled data. Furthermore, DMLITE incorporates LLMs to dynamically adjust particle swarm optimization parameters for intelligent feature selection by implementing a dual objective function that minimizes both classification error and variance across data distributions. Comprehensive experimental validation on benchmark datasets confirms the effectiveness of DMLITE, achieving classification accuracies of 98.87\%, 92.61\%, and 99.83\% on USTC-TFC, ISCX-VPN, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively. This improves classification accuracy by an average of 3.7\% and reduces training time by an average of 41.9\% compared to the representative deep learning model.

### Emotion Diffusion in Real and Simulated Social Graphs: Structural Limits of LLM-Based Social Simulation
**Authors**: Qiqi Qiang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T12:14:56Z

**Summary**: Understanding how emotions diffuse through social networks is central to computational social science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to simulate social media interactions, raising the question of whether LLM-generated data can realistically reproduce emotion diffusion patterns observed in real online communities. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison between emotion diffusion in real-world social graphs and in LLM-simulated interaction networks. We construct diffusion graphs from Reddit discussion data and compare them with synthetic social graphs generated through LLM-driven conversational simulations. Emotion states are inferred using established sentiment analysis pipelines, and both real and simulated graphs are analyzed from structural, behavioral, and predictive perspectives. Our results reveal substantial structural and dynamic discrepancies between real and simulated diffusion processes. Real-world emotion diffusion exhibits dense connectivity, repeated interactions, sentiment shifts, and emergent community structures, whereas LLM-simulated graphs largely consist of isolated linear chains with monotonic emotional trajectories. These structural limitations significantly affect downstream tasks such as graph-based emotion prediction, leading to reduced emotional diversity and class imbalance in simulated settings. Our findings highlight current limitations of LLM-based social simulation in capturing the interactive complexity and emotional heterogeneity of real social networks. This work provides empirical evidence for the cautious use of LLM-generated data in social science research and suggests directions for improving future simulation frameworks.

### AutoBaxBuilder: Bootstrapping Code Security Benchmarking
**Authors**: Tobias von Arx, Niels Mündler, Mark Vero, Maximilian Baader, Martin Vechev

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T12:02:00Z

**Summary**: As LLMs see wide adoption in software engineering, the reliable assessment of the correctness and security of LLM-generated code is crucial. Notably, prior work has demonstrated that security is often overlooked, exposing that LLMs are prone to generating code with security vulnerabilities. These insights were enabled by specialized benchmarks, crafted through significant manual effort by security experts. However, relying on manually-crafted benchmarks is insufficient in the long term, because benchmarks (i) naturally end up contaminating training data, (ii) must extend to new tasks to provide a more complete picture, and (iii) must increase in difficulty to challenge more capable LLMs. In this work, we address these challenges and present AutoBaxBuilder, a framework that generates tasks and tests for code security benchmarking from scratch. We introduce a robust pipeline with fine-grained plausibility checks, leveraging the code understanding capabilities of LLMs to construct functionality tests and end-to-end security-probing exploits. To confirm the quality of the generated benchmark, we conduct both a qualitative analysis and perform quantitative experiments, comparing it against tasks constructed by human experts. We use AutoBaxBuilder to construct entirely new tasks and release them to the public as AutoBaxBench, together with a thorough evaluation of the security capabilities of LLMs on these tasks. We find that a new task can be generated in under 2 hours, costing less than USD 10.

### A Real-World Evaluation of LLM Medication Safety Reviews in NHS Primary Care
**Authors**: Oliver Normand, Esther Borsi, Mitch Fruin, Lauren E Walker, Jamie Heagerty, Chris C. Holmes, Anthony J Avery, Iain E Buchan, Harry Coppock

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:58:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often match or exceed clinician-level performance on medical benchmarks, yet very few are evaluated on real clinical data or examined beyond headline metrics. We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\% [95\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\% [95\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\% [95\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations. We provide 45 detailed vignettes that comprehensively cover all identified failure cases. This work highlights shortcomings that must be addressed before LLM-based clinical AI can be safely deployed. It also begs larger-scale, prospective evaluations and deeper study of LLM behaviours in clinical contexts.

### MarineEval: Assessing the Marine Intelligence of Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: YuK-Kwan Wong, Tuan-An To, Jipeng Zhang, Ziqiang Zheng, Sai-Kit Yeung

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:57:50Z

**Summary**: We have witnessed promising progress led by large language models (LLMs) and further vision language models (VLMs) in handling various queries as a general-purpose assistant. VLMs, as a bridge to connect the visual world and language corpus, receive both visual content and various text-only user instructions to generate corresponding responses. Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs. During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements. We hope our new benchmark and observations will facilitate future research. Project Page: http://marineeval.hkustvgd.com/

### ClarifyMT-Bench: Benchmarking and Improving Multi-Turn Clarification for Conversational Large Language Models
**Authors**: Sichun Luo, Yi Huang, Mukai Li, Shichang Meng, Fengyuan Liu, Zefa Hu, Junlan Feng, Qi Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:39:00Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as conversational assistants in open-domain, multi-turn settings, where users often provide incomplete or ambiguous information. However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions. ClarifyMT-Bench establishes a reproducible foundation for studying when LLMs should ask, when they should answer, and how to navigate ambiguity in real-world human-LLM interactions.

### Sequence to Sequence Reward Modeling: Improving RLHF by Language Feedback
**Authors**: Jiayi Zhou, Jiaming Ji, Juntao Dai, Dong Li, Yaodong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:32:24Z

**Summary**: Aligning the behavior of Large language models (LLMs) with human intentions and values remains a critical challenge. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) aligns LLMs by training a reward model (RM) on human preferences and fine-tuning the LLMs to maximize RM feedback. Despite its effectiveness and popularity, RLHF is prone to biased local optimization. It means RM fails to provide feedback that accurately aligns with human preference, causing LLMs to explore unexpected generalizations, and failing to achieve alignment objectives. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel \textit{sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) reward modeling} method. Its key insight is that learning from language feedback rather than scalar feedback improves RLHF without additional annotations. We replaced the reward modeling target from binary maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with sequence MLE. This method enables richer and fine-grained language feedback without additional annotations, models, or training stages. Our experiments demonstrated its effectiveness, specifically, reducing the refusal-to-response paradigm in single-turn safety dialogues and the long-response bias in text summarization tasks. We provide further analysis that seq2seq RM improves RLHF performance across 2B and 7B LLMs on 3 NLP tasks, achieving an average win rate of 76.9\%. We further show that seq2seq RM can still improve the performance of RLHF under out-of-distribution prompts.

### Beyond Consensus: Mitigating the Agreeableness Bias in LLM Judge Evaluations
**Authors**: Suryaansh Jain, Umair Z. Ahmed, Shubham Sahai, Ben Leong

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:22:59Z

**Summary**: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw: LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often leads to inflated reliability scores.   While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366 high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

### Beyond Context: Large Language Models Failure to Grasp Users Intent
**Authors**: Ahmed M. Hussain, Salahuddin Salahuddin, Panos Papadimitratos

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:15:57Z

**Summary**: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) safety approaches focus on explicitly harmful content while overlooking a critical vulnerability: the inability to understand context and recognize user intent. This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms. We empirically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases. This pattern reveals that current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities. These limitations require paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc protective mechanisms.

### Semi-Supervised Learning for Large Language Models Safety and Content Moderation
**Authors**: Eduard Stefan Dinuta, Iustin Sirbu, Traian Rebedea

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:12:09Z

**Summary**: Safety for Large Language Models (LLMs) has been an ongoing research focus since their emergence and is even more relevant nowadays with the increasing capacity of those models. Currently, there are several guardrails in place for all public LLMs and multiple proposed datasets for training safety classifiers. However, training these safety classifiers relies on large quantities of labeled data, which can be problematic to acquire, prone to labeling errors, or often include synthetic data. To address these issues, we suggest a different approach: utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, to improve the performance on the safety task. We analyze the improvements that these techniques can offer for both prompts given to Large Language Models and the responses to those requests. Moreover, since augmentation is the central part of semi-supervised algorithms, we demonstrate the importance of using task-specific augmentations, which significantly increase the performance when compared to general-purpose augmentation techniques.

### Semantic Refinement with LLMs for Graph Representations
**Authors**: Safal Thapaliya, Zehong Wang, Jiazheng Li, Ziming Li, Yanfang Ye, Chuxu Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T11:10:28Z

**Summary**: Graph-structured data exhibit substantial heterogeneity in where their predictive signals originate: in some domains, node-level semantics dominate, while in others, structural patterns play a central role. This structure-semantics heterogeneity implies that no graph learning model with a fixed inductive bias can generalize optimally across diverse graph domains. However, most existing methods address this challenge from the model side by incrementally injecting new inductive biases, which remains fundamentally limited given the open-ended diversity of real-world graphs. In this work, we take a data-centric perspective and treat node semantics as a task-adaptive variable. We propose a Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement framework DAS for graph representation learning, which couples a fixed graph neural network (GNN) and a large language model (LLM) in a closed feedback loop. The GNN provides implicit supervisory signals to guide the semantic refinement of LLM, and the refined semantics are fed back to update the same graph learner. We evaluate our approach on both text-rich and text-free graphs. Results show consistent improvements on structure-dominated graphs while remaining competitive on semantics-rich graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-centric semantic adaptation under structure-semantics heterogeneity.

### Towards a Zero Trust Decentralized Identity Management System for Secure Autonomous Vehicles
**Authors**: Amal Yousseef, Shalaka Satam, Banafsheh Saber Latibari, Mai Abdel-Malek, Soheil Salehi, Pratik Satam

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T10:06:21Z

**Summary**: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on pervasive connectivity to enable cooperative and safety-critical applications, but this connectivity also exposes them to a wide range of cybersecurity threats. Existing perimeter-based security and centralized identity management approaches are inadequate for highly dynamic V2X environments, as they depend on implicit trust and suffer from scalability and single-point-of-failure limitations. This paper proposes D-IM, a Zero Trust-based decentralized identity management and authentication framework for secure V2X communication. D-IM integrates continuous verification with a permissioned blockchain to eliminate centralized trust assumptions and enforce explicit, verifiable identity relationships among vehicles and infrastructure. The framework is designed around clear Zero Trust-aligned goals, including mutual authentication, decentralization, privacy protection, non-repudiation, and traceability, and addresses a comprehensive attacker model covering identity, data integrity, collusion, availability, and accountability threats. We present the D-IM system architecture and identification and authorization protocol, and validate its security properties through both qualitative analysis and a formal BAN logic-based verification. Simulation results in urban and highway scenarios using DSRC and C-V2X demonstrate that D-IM introduces limited overhead while preserving network performance, supporting its practicality for real-world AV deployments.

### LLM Personas as a Substitute for Field Experiments in Method Benchmarking
**Authors**: Enoch Hyunwook Kang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T09:56:00Z

**Summary**: Field experiments (A/B tests) are often the most credible benchmark for methods in societal systems, but their cost and latency create a major bottleneck for iterative method development. LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.

**Authors**: Mohsin Khan, Matti Hämäläinen, Timo J. Mäkelä, Erkki Harjula, Jani Katisko

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T09:55:51Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates the feasibility of deploying private 5G networks in hospital environments, with a focus on the operating room at the brand new Oulu University Hospital, Finland. The study aims to evaluate the interference risk with other wireless systems, and electromagnetic safety of a private 5G network in the 3.9-4.1 GHz band, while ensuring compatibility with legacy wireless systems, such as LTE and Wi-Fi. We conducted a measurement campaign, employing state-of-the-art instrumentation and a methodology that combined high resolution and long-duration spectrum scans. The results demonstrate no measurable interference between the hospital's private 5G network with adjacent LTE (4G) or Wi-Fi bands, confirming the spectral isolation of the 5G transmissions, and vise versa. Additionally, RF exposure levels in the operating room were found to be well below ICNIRP, WHO, and IEEE safety thresholds, ensuring that the network poses negligible biological risk to patients and hospital staff. The study also proposes spectrum management strategies for private 5G networks in hospitals, focusing on adaptive sensing and guardband planning. These findings provide a solid foundation for the integration of private 5G infrastructure in hospitals environments, supporting digital transformation in patient care without compromising electromagnetic compatibility or patient safety. The results also contribute to ongoing discussions around private 5G network deployments in sensitive sectors and provide actionable guidelines for future hospitals' wireless systems planning.

### Defining Cost Function of Steganography with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Hanzhou Wu, Yige Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T09:53:41Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we make the first attempt towards defining cost function of steganography with large language models (LLMs), which is totally different from previous works that rely heavily on expert knowledge or require large-scale datasets for cost learning. To achieve this goal, a two-stage strategy combining LLM-guided program synthesis with evolutionary search is applied in the proposed method. In the first stage, a certain number of cost functions in the form of computer programs are synthesized from LLM responses to structured prompts. These cost functions are then evaluated with pretrained steganalysis models so that candidate cost functions suited to steganography can be collected. In the second stage, by retraining a steganalysis model for each candidate cost function, the optimal cost function(s) can be determined according to the detection accuracy. This two-stage strategy is performed by an iterative fashion so that the best cost function can be collected at the last iteration. Experiments show that the proposed method enables LLMs to design new cost functions of steganography that significantly outperform existing works in terms of resisting steganalysis tools, which verifies the superiority of the proposed method. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first work applying LLMs to the design of advanced cost function of steganography, which presents a novel perspective for steganography design and may shed light on further research.

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T09:40:00Z

**Summary**: Code generation has emerged as a critical research area at the intersection of Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), attracting significant attention from both academia and industry. Within this broader landscape, Verilog, as a representative hardware description language (HDL), plays a fundamental role in digital circuit design and verification, making its automated generation particularly significant for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Consequently, recent research has increasingly focused on applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to Verilog code generation, particularly at the Register Transfer Level (RTL), exploring how these AI-driven techniques can be effectively integrated into hardware design workflows. Despite substantial research efforts have explored LLM applications in this domain, a comprehensive survey synthesizing these developments remains absent from the literature. This review fill addresses this gap by providing a systematic literature review of LLM-based methods for Verilog code generation, examining their effectiveness, limitations, and potential for advancing automated hardware design. The review encompasses research work from conferences and journals in the fields of SE, AI, and EDA, encompassing 70 papers published on venues, along with 32 high-quality preprint papers, bringing the total to 102 papers. By answering four key research questions, we aim to (1) identify the LLMs used for Verilog generation, (2) examine the datasets and metrics employed in evaluation, (3) categorize the techniques proposed for Verilog generation, and (4) analyze LLM alignment approaches for Verilog generation. Based on our findings, we have identified a series of limitations of existing studies. Finally, we have outlined a roadmap highlighting potential opportunities for future research endeavors in LLM-assisted hardware design.

### Agentic Explainable Artificial Intelligence (Agentic XAI) Approach To Explore Better Explanation
**Authors**: Tomoaki Yamaguchi, Yutong Zhou, Masahiro Ryo, Keisuke Katsura

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T09:19:15Z

**Summary**: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.

### Language-Guided Grasp Detection with Coarse-to-Fine Learning for Robotic Manipulation
**Authors**: Zebin Jiang, Tianle Jin, Xiangtong Yao, Alois Knoll, Hu Cao

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T09:16:42Z

**Summary**: Grasping is one of the most fundamental challenging capabilities in robotic manipulation, especially in unstructured, cluttered, and semantically diverse environments. Recent researches have increasingly explored language-guided manipulation, where robots not only perceive the scene but also interpret task-relevant natural language instructions. However, existing language-conditioned grasping methods typically rely on shallow fusion strategies, leading to limited semantic grounding and weak alignment between linguistic intent and visual grasp reasoning.In this work, we propose Language-Guided Grasp Detection (LGGD) with a coarse-to-fine learning paradigm for robotic manipulation. LGGD leverages CLIP-based visual and textual embeddings within a hierarchical cross-modal fusion pipeline, progressively injecting linguistic cues into the visual feature reconstruction process. This design enables fine-grained visual-semantic alignment and improves the feasibility of the predicted grasps with respect to task instructions. In addition, we introduce a language-conditioned dynamic convolution head (LDCH) that mixes multiple convolution experts based on sentence-level features, enabling instruction-adaptive coarse mask and grasp predictions. A final refinement module further enhances grasp consistency and robustness in complex scenes.Experiments on the OCID-VLG and Grasp-Anything++ datasets show that LGGD surpasses existing language-guided grasping methods, exhibiting strong generalization to unseen objects and diverse language queries. Moreover, deployment on a real robotic platform demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach in executing accurate, instruction-conditioned grasp actions. The code will be released publicly upon acceptance.

### Towards Hierarchical Multi-Agent Decision-Making for Uncertainty-Aware EV Charging
**Authors**: Lo Pang-Yun Ting, Ali Şenol, Huan-Yang Wang, Hsu-Chao Lai, Kun-Ta Chuang, Huan Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T09:13:05Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in bidirectional EV charging and discharging systems have spurred interest in workplace applications. However, real-world deployments face various dynamic factors, such as fluctuating electricity prices and uncertain EV departure times, that hinder effective energy management. To address these issues and minimize building electricity costs while meeting EV charging requirements, we design a hierarchical multi-agent structure in which a high-level agent coordinates overall charge or discharge decisions based on real-time pricing, while multiple low-level agents manage individual power level accordingly. For uncertain EV departure times, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware critic augmentation mechanism for low-level agents that improves the evaluation of power-level decisions and ensures robust control under such uncertainty. Building upon these two key designs, we introduce HUCA, a real-time charging control framework that coordinates energy supply among the building and EVs. Experiments on real-world electricity datasets show that HUCA significantly reduces electricity costs and maintains competitive performance in meeting EV charging requirements under both simulated certain and uncertain departure scenarios. The results further highlight the importance of hierarchical control and the proposed critic augmentation under the uncertain departure scenario. A case study illustrates HUCA's capability to allocate energy between the building and EVs in real time, underscoring its potential for practical use.

### Intervention Efficiency and Perturbation Validation Framework: Capacity-Aware and Robust Clinical Model Selection under the Rashomon Effect
**Authors**: Yuwen Zhang, Viet Tran, Paul Weng

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T09:06:26Z

**Summary**: In clinical machine learning, the coexistence of multiple models with comparable performance (a manifestation of the Rashomon Effect) poses fundamental challenges for trustworthy deployment and evaluation. Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.

**Authors**: Jingjing Qu, Kejia Hu, Jun Zhu, Yulei Ye, Wenhao Li, Teng Wang, Zhiyun Chen, Chaochao Lu, Aimin Zhou, Xiangfeng Wang, Xia Hu, James Evans

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:52:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable unprecedented social science experimentation by creating controlled hybrid human-AI environments. We introduce Epitome (www.epitome-ai.com), an open experimental platform that operationalizes this paradigm through Matrix-like social worlds where researchers can study isolated human subjects and groups interacting with LLM agents. This maintains ecological validity while enabling precise manipulation of social dynamics. Epitome approaches three frontiers: (1) methodological innovation using LLM confederates to reduce complexity while scaling interactions; (2) empirical investigation of human behavior in AI-saturated environments; and (3) exploration of emergent properties in hybrid collectives. Drawing on interdisciplinary foundations from management, communication, sociology, psychology, and ethics, the platform's modular architecture spans foundation model deployment through data collection. We validate Epitome through replication of three seminal experiments, demonstrating capacity to generate robust findings while reducing experimental complexity. This tool provides crucial insights for understanding how humans navigate AI-mediated social realities, knowledge essential for policy, education, and human-centered AI design.

### Rethinking Direct Preference Optimization in Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Junyong Kang, Seohyun Lim, Kyungjune Baek, Hyunjung Shim

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:49:27Z

**Summary**: Aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences has emerged as a critical research challenge. While recent advances in this area have extended preference optimization techniques from large language models (LLMs) to the diffusion setting, they often struggle with limited exploration. In this work, we propose a novel and orthogonal approach to enhancing diffusion-based preference optimization. First, we introduce a stable reference model update strategy that relaxes the frozen reference model, encouraging exploration while maintaining a stable optimization anchor through reference model regularization. Second, we present a timestep-aware training strategy that mitigates the reward scale imbalance problem across timesteps. Our method can be integrated into various preference optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that our approach improves the performance of state-of-the-art methods on human preference evaluation benchmarks. The code is available at the Github: https://github.com/kaist-cvml/RethinkingDPO_Diffusion_Models.

### Making AI Work: An Autoethnography of a Workaround in Higher Education
**Authors**: Shang Chieh Lee, Bhuva Narayan, Simon Buckingham Shum, Stella Ng, A. Baki Kocaballi

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:48:18Z

**Summary**: Research on the implementation of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in higher education often focuses on strategic goals, overlooking the hidden, and often politically charged, labour required to make it functional. This paper provides an insider's account of the sociotechnical friction that arises when an institutional goal of empowering non-technical staff conflicts with the technical limitations of enterprise Large Language Models (LLMs). Through analytic autoethnography, this study examines a GenAI project pushed to an impasse, focusing on a workaround developed to navigate not only technical constraints but also the combined challenge of organisational territoriality and assertions of positional power. Drawing upon Alter's (2014) theory of workarounds, the analysis interprets "articulation work" as a form of "invisible labour". By engaging with the Information Systems (IS) domains of user innovation and technology-in-practice, this study argues that such user-driven workarounds should be understood not as deviations, but as integral acts of sociotechnical integration. This integration, however, highlights the central paradoxes of modern GenAI where such workarounds for "unfinished" systems can simultaneously create unofficial "shadow" systems and obscure the crucial, yet invisible, sociotechnical labour involved. The findings suggest that the invisible labour required to integrate GenAI within complex organisational politics is an important, rather than peripheral, component of how it becomes functional in practice.

### Case Prompting to Mitigate Large Language Model Bias for ICU Mortality Prediction
**Authors**: Gangxiong Zhang, Yongchao Long, Yong Zhang, Yuxi Zhou, Shenda Hong

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:34:41Z

**Summary**: Accurate mortality risk prediction for intensive care unit (ICU) patients is essential for clinical decision-making. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction, and that a carefully designed prompting framework can effectively co-optimize fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support.

### zkFL-Health: Blockchain-Enabled Zero-Knowledge Federated Learning for Medical AI Privacy
**Authors**: Savvy Sharma, George Petrovic, Sarthak Kaushik

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:29:28Z

**Summary**: Healthcare AI needs large, diverse datasets, yet strict privacy and governance constraints prevent raw data sharing across institutions. Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by training where data reside and exchanging only model updates, but practical deployments still face two core risks: (1) privacy leakage via gradients or updates (membership inference, gradient inversion) and (2) trust in the aggregator, a single point of failure that can drop, alter, or inject contributions undetected. We present zkFL-Health, an architecture that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deliver privacy-preserving, verifiably correct collaborative training for medical AI. Clients locally train and commit their updates; the aggregator operates within a TEE to compute the global update and produces a succinct ZK proof (via Halo2/Nova) that it used exactly the committed inputs and the correct aggregation rule, without revealing any client update to the host. Verifier nodes validate the proof and record cryptographic commitments on-chain, providing an immutable audit trail and removing the need to trust any single party. We outline system and threat models tailored to healthcare, the zkFL-Health protocol, security/privacy guarantees, and a performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost. This framework enables multi-institutional medical AI with strong confidentiality, integrity, and auditability, key properties for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance.

### Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable yet Noisy Rewards under Imperfect Verifiers
**Authors**: Xin-Qiang Cai, Wei Wang, Feng Liu, Tongliang Liu, Gang Niu, Masashi Sugiyama

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:25:26Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) replaces costly human labeling with automated verifiers. To reduce verifier hacking, many RLVR systems binarize rewards to $\{0,1\}$, but imperfect verifiers inevitably introduce \emph{false negatives} (rejecting correct answers) and \emph{false positives} (accepting incorrect ones). We formalize verifier unreliability as a stochastic reward channel with asymmetric noise rates $ρ_0$ and $ρ_1$ -- the FP rate and the FN rate, respectively. From this abstraction we derive two lightweight corrections: (i) a \emph{backward} correction that yields an unbiased surrogate reward and thus an unbiased policy-gradient estimator in expectation, and (ii) a \emph{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so the expected update aligns with the clean gradient direction and requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group relative policy optimization pipeline, both corrections improve RLVR for math reasoning under synthetic and real verifier noise, with the forward variant being more stable under heavier noise. Finally, an appeals mechanism with a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate online and further improves performance.

**Authors**: Zijian Li, Luzhen Tang, Mengyu Xia, Xinyu Li, Naping Chen, Dragan Gašević, Yizhou Fan

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:10:02Z

**Summary**: With generative artificial intelligence driving the growth of dialogic data in education, automated coding is a promising direction for learning analytics to improve efficiency. This surge highlights the need to understand the nuances of student-AI interactions, especially those rare yet crucial. However, automated coding may struggle to capture these rare codes due to imbalanced data, while human coding remains time-consuming and labour-intensive. The current study examined the potential of large language models (LLMs) to approximate or replace humans in deductive, theory-driven coding, while also exploring how human-AI collaboration might support such coding tasks at scale. We compared the coding performance of small transformer classifiers (e.g., BERT) and LLMs in two datasets, with particular attention to imbalanced head-tail distributions in dialogue codes. Our results showed that LLMs did not outperform BERT-based models and exhibited systematic errors and biases in deductive coding tasks. We designed and evaluated a human-AI collaborative workflow that improved coding efficiency while maintaining coding reliability. Our findings reveal both the limitations of LLMs -- especially their difficulties with semantic similarity and theoretical interpretations and the indispensable role of human judgment -- while demonstrating the practical promise of human-AI collaborative workflows for coding.

**Authors**: Roopa Bukke, Soumya Pandey, Suraj Kumar, Soumi Chattopadhyay, Chandranath Adak

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T08:06:52Z

**Summary**: The rapid proliferation of online misinformation poses significant risks to public trust, policy, and safety, necessitating reliable automated fake news detection. Existing methods often struggle with multimodal content, domain generalization, and explainability. We propose AMPEND-LS, an agentic multi-persona evidence-grounded framework with LLM-SLM synergy for multimodal fake news detection. AMPEND-LS integrates textual, visual, and contextual signals through a structured reasoning pipeline powered by LLMs, augmented with reverse image search, knowledge graph paths, and persuasion strategy analysis. To improve reliability, we introduce a credibility fusion mechanism combining semantic similarity, domain trustworthiness, and temporal context, and a complementary SLM classifier to mitigate LLM uncertainty and hallucinations. Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMPEND-LS consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy, F1 score, and robustness. Qualitative case studies further highlight its transparent reasoning and resilience against evolving misinformation. This work advances the development of adaptive, explainable, and evidence-aware systems for safeguarding online information integrity.

### Larger Is Not Always Better: Leveraging Structured Code Diffs for Comment Inconsistency Detection
**Authors**: Phong Nguyen, Anh M. T. Bui, Phuong T. Nguyen

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:58:28Z

**Summary**: Ensuring semantic consistency between source code and its accompanying comments is crucial for program comprehension, effective debugging, and long-term maintainability. Comment inconsistency arises when developers modify code but neglect to update the corresponding comments, potentially misleading future maintainers and introducing errors. Recent approaches to code-comment inconsistency (CCI) detection leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and rely on capturing the semantic relationship between code changes and outdated comments. However, they often ignore the structural complexity of code evolution, including historical change activities, and introduce privacy and resource challenges. In this paper, we propose a Just-In-Time CCI detection approach built upon the CodeT5+ backbone. Our method decomposes code changes into ordered sequences of modification activities such as replacing, deleting, and adding to more effectively capture the correlation between these changes and the corresponding outdated comments. Extensive experiments conducted on publicly available benchmark datasets-JITDATA and CCIBENCH--demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art models by up to 13.54% in F1-Score and achieves an improvement ranging from 4.18% to 10.94% over fine-tuned LLMs including DeepSeek-Coder, CodeLlama and Qwen2.5-Coder.

### Learning the Macroeconomic Language
**Authors**: Siddhartha Chib, Fei Tan

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:55:31Z

**Summary**: We show how state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), seemingly inapplicable to the small samples typical of macroeconomics, can be trained to learn the language of macroeconomy. We estimate a large-scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model on an initial segment of the data and obtain a posterior distribution over structural parameters. We sample from this posterior to generate millions of theory-consistent synthetic panels that, when mixed with actual macroeconomic data, form the training corpus for a time-series transformer with attention. The trained model is then used to forecast out-of-sample through 2025. The results show that this hybrid forecaster, which combines the theoretical coherence of DSGE models with the representational power of modern LLMs, successfully learns the macroeconomic language.

### Artificial or Just Artful? Do LLMs Bend the Rules in Programming?
**Authors**: Oussama Ben Sghaier, Kevin Delcourt, Houari Sahraoui

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:51:15Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation, yet their apparent successes often mask a tension between pretraining objectives and alignment choices. While pretraining encourages models to exploit all available signals to maximize success, alignment, whether through fine-tuning or prompting, may restrict their use. This conflict is especially salient in agentic AI settings, for instance when an agent has access to unit tests that, although intended for validation, act as strong contextual signals that can be leveraged regardless of explicit prohibitions. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs adapt their code generation strategies when exposed to test cases under different prompting conditions. Using the BigCodeBench (Hard) dataset, we design five prompting conditions that manipulate test visibility and impose explicit or implicit restrictions on their use. We evaluate five LLMs (four open-source and one closed-source) across correctness, code similarity, program size, and code churn, and analyze cross-model consistency to identify recurring adaptation strategies. Our results show that test visibility dramatically alters performance, correctness nearly doubles for some models, while explicit restrictions or partial exposure only partially mitigate this effect. Beyond raw performance, we identify four recurring adaptation strategies, with test-driven refinement emerging as the most frequent. These results highlight how LLMs adapt their behavior when exposed to contextual signals that conflict with explicit instructions, providing useful insight into how models reconcile pretraining objectives with alignment constraints.

### Learning to Compress: Unlocking the Potential of Large Language Models for Text Representation
**Authors**: Yeqin Zhang, Yizheng Zhao, Chen Hu, Binxing Jiao, Daxin Jiang, Ruihang Miao, Cam-Tu Nguyen

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:50:00Z

**Summary**: Text representation plays a critical role in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and other downstream applications. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data. Code is available at https://github.com/longtaizi13579/LLM2Comp.

### V-Rex: Real-Time Streaming Video LLM Acceleration via Dynamic KV Cache Retrieval
**Authors**: Donghyuk Kim, Sejeong Yang, Wonjin Shin, Joo-Young Kim

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:46:59Z

**Summary**: Streaming video large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for real-time multimodal tasks such as video captioning, question answering, conversational agents, and augmented reality. However, these models face fundamental memory and computational challenges because their key-value (KV) caches grow substantially with continuous streaming video input. This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Due to its iterative prefill stage, it suffers from significant limitations, including extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in accuracy. Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment, which is the primary target for these models.   In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. At its core, V-Rex introduces ReSV, a training-free dynamic KV cache retrieval algorithm. ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames. To fully realize these algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring bit-level and early-exit based computing units. V-Rex achieves unprecedented real-time of 3.9-8.3 FPS and energy-efficient streaming video LLM inference on edge deployment with negligible accuracy loss. While DRE only accounts for 2.2% power and 2.0% area, the system delivers 1.9-19.7x speedup and 3.1-18.5x energy efficiency improvements over AGX Orin GPU. This work is the first to comprehensively tackle KV cache retrieval across algorithms and hardware, enabling real-time streaming video LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices.

### Policy-Conditioned Policies for Multi-Agent Task Solving
**Authors**: Yue Lin, Shuhui Zhu, Wenhao Li, Ang Li, Dan Qiao, Pascal Poupart, Hongyuan Zha, Baoxiang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:42:10Z

**Summary**: In multi-agent tasks, the central challenge lies in the dynamic adaptation of strategies. However, directly conditioning on opponents' strategies is intractable in the prevalent deep reinforcement learning paradigm due to a fundamental ``representational bottleneck'': neural policies are opaque, high-dimensional parameter vectors that are incomprehensible to other agents. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift that bridges this gap by representing policies as human-interpretable source code and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as approximate interpreters. This programmatic representation allows us to operationalize the game-theoretic concept of \textit{Program Equilibrium}. We reformulate the learning problem by utilizing LLMs to perform optimization directly in the space of programmatic policies. The LLM functions as a point-wise best-response operator that iteratively synthesizes and refines the ego agent's policy code to respond to the opponent's strategy. We formalize this process as \textit{Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR)}, an algorithm where the policy code is optimized by textual gradients, using structured feedback derived from game utility and runtime unit tests. We demonstrate that this approach effectively solves several standard coordination matrix games and a cooperative Level-Based Foraging environment.

### Steering Vision-Language Pre-trained Models for Incremental Face Presentation Attack Detection
**Authors**: Haoze Li, Jie Zhang, Guoying Zhao, Stephen Lin, Shiguang Shan

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:36:25Z

**Summary**: Face Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) demands incremental learning (IL) to combat evolving spoofing tactics and domains. Privacy regulations, however, forbid retaining past data, necessitating rehearsal-free IL (RF-IL). Vision-Language Pre-trained (VLP) models, with their prompt-tunable cross-modal representations, enable efficient adaptation to new spoofing styles and domains. Capitalizing on this strength, we propose \textbf{SVLP-IL}, a VLP-based RF-IL framework that balances stability and plasticity via \textit{Multi-Aspect Prompting} (MAP) and \textit{Selective Elastic Weight Consolidation} (SEWC). MAP isolates domain dependencies, enhances distribution-shift sensitivity, and mitigates forgetting by jointly exploiting universal and domain-specific cues. SEWC selectively preserves critical weights from previous tasks, retaining essential knowledge while allowing flexibility for new adaptations. Comprehensive experiments across multiple PAD benchmarks show that SVLP-IL significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting and enhances performance on unseen domains. SVLP-IL offers a privacy-compliant, practical solution for robust lifelong PAD deployment in RF-IL settings.

### Towards Better Search with Domain-Aware Text Embeddings for C2C Marketplaces
**Authors**: Andre Rusli, Miao Cao, Shoma Ishimoto, Sho Akiyama, Max Frenzel

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:35:17Z

**Summary**: Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplaces pose distinct retrieval challenges: short, ambiguous queries; noisy, user-generated listings; and strict production constraints. This paper reports our experiment to build a domain-aware Japanese text-embedding approach to improve the quality of search at Mercari, Japan's largest C2C marketplace. We experimented with fine-tuning on purchase-driven query-title pairs, using role-specific prefixes to model query-item asymmetry. To meet production constraints, we apply Matryoshka Representation Learning to obtain compact, truncation-robust embeddings. Offline evaluation on historical search logs shows consistent gains over a strong generic encoder, with particularly large improvements when replacing PCA compression with Matryoshka truncation. A manual assessment further highlights better handling of proper nouns, marketplace-specific semantics, and term-importance alignment. Additionally, an initial online A/B test demonstrates statistically significant improvements in revenue per user and search-flow efficiency, with transaction frequency maintained. Results show that domain-aware embeddings improve relevance and efficiency at scale and form a practical foundation for richer LLM-era search experiences.

### LLM4Perf: Large Language Models Are Effective Samplers for Multi-Objective Performance Modeling
**Authors**: Xin Wang, Zhenhao Li, Zishuo Ding

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:33:31Z

**Summary**: The performance of modern software systems is critically dependent on their complex configuration options. Building accurate performance models to navigate this vast space requires effective sampling strategies, yet existing methods often struggle with multi-objective optimization and cannot leverage semantic information from documentation. The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) motivates the central question of this work: Can LLMs serve as effective samplers for multi-objective performance modeling? To explore this, we present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the capabilities and characteristics of LLM-driven sampling. We design and implement LLM4Perf, a feedback-based framework, and use it to systematically evaluate the LLM-guided sampling process across four highly configurable, real-world systems. Our study reveals that the LLM-guided approach outperforms traditional baselines in most cases. Quantitatively, LLM4Perf achieves the best performance in nearly 68.8% (77 out of 112) of all evaluation scenarios, demonstrating its superior effectiveness. We find this effectiveness stems from the LLM's dual capabilities of configuration space pruning and feedback-driven strategy refinement. The effectiveness of this pruning is further validated by the fact that it also improves the performance of the baseline methods in nearly 91.5% (410 out of 448) of cases. Furthermore, we show how the LLM choices for each component and hyperparameters within LLM4Perf affect its effectiveness. Overall, this paper provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of LLMs in performance engineering and offers concrete insights into the mechanisms that drive their success.

### Rethinking Supervised Fine-Tuning: Emphasizing Key Answer Tokens for Improved LLM Accuracy
**Authors**: Xiaofeng Shi, Qian Kou, Yuduo Li, Hua Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:24:31Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) component has become significant for complex reasoning tasks. However, in conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), the model could allocate disproportionately more attention to CoT sequences with excessive length. This reduces focus on the much shorter but essential Key portion-the final answer, whose correctness directly determines task success and evaluation quality. To address this limitation, we propose SFTKey, a two-stage training scheme. In the first stage, conventional SFT is applied to ensure proper output format, while in the second stage, only the Key portion is fine-tuned to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families demonstrate that SFTKey achieves an average accuracy improvement exceeding 5\% over conventional SFT, while preserving the ability to generate correct formats. Overall, this study advances LLM fine-tuning by explicitly balancing CoT learning with additional optimization on answer-relevant tokens.

### Fundamental Phase Noise in Thin Film Lithium Niobate Resonators
**Authors**: Ran Yin, Yue Yu, Chunho Lee, Ian Christen, Zaijun Chen, Mengjie Yu

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:18:42Z

**Summary**: Fundamental phase noise in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic integrated circuits is governed by thermal-charge-carrier-refractive (TCCR) dynamics arising from thermally driven carrier fluctuations. In contrast to the predominantly thermorefractive noise in silicon photonic platforms, TCCR noise represents a distinct mechanism that becomes critical for applications requiring high frequency stability and phase coherence, including optomechanical sensing, low-phase-noise microwave synthesis, and on-chip quantum squeezing. A quantitative understanding of the deterministic parameters that control TCCR noise is therefore essential for engineering the next generation of low-noise TFLN photonic systems. Here, we identify two dominant contributors to the TCCR noise in TFLN microresonators: material anisotropy and surface states. Material anisotropy results in increased noise for extraordinarily polarized optical modes and leads to a geometry dependent phase noise. Surface-state effects manifest as increased noise in higher-order transverse modes as well as more than 120-fold higher noise in suspended microresonators. Finally, we demonstrate that post-fabrication annealing -- widely used to reduce defect densities and recover crystal quality -- suppresses frequency noise by a factor of 8.2 in cladded microresonators. Together, these results establish a practical pathway for noise engineering in TFLN integrated photonic devices and accelerate their deployment in next-generation precision photonic systems.

### LLM Swiss Round: Aggregating Multi-Benchmark Performance via Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics
**Authors**: Jiashuo Liu, Jiayun Wu, Chunjie Wu, Jingkai Liu, Zaiyuan Wang, Huan Zhou, Wenhao Huang, Hongseok Namkoong

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:14:31Z

**Summary**: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and diverse specialized benchmarks necessitates a shift from fragmented, task-specific metrics to a holistic, competitive ranking system that effectively aggregates performance across multiple ability dimensions. Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation.

### GateBreaker: Gate-Guided Attacks on Mixture-of-Expert LLMs
**Authors**: Lichao Wu, Sasha Behrouzi, Mohamadreza Rostami, Stjepan Picek, Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T07:13:24Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have advanced the scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) by activating only a sparse subset of parameters per input, enabling state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational cost. As these models are increasingly deployed in critical domains, understanding and strengthening their alignment mechanisms is essential to prevent harmful outputs. However, existing LLM safety research has focused almost exclusively on dense architectures, leaving the unique safety properties of MoEs largely unexamined. The modular, sparsely-activated design of MoEs suggests that safety mechanisms may operate differently than in dense models, raising questions about their robustness.   In this paper, we present GateBreaker, the first training-free, lightweight, and architecture-agnostic attack framework that compromises the safety alignment of modern MoE LLMs at inference time. GateBreaker operates in three stages: (i) gate-level profiling, which identifies safety experts disproportionately routed on harmful inputs, (ii) expert-level localization, which localizes the safety structure within safety experts, and (iii) targeted safety removal, which disables the identified safety structure to compromise the safety alignment. Our study shows that MoE safety concentrates within a small subset of neurons coordinated by sparse routing. Selective disabling of these neurons, approximately 3% of neurons in the targeted expert layers, significantly increases the averaged attack success rate (ASR) from 7.4% to 64.9% against the eight latest aligned MoE LLMs with limited utility degradation. These safety neurons transfer across models within the same family, raising ASR from 17.9% to 67.7% with one-shot transfer attack. Furthermore, GateBreaker generalizes to five MoE vision language models (VLMs) with 60.9% ASR on unsafe image inputs.

### Neural Dynamic Data Valuation: A Stochastic Optimal Control Approach
**Authors**: Zhangyong Liang, Ji Zhang, Xin Wang, Pengfei Zhang, Zhao Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:59:27Z

**Summary**: Data valuation has become a cornerstone of the modern data economy, where datasets function as tradable intellectual assets that drive decision-making, model training, and market transactions. Despite substantial progress, existing valuation methods remain limited by high computational cost, weak fairness guarantees, and poor interpretability, which hinder their deployment in large-scale, high-stakes applications. This paper introduces Neural Dynamic Data Valuation (NDDV), a new framework that formulates data valuation as a stochastic optimal control problem to capture the dynamic evolution of data utility over time. Unlike static combinatorial approaches, NDDV models data interactions through continuous trajectories that reflect both individual and collective learning dynamics.

### Distilling the Essence: Efficient Reasoning Distillation via Sequence Truncation
**Authors**: Wei-Rui Chen, Vignesh Kothapalli, Ata Fatahibaarzi, Hejian Sang, Shao Tang, Qingquan Song, Zhipeng Wang, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:57:35Z

**Summary**: Distilling the reasoning capabilities from a large language model (LLM) to a smaller student model often involves training on substantial amounts of reasoning data. However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\approx94\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\%$ each. These findings suggest that reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens and provides a simple lever for computation-quality tradeoffs.

### CoSeNet: A Novel Approach for Optimal Segmentation of Correlation Matrices
**Authors**: Alberto. Palomo-Alonso, David Casillas-Perez, Silvia Jimenez-Fernandez, Antonio Portilla-Figueras, Sancho Salcedo-Sanz

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:55:43Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the optimal identification of correlated segments in noisy correlation matrices. The proposed model is known as CoSeNet (Correlation Seg-mentation Network) and is based on a four-layer algorithmic architecture that includes several processing layers: input, formatting, re-scaling, and segmentation layer. The proposed model can effectively identify correlated segments in such matrices, better than previous approaches for similar problems. Internally, the proposed model utilizes an overlapping technique and uses pre-trained Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, which makes it robust and generalizable. CoSeNet approach also includes a method that optimizes the parameters of the re-scaling layer using a heuristic algorithm and fitness based on a Window Difference-based metric. The output of the model is a binary noise-free matrix representing optimal segmentation as well as its seg-mentation points and can be used in a variety of applications, obtaining compromise solutions between efficiency, memory, and speed of the proposed deployment model.

### LLM-Empowered Agentic AI for QoE-Aware Network Slicing Management in Industrial IoT
**Authors**: Xudong Wang, Lei Feng, Ruichen Zhang, Fanqin Zhou, Hongyang Du, Wenjing Li, Dusit Niyato, Abbas Jamalipour, Ping Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:49:43Z

**Summary**: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requires networks that deliver ultra-low latency, high reliability, and cost efficiency, which traditional optimization methods and deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approaches struggle to provide under dynamic and heterogeneous workloads. To address this gap, large language model (LLM)-empowered agentic AI has emerged as a promising paradigm, integrating reasoning, planning, and adaptation to enable QoE-aware network management. In this paper, we explore the integration of agentic AI into QoE-aware network slicing for IIoT. We first review the network slicing management architecture, QoE metrics for IIoT applications, and the challenges of dynamically managing heterogeneous network slices, while highlighting the motivations and advantages of adopting agentic AI. We then present the workflow of agentic AI-based slicing management, illustrating the full lifecycle of AI agents from processing slice requests to constructing slice instances and performing dynamic adjustments. Furthermore, we propose an LLM-empowered agentic AI approach for slicing management, which integrates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for semantic intent inference, a DRL-based orchestrator for slicing configuration, and an incremental memory mechanism for continual learning and adaptation. Through a case study on heterogeneous slice management, we demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other baselines in balancing latency, reliability, and cost, and achieves up to a 19% improvement in slice availability ratio.

### TrafficSimAgent: A Hierarchical Agent Framework for Autonomous Traffic Simulation with MCP Control
**Authors**: Yuwei Du, Jun Zhang, Jie Feng, Zhicheng Liu, Jian Yuan, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:48:04Z

**Summary**: Traffic simulation is important for transportation optimization and policy making. While existing simulators such as SUMO and MATSim offer fully-featured platforms and utilities, users without too much knowledge about these platforms often face significant challenges when conducting experiments from scratch and applying them to their daily work. To solve this challenge, we propose TrafficSimAgent, an LLM-based agent framework that serves as an expert in experiment design and decision optimization for general-purpose traffic simulation tasks. The framework facilitates execution through cross-level collaboration among expert agents: high-level expert agents comprehend natural language instructions with high flexibility, plan the overall experiment workflow, and invoke corresponding MCP-compatible tools on demand; meanwhile, low-level expert agents select optimal action plans for fundamental elements based on real-time traffic conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios show that TrafficSimAgent effectively executes simulations under various conditions and consistently produces reasonable outcomes even when user instructions are ambiguous. Besides, the carefully designed expert-level autonomous decision-driven optimization in TrafficSimAgent yields superior performance when compared with other systems and SOTA LLM based methods.

### AegisAgent: An Autonomous Defense Agent Against Prompt Injection Attacks in LLM-HARs
**Authors**: Yihan Wang, Huanqi Yang, Shantanu Pal, Weitao Xu

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:29:24Z

**Summary**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into wearable sensing is creating a new class of mobile applications capable of nuanced human activity understanding. However, the reliability of these systems is critically undermined by their vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, where attackers deliberately input deceptive instructions into LLMs. Traditional defenses, based on static filters and rigid rules, are insufficient to address the semantic complexity of these new attacks. We argue that a paradigm shift is needed -- from passive filtering to active protection and autonomous reasoning. We introduce AegisAgent, an autonomous agent system designed to ensure the security of LLM-driven HAR systems. Instead of merely blocking threats, AegisAgent functions as a cognitive guardian. It autonomously perceives potential semantic inconsistencies, reasons about the user's true intent by consulting a dynamic memory of past interactions, and acts by generating and executing a multi-step verification and repair plan. We implement AegisAgent as a lightweight, full-stack prototype and conduct a systematic evaluation on 15 common attacks with five state-of-the-art LLM-based HAR systems on three public datasets. Results show it reduces attack success rate by 30\% on average while incurring only 78.6 ms of latency overhead on a GPU workstation. Our work makes the first step towards building secure and trustworthy LLM-driven HAR systems.

**Authors**: Oleksii Proniakin, Diego Fajardo, Ruslan Nazarenko, Razvan Marinescu

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:17:21Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in clinical settings using multi-dimensional rubrics which quantify reasoning quality, safety, and patient-centeredness. Yet, replicating specific mistakes in other LLM models is not straightforward and often requires manual effort. We introduce MedMistake, an automatic pipeline that extracts mistakes LLMs make in patient-doctor conversations and converts them into a benchmark of single-shot QA pairs. Our pipeline (1) creates complex, conversational data between an LLM patient and LLM doctor, (2) runs an evaluation with a committee of 2 LLM judges across a variety of dimensions and (3) creates simplified single-shot QA scenarios from those mistakes. We release MedMistake-All, a dataset of 3,390 single-shot QA pairs where GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are currently failing to answer correctly, as judged by two LLM judges. We used medical experts to validate a subset of 211/3390 questions (MedMistake-Bench), which we used to run a final evaluation of 12 frontier LLMs: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek-Chat, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Grok 4, Grok 4.1, Mistral Large. We found that GPT models, Claude and Grok obtained the best performance on MedMistake-Bench. We release both the doctor-validated benchmark (MedMistake-Bench), as well as the full dataset (MedMistake-All) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheLumos/MedicalMistakeBenchmark.

### Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Enhanced Satellite Networks: Deployment Strategies, Key Capabilities, Practical Solutions, and Future Directions
**Authors**: Ziyuan Zheng, Xiangyu Li, Shirui Zuo, Yu Wan, Bodong Shang, Wenpeng Jing, Qingqing Wu

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:16:09Z

**Summary**: Satellite networks promise wide-area 6G coverage but face two persistent barriers: blockage-induced service discontinuities and increasingly stringent spectrum coexistence across satellite layers and with terrestrial systems. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) act as low-power programmable apertures that redirect energy without the cost and power consumption of fully active arrays. We develop a deployment-first, operations-aware view of RIS-enabled satellite networking that treats RIS as both satellite/terminal antennas and inter-satellite or space-ground relays. We show that system-level gains are governed by two unifying mechanisms: connectivity restoration via virtual line-of-sight links that preserve connectivity under blockage and mobility, and angular selectivity that reshapes interference to enlarge spectrum reuse. We further discuss practical operation under high mobility, highlighting Delay-Doppler channel acquisition, predictive beam tracking, and control designs that budget overhead and latency, and summarize hardware considerations for reliable operation in space. Finally, we outline forward-looking opportunities in the generative artificial intelligence paradigm, multifunctional RIS architectures, ubiquitous satellite integrated sensing and communication, and sustainable satellite Internet-of-Things.

### SPOT!: Map-Guided LLM Agent for Unsupervised Multi-CCTV Dynamic Object Tracking
**Authors**: Yujin Noh, Inho Jake Park, Chigon Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:04:58Z

**Summary**: CCTV-based vehicle tracking systems face structural limitations in continuously connecting the trajectories of the same vehicle across multiple camera environments. In particular, blind spots occur due to the intervals between CCTVs and limited Fields of View (FOV), which leads to object ID switching and trajectory loss, thereby reducing the reliability of real-time path prediction. This paper proposes SPOT (Spatial Prediction Over Trajectories), a map-guided LLM agent capable of tracking vehicles even in blind spots of multi-CCTV environments without prior training. The proposed method represents road structures (Waypoints) and CCTV placement information as documents based on 2D spatial coordinates and organizes them through chunking techniques to enable real-time querying and inference. Furthermore, it transforms the vehicle's position into the actual world coordinate system using the relative position and FOV information of objects observed in CCTV images. By combining map spatial information with the vehicle's moving direction, speed, and driving patterns, a beam search is performed at the intersection level to derive candidate CCTV locations where the vehicle is most likely to enter after the blind spot. Experimental results based on the CARLA simulator in a virtual city environment confirmed that the proposed method accurately predicts the next appearing CCTV even in blind spot sections, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than existing techniques.

### DAO-Agent: Zero Knowledge-Verified Incentives for Decentralized Multi-Agent Coordination
**Authors**: Yihan Xia, Taotao Wang, Wenxin Xu, Shengli Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T06:00:39Z

**Summary**: Autonomous Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising paradigm for facilitating cross-application and cross-organization collaborations. These autonomous agents often operate in trustless environments, where centralized coordination faces significant challenges, such as the inability to ensure transparent contribution measurement and equitable incentive distribution. While blockchain is frequently proposed as a decentralized coordination platform, it inherently introduces high on-chain computation costs and risks exposing sensitive execution information of the agents. Consequently, the core challenge lies in enabling auditable task execution and fair incentive distribution for autonomous LLM agents in trustless environments, while simultaneously preserving their strategic privacy and minimizing on-chain costs. To address this challenge, we propose DAO-Agent, a novel framework that integrates three key technical innovations: (1) an on-chain decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance mechanism for transparent coordination and immutable logging; (2) a ZKP mechanism approach that enables Shapley-based contribution measurement off-chain, and (3) a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture that verifies ZKP-validated contribution measurements on-chain with minimal computational overhead. We implement DAO-Agent and conduct end-to-end experiments using a crypto trading task as a case study. Experimental results demonstrate that DAO-Agent achieves up to 99.9% reduction in verification gas costs compared to naive on-chain alternatives, with constant-time verification complexity that remains stable as coalition size increases, thereby establishing a scalable foundation for agent coordination in decentralized environments.

### Universal Transient Stability Analysis: A Large Language Model-Enabled Dynamics Prediction Framework
**Authors**: Chao Shen, Ke Zuo, Mingyang Sun

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T05:52:20Z

**Summary**: Existing dynamics prediction frameworks for transient stability analysis (TSA) fail to achieve multi-scenario "universality"--the inherent ability of a single, pre-trained architecture to generalize across diverse operating conditions, unseen faults, and heterogeneous systems. To address this, this paper proposes TSA-LLM, a large language model (LLM)-based universal framework that models multi-variate transient dynamics prediction as a univariate generative task with three key innovations: First, a novel data processing pipeline featuring channel independence decomposition to resolve dimensional heterogeneity, sample-wise normalization to eliminate separate stable or unstable pipelines, and temporal patching for efficient long-sequence modeling; Second, a parameter-efficient freeze-and-finetune strategy that augments the LLM's architecture with dedicated input embedding and output projection layers while freezing core transformer blocks to preserve generic feature extraction capabilities; Third, a two-stage fine-tuning scheme that combines teacher forcing, which feeds the model ground-truth data during initial training, with scheduled sampling, which gradually shifts to leveraging model-generated predictions, to mitigate cumulative errors in long-horizon iterative prediction. Comprehensive testing demonstrates the framework's universality, as TSA-LLM trained solely on the New England 39-bus system achieves zero-shot generalization to mixed stability conditions and unseen faults, and matches expert performance on the larger Iceland 189-bus system with only 5% fine-tuning data. This multi-scenario versatility validates a universal framework that eliminates scenario-specific retraining and achieves scalability via large-scale parameters and cross-scenario training data.

### Mesh-Attention: A New Communication-Efficient Distributed Attention with Improved Data Locality
**Authors**: Sirui Chen, Jingji Chen, Siqi Zhu, Ziheng Jiang, Yanghua Peng, Xuehai Qian

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T05:48:58Z

**Summary**: Distributed attention is a fundamental problem for scaling context window for Large Language Models (LLMs). The state-of-the-art method, Ring-Attention, suffers from scalability limitations due to its excessive communication traffic. This paper proposes a new distributed attention algorithm, Mesh-Attention, by rethinking the design space of distributed attention with a new matrix-based model. Our method assigns a two-dimensional tile -- rather than one-dimensional row or column -- of computation blocks to each GPU to achieve higher efficiency through lower communication-computation (CommCom) ratio. The general approach covers Ring-Attention as a special case, and allows the tuning of CommCom ratio with different tile shapes. Importantly, we propose a greedy algorithm that can efficiently search the scheduling space within the tile with restrictions that ensure efficient communication among GPUs. The theoretical analysis shows that Mesh-Attention leads to a much lower communication complexity and exhibits good scalability comparing to other current algorithms.   Our extensive experiment results show that Mesh-Attention can achieve up to 3.4x speedup (2.9x on average) and reduce the communication volume by up to 85.4% (79.0% on average) on 256 GPUs. Our scalability results further demonstrate that Mesh-Attention sustains superior performance as the system scales, substantially reducing overhead in large-scale deployments. The results convincingly confirm the advantage of Mesh-Attention.

### Deadline-Aware Online Scheduling for LLM Fine-Tuning with Spot Market Predictions
**Authors**: Linggao Kong, Yuedong Xu, Lei Jiao, Chuan Xu

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T05:47:27Z

**Summary**: As foundation models grow in size, fine-tuning them becomes increasingly expensive. While GPU spot instances offer a low-cost alternative to on-demand resources, their volatile prices and availability make deadline-aware scheduling particularly challenging. We tackle this difficulty by using a mix of spot and on-demand instances. Distinctively, we show the predictability of prices and availability in a spot instance market, the power of prediction in enabling cost-efficient scheduling and its sensitivity to estimation errors. An integer programming problem is formulated to capture the use of mixed instances under both the price and availability dynamics. We propose an online allocation algorithm with prediction based on the committed horizon control approach that leverages a \emph{commitment level} to enforce the partial sequence of decisions. When this prediction becomes inaccurate, we further present a complementary online algorithm without predictions. An online policy selection algorithm is developed that learns the best policy from a pool constructed by varying the parameters of both algorithms. We prove that the prediction-based algorithm achieves tighter performance bounds as prediction error decreases, while the policy selection algorithm possesses a regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$. Experimental results demonstrate that our online framework can adaptively select the best policy under varying spot market dynamics and prediction quality, consistently outperforming baselines and improving utility by up to 54.8\%.

### Can Agentic AI Match the Performance of Human Data Scientists?
**Authors**: An Luo, Jin Du, Fangqiao Tian, Xun Xian, Robert Specht, Ganghua Wang, Xuan Bi, Charles Fleming, Jayanth Srinivasa, Ashish Kundu, Mingyi Hong, Jie Ding

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T05:31:42Z

**Summary**: Data science plays a critical role in transforming complex data into actionable insights across numerous domains. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have significantly automated data science workflows, but a fundamental question persists: Can these agentic AI systems truly match the performance of human data scientists who routinely leverage domain-specific knowledge? We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance. Our experiments show that agentic AI that relies on generic analytics workflow falls short of methods that use domain-specific insights. This highlights a key limitation of the current agentic AI for data science and underscores the need for future research to develop agentic AI systems that can better recognize and incorporate domain knowledge.

### Compressed Causal Reasoning: Quantization and GraphRAG Effects on Interventional and Counterfactual Accuracy
**Authors**: Steve Nwaiwu, Nipat Jongsawat, Anucha Tungkasthan

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T05:31:23Z

**Summary**: Causal reasoning in Large Language Models spanning association, intervention, and counterfactual inference is essential for reliable decision making in high stakes settings. As deployment shifts toward edge and resource constrained environments, quantized models such as INT8 and NF4 are becoming standard. Yet the impact of precision reduction on formal causal reasoning is poorly understood. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate quantization effects across all three levels of Pearls Causal Ladder. Using a 3000 sample stratified CLadder benchmark, we find that rung level accuracy in Llama 3 8B remains broadly stable under quantization, with NF4 showing less than one percent overall degradation. Interventional queries at rung 2 are the most sensitive to precision loss, whereas counterfactual reasoning at rung 3 is comparatively stable but exhibits heterogeneous weaknesses across query types such as collider bias and backdoor adjustment. Experiments on the CRASS benchmark show near identical performance across precisions, indicating that existing commonsense counterfactual datasets lack the structural sensitivity needed to reveal quantization induced reasoning drift. We further evaluate Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation using ground truth causal graphs and observe a consistent improvement in NF4 interventional accuracy of plus 1.7 percent, partially offsetting compression related degradation. These results suggest that causal reasoning is unexpectedly robust to four bit quantization, graph structured augmentation can selectively reinforce interventional reasoning, and current counterfactual benchmarks fail to capture deeper causal brittleness. This work provides an initial empirical map of compressed causal reasoning and practical guidance for deploying efficient and structurally supported causal AI systems.

### One Tool Is Enough: Reinforcement Learning for Repository-Level LLM Agents
**Authors**: Zhaoxi Zhang, Yitong Duan, Yanzhi Zhang, Yiming Xu, Jiyan He, Yunfang Wu

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T05:27:53Z

**Summary**: Locating the files and functions requiring modification in large open-source software (OSS) repositories is challenging due to their scale and structural complexity. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods typically treat this as a repository-level retrieval task and rely on multiple auxiliary tools, which overlook code execution logic and complicate model control. We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization.

### Diving into 3D Parallelism with Heterogeneous Spot Instance GPUs: Design and Implications
**Authors**: Yuxiao Wang, Yuedong Xu, Qingyang Duan, Yuxuan Liu, Lei Jiao, Yinghao Yu, Jun Wu

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T05:21:47Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and the continuous release of new GPU products have significantly increased the demand for distributed training across heterogeneous GPU environments. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the challenges involved in implementing 3D parallelism in such environments, addressing critical issues such as the need for symmetric tensor parallelism, efficient gradient synchronization in asymmetric pipeline parallelism, and the trade-offs between memory utilization and computational efficiency. Building upon these insights, we introduce AutoHet, a novel system that automatically identifies the optimal parallelism plan for distributed training on heterogeneous GPUs. AutoHet supports asymmetric 3D parallelism structures and facilitates fine-grained workload distribution. We propose a theoretical model that frames the device grouping and load balancing as an optimization problem to minimize per-iteration training time, thus effectively balancing computing power and memory usage across GPUs with diverse capabilities. To enable elastic training upon spot instance preemption, AutoHet presents an efficient recovery strategy that prioritizes to retrieve training states from local nodes, and only downloads the missing checkpoints from the cloud storage. Our extensive evaluation, conducted on three large-scale models and utilizing combinations of three different GPU types, demonstrates that AutoHet outperforms existing DNN training systems, achieving up to a 1.79$\times$ speedup in training throughput compared with Megatron-LM and Whale, and a 4.38$\times$ speedup of recovery speed compared to a spot instance baseline.

### Don't Pass@k: A Bayesian Framework for Large Language Model Evaluation
**Authors**: Mohsen Hariri, Amirhossein Samandar, Michael Hinczewski, Vipin Chaudhary

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T05:18:52Z

**Summary**: Pass$@k$ is widely used to report performance for LLM reasoning, but it often yields unstable, misleading rankings, especially when the number of trials (samples) is limited and compute is constrained. We present a principled Bayesian evaluation framework that replaces Pass$@k$ and average accuracy over $N$ trials (avg$@N$) with posterior estimates of a model's underlying success probability and credible intervals, yielding stable rankings and a transparent decision rule for differences. Evaluation outcomes are modeled as categorical (not just 0/1) with a Dirichlet prior, giving closed-form expressions for the posterior mean and uncertainty of any weighted rubric and enabling the use of prior evidence when appropriate. Theoretically, under a uniform prior, the Bayesian posterior mean is order-equivalent to average accuracy (Pass$@1$), explaining its empirical robustness while adding principled uncertainty. Empirically, in simulations with known ground-truth success rates and on AIME'24/'25, HMMT'25, and BrUMO'25, the Bayesian/avg procedure achieves faster convergence and greater rank stability than Pass$@k$ and recent variants, enabling reliable comparisons at far smaller sample counts. The framework clarifies when observed gaps are statistically meaningful (non-overlapping credible intervals) versus noise, and it naturally extends to graded, rubric-based evaluations. Together, these results recommend replacing Pass$@k$ for LLM evaluation and ranking with a posterior-based, compute-efficient protocol that unifies binary and non-binary evaluation while making uncertainty explicit.

### From Human Bias to Robot Choice: How Occupational Contexts and Racial Priming Shape Robot Selection
**Authors**: Jiangen He, Wanqi Zhang, Jessica Barfield

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T05:15:26Z

**Summary**: As artificial agents increasingly integrate into professional environments, fundamental questions have emerged about how societal biases influence human-robot selection decisions. We conducted two comprehensive experiments (N = 1,038) examining how occupational contexts and stereotype activation shape robotic agent choices across construction, healthcare, educational, and athletic domains. Participants made selections from artificial agents that varied systematically in skin tone and anthropomorphic characteristics. Our study revealed distinct context-dependent patterns. Healthcare and educational scenarios demonstrated strong favoritism toward lighter-skinned artificial agents, while construction and athletic contexts showed greater acceptance of darker-toned alternatives. Participant race was associated with systematic differences in selection patterns across professional domains. The second experiment demonstrated that exposure to human professionals from specific racial backgrounds systematically shifted later robotic agent preferences in stereotype-consistent directions. These findings show that occupational biases and color-based discrimination transfer directly from human-human to human-robot evaluation contexts. The results highlight mechanisms through which robotic deployment may unintentionally perpetuate existing social inequalities.

### Neural Probe-Based Hallucination Detection for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shize Liang, Hongzhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T05:10:19Z

**Summary**: Large language models(LLMs) excel at text generation and knowledge question-answering tasks, but they are prone to generating hallucinated content, severely limiting their application in high-risk domains. Current hallucination detection methods based on uncertainty estimation and external knowledge retrieval suffer from the limitation that they still produce erroneous content at high confidence levels and rely heavily on retrieval efficiency and knowledge coverage. In contrast, probe methods that leverage the model's hidden-layer states offer real-time and lightweight advantages. However, traditional linear probes struggle to capture nonlinear structures in deep semantic spaces.To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural network-based framework for token-level hallucination detection. By freezing language model parameters, we employ lightweight MLP probes to perform nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states. A multi-objective joint loss function is designed to enhance detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Additionally, we establish a layer position-probe performance response model, using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers and achieve superior training results.Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions.

### Evolving Security in LLMs: A Study of Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses
**Authors**: Zhengchun Shang, Wenlan Wei, Weiheng Bai

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T04:57:32Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly popular, powering a wide range of applications. Their widespread use has sparked concerns, especially through jailbreak attacks that bypass safety measures to produce harmful content.   In this paper, we present a comprehensive security analysis of large language models (LLMs), addressing critical research questions on the evolution and determinants of model safety.   Specifically, we begin by identifying the most effective techniques for detecting jailbreak attacks. Next, we investigate whether newer versions of LLMs offer improved security compared to their predecessors. We also assess the impact of model size on overall security and explore the potential benefits of integrating multiple defense strategies to enhance the security.   Our study evaluates both open-source (e.g., LLaMA and Mistral) and closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4) by employing four state-of-the-art attack techniques and assessing the efficacy of three new defensive approaches.

### AirGS: Real-Time 4D Gaussian Streaming for Free-Viewpoint Video Experiences
**Authors**: Zhe Wang, Jinghang Li, Yifei Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T04:57:30Z

**Summary**: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive viewing experiences by allowing users to view scenes from arbitrary perspectives. As a prominent reconstruction technique for FVV generation, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) models dynamic scenes with time-varying 3D Gaussian ellipsoids and achieves high-quality rendering via fast rasterization. However, existing 4DGS approaches suffer from quality degradation over long sequences and impose substantial bandwidth and storage overhead, limiting their applicability in real-time and wide-scale deployments. Therefore, we present AirGS, a streaming-optimized 4DGS framework that rearchitects the training and delivery pipeline to enable high-quality, low-latency FVV experiences. AirGS converts Gaussian video streams into multi-channel 2D formats and intelligently identifies keyframes to enhance frame reconstruction quality. It further combines temporal coherence with inflation loss to reduce training time and representation size. To support communication-efficient transmission, AirGS models 4DGS delivery as an integer linear programming problem and design a lightweight pruning level selection algorithm to adaptively prune the Gaussian updates to be transmitted, balancing reconstruction quality and bandwidth consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirGS reduces quality deviation in PSNR by more than 20% when scene changes, maintains frame-level PSNR consistently above 30, accelerates training by 6 times, reduces per-frame transmission size by nearly 50% compared to the SOTA 4DGS approaches.

### Pioneering Multimodal Emotion Recognition in the Era of Large Models: From Closed Sets to Open Vocabularies
**Authors**: Jing Han, Zhiqiang Gao, Shihao Gao, Jialing Liu, Hongyu Chen, Zixing Zhang, Björn W. Schuller

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T04:42:30Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multi- and cross-modal integration capabilities. However, their potential for fine-grained emotion understanding remains systematically underexplored. While open-vocabulary multimodal emotion recognition (MER-OV) has emerged as a promising direction to overcome the limitations of closed emotion sets, no comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs in this context currently exists. To address this, our work presents the first large-scale benchmarking study of MER-OV on the OV-MERD dataset, evaluating 19 mainstream MLLMs, including general-purpose, modality-specialized, and reasoning-enhanced architectures. Through systematic analysis of model reasoning capacity, fusion strategies, contextual utilization, and prompt design, we provide key insights into the capabilities and limitations of current MLLMs for MER-OV. Our evaluation reveals that a two-stage, trimodal (audio, video, and text) fusion approach achieves optimal performance in MER-OV, with video emerging as the most critical modality. We further identify a surprisingly narrow gap between open- and closed-source LLMs. These findings establish essential benchmarks and offer practical guidelines for advancing open-vocabulary and fine-grained affective computing, paving the way for more nuanced and interpretable emotion AI systems. Associated code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

### Uncovering Hierarchical Structure in LLM Embeddings with $δ$-Hyperbolicity, Ultrametricity, and Neighbor Joining
**Authors**: Prakash Chourasia, Sarwan Ali, Murray Patterson

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T04:15:36Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled significant strides in various fields. This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM embeddings in the context of inherent geometric properties. We investigate the structural properties of these embeddings through three complementary metrics $δ$-hyperbolicity, Ultrametricity, and Neighbor Joining. $δ$-hyperbolicity, a measure derived from geometric group theory, quantifies how much a metric space deviates from being a tree-like structure. In contrast, ultrametricity characterizes strictly hierarchical structures where distances obey a strong triangle inequality. While Neighbor Joining quantifies how tree-like the distance relationships are, it does so specifically with respect to the tree reconstructed by the Neighbor Joining algorithm. By analyzing the embeddings generated by LLMs using these metrics, we uncover to what extent the embedding space reflects an underlying hierarchical or tree-like organization. Our findings reveal that LLM embeddings exhibit varying degrees of hyperbolicity and ultrametricity, which correlate with their performance in the underlying machine learning tasks.

**Summary**: Full parameter fine tuning is a key technique for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, but it incurs substantial memory overhead due to the need to cache extensive intermediate activations for backpropagation. This bottleneck makes full fine tuning of contemporary large scale LLMs challenging in practice. Existing distributed training frameworks such as DeepSpeed alleviate this issue using techniques like ZeRO and FSDP, which rely on multi GPU memory or CPU offloading, but often require additional hardware resources and reduce training speed. We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory. While preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures, this approach significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine tuning. As a result, RevFFN enables efficient full fine tuning on a single consumer grade or server grade GPU.

**Authors**: Huizheng Wang, Taiquan Wei, Hongbin Wang, Zichuan Wang, Xinru Tang, Zhiheng Yue, Shaojun Wei, Yang Hu, Shouyi Yin

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T03:53:05Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) rely on self-attention for contextual understanding, demanding high-throughput inference and large-scale token parallelism (LTPP). Existing dynamic sparsity accelerators falter under LTPP scenarios due to stage-isolated optimizations. Revisiting the end-to-end sparsity acceleration flow, we identify an overlooked opportunity: cross-stage coordination can substantially reduce redundant computation and memory access. We propose STAR, a cross-stage compute- and memory-efficient algorithm-hardware co-design tailored for Transformer inference under LTPP. STAR introduces a leading-zero-based sparsity prediction using log-domain add-only operations to minimize prediction overhead. It further employs distributed sorting and a sorted updating FlashAttention mechanism, guided by a coordinated tiling strategy that enables fine-grained stage interaction for improved memory efficiency and latency. These optimizations are supported by a dedicated STAR accelerator architecture, achieving up to 9.2$\times$ speedup and 71.2$\times$ energy efficiency over A100, and surpassing SOTA accelerators by up to 16.1$\times$ energy and 27.1$\times$ area efficiency gains. Further, we deploy STAR onto a multi-core spatial architecture, optimizing dataflow and execution orchestration for ultra-long sequence processing. Architectural evaluation shows that, compared to the baseline design, Spatial-STAR achieves a 20.1$\times$ throughput improvement.

**Summary**: This paper presents LLaDA2.0 -- a tuple of discrete diffusion large language models (dLLM) scaling up to 100B total parameters through systematic conversion from auto-regressive (AR) models -- establishing a new paradigm for frontier-scale deployment. Instead of costly training from scratch, LLaDA2.0 upholds knowledge inheritance, progressive adaption and efficiency-aware design principle, and seamless converts a pre-trained AR model into dLLM with a novel 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size in block diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable) and reverting back to compact-size block diffusion (decay). Along with post-training alignment with SFT and DPO, we obtain LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), two instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants optimized for practical deployment. By preserving the advantages of parallel decoding, these models deliver superior performance and efficiency at the frontier scale. Both models were open-sourced.

### Adaptive Financial Sentiment Analysis for NIFTY 50 via Instruction-Tuned LLMs , RAG and Reinforcement Learning Approaches
**Authors**: Chaithra, Kamesh Kadimisetty, Biju R Mohan

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T03:42:59Z

**Summary**: Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling.

### ART: Adaptive Response Tuning Framework -- A Multi-Agent Tournament-Based Approach to LLM Response Optimization
**Authors**: Omer Jauhar Khan

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T03:42:55Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, single-model responses often exhibit inconsistencies, hallucinations, and varying quality across different query domains. This paper presents ART (Adaptive Response Tuning), a novel framework that employs tournament-style ELO ranking and multi-agent reasoning to systematically optimize LLM outputs. By enabling multiple LLM agents to compete, critique, and collaborate through structured tournament workflows, ART produces consensus responses that outperform individual model outputs. Our framework introduces configurable tournament parameters, dynamic agent selection, and multiple consensus fusion strategies. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in response accuracy, coherence, and reliability compared to baseline single-model approaches. The ART framework provides a scalable, production-ready solution for applications requiring high-quality, vetted LLM responses, achieving an 8.4% improvement in overall quality metrics and R^2 values exceeding 0.96 in ELO rating convergence.

### Where Did This Sentence Come From? Tracing Provenance in LLM Reasoning Distillation
**Authors**: Kaiyuan Liu, Shaotian Yan, Rui Miao, Bing Wang, Chen Shen, Jun Zhang, Jieping Ye

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T03:19:05Z

**Summary**: Reasoning distillation has attracted increasing attention. It typically leverages a large teacher model to generate reasoning paths, which are then used to fine-tune a student model so that it mimics the teacher's behavior in training contexts. However, previous approaches have lacked a detailed analysis of the origins of the distilled model's capabilities. It remains unclear whether the student can maintain consistent behaviors with the teacher in novel test-time contexts, or whether it regresses to its original output patterns, raising concerns about the generalization of distillation models. To analyse this question, we introduce a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework. For each action (e.g., a sentence) produced by the distilled model, we obtain the predictive probabilities assigned by the teacher, the original student, and the distilled model under the same context. By comparing these probabilities, we classify each action into different categories. By systematically disentangling the provenance of each action, we experimentally demonstrate that, in test-time contexts, the distilled model can indeed generate teacher-originated actions, which correlate with and plausibly explain observed performance on distilled model. Building on this analysis, we further propose a teacher-guided data selection method. Unlike prior approach that rely on heuristics, our method directly compares teacher-student divergences on the training data, providing a principled selection criterion. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple representative teacher models and diverse student models. The results highlight the utility of our provenance-tracing framework and underscore its promise for reasoning distillation. We hope to share Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing and our insights into reasoning distillation with the community.

### When Experts Speak:Sequential LLM-Bayesian Learning for Startup Success Prediction
**Authors**: Yidong Chai, Yanguang Liu, Xuan Tian, Jiaheng Xie, Yonghang Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T02:49:13Z

**Summary**: Evaluating startups is inherently challenging in entrepreneurial finance, where investors confront severe information asymmetry and limited quantitative data. Leveraging a novel expert network call data, we develop an LLM-Bayesian model that analyzes these conversations at the question-answer turn level, extracting semantic and evaluative signals via large language models (LLMs) and aggregating them in a sequential Bayesian architecture. The model dynamically updates beliefs as additional expert calls occur and attenuates contradictory assessments, which are absent from existing text-based screening tools. Empirically, our model outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by 6.691% in F1-score and increases portfolio-level Return on Investment by 15.255%. Attention and ablation analyses reveal that conversational cues are particularly informative for technologically complex startups, young firms, diverse founding teams, and firms with low public visibility. By converting expert dialogue into continually updated probabilities, our model advances research in entrepreneurial finance and information systems and offers policy implications for improving funding outcomes for informationally disadvantaged startups.

**Authors**: Nguyen Tien Dong, Minh-Anh Nguyen, Thanh Dat Hoang, Nguyen Tuan Ngoc, Dao Xuan Quang Minh, Phan Phi Hai, Nguyen Thi Ngoc Anh, Dang Van Tu, Binh Vu

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T02:46:01Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new possibilities for applying artificial intelligence within the legal domain. Nonetheless, the complexity, hierarchical organization, and frequent revisions of Vietnamese legislation pose considerable challenges for evaluating how well these models interpret and utilize legal knowledge. To address this gap, the Vietnamese Legal Benchmark (VLegal-Bench) is introduced, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs on Vietnamese legal tasks. Informed by Bloom's cognitive taxonomy, VLegal-Bench encompasses multiple levels of legal understanding through tasks designed to reflect practical usage scenarios. The benchmark comprises 10,450 samples generated through a rigorous annotation pipeline, where legal experts label and cross-validate each instance using our annotation system to ensure every sample is grounded in authoritative legal documents and mirrors real-world legal assistant workflows, including general legal questions and answers, retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, and scenario-based problem solving tailored to Vietnamese law. By providing a standardized, transparent, and cognitively informed evaluation framework, VLegal-Bench establishes a solid foundation for assessing LLM performance in Vietnamese legal contexts and supports the development of more reliable, interpretable, and ethically aligned AI-assisted legal systems. To facilitate access and reproducibility, we provide a public landing page for this benchmark at https://vilegalbench.cmcai.vn/.

### FedPOD: the deployable units of training for federated learning
**Authors**: Daewoon Kim, Si Young Yie, Jae Sung Lee

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T02:38:59Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes FedPOD, which ranked first in the 2024 Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) Challenge, for optimizing learning efficiency and communication cost in federated learning among multiple clients. Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics.

### Exploring Efficiency Frontiers of Thinking Budget in Medical Reasoning: Scaling Laws between Computational Resources and Reasoning Quality
**Authors**: Ziqian Bi, Lu Chen, Junhao Song, Hongying Luo, Enze Ge, Junmin Huang, Tianyang Wang, Keyu Chen, Chia Xin Liang, Zihan Wei, Huafeng Liu, Chunjie Tian, Jibin Guan, Joe Yeong, Yongzhi Xu, Peng Wang, Xinyuan Song, Junfeng Hao

**Updated**: 2025-12-24T02:25:32Z

**Summary**: This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of thinking budget mechanisms in medical reasoning tasks, revealing fundamental scaling laws between computational resources and reasoning quality. We systematically evaluated two major model families, Qwen3 (1.7B to 235B parameters) and DeepSeek-R1 (1.5B to 70B parameters), across 15 medical datasets spanning diverse specialties and difficulty levels. Through controlled experiments with thinking budgets ranging from zero to unlimited tokens, we establish logarithmic scaling relationships where accuracy improvements follow a predictable pattern with both thinking budget and model size. Our findings identify three distinct efficiency regimes: high-efficiency (0 to 256 tokens) suitable for real-time applications, balanced (256 to 512 tokens) offering optimal cost-performance tradeoffs for routine clinical support, and high-accuracy (above 512 tokens) justified only for critical diagnostic tasks. Notably, smaller models demonstrate disproportionately larger benefits from extended thinking, with 15 to 20% improvements compared to 5 to 10% for larger models, suggesting a complementary relationship where thinking budget provides greater relative benefits for capacity-constrained models. Domain-specific patterns emerge clearly, with neurology and gastroenterology requiring significantly deeper reasoning processes than cardiovascular or respiratory medicine. The consistency between Qwen3 native thinking budget API and our proposed truncation method for DeepSeek-R1 validates the generalizability of thinking budget concepts across architectures. These results establish thinking budget control as a critical mechanism for optimizing medical AI systems, enabling dynamic resource allocation aligned with clinical needs while maintaining the transparency essential for healthcare deployment.
