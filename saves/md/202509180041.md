**Authors**: Yilun Wang, Pengfei Chen, Haiyu Huang, Zilong He, Gou Tan, Chuanfu Zhang, Jingkai He, Zibin Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:33:29Z

**Summary**: Modern software systems generate massive volumes of runtime logs, necessitating efficient and accurate log parsing to enable critical downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and root cause analysis. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system.   In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.

### Topology and Fragility of European High-Voltage Networks: A   Cross-Country Comparative Analysis
**Authors**: Bálint Hartmann, Michelle T. Cirunay

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T09:54:58Z

**Summary**: Reliable electricity supply depends on the seamless operation of high-voltage grid infrastructure spanning both transmission and sub-transmission levels. Beneath this apparent uniformity lies a striking structural diversity, which leaves a clear imprint on system vulnerability. In this paper, we present harmonized topological models of the high-voltage grids of 15 European countries, integrating all elements at voltage levels above 110 kV. Topological analysis of these networks reveals a simple yet robust pattern: node degree distributions consistently follow an exponential decay, but the rate of decay varies significantly across countries. Through a detailed and systematic evaluation of network tolerance to node and edge removals, we show that the decay rate delineates the boundary between systems that are more resilient to failures and those that are prone to large-scale disruptions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this numerical boundary is highly sensitive to which layers of the infrastructure are included in the models. To our knowledge, this study provides the first quantitative cross-country comparison of 15 European high-voltage networks, linking topological properties with vulnerability characteristics.

### Tool-R1: Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Agentic Tool Use
**Authors**: Yabo Zhang, Yihan Zeng, Qingyun Li, Zhen Hu, Kavin Han, Wangmeng Zuo

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T09:22:21Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function, combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1 substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks. These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications. Our code will be available at https://github.com/YBYBZhang/Tool-R1.

### SAGA: Selective Adaptive Gating for Efficient and Expressive Linear   Attention
**Authors**: Yuan Cao, Dong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T08:36:05Z

**Summary**: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck, particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$ to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly, which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps, contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency and model effectiveness.

### Adaptive K-PackCache: Cost-Centric Data Caching in Cloud
**Authors**: Suvarthi Sarkar, Aadarshraj Sah, Poddutoori Sweeya Reddy, Aryabartta Sahu

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T07:49:41Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in data analytics have enabled the accurate prediction of user access patterns, giving rise to the idea of packed caching delivering multiple co accessed data items together as a bundle. This improves caching efficiency, as accessing one item often implies the need for others. Prior work has explored only 2 item pairwise packing. In this paper, we extend the concept to general K packing, allowing variable size bundles for improved flexibility and performance. We formulate the K PackCache problem from a content delivery network CDN operator perspective, aiming to minimize total cost comprising two components: transfer cost modeled as a base cost plus a linearly increasing term with the number of items packed, and memory rental cost for caching, which depends on how long and how much is stored. Overpacking increases cost due to low utility, underpacking leads to missed sharing opportunities. We propose an online algorithm, Adaptive K PackCache AKPC, which dynamically forms, merges, and splits data cliques based on user access patterns and content correlation. Our approach supports batch requests, enables approximate clique merging, and offers a formal competitive guarantee. Through extensive evaluation on the Netflix and Spotify datasets, AKPC reduces total cost by up to 63 and 55 percentage over online baselines, respectively, and achieves performance within 15 and 13 percentage of the optimal. This demonstrates its scalability and effectiveness for real world caching systems.

### Accelerating LLM Inference via Dynamic KV Cache Placement in   Heterogeneous Memory System
**Authors**: Yunhua Fang, Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Linsen Ma, Kaoutar El Maghraoui, Naigang Wang, Meng Wang, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-15T14:40:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is increasingly constrained by memory bandwidth, with frequent access to the key-value (KV) cache dominating data movement. While attention sparsity reduces some memory traffic, the relevance of past tokens varies over time, requiring the full KV cache to remain accessible and sustaining pressure on both bandwidth and capacity. With advances in interconnects such as NVLink and LPDDR5X, modern AI hardware now integrates high-bandwidth memory (HBM) with high-speed off-package DRAM, making heterogeneous memory systems a practical solution. This work investigates dynamic KV cache placement across such systems to maximize aggregated bandwidth utilization under capacity constraints. Rather than proposing a specific scheduling policy, we formulate the placement problem mathematically and derive a theoretical upper bound, revealing substantial headroom for runtime optimization. To our knowledge, this is the first formal treatment of dynamic KV cache scheduling in heterogeneous memory systems for LLM inference.

### SpecVLM: Fast Speculative Decoding in Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Haiduo Huang, Fuwei Yang, Zhenhua Liu, Xuanwu Yin, Dong Li, Pengju Ren, Emad Barsoum

**Updated**: 2025-09-15T11:53:56Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding is a powerful way to accelerate autoregressive large language models (LLMs), but directly porting it to vision-language models (VLMs) faces unique systems constraints: the prefill stage is dominated by visual tokens whose count scales with image resolution and video length, inflating both compute and memory, especially the key-value (KV) cache. We study speculative decoding for VLMs and introduce SpecVLM, a practical system that (1) establishes a strong EAGLE-2-style baseline, EagleVLM, delivering 1.5--2.3x end-to-end speedups over full autoregressive inference, and (2) further accelerates VLM inference with an elastic visual compressor that adaptively selects among pruning, pooling, convolution, and resampler primitives to balance FLOPs/parameters and accuracy per input. To avoid costly offline distillation corpora, we propose an online-logit distillation protocol that trains the draft model with on-the-fly teacher logits and penultimate features using a combined cross-entropy and Smooth L1 objective, eliminating storage and preprocessing while remaining compute-efficient. This protocol reveals a training-time scaling effect: longer online training monotonically increases the draft model's average accepted length, improving speculative efficiency. Empirically, SpecVLM achieves additional acceleration, culminating in 2.5--2.9x end-to-end speedups within 5 epochs across LLaVA and MMMU, consistently over resolutions and task difficulties, while preserving the target model's output distribution (lossless decoding). Our code is available at https://github.com/haiduo/SpecVLM.

### SpeCa: Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Speculative Feature   Caching
**Authors**: Jiacheng Liu, Chang Zou, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Fei Ren, Shaobo Wang, Kaixin Li, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-15T06:46:22Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis, yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications. These models face two fundamental challenges: strict temporal dependencies preventing parallelization, and computationally intensive forward passes required at each denoising step. Drawing inspiration from speculative decoding in large language models, we present SpeCa, a novel 'Forecast-then-verify' acceleration framework that effectively addresses both limitations. SpeCa's core innovation lies in introducing Speculative Sampling to diffusion models, predicting intermediate features for subsequent timesteps based on fully computed reference timesteps. Our approach implements a parameter-free verification mechanism that efficiently evaluates prediction reliability, enabling real-time decisions to accept or reject each prediction while incurring negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, SpeCa introduces sample-adaptive computation allocation that dynamically modulates resources based on generation complexity, allocating reduced computation for simpler samples while preserving intensive processing for complex instances. Experiments demonstrate 6.34x acceleration on FLUX with minimal quality degradation (5.5% drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT while preserving generation fidelity, and 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo. The verification mechanism incurs minimal overhead (1.67%-3.5% of full inference costs), establishing a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference while maintaining generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios. Our codes have been released in Github: \textbf{https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/Cache4Diffusion}

### LogicTree: Structured Proof Exploration for Coherent and Rigorous   Logical Reasoning with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Kang He, Kaushik Roy

**Updated**: 2025-09-15T01:15:50Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities across various domains. However, LLMs still face distinct challenges in complex logical reasoning, as (1) proof-finding requires systematic exploration and the maintenance of logical coherence and (2) searching the right combination of premises at each reasoning step is inherently challenging in tasks with large premise space. To address this, we propose LogicTree, an inference-time modular framework employing algorithm-guided search to automate structured proof exploration and ensure logical coherence. Advancing beyond tree-of-thought (ToT), we incorporate caching mechanism into LogicTree to enable effective utilization of historical knowledge, preventing reasoning stagnation and minimizing redundancy. Furthermore, we address the combinatorial complexity of premise search by decomposing it into a linear process. The refined premise selection restricts subsequent inference to at most one derivation per step, enhancing reasoning granularity and enforcing strict step-by-step reasoning. Additionally, we introduce two LLM-free heuristics for premise prioritization, enabling strategic proof search. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that LogicTree optimally scales inference-time computation to achieve higher proof accuracy, surpassing chain-of-thought (CoT) and ToT with average gains of 23.6% and 12.5%, respectively, on GPT-4o. Moreover, within LogicTree, GPT-4o outperforms o3-mini by 7.6% on average.

### FineServe: Precision-Aware KV Slab and Two-Level Scheduling for   Heterogeneous Precision LLM Serving
**Authors**: Kyungmin Bin, Seungbeom Choi, Jimyoung Son, Jieun Choi, Daseul Bae, Daehyeon Baek, Kihyo Moon, Minsung Jang, Hyojung Lee

**Updated**: 2025-09-15T00:51:47Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) techniques have significantly increased demand for serving quantized large language models (LLMs), enabling higher throughput and substantially reduced memory usage with minimal accuracy loss. Quantized models address memory constraints in LLMs and enhance GPU resource utilization through efficient GPU sharing. However, quantized models have smaller KV block sizes than non-quantized models, causing limited memory efficiency due to memory fragmentation. Also, distinct resource usage patterns between quantized and non-quantized models require efficient scheduling to maximize throughput. To address these challenges, we propose FineServe, an inference serving framework for mixed-precision LLMs. FineServe's key contributions include: (1) KV Slab, a precision-aware adaptive memory management technique dynamically allocating KV cache based on model quantization characteristics, significantly reducing GPU memory fragmentation, and (2) a two-level scheduling framework comprising a global scheduler that places models to GPUs based on request rates, latency SLOs, and memory constraints and efficiency, and a local scheduler that adaptively adjusts batch sizes according to real-time request fluctuations. Experimental results demonstrate that FineServe achieves up to 2.2x higher SLO attainment and 1.8x higher token generation throughput compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing systems.

### Multi-Layer Perceptron-Based Relay Node Selection for Next-Generation   Intelligent Delay-Tolerant Networks
**Authors**: Zhekun Huang, Milena Radenkovic

**Updated**: 2025-09-14T12:29:49Z

**Summary**: Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are critical for emergency communication in highly dynamic and challenging scenarios characterized by intermittent connectivity, frequent disruptions, and unpredictable node mobility. While some protocols are widely adopted for simplicity and low overhead, their static replication strategy lacks the ability to adaptively distinguish high-quality relay nodes, often leading to inefficient and suboptimal message dissemination. To address this challenge, we propose a novel intelligent routing enhancement that integrates machine learning-based node evaluation into the Spray and Wait framework. Several dynamic, core features are extracted from simulation logs and are used to train multiple classifiers - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) - to predict whether a node is suitable as a relay under dynamic conditions. The trained models are deployed via a lightweight Flask-based RESTful API, enabling real-time, adaptive predictions. We implement the enhanced router MLPBasedSprayRouter, which selectively forwards messages based on the predicted relay quality. A caching mechanism is incorporated to reduce computational overhead and ensure stable, low-latency inference. Extensive experiments under realistic emergency mobility scenarios demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves delivery ratio while reducing average latency compared to the baseline protocols. Among all evaluated classifiers, MLP achieved the most robust performance, consistently outperforming both SVM and RF in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and inference speed. These results confirm the novelty and practicality of integrating machine learning into DTN routing, paving the way for resilient and intelligent communication systems in smart cities, disaster recovery, and other dynamic environments.

### Dislocation response to electric fields in strontium titanate: A   mesoscale indentation study
**Authors**: Alexander Frisch, Daniel Isaia, Oliver Preuß, Xufei Fang

**Updated**: 2025-09-14T09:26:44Z

**Summary**: Dislocations in perovskite oxides have drawn increasing research interest due to their potential of tuning functional properties of electroceramics. Open questions remain regarding the behavior of dislocations concerning their stability under strong externally applied electric fields. In this study, we investigate the dielectric breakdown strength of nominally undoped SrTiO3 crystals after the introduction of high-density dislocations. The dislocation-rich samples are prepared using the Brinell scratching method, and they consistently exhibit lower dielectric breakdown strength as well as a larger scatter in the breakdown probability. We also study the impact of electric field on the introduction and movement of dislocations in SrTiO3 crystals using Brinell indentation coupled with an electric field of 2 kV/mm. No changes on the dislocation plastic zone size, depth, and dislocation distribution are observed under this electric field. Based on the charge state of the dislocations in SrTiO3 as well as the electrical and thermal conductivity modified by dislocations, we discuss the forces induced by the electric field to act on the dislocations to underline the possible mechanisms for such dislocation behavior.

### AQUA: Attention via QUery mAgnitudes for Memory and Compute Efficient   Inference in LLMs
**Authors**: Santhosh G S, Saurav Prakash, Balaraman Ravindran

**Updated**: 2025-09-14T08:20:48Z

**Summary**: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism remains a fundamental barrier to scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) to longer contexts, creating a critical bottleneck in both computation and memory. To address this, we introduce AQUA (Attention via QUery mAgnitudes) a novel and versatile approximation strategy that significantly reduces the cost of attention with a graceful performance trade-off. Our method operates in two phases: an efficient offline step where we compute a universal, language agnostic projection matrix via SVD on a calibration dataset, and an online inference step where we project query and key vectors and dynamically select a sparse subset of dimensions based on the query's magnitude. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of AQUA, establishing the break-even point at which it becomes more computationally efficient than standard attention. Our empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that a 25% reduction in the attention dot-product computation can be achieved with a statistically insignificant impact on performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We further showcase the versatility of AQUA by demonstrating its ability to synergistically accelerate existing token eviction methods like H2O and to directly reduce KV-cache memory size. By offering a controllable knob to balance efficiency and accuracy, AQUA provides a practical and powerful tool for making large-scale LLM inference more accessible and sustainable.

### Judge Q: Trainable Queries for Optimized Information Retention in KV   Cache Eviction
**Authors**: Yijun Liu, Yixuan Wang, Yuzhuang Xu, Shiyu Ji, Yang Xu, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che

**Updated**: 2025-09-13T03:34:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) utilize key-value (KV) cache to store historical information during sequence processing. The size of KV cache grows linearly as the length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and decoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize the last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV importance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it tends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect or omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose Judge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This method only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By concatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train these tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that of the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the soft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the importance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining decoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our method exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction approaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks including LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Results indicate an improvement of approximately 1 point on the LongBench and over 3 points on RULER. This proposed methodology can be seamlessly integrated into existing open-source models with minimal training overhead, thereby enhancing performance in KV cache eviction scenarios.

### MCBP: A Memory-Compute Efficient LLM Inference Accelerator Leveraging   Bit-Slice-enabled Sparsity and Repetitiveness
**Authors**: Huizheng Wang, Zichuan Wang, Zhiheng Yue, Yousheng Long, Taiquan Wei, Jianxun Yang, Yang Wang, Chao Li, Shaojun Wei, Yang Hu, Shouyi Yin

**Updated**: 2025-09-12T16:05:27Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) face significant inference latency due to inefficiencies in GEMM operations, weight access, and KV cache access, especially in real-time scenarios. This highlights the need for a versatile compute-memory efficient accelerator. Unfortunately, existing Transformer accelerators struggle to address both aspects simultaneously, as they focus on value-level processing, missing fine-grained opportunities to optimize computation and memory collaboratively. This paper introduces MCBP, a bit-grained compute-memory efficient algorithm-hardware co-design that leverages bit-slice (BS) enabled repetitiveness and sparsity to accelerate LLM inference. MCBP features three key innovations: 1) BS-repetitiveness-enabled computation reduction (BRCR), which eliminates redundant GEMM computations via leveraging redundancy hidden among BS vectors; 2) BS-sparsity-enabled two-state coding (BSTC), which reduces weight access via exploiting significant sparsity in high-order bit-slice weight; 3) Bit-grained progressive prediction (BGPP), which reduces KV cache access by leveraging early-termination-based bit-grained prediction. These techniques, supported by custom accelerator designs, effectively alleviate the burden in GEMM, weight access, and KV cache access. Extensive experiments on 26 benchmarks show that MCBP achieves 9.43x speed up and 31.1x higher energy efficiency than Nvidia A100 GPU. Compared to SOTA Transformer accelerators, MCBP achieves 35x, 5.2x and 3.2x energy saving than Spatten, FACT and SOFA, respectively.

### Compute Only 16 Tokens in One Timestep: Accelerating Diffusion   Transformers with Cluster-Driven Feature Caching
**Authors**: Zhixin Zheng, Xinyu Wang, Chang Zou, Shaobo Wang, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-12T14:53:45Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to generate high-quality images and videos, yet still suffer from a huge computational cost due to their iterative denoising process. Recently, feature caching has been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the feature computation in previous timesteps and reusing it in the following timesteps, which leverage the temporal similarity of diffusion models while ignoring the similarity in the spatial dimension. In this paper, we introduce Cluster-Driven Feature Caching (ClusCa) as an orthogonal and complementary perspective for previous feature caching. Specifically, ClusCa performs spatial clustering on tokens in each timestep, computes only one token in each cluster and propagates their information to all the other tokens, which is able to reduce the number of tokens by over 90%. Extensive experiments on DiT, FLUX and HunyuanVideo demonstrate its effectiveness in both text-to-image and text-to-video generation. Besides, it can be directly applied to any diffusion transformer without requirements for training. For instance, ClusCa achieves 4.96x acceleration on FLUX with an ImageReward of 99.49%, surpassing the original model by 0.51%. The code is available at https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/Cache4Diffusion.

### XBOF: A Cost-Efficient CXL JBOF with Inter-SSD Compute Resource Sharing
**Authors**: Shushu Yi, Yuda An, Li Peng, Xiurui Pan, Qiao Li, Jieming Yin, Guangyan Zhang, Wenfei Wu, Diyu Zhou, Zhenlin Wang, Xiaolin Wang, Yingwei Luo, Ke Zhou, Jie Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-12T13:49:27Z

**Summary**: Enterprise SSDs integrate numerous computing resources (e.g., ARM processor and onboard DRAM) to satisfy the ever-increasing performance requirements of I/O bursts. While these resources substantially elevate the monetary costs of SSDs, the sporadic nature of I/O bursts causes severe SSD resource underutilization in just a bunch of flash (JBOF) level. Tackling this challenge, we propose XBOF, a cost-efficient JBOF design, which only reserves moderate computing resources in SSDs at low monetary cost, while achieving demanded I/O performance through efficient inter-SSD resource sharing. Specifically, XBOF first disaggregates SSD architecture into multiple disjoint parts based on their functionality, enabling fine-grained SSD internal resource management. XBOF then employs a decentralized scheme to manage these disaggregated resources and harvests the computing resources of idle SSDs to assist busy SSDs in handling I/O bursts. This idea is facilitated by the cache-coherent capability of Compute eXpress Link (CXL), with which the busy SSDs can directly utilize the harvested computing resources to accelerate metadata processing. The evaluation results show that XBOF improves SSD resource utilization by 50.4% and saves 19.0% monetary costs with a negligible performance loss, compared to existing JBOF designs.

### LAVa: Layer-wise KV Cache Eviction with Dynamic Budget Allocation
**Authors**: Yiqun Shen, Song Yuan, Zhengze Zhang, Xiaoliang Wang, Daxin Jiang, Nguyen Cam-Tu

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T16:48:24Z

**Summary**: KV Cache is commonly used to accelerate LLM inference with long contexts, yet its high memory demand drives the need for cache compression. Existing compression methods, however, are largely heuristic and lack dynamic budget allocation. To address this limitation, we introduce a unified framework for cache compression by minimizing information loss in Transformer residual streams. Building on it, we analyze the layer attention output loss and derive a new metric to compare cache entries across heads, enabling layer-wise compression with dynamic head budgets. Additionally, by contrasting cross-layer information, we also achieve dynamic layer budgets. LAVa is the first unified strategy for cache eviction and dynamic budget allocation that, unlike prior methods, does not rely on training or the combination of multiple strategies. Experiments with benchmarks (LongBench, Needle-In-A-Haystack, Ruler, and InfiniteBench) demonstrate its superiority. Moreover, our experiments reveal a new insight: dynamic layer budgets are crucial for generation tasks (e.g., code completion), while dynamic head budgets play a key role in extraction tasks (e.g., extractive QA). As a fully dynamic compression method, LAVa consistently maintains top performance across task types. Our code is available at https://github.com/MGDDestiny/Lava.

**Authors**: Jialiang Huang, Teng Ma, Zheng Liu, Sixing Lin, Kang Chen, Jinlei Jiang, Xia Liao, Yingdi Shan, Yongwei Wu, Ning Zhang, Mengting Lu, Tao Ma, Haifeng Gong, Mingxing Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T15:06:03Z

**Summary**: Serverless computing provides dynamic scalability, but its infrastructure overhead becomes a bottleneck for emerging workloads such as LLM agents, which exhibit unpredictable invocation patterns and variable resource demands. Our analysis shows that for these agents, the cost of running on serverless platforms can reach up to 70% of the cost of LLM API calls. This finding motivates the need for a more efficient, high-density serverless platform. We present TrEnv, a co-designed serverless platform that supports both container- and VM-based environments, optimized for the unique demands of LLM agents. TrEnv reduces startup latency and memory usage through repurposable sandboxes and memory templates, which enable fast reuse and restoration of execution environments. To further reduce overhead in VM-based agent workloads, TrEnv leverages browser sharing and a page cache bypassing mechanism. Evaluations show that TrEnv reduces P99 latency by up to 7X and memory usage by 48% in container-based settings, and achieves up to 58% lower P99 latency and 61% memory savings for VM-based agents compared to state-of-the-art systems like E2B.

### In-Loop Filtering Using Learned Look-Up Tables for Video Coding
**Authors**: Zhuoyuan Li, Jiacheng Li, Yao Li, Jialin Li, Li Li, Dong Liu, Feng Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T14:34:01Z

**Summary**: In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology in video coding standards to reduce artifacts and enhance visual quality. Recently, neural network-based ILF schemes have achieved remarkable coding gains, emerging as a powerful candidate for next-generation video coding standards. However, the use of deep neural networks (DNN) brings significant computational and time complexity or high demands for dedicated hardware, making it challenging for general use. To address this limitation, we study a practical ILF solution by adopting look-up tables (LUTs). After training a DNN with a restricted reference range for ILF, all possible inputs are traversed, and the output values of the DNN are cached into LUTs. During the coding process, the filtering process is performed by simply retrieving the filtered pixel through locating the input pixels and interpolating between the cached values, instead of relying on heavy inference computations. In this paper, we propose a universal LUT-based ILF framework, termed LUT-ILF++. First, we introduce the cooperation of multiple kinds of filtering LUTs and propose a series of customized indexing mechanisms to enable better filtering reference perception with limited storage consumption. Second, we propose the cross-component indexing mechanism to enable the filtering of different color components jointly. Third, in order to make our solution practical for coding uses, we propose the LUT compaction scheme to enable the LUT pruning, achieving a lower storage cost of the entire solution. The proposed framework is implemented in the VVC reference software. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves on average 0.82%/2.97%/1.63% and 0.85%/4.11%/2.06% bitrate reduction for common test sequences, under the AI and RA configurations, respectively. Compared to DNN-based solutions, our proposed solution has much lower time complexity and storage cost.

### VFlowOpt: A Token Pruning Framework for LMMs with Visual Information   Flow-Guided Optimization
**Authors**: Sihan Yang, Runsen Xu, Chenhang Cui, Tai Wang, Dahua Lin, Jiangmiao Pang

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T12:06:49Z

**Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically, we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning, thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs. Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

### Universal Workers: A Vision for Eliminating Cold Starts in Serverless   Computing
**Authors**: Saman Akbari, Manfred Hauswirth

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T10:20:20Z

**Summary**: Serverless computing enables developers to deploy code without managing infrastructure, but suffers from cold start overhead when initializing new function instances. Existing solutions such as "keep-alive" or "pre-warming" are costly and unreliable under bursty workloads. We propose universal workers, which are computational units capable of executing any function with minimal initialization overhead. Based on an analysis of production workload traces, our key insight is that requests in Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms show a highly skewed distribution, with most requests invoking a small subset of functions. We exploit this observation to approximate universal workers through locality groups and three-tier caching (handler, install, import). With this work, we aim to enable more efficient and scalable FaaS platforms capable of handling diverse workloads with minimal initialization overhead.

### Spotlight Attention: Towards Efficient LLM Generation via Non-linear   Hashing-based KV Cache Retrieval
**Authors**: Wenhao Li, Yuxin Zhang, Gen Luo, Haiyuan Wan, Ziyang Gong, Fei Chao, Rongrong Ji

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T06:45:58Z

**Summary**: Reducing the key-value (KV) cache burden in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerates inference. Dynamically selecting critical KV caches during decoding helps maintain performance. Existing methods use random linear hashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to the orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in LLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear hashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys, enhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight, stable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling optimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8 hours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves retrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least 5$\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the computational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA kernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\mu$s on a single A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\times$ higher than vanilla decoding.

### Bidirectional Sparse Attention for Faster Video Diffusion Training
**Authors**: Chenlu Zhan, Wen Li, Chuyu Shen, Jun Zhang, Suhui Wu, Hao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T06:16:31Z

**Summary**: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training, the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full attention.

### Coherence-Aware Task Graph Modeling for Realistic Application
**Authors**: Guochu Xiong, Xiangzhong Luo, Weichen Liu

**Updated**: 2025-09-11T02:00:27Z

**Summary**: As multicore systems continue to scale, cache coherence has emerged as a critical determinant of system performance, with coherence behavior and task execution closely intertwined, reshaping inter-task dependencies. Task graph modeling provides a structured way to capture such dependencies and serves as the foundation for many system-level design strategies. However, these strategies typically rely on predefined task graphs, while many real-world applications lack explicit graphs and exhibit dynamic, data-dependent behavior, limiting the effectiveness of static approaches. To address this, several task graph modeling methods for realistic workloads have been developed. Yet, they either rely on implicit techniques that use application-specific features without producing explicit graphs, or they generate graphs tailored to fixed scheduling models, which limits generality. More importantly, they often overlook coherence interactions, creating a gap between design assumptions and actual runtime behavior. To overcome these limitations, we propose CoTAM, a Coherence-Aware Task Graph Modeling framework for realistic workloads that constructs a unified task graph reflecting runtime behavior. CoTAM analyzes the impact of coherence by decoupling its effects from overall execution, quantifies its influence through a learned weighting scheme, and infers inter-task dependencies for coherence-aware graph generation. Extensive experiments show that CoTAM outperforms implicit methods, bridging the gap between dynamic workload behavior and existing designs while demonstrating the importance of incorporating cache coherence into task graph modeling for accurate and generalizable system-level analysis.

**Authors**: Muhammad Taha Cheema, Abeer Aamir, Khawaja Gul Muhammad, Naveed Anwar Bhatti, Ihsan Ayyub Qazi, Zafar Ayyub Qazi

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T17:59:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments without compromising user experience.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformer-Based Text-to-Speech with Transformer   Layer Caching
**Authors**: Siratish Sakpiboonchit

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T15:41:15Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a method to accelerate the inference process of diffusion transformer (DiT)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models by applying a selective caching mechanism to transformer layers. Specifically, I integrate SmoothCache into the F5-TTS architecture, focusing on caching outputs of self-attention and feed-forward network layers to reduce redundant computations during the denoising process. A calibration phase is introduced to analyze L1 relative errors between timesteps, guiding the selection of cache schedules that minimize quality degradation. To address the problem of inter-layer dependency, a unified caching schedule is adopted, applying the cache pattern derived from self-attention layers to both layer types. Experiments on LibriSpeech-PC and Seed-TTS datasets evaluate various cache thresholds and denoising step configurations. Results show that caching at higher denoising steps reduces inference time without compromising output quality, whereas caching at lower steps can negatively impact synthesis quality similarly to reducing the total number of denoising steps. Objective and subjective metrics confirm the effectiveness of SmoothCache in maintaining performance while improving computational efficiency. Comparisons between cached inference and reduced-step inference further highlight the benefits of selective caching, especially under high-step configurations. This work demonstrates that transformer layer caching is a practical solution for optimizing diffusion transformer-based TTS models without requiring architectural changes or retraining. Example inference results can be heard at https://siratish.github.io/F5-TTS_SmoothCache/ .

### BitROM: Weight Reload-Free CiROM Architecture Towards Billion-Parameter   1.58-bit LLM Inference
**Authors**: Wenlun Zhang, Xinyu Li, Shimpei Ando, Kentaro Yoshioka

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T12:46:29Z

**Summary**: Compute-in-Read-Only-Memory (CiROM) accelerators offer outstanding energy efficiency for CNNs by eliminating runtime weight updates. However, their scalability to Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by their vast parameter sizes. Notably, LLaMA-7B - the smallest model in LLaMA series - demands more than 1,000 cm2 of silicon area even in advanced CMOS nodes. This paper presents BitROM, the first CiROM-based accelerator that overcomes this limitation through co-design with BitNet's 1.58-bit quantization model, enabling practical and efficient LLM inference at the edge. BitROM introduces three key innovations: 1) a novel Bidirectional ROM Array that stores two ternary weights per transistor; 2) a Tri-Mode Local Accumulator optimized for ternary-weight computations; and 3) an integrated Decode-Refresh (DR) eDRAM that supports on-die KV-cache management, significantly reducing external memory access during decoding. In addition, BitROM integrates LoRA-based adapters to enable efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks. Evaluated in 65nm CMOS, BitROM achieves 20.8 TOPS/W and a bit density of 4,967 kB/mm2 - offering a 10x improvement in area efficiency over prior digital CiROM designs. Moreover, the DR eDRAM contributes to a 43.6% reduction in external DRAM access, further enhancing deployment efficiency for LLMs in edge applications.

### Accelerating Mixture-of-Expert Inference with Adaptive Expert Split   Mechanism
**Authors**: Jiaming Yan, Jianchun Liu, Hongli Xu, Liusheng Huang

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T07:28:24Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern large language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs. Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget, thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.

### EvolKV: Evolutionary KV Cache Compression for LLM Inference
**Authors**: Bohan Yu, Yekun Chai

**Updated**: 2025-09-10T06:32:49Z

**Summary**: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for KV cache budget allocation.

### TokenSelect: Efficient Long-Context Inference and Length Extrapolation   for LLMs via Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection
**Authors**: Wei Wu, Zhuoshi Pan, Chao Wang, Liyi Chen, Yunchu Bai, Tianfu Wang, Kun Fu, Zheng Wang, Hui Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-09-09T13:30:17Z

**Summary**: Rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred demand for processing extended context sequences in contemporary applications. However, this progress faces two challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues limit LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using QK dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a few critical KV cache tokens in attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we design the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented the efficient Paged Dot Product Kernel, significantly reducing the selection overhead. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to $23.84\times$ speedup in attention computation and up to $2.28\times$ acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.

### DuoServe-MoE: Dual-Phase Expert Prefetch and Cache Scheduling for   Efficient MoE LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yuning Zhang, Grant Pinkert, Nan Yang, Yanli Li, Dong Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-09-09T04:00:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of deep learning tasks. Mixture of Experts (MoE) further enhances their capabilities by increasing model width through sparsely activated expert branches, which keeps inference computation efficient. However, the large number of expert weights introduces significant GPU memory pressure, especially in resource-constrained environments such as single-GPU servers. More importantly, MoE inference consists of two fundamentally different stages: a prefill stage where most experts are activated densely, and a decode stage where only a few experts are triggered sparsely. Treating these stages with a uniform scheduling strategy often leads to suboptimal latency and memory usage. To address this, we propose DuoServe-MoE, an inference serving system that explicitly separates prefill and decode stages and applies tailored expert scheduling strategies to each. In the prefill stage, DuoServe-MoE uses a two-stream CUDA pipeline that overlaps expert weight prefetching with the computation of non-MoE layers, limiting expert residency in GPU memory. In the decode stage, a lightweight layer-level predictor trained offline from activation traces is used to prefetch only the most likely activated experts, without requiring any changes to the model. Experiments on 4-bit Mixtral-8x7B and 8x22B models show that DuoServe-MoE improves end-to-end latency by 1.42 to 7.54 times while keeping peak memory usage at only 15 percent of the full model size.

### BOLT: Bandwidth-Optimized Lightning-Fast Oblivious Map powered by Secure   HBM Accelerators
**Authors**: Yitong Guo, Hongbo Chen, Haobin Hiroki Chen, Yukui Luo, XiaoFeng Wang, Chenghong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-09T00:15:05Z

**Summary**: While Trusted Execution Environments provide a strong foundation for secure cloud computing, they remain vulnerable to access pattern leakages. Oblivious Maps (OMAPs) mitigate this by fully hiding access patterns but suffer from high overhead due to randomized remapping and worst-case padding. We argue these costs are not fundamental. Modern accelerators featuring High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) offer a new opportunity: Vaswani et al. [OSDI'18] point out that eavesdropping on HBM is difficult -- even for physical attackers -- as its memory channels are sealed together with processor cores inside the same physical package. Later, Hunt et al. [NSDI'20] show that, with proper isolation, HBM can be turned into an unobservable region where both data and memory traces are hidden. This motivates a rethink of OMAP design with HBM-backed solutions to finally overcome their traditional performance limits. Building on these insights, we present BOLT, a Bandwidth Optimized, Lightning-fast OMAP accelerator that, for the first time, achieves O(1) + O(log_2(log_2 (N))) bandwidth overhead. BOLT introduces three key innovations: (i) a new OMAP algorithm that leverages isolated HBM as an unobservable cache to accelerate oblivious access to large host memory; (ii) a self-hosted architecture that offloads execution and memory control from the host to mitigate CPU-side leakage; and (iii) tailored algorithm-architecture co-designs that maximize resource efficiency. We implement a prototype BOLT on a Xilinx U55C FPGA. Evaluations show that BOLT achieves up to 279x and 480x speedups in initialization and query time, respectively, over state-of-the-art OMAPs, including an industry implementation from Facebook.

### Revolutionizing Reinforcement Learning Framework for Diffusion Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Yinjie Wang, Ling Yang, Bowen Li, Ye Tian, Ke Shen, Mengdi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T17:58:06Z

**Summary**: We propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for diffusion language models (DLMs) that incorporates preferred inference trajectory into post-training, and is applicable across different architectures. Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex math and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific models to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models, namely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks. TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1% relative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical applications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building, training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and general tasks.

**Authors**: Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Linsen Ma, Yunhua Fang, Zirak Burzin Engineer, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T17:22:17Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) inference is bottlenecked by the limited bandwidth of CXL-based memory used for capacity expansion. We introduce CXL-NDP, a transparent near-data processing architecture that amplifies effective CXL bandwidth without requiring changes to the CXL.mem interface or AI models. CXL-NDP integrates a precision-scalable bit-plane layout for dynamic quantization with transparent lossless compression of weights and KV caches directly within the CXL device. In end-to-end serving, CXL-NDP improves throughput by 43%, extends the maximum context length by 87%, and reduces the KV cache footprint by 46.9% without accuracy loss. Hardware synthesis confirms its practicality with a modest silicon footprint, lowering the barrier for adopting efficient, scalable CXL-based memory in generative AI infrastructure.

### X-EcoMLA: Upcycling Pre-Trained Attention into MLA for Efficient and   Extreme KV Compression
**Authors**: Guihong Li, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Mingyu Yang, Vikram Appia, Emad Barsoum

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T13:34:54Z

**Summary**: Multi-head latent attention (MLA) is designed to optimize KV cache memory through low-rank key-value joint compression. Rather than caching keys and values separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing memory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory efficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation lies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be trained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits fully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different attention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post training distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention into an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training adaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that leveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training accuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising model performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively compress the KV cache while preserving the performance on the benchmarks; specifically, for Llama3.2-1B-Instruct baseline, a 6.4x compression achieves the same average score by using only 3.6B training tokens and 70 GPU hours on AMD MI300, whereas a 10.6x compression have less than 0.1% average score drop with 7B training tokens and 140 GPU hours.

### CausNVS: Autoregressive Multi-view Diffusion for Flexible 3D Novel View   Synthesis
**Authors**: Xin Kong, Daniel Watson, Yannick Strümpler, Michael Niemeyer, Federico Tombari

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T11:49:51Z

**Summary**: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis, but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across diverse settings.

### Scaling up Multi-Turn Off-Policy RL and Multi-Agent Tree Search for LLM   Step-Provers
**Authors**: Ran Xin, Zeyu Zheng, Yanchen Nie, Kun Yuan, Xia Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T09:54:18Z

**Summary**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem proving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by challenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and inference-time compute. This paper introduces \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system designed to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary innovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space, enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics benchmarks. \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\% and 41.4\% on the MiniF2F and ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal mathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of broader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon multi-turn reasoning and complex search.

### Physical Autoregressive Model for Robotic Manipulation without Action   Pretraining
**Authors**: Zijian Song, Sihan Qin, Tianshui Chen, Liang Lin, Guangrun Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T09:09:36Z

**Summary**: The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

### HyFedRAG: A Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for   Heterogeneous and Privacy-Sensitive Data
**Authors**: Cheng Qian, Hainan Zhang, Yongxin Tong, Hong-Wei Zheng, Zhiming Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T08:44:24Z

**Summary**: Centralized RAG pipelines struggle with heterogeneous and privacy-sensitive data, especially in distributed healthcare settings where patient data spans SQL, knowledge graphs, and clinical notes. Clinicians face difficulties retrieving rare disease cases due to privacy constraints and the limitations of traditional cloud-based RAG systems in handling diverse formats and edge devices. To address this, we introduce HyFedRAG, a unified and efficient Federated RAG framework tailored for Hybrid data modalities. By leveraging an edge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across diverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are: (1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which supports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and unstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into standardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs integrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate lightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three anonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich, de-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize response latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier caching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache, and cloud inference cache. Experimental results on PMC-Patients demonstrate that HyFedRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of retrieval quality, generation consistency, and system efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable and privacy-compliant solution for RAG over structural-heterogeneous data, unlocking the potential of LLMs in sensitive and diverse data environments.

### Tree of Agents: Improving Long-Context Capabilities of Large Language   Models through Multi-Perspective Reasoning
**Authors**: Song Yu, Xiaofei Xu, Ke Deng, Li Li, Lin Tian

**Updated**: 2025-09-08T08:34:02Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized. Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger commercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Aireduce952/Tree-of-Agents.

### A facile vector substrate platform via BaTiO3 membrane transfer enables   high quality solution processed epitaxial PZT on silicon
**Authors**: Asraful Haque, Antony Jeyaseelan, Shubham Kumar Parate, Srinivasan Raghavan, Pavan Nukala

**Updated**: 2025-09-07T13:15:17Z

**Summary**: The direct integration of high-performance ferroelectric oxides with silicon remains challenging due to lattice mismatch, thermal incompatibility, and the need for high-temperature epitaxial growth. Here, a hybrid integration approach is demonstrated in which crystalline BaTiO3 (BTO) membranes are first transferred onto Pt coated Si substrates and subsequently used as vector substrates (VS) for the growth of epitaxial (001) Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) thin films via chemical solution deposition (CSD). A KI and HCl based etchant enables rapid and complete dissolution of the SrVO3 sacrificial layer in about 30 minutes, reducing the release time from days to minutes compared with conventional water based approaches to dissolve AVO3 and AMoO3 (A is Ca, Sr, Ba). The BTO VS imposes dominant (00l) out of plane orientation and in plane cube on cube epitaxy in the overlying PZT. Devices exhibit remnant polarization 10 to 12 micro coulomb/cm2 and coercive field of 100 kV/cm, with stable switching to 10^8 cycles on the VS. From piezoelectric butterfly loops, we extract effective d33 of 70 pm/V for PZT on VS, and 54 pm/V for PZT grown on conventional Pt Si substrates. This approach demonstrates a scalable and cost effective route for integrating functional ferroelectric materials onto silicon and offers a promising platform for future CMOS compatible oxide electronics.

### Tight Cache Contention Analysis for WCET Estimation on Multicore Systems
**Authors**: Shuai Zhao, Jieyu Jiang, Shenlin Cai, Yaowei Liang, Chen Jie, Yinjie Fang, Wei Zhang, Guoquan Zhang, Yaoyao Gu, Xiang Xiao, Wei Qin, Xiangzhen Ouyang, Wanli Chang

**Updated**: 2025-09-06T05:58:51Z

**Summary**: WCET (Worst-Case Execution Time) estimation on multicore architecture is particularly challenging mainly due to the complex accesses over cache shared by multiple cores. Existing analysis identifies possible contentions between parallel tasks by leveraging the partial order of the tasks or their program regions. Unfortunately, they overestimate the number of cache misses caused by a remote block access without considering the actual cache state and the number of accesses. This paper reports a new analysis for inter-core cache contention. Based on the order of program regions in a task, we first identify memory references that could be affected if a remote access occurs in a region. Afterwards, a fine-grained contention analysis is constructed that computes the number of cache misses based on the access quantity of local and remote blocks. We demonstrate that the overall inter-core cache interference of a task can be obtained via dynamic programming. Experiments show that compared to existing methods, the proposed analysis reduces inter-core cache interference and WCET estimations by 52.31% and 8.94% on average, without significantly increasing computation overhead.

### RapidGNN: Energy and Communication-Efficient Distributed Training on   Large-Scale Graph Neural Networks
**Authors**: Arefin Niam, Tevfik Kosar, M S Q Zulkar Nine

**Updated**: 2025-09-05T16:10:20Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient cache construction and prefetching of remote features. Evaluation on benchmark graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to 3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing units efficiently. Furthermore, it achieves increased energy efficiency over the baseline methods for both CPU and GPU by 44% and 32%, respectively.

### KVCompose: Efficient Structured KV Cache Compression with Composite   Tokens
**Authors**: Dmitry Akulov, Mohamed Sana, Antonio De Domenico, Tareq Si Salem, Nicola Piovesan, Fadhel Ayed

**Updated**: 2025-09-05T14:58:24Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute kernels.   We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

### Mainframe-Style Channel Controllers for Modern Disaggregated Memory   Systems
**Authors**: Zikai Liu, Jasmin Schult, Pengcheng Xu, Timothy Roscoe

**Updated**: 2025-09-05T10:39:03Z

**Summary**: Despite the promise of alleviating the main memory bottleneck, and the existence of commercial hardware implementations, techniques for Near-Data Processing have seen relatively little real-world deployment. The idea has received renewed interest with the appearance of disaggregated or "far" memory, for example in the use of CXL memory pools.   However, we argue that the lack of a clear OS-centric abstraction of Near-Data Processing is a major barrier to adoption of the technology. Inspired by the channel controllers which interface the CPU to disk drives in mainframe systems, we propose memory channel controllers as a convenient, portable, and virtualizable abstraction of Near-Data Processing for modern disaggregated memory systems.   In addition to providing a clean abstraction that enables OS integration while requiring no changes to CPU architecture, memory channel controllers incorporate another key innovation: they exploit the cache coherence provided by emerging interconnects to provide a much richer programming model, with more fine-grained interaction, than has been possible with existing designs.

### PagedEviction: Structured Block-wise KV Cache Pruning for Efficient   Large Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata, Jie Ye, Xian-He Sun, Anthony Kougkas, Murali Emani, Venkatram Vishwanath, Bogdan Nicolae

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T16:40:01Z

**Summary**: KV caching significantly improves the efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) inference by storing attention states from previously processed tokens, enabling faster generation of subsequent tokens. However, as sequence length increases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address this, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache pruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention. Unlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or evict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient block-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method integrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications to its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models on the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.

### Dissecting the NVIDIA Hopper Architecture through Microbenchmarking and   Multiple Level Analysis
**Authors**: Weile Luo, Ruibo Fan, Zeyu Li, Dayou Du, Hongyuan Liu, Qiang Wang, Xiaowen Chu

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T15:21:11Z

**Summary**: This study presents a comprehensive multi-level analysis of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture, focusing on its performance characteristics and novel features. We benchmark Hopper's memory subsystem, highlighting improvements in the L2 partitioned cache and global memory access compared to Ampere and Ada Lovelace. The evaluation of Hopper's fourth-generation tensor cores reveals the benefits of FP8 precision and asynchronous wgmma instructions for matrix operations. Additionally, we investigate the performance of DPX instructions for dynamic programming, distributed shared memory (DSM) for inter-SM communication, and the Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) for asynchronous data movement. Through multi-level evaluation, we discover that the Hopper architecture demonstrates significant acceleration potential in real-world applications. For instance, the asynchronous programming model supported by TMA achieves a 1.5x speedup in matrix multiplication, FP8 delivers nearly double the performance of FP16, and DPX instructions accelerate a computational biology algorithm by at least 4.75x. Our findings provide actionable insights for optimizing compute-intensive workloads, from AI training to bioinformatics, on Hopper GPUs.

### Set Block Decoding is a Language Model Inference Accelerator
**Authors**: Itai Gat, Heli Ben-Hamu, Marton Havasi, Daniel Haziza, Jeremy Reizenstein, Gabriel Synnaeve, David Lopez-Paz, Brian Karrer, Yaron Lipman

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T13:02:39Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive next token prediction language models offer powerful capabilities but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to the high computational and memory costs of inference, particularly during the decoding stage. We introduce Set Block Decoding (SBD), a simple and flexible paradigm that accelerates generation by integrating standard next token prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within a single architecture. SBD allows the model to sample multiple, not necessarily consecutive, future tokens in parallel, a key distinction from previous acceleration methods. This flexibility allows the use of advanced solvers from the discrete diffusion literature, offering significant speedups without sacrificing accuracy. SBD requires no architectural changes or extra training hyperparameters, maintains compatibility with exact KV-caching, and can be implemented by fine-tuning existing next token prediction models. By fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, we demonstrate that SBD enables a 3-5x reduction in the number of forward passes required for generation while achieving same performance as equivalent NTP training.

### VisioFirm: Cross-Platform AI-assisted Annotation Tool for Computer   Vision
**Authors**: Safouane El Ghazouali, Umberto Michelucci

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T12:54:32Z

**Summary**: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction. Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation. Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO, COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from \href{https://github.com/OschAI/VisioFirm}{https://github.com/OschAI/VisioFirm}.

### Systematic Timing Leakage Analysis of NIST PQDSS Candidates: Tooling and   Lessons Learned
**Authors**: Olivier Adjonyo, Sebastien Bardin, Emanuele Bellini, Gilbert Ndollane Dione, Mahmudul Faisal Al Ameen, Robert Merget, Frederic Recoules, Yanis Sellami

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T08:41:06Z

**Summary**: The PQDSS standardization process requires cryptographic primitives to be free from vulnerabilities, including timing and cache side-channels. Resistance to timing leakage is therefore an essential property, and achieving this typically relies on software implementations that follow constant-time principles. Moreover, ensuring that all implementations are constant-time is crucial for fair performance comparisons, as secure implementations often incur additional overhead. Such analysis also helps identify scheme proposals that are inherently difficult to implement in constant time. Because constant-time properties can be broken during compilation, it is often necessary to analyze the compiled binary directly. Since manual binary analysis is extremely challenging, automated analysis becomes highly important. Although several tools exist to assist with such analysis, they often have usability limitations and are difficult to set up correctly. To support the developers besides the NIST committee in verifying candidates, we developed a toolchain that automates configuration, execution, and result analysis for several widely used constant-time analysis tools. We selected TIMECOP and Binsec/Rel2 to verify constant-time policy compliance at the binary level, and dudect and RTLF to detect side-channel vulnerabilities through statistical analysis of execution time behavior. We demonstrate its effectiveness and practicability by evaluating the NIST PQDSS round 1 and round 2 implementations. We reported 26 issues in total to the respective developers, and 5 of them have already been fixed. We also discuss our different findings, as well as the benefits of shortcomings of the different tools.

### IC-Cache: Efficient Large Language Model Serving via In-context Caching
**Authors**: Yifan Yu, Yu Gan, Nikhil Sarda, Lillian Tsai, Jiaming Shen, Yanqi Zhou, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Fan Lai, Henry M. Levy, David Culler

**Updated**: 2025-09-04T06:20:55Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have excelled in various applications, yet serving them at scale is challenging due to their substantial resource demands and high latency. Our real-world studies reveal that over 70% of user requests to LLMs have semantically similar counterparts, suggesting the potential for knowledge transfer among requests. However, naively caching and reusing past responses leads to a big quality drop. In this paper, we introduce IC-Cache, a caching system that enables live LLM capability augmentation to improve serving efficiency: by leveraging historical request-response pairs from larger models as in-context examples, IC-Cache empowers small LLMs to imitate and even exceed the compositional abilities (e.g., reasoning) of their larger counterparts, enabling selective offloading of requests to reduce cost and latency. Achieving this live augmentation at scale introduces intricate trade-offs between response quality, latency, and system throughput. For a new request, IC-Cache efficiently selects similar, high-utility examples to prepend them to the new request's input. At scale, it adaptively routes requests across LLMs of varying capabilities, accounting for response quality and serving loads. IC-Cache employs a cost-aware cache replay mechanism that refines example quality offline to maximize online cache utility and efficiency. Evaluations on millions of realistic requests demonstrate that IC-Cache improves LLM serving throughput by 1.4-5.9x and reduces latency by 28-71% without hurting response quality.

### ConServe: Fine-Grained GPU Harvesting for LLM Online and Offline   Co-Serving
**Authors**: Yifan Qiao, Shu Anzai, Shan Yu, Haoran Ma, Shuo Yang, Yang Wang, Miryung Kim, Yongji Wu, Yang Zhou, Jiarong Xing, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Ion Stoica, Harry Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T20:54:57Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) serving demands low latency and high throughput, but high load variability makes it challenging to achieve high GPU utilization. In this paper, we identify a synergetic but overlooked opportunity to co-serve latency-critical online requests alongside latency-tolerant offline tasks such as model benchmarking. While promising, existing serving systems fail to co-serve them efficiently, as their coarse-grained resource management at the request or iteration level cannot harvest millisecond-level GPU idle cycles without introducing interference that violates online latency objectives. ConServe is a new LLM co-serving system that achieves high throughput and strong online latency guarantees by managing resources at finer granularities. ConServe introduces three techniques: (1) a latency-aware token-level scheduler that precisely sizes offline batches and tokens to fit within online latency objectives; (2) sub-iteration, layer-wise preemption that allows offline tasks to yield to online load spikes; and (3) incremental KV cache management that enables preempting and resuming offline requests at near-zero cost. Evaluations with Llama-3.1 and Qwen-2.5 models on real-world workloads show that ConServe delivers an average of 2.2$\times$ higher throughput and reduces online serving tail latency by 2.9$\times$ on average compared to state-of-the-art systems.

### CloudFormer: An Attention-based Performance Prediction for Public Clouds   with Unknown Workload
**Authors**: Amirhossein Shahbazinia, Darong Huang, Luis Costero, David Atienza

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T15:15:44Z

**Summary**: Cloud platforms are increasingly relied upon to host diverse, resource-intensive workloads due to their scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. In multi-tenant cloud environments, virtual machines are consolidated on shared physical servers to improve resource utilization. While virtualization guarantees resource partitioning for CPU, memory, and storage, it cannot ensure performance isolation. Competition for shared resources such as last-level cache, memory bandwidth, and network interfaces often leads to severe performance degradation. Existing management techniques, including VM scheduling and resource provisioning, require accurate performance prediction to mitigate interference. However, this remains challenging in public clouds due to the black-box nature of VMs and the highly dynamic nature of workloads. To address these limitations, we propose CloudFormer, a dual-branch Transformer-based model designed to predict VM performance degradation in black-box environments. CloudFormer jointly models temporal dynamics and system-level interactions, leveraging 206 system metrics at one-second resolution across both static and dynamic scenarios. This design enables the model to capture transient interference effects and adapt to varying workload conditions without scenario-specific tuning. Complementing the methodology, we provide a fine-grained dataset that significantly expands the temporal resolution and metric diversity compared to existing benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that CloudFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving robust generalization across diverse and previously unseen workloads. Notably, CloudFormer attains a mean absolute error (MAE) of just 7.8%, representing a substantial improvement in predictive accuracy and outperforming existing methods at least by 28%.

### Mooncake: A KVCache-centric Disaggregated Architecture for LLM Serving
**Authors**: Ruoyu Qin, Zheming Li, Weiran He, Mingxing Zhang, Yongwei Wu, Weimin Zheng, Xinran Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:56:29Z

**Summary**: Mooncake is the serving platform for Kimi, a leading LLM service provided by Moonshot AI. It features a KVCache-centric disaggregated architecture that separates the prefill and decoding clusters. It also leverages the underutilized CPU, DRAM, and SSD resources of the GPU cluster to implement a disaggregated cache of KVCache. The core of Mooncake is its KVCache-centric scheduler, which balances maximizing overall effective throughput while meeting latency-related Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Unlike traditional studies that assume all requests will be processed, Mooncake faces challenges due to highly overloaded scenarios. To mitigate these, we developed a prediction-based early rejection policy. Experiments show that Mooncake excels in long-context scenarios. Compared to the baseline method, Mooncake can achieve up to a 525% increase in throughput in certain simulated scenarios while adhering to SLOs. Under real workloads, Mooncake's innovative architecture enables Kimi to handle 75% more requests.

### RAT: Bridging RNN Efficiency and Attention Accuracy via Chunk-based   Sequence Modeling
**Authors**: Xiuying Wei, Anunay Yadav, Razvan Pascanu, Caglar Gulcehre

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T14:28:23Z

**Summary**: Transformers have become the cornerstone of modern large-scale language models, but their reliance on softmax attention poses a computational bottleneck at both training and inference. Recurrent models offer high efficiency, but compressing the full sequence into a fixed-size and holistic representation suffers from memory degradation in long contexts and limits fine-grained retrieval. To address this, we propose RAT, an intermediate design that bridges the efficiency of RNNs and capacity of attention. RAT partitions the input into chunks, applies recurrence within each chunk for local dependencies, and softmax-based attention across chunks for long-range interactions. This design mitigates memory degradation and enables direct access to distant tokens, while retaining computational efficiency. Empirically, with a chunk size of 16, the RAT block achieves a 7x improvement in training speed with 100K token sequences and 9x in generation at the 4K position, while maintaining similar performance compared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter models from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short- and long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We further propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves RAT with local attention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local interactions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces cache memory usage, but also consistently enhances performance and shows the overall best results.

### A Cegar-centric Bounded Reachability Analysis for Compositional Affine   Hybrid Systems
**Authors**: Atanu Kundu, Pratyay Sarkar, Rajarshi Ray

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T11:23:35Z

**Summary**: Reachability analysis of compositional hybrid systems, where individual components are modeled as hybrid automata, poses unique challenges. In addition to preserving the compositional semantics while computing system behaviors, algorithms have to cater to the explosion in the number of locations in the parallel product automaton. In this paper, we propose a bounded reachability analysis algorithm for compositional hybrid systems with piecewise affine dynamics, based on the principle of counterexample guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR). In particular, the algorithm searches for a counterexample in the discrete abstraction of the composition model, without explicitly computing a product automaton. When a counterexample is discovered in the abstraction, its validity is verified by a refinement of the state-space guided by the abstract counterexample. The state-space refinement is through a symbolic reachability analysis, particularly using a state-of-the-art algorithm with support functions as the continuous state representation. In addition, the algorithm mixes different semantics of composition with the objective of improved efficiency. Step compositional semantics is followed while exploring the abstract (discrete) state-space, while shallow compositional semantics is followed during state-space refinement with symbolic reachability analysis. Optimizations such as caching the results of the symbolic reachability analysis, which can be later reused, have been proposed. We implement this algorithm in the tool SAT-Reach and demonstrate the scalability benefits.

### Adaptive KV-Cache Compression without Manually Setting Budget
**Authors**: Chenxia Tang, Jianchun Liu, Hongli Xu, Liusheng Huang

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T08:38:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) inference relies heavily on KV-caches to accelerate autoregressive decoding, but the resulting memory footprint grows rapidly with sequence length, posing significant efficiency challenges. Current KV-cache compression methods suffer from a Procrustes' bed problem: they force diverse workloads into fixed compression ratios, leading to suboptimal resource allocation and inference performance. To this end, we present GVote, an adaptive KV-cache compression scheme that eliminates manual budget specification while achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. GVote operates on the principle that the important keys are the aggregation of keys required by future queries. The method predicts future query attention demands by Monte-Carlo style sampling potential queries and aggregating selected keys to determine the optimal cache budget without manual specification. Experimental evaluation demonstrates GVote's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks, including GSM8K, RULER and Longbench. Compared to baselines, GVote exhibits 2$\times$ memory reduction while the accuracy maintains higher or comparable.

### FastCache: Fast Caching for Diffusion Transformer Through Learnable   Linear Approximation
**Authors**: Dong Liu, Yanxuan Yu, Jiayi Zhang, Yifan Li, Ben Lengerich, Ying Nian Wu

**Updated**: 2025-09-03T06:56:21Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) are powerful generative models but remain computationally intensive due to their iterative structure and deep transformer stacks. To alleviate this inefficiency, we propose FastCache, a hidden-state-level caching and compression framework that accelerates DiT inference by exploiting redundancy within the model's internal representations. FastCache introduces a dual strategy: (1) a spatial-aware token selection mechanism that adaptively filters redundant tokens based on hidden state saliency, and (2) a transformer-level cache that reuses latent activations across timesteps when changes are statistically insignificant. These modules work jointly to reduce unnecessary computation while preserving generation fidelity through learnable linear approximation. Theoretical analysis shows that FastCache maintains bounded approximation error under a hypothesis-testing-based decision rule. Empirical evaluations across multiple DiT variants demonstrate substantial reductions in latency and memory usage, with best generation output quality compared to other cache methods, as measured by FID and t-FID. Code implementation of FastCache is available on GitHub at https://github.com/NoakLiu/FastCache-xDiT.

**Authors**: Zifan Zhang, Zhiyuan Peng, Hanzhi Yu, Mingzhe Chen, Yuchen Liu

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T18:10:00Z

**Summary**: Digital network twins (DNTs), by representing a physical network using a virtual model, offer significant benefits such as streamlined network development, enhanced productivity, and cost reduction for next-generation (nextG) communication infrastructure. Existing works mainly describe the deployment of DNT technologies in various service sections.The full life cycle of DNTs for telecommunication has not yet been comprehensively studied, particularly in the aspects of fine-grained creation, real-time adaptation, resource-efficient deployment, and security protection. This article presents an in-depth overview of DNTs, exploring their concrete integration into networks and communication, covering the fundamental designs, the emergent applications, and critical challenges in multiple dimensions. We also include two detailed case studies to illustrate how DNTs can be applied in real-world scenarios such as wireless traffic forecasting and edge caching. Additionally, a forward-looking vision of the research opportunities in tackling the challenges of DNTs is provided, aiming to fully maximize the benefits of DNTs in nextG networks.

### A Novel Coded Caching Scheme for Partially Cooperative Device-to-Device   Networks
**Authors**: Rashid Ummer N. T., K. K. Krishnan Namboodiri, B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T17:35:42Z

**Summary**: Device-to-device (D2D) communication is one of the most promising techniques for future wireless cellular communication systems. This paper considers coded caching in a partially cooperative wireless D2D network, where only a subset of users transmit during delivery, while all users request files. The non-transmitting users are referred to as selfish users. All existing schemes that do not require knowledge of the identity of selfish users before content placement are limited to the high-memory regime, particularly when the number of selfish users is large. We propose a novel coded caching scheme for a partially cooperative D2D network that operates in all feasible memory regimes, regardless of the number of selfish users. We also derive a lower bound on the transmission load of a partially cooperative D2D coded caching scheme. Using this bound, the proposed scheme is shown to be optimal in the high-memory regime.

### REPS: Recycled Entropy Packet Spraying for Adaptive Load Balancing and   Failure Mitigation
**Authors**: Tommaso Bonato, Abdul Kabbani, Ahmad Ghalayini, Michael Papamichael, Mohammad Dohadwala, Lukas Gianinazzi, Mikhail Khalilov, Elias Achermann, Daniele De Sensi, Torsten Hoefler

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T16:39:56Z

**Summary**: Next-generation datacenters require highly efficient network load balancing to manage the growing scale of artificial intelligence (AI) training and general datacenter traffic. However, existing Ethernet-based solutions, such as Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) and oblivious packet spraying (OPS), struggle to maintain high network utilization due to both increasing traffic demands and the expanding scale of datacenter topologies, which also exacerbate network failures. To address these limitations, we propose REPS, a lightweight decentralized per-packet adaptive load balancing algorithm designed to optimize network utilization while ensuring rapid recovery from link failures. REPS adapts to network conditions by caching good-performing paths. In case of a network failure, REPS re-routes traffic away from it in less than 100 microseconds. REPS is designed to be deployed with next-generation out-of-order transports, such as Ultra Ethernet, and uses less than 25 bytes of per-connection state regardless of the topology size. We extensively evaluate REPS in large-scale simulations and FPGA-based NICs.

### MLP-Offload: Multi-Level, Multi-Path Offloading for LLM Pre-training to   Break the GPU Memory Wall
**Authors**: Avinash Maurya, M. Mustafa Rafique, Franck Cappello, Bogdan Nicolae

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T16:30:49Z

**Summary**: Training LLMs larger than the aggregated memory of multiple GPUs is increasingly necessary due to the faster growth of LLM sizes compared to GPU memory. To this end, multi-tier host memory or disk offloading techniques are proposed by state of art. Despite advanced asynchronous multi-tier read/write strategies, such offloading strategies result in significant I/O overheads in the critical path of training, resulting in slower iterations. To this end, we propose MLP-Offload, a novel multi-level, multi-path offloading engine specifically designed for optimizing LLM training on resource-constrained setups by mitigating I/O bottlenecks. We make several key observations that drive the design of MLP-Offload, such as I/O overheads during the update dominate the iteration time; I/O bandwidth of the third-level remote storage tier remains unutilized; and, contention due to concurrent offloading amplifies I/O bottlenecks. Driven by these insights, we design and implement MLP-Offload to offload the optimizer states across multiple tiers in a cache-efficient and concurrency-controlled fashion to mitigate I/O bottlenecks during the backward and update phases. Evaluations on models up to 280B parameters shows that MLP-Offload achieves 2.5$\times$ faster iterations compared to the state-of-the-art LLM training runtimes.

### Cache Management for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs -- extended version
**Authors**: Spyros Angelopoulos, Loris Marchal, Adrien Obrecht, Bertrand Simon

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T15:19:06Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a variety of tasks. One of the main challenges towards the successful deployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions of parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been proposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated when producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently managing the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts should be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.   In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert management optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture of LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first present lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and randomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like policies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a layer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.   Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE usage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging problem, such as the standard LRU.

### Leveraging Approximate Caching for Faster Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Shai Bergman, Zhang Ji, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Diana Petrescu, Rafael Pires, Mathis Randl, Martijn de Vos

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T13:09:37Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves the reliability of large language model (LLM) answers by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG increases the end-to-end inference time since looking for relevant documents from large vector databases is computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce Proximity, an approximate key-value cache that optimizes the RAG workflow by leveraging similarities in user queries. Instead of treating each query independently, Proximity reuses previously retrieved documents when similar queries appear, substantially reducing reliance on expensive vector database lookups. To scale efficiently, Proximity employs a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme that enables fast cache lookups while preserving retrieval accuracy. We evaluate Proximity using the MMLU and MedRAG question answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Proximity with our LSH scheme and a realistically skewed MedRAG workload reduces database calls by 78.9% while maintaining database recall and test accuracy. We experiment with different similarity tolerances and cache capacities, and show that the time spent within the Proximity cache remains low and constant (4.8 microseconds) even as the cache grows substantially in size. Our work highlights that approximate caching is a viable and effective strategy for optimizing RAG-based systems.

### Efficient Geometry Compression and Communication for 3D Gaussian   Splatting Point Clouds
**Authors**: Liang Xie, Yanting Li, Luyang Tang, Wei Gao

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T11:58:06Z

**Summary**: Storage and transmission challenges in dynamic 3D scene representation based on the i3DV platform, With increasing scene complexity, the explosive growth of 3D Gaussian data volume causes excessive storage space occupancy. To address this issue, we propose adopting the AVS PCRM reference software for efficient compression of Gaussian point cloud geometry data. The strategy deeply integrates the advanced encoding capabilities of AVS PCRM into the i3DV platform, forming technical complementarity with the original rate-distortion optimization mechanism based on binary hash tables. On one hand, the hash table efficiently caches inter-frame Gaussian point transformation relationships, which allows for high-fidelity transmission within a 40 Mbps bandwidth constraint. On the other hand, AVS PCRM performs precise compression on geometry data. Experimental results demonstrate that the joint framework maintains the advantages of fast rendering and high-quality synthesis in 3D Gaussian technology while achieving significant 10\%-25\% bitrate savings on universal test sets. It provides a superior rate-distortion tradeoff solution for the storage, transmission, and interaction of 3D volumetric video.

### SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache   Channel Pruning
**Authors**: Huanxuan Liao, Yixing Xu, Shizhu He, Guanchen Li, Xuanwu Yin, Dong Li, Emad Barsoum, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T11:29:34Z

**Summary**: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

### Batch Query Processing and Optimization for Agentic Workflows
**Authors**: Junyi Shen, Noppanat Wadlom, Yao Lu

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T09:17:40Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic workflows combine multi-step reasoning, tool use, and collaboration across multiple specialized agents. Existing LLM serving engines optimize individual calls in isolation, while multi-agent frameworks focus on orchestration without system-level performance planning. As a result, repeated prompts, overlapping contexts, and concurrent executions create substantial redundancy and poor GPU utilization, especially in batch analytics scenarios. We introduce Halo, a system that brings batch query processing and optimization into agentic LLM workflows. Halo represents each workflow as a structured query plan DAG and constructs a consolidated graph for batched queries that exposes shared computation. Guided by a cost model that jointly considers prefill and decode costs, cache reuse, and GPU placement, Halo performs plan-level optimization to minimize redundant execution. Its runtime integrates adaptive batching, KV-cache sharing and migration, along with compute-communication overlap to maximize hardware efficiency. Evaluation across six benchmarks shows that Halo achieves up to 18.6x speedup for batch inference and 4.7x throughput improvement under online serving, scaling to workloads of tens of thousands of queries and complex graphs. These gains are achieved without compromising output quality. By unifying query optimization with LLM serving, Halo enables efficient agentic workflows in data analytics and decision-making applications.

### Augmented Shuffle Differential Privacy Protocols for Large-Domain   Categorical and Key-Value Data
**Authors**: Takao Murakami, Yuichi Sei, Reo Eriguchi

**Updated**: 2025-09-02T06:40:45Z

**Summary**: Shuffle DP (Differential Privacy) protocols provide high accuracy and privacy by introducing a shuffler who randomly shuffles data in a distributed system. However, most shuffle DP protocols are vulnerable to two attacks: collusion attacks by the data collector and users and data poisoning attacks. A recent study addresses this issue by introducing an augmented shuffle DP protocol, where users do not add noise and the shuffler performs random sampling and dummy data addition. However, it focuses on frequency estimation over categorical data with a small domain and cannot be applied to a large domain due to prohibitively high communication and computational costs.   In this paper, we fill this gap by introducing a novel augmented shuffle DP protocol called the FME (Filtering-with-Multiple-Encryption) protocol. Our FME protocol uses a hash function to filter out unpopular items and then accurately calculates frequencies for popular items. To perform this within one round of interaction between users and the shuffler, our protocol carefully communicates within a system using multiple encryption. We also apply our FME protocol to more advanced KV (Key-Value) statistics estimation with an additional technique to reduce bias. For both categorical and KV data, we prove that our protocol provides computational DP, high robustness to the above two attacks, accuracy, and efficiency. We show the effectiveness of our proposals through comparisons with twelve existing protocols.

### LLMs cannot spot math errors, even when allowed to peek into the   solution
**Authors**: KV Aditya Srivatsa, Kaushal Kumar Maurya, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2025-09-01T11:41:10Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on math word problems, yet they have been shown to struggle with meta-reasoning tasks such as identifying errors in student solutions. In this work, we investigate the challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution, aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve performance.

### Rotate, Clip, and Partition: Towards W2A4KV4 Quantization by Integrating   Rotation and Learnable Non-uniform Quantizer
**Authors**: Euntae Choi, Sumin Song, Woosang Lim, Sungjoo Yoo

**Updated**: 2025-09-01T07:26:57Z

**Summary**: We propose Rotate, Clip, and Partition (RCP), a quantization-aware training (QAT) approach that first realizes extreme compression of LLMs with W2A4KV4(2-bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) configuration. RCP integrates recent rotation techniques with a novel non-uniform weight quantizer design, by quantitatively analyzing the impact of random rotation on 2-bit weight quantization. Our weight quantizer features Learnable Direct Partitioning (LDP), which introduces learnable parameters to directly learn non-uniform intervals jointly with LLM weights. We also present a specialized GPU kernel that supports GEMV on non-uniform W2A4. Experiments show that RCP can compress LLaMA-2-7B to W2A4KV4 with a loss of only 2.84 WikiText2 ppl and 5.29 times reduced memory footprint. Furthermore, RCP can quantize challenging mobile-targeted LLaMA-3.2 models and domain-specific WizardCoder-7B and MetaMath-7B with no critical problems such as convergence failure and repetition. Code is available at https://github.com/ songsm921/RCP.

### ProMoE: Fast MoE-based LLM Serving using Proactive Caching
**Authors**: Xiaoniu Song, Zihang Zhong, Rong Chen, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-01T03:51:09Z

**Summary**: The promising applications of large language models are often limited by the constrained GPU memory capacity available on edge devices. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models help address this issue by activating only a subset of the model's parameters during computation. This approach allows the unused parameters to be offloaded to host memory, thereby reducing the overall GPU memory demand. However, existing cache-based offloading solutions handle cache misses reactively, which significantly impacts system performance. In this paper, we introduce ProMoE, a novel proactive caching system that utilizes intermediate results to predict subsequent expert usage. By proactively fetching experts in advance, ProMoE eliminates passive cache misses, removes loading time from the critical path, and reduces the performance overhead associated with offloading. Our evaluations demonstrate that ProMoE achieves an average speedup of 2.20x (up to 3.21x) and 2.07x (up to 5.02x) in the prefill and decode stages, respectively, compared to existing offloading solutions.

### REFRAG: Rethinking RAG based Decoding
**Authors**: Xiaoqiang Lin, Aritra Ghosh, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low, Anshumali Shrivastava, Vijai Mohan

**Updated**: 2025-09-01T03:31:44Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

### LLM Serving Optimization with Variable Prefill and Decode Lengths
**Authors**: Meixuan Wang, Yinyu Ye, Zijie Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-31T15:09:36Z

**Summary**: We study the problem of serving LLM (Large Language Model) requests where each request has heterogeneous prefill and decode lengths. In LLM serving, the prefill length corresponds to the input prompt length, which determines the initial memory usage in the KV cache. The decode length refers to the number of output tokens generated sequentially, with each additional token increasing the KV cache memory usage by one unit. Given a set of n requests, our goal is to schedule and process them to minimize the total completion time. We show that this problem is NP-hard due to the interplay of batching, placement constraints, precedence relationships, and linearly increasing memory usage. We then analyze commonly used scheduling strategies in practice, such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-First (SF), and prove that their competitive ratios scale up sublinearly with the memory limit-a significant drawback in real-world settings where memory demand is large. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on a new selection metric that efficiently forms batches over time. We prove that this algorithm achieves a constant competitive ratio. Finally, we develop and evaluate a few algorithm variants inspired by this approach, including dynamic programming variants, local search methods, and an LP-based scheduler, demonstrating through comprehensive simulations that they outperform standard baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.

### Accelerating Latency-Critical Applications with AI-Powered   Semi-Automatic Fine-Grained Parallelization on SMT Processors
**Authors**: Denis Los, Igor Petushkov

**Updated**: 2025-08-31T14:51:19Z

**Summary**: Latency-critical applications tend to show low utilization of functional units due to frequent cache misses and mispredictions during speculative execution in high-performance superscalar processors. However, due to significant impact on single-thread performance, Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) technology is rarely used with heavy threads of latency-critical applications. In this paper, we explore utilization of SMT technology to support fine-grained parallelization of latency-critical applications. Following the advancements in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce Aira, an AI-powered Parallelization Adviser. To implement Aira, we extend AI Coding Agent in Cursor IDE with additional tools connected through Model Context Protocol, enabling end-to-end AI Agent for parallelization. Additional connected tools enable LLM-guided hotspot detection, collection of dynamic dependencies with Dynamic Binary Instrumentation, SMT-aware performance simulation to estimate performance gains. We apply Aira with Relic parallel framework for fine-grained task parallelism on SMT cores to parallelize latency-critical benchmarks representing real-world applications used in industry. We show 17% geomean performance gain from parallelization of latency-critical benchmarks using Aira with Relic framework.

### Yet Another Mirage of Breaking MIRAGE: Debunking Occupancy-based   Side-Channel Attacks on Fully Associative Randomized Caches
**Authors**: Chris Cao, Gururaj Saileshwar

**Updated**: 2025-08-31T05:43:55Z

**Summary**: Recent work presented at USENIX Security 2025 (SEC'25) claims that occupancy-based attacks can recover AES keys from the MIRAGE randomized cache. In this paper, we examine these claims and find that they arise from a modeling flaw in the SEC'25 paper. Most critically, the SEC'25 paper's simulation of MIRAGE uses a constant seed to initialize the random number generator used for global evictions in MIRAGE, causing every AES encryption they trace to evict the same deterministic sequence of cache lines. This artificially creates a highly repeatable timing pattern that is not representative of a realistic implementation of MIRAGE, where eviction sequences vary randomly between encryptions. When we instead randomize the eviction seed for each run, reflecting realistic operation, the correlation between AES T-table accesses and attacker runtimes disappears, and the attack fails. These findings show that the reported leakage is an artifact of incorrect modeling, and not an actual vulnerability in MIRAGE.

### NetGent: Agent-Based Automation of Network Application Workflows
**Authors**: Jaber Daneshamooz, Eugene Vuong, Laasya Koduru, Sanjay Chandrasekaran, Arpit Gupta

**Updated**: 2025-08-30T22:47:15Z

**Summary**: We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly. NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments, NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming, live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping, producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

### KVComp: A High-Performance, LLM-Aware, Lossy Compression Framework for   KV Cache
**Authors**: Bo Jiang, Taolue Yang, Youyuan Liu, Chengming Zhang, Xubin He, Sian Jin

**Updated**: 2025-08-30T18:25:19Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive potential in various practical applications. However, long context inference poses a significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to multiple gigabytes as sequence length and batch size increase. In this paper, we present KVComp, a generic and efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-text generation that synergistically works with both latency-critical and throughput-critical inference systems. KVComp employs novel lossy compression techniques specifically designed for KV cache data characteristics, featuring careful co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach maintains compatibility with the growing nature of KV cache while preserving high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that KVComp achieves on average 47\% and up to 83\% higher memory reduction rate compared to existing methods with little/no model accuracy degradation. Furthermore, KVComp achieves extremely high execution throughput, effectively reducing decompression overhead and, in some cases, even accelerating the matrix-vector multiplication operation and outperform cuBLAS-based attention kernels with less data movement.

### Discrete and Continuous Caching Games
**Authors**: Áron Jánosik, Csenge Miklós, Dániel G. Simon, Kristóf Zólomy

**Updated**: 2025-08-30T14:49:34Z

**Summary**: We investigate a discrete search game called the Multiple Caching Game where the searcher's aim is to find all of a set of $d$ treasures hidden in $n$ locations. Allowed queries are sets of locations of size $k$, and the searcher wins if in all $d$ queries, at least one treasure is hidden in one of the $k$ picked locations. P\'alv\"olgyi showed that the value of the game is at most $\frac{k^d}{\binom{n+d-1}{d}}$, with equality for large enough $n$. We conjecture the exact cases of equality. We also investigate variants of the game and show an example where their values are different, answering a question of P\'alv\"olgyi.   This game is closely related to a continuous variant, Alpern's Caching Game, based on which we define other continous variants of the multiple caching game and examine their values.

### DiffKV: Differentiated Memory Management for Large Language Models with   Parallel KV Compaction
**Authors**: Yanqi Zhang, Yuwei Hu, Runyuan Zhao, John C. S. Lui, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-30T09:35:22Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities but face substantial serving costs due to their high memory demands, with the key-value (KV) cache being a primary bottleneck. State-of-the-art KV cache compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, apply uniform treatment to both keys and values, and discard unimportant tokens entirely, overlooking the fine-grained distinctions in the significance of individual KV cache components. To address such limitations, we introduce \textit{DiffKV}, a novel framework for efficient KV cache compression that exploits three levels of differentiation in the KV cache: (1) the differing impact of keys and values on attention computation, (2) the varying importance of tokens, and (3) the diverse dynamic sparsity patterns across attention heads. These levels of differentiation introduce irregular memory usage patterns across different requests and attention heads, posing significant scalability challenges for memory management. To address these challenges, DiffKV proposes an on-GPU memory manager that compacts fragmented free memory list into contiguous regions in parallel, effectively translating sparsity in the KV cache into performance gains. We evaluate DiffKV on several mainstream LLMs, including the emerging thinking models that generate extended chains of thought. DiffKV is able to compress the KV cache by $2.7\times$ to $5.7\times$ with near-lossless accuracy on complex workloads requiring sophisticated reasoning and long-generation capabilities, and enhances throughput by $1.9\times$ to $5.4\times$. Source codes of DiffKV are available at https://github.com/zyqCSL/DiffKV.

### LightVLM: Acceleraing Large Multimodal Models with Pyramid Token Merging   and KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Lianyu Hu, Fanhua Shang, Wei Feng, Liang Wan

**Updated**: 2025-08-30T08:57:53Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput. Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B), hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by 3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

### GraphKV: Breaking the Static Selection Paradigm with Graph-Based KV   Cache Eviction
**Authors**: Xuelin Li, Xiangqi Jin, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-30T06:56:28Z

**Summary**: Efficient Key-Value (KV) cache management is essential for processing long text sequences in large language models (LLMs), where memory constraints often limit performance. Conventional KV eviction strategies, such as top-k selection based on attention scores, depend on static heuristics that fail to capture the evolving implicit dependencies among tokens during inference. To overcome this, we propose GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for KV cache compression. In GraphKV, tokens are modeled as nodes with importance scores, and edges represent their similarity relationships. Through a decay-signal-propagation mechanism, token importance is dynamically updated by propagating information across the graph, enabling adaptive retention of the most contextually significant tokens. GraphKV can be seamlessly utilized in existing KV cache eviction methods such as SnapKV and PyramidKV in a plug-and-play manner. Codes will be released on Github.

### Robust Containment Queries over Collections of Trimmed NURBS Surfaces   via Generalized Winding Numbers
**Authors**: Jacob Spainhour, Kenneth Weiss

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T20:39:21Z

**Summary**: We propose a containment query that is robust to the watertightness of regions bound by trimmed NURBS surfaces, as this property is difficult to guarantee for in-the-wild CAD models. Containment is determined through the generalized winding number (GWN), a mathematical construction that is indifferent to the arrangement of surfaces in the shape. Applying contemporary techniques for the 3D GWN to trimmed NURBS surfaces requires some form of geometric discretization, introducing computational inefficiency to the algorithm and even risking containment misclassifications near the surface. In contrast, our proposed method uses a novel reformulation of the relevant surface integral based on Stokes' theorem, which operates on the boundary and trimming curves as provided through rapidly converging adaptive quadrature. Batches of queries are further accelerated by memoizing (i.e.\ caching and reusing) quadrature node positions and tangents as they are evaluated. We demonstrate that our GWN method is robust to complex trimming geometry in a CAD model, and is accurate up to arbitrary precision at arbitrary distances from the surface. The derived containment query is therefore robust to model non-watertightness while respecting all curved features of the input shape.

### From TLinFormer to TConstFormer: The Leap to Constant-Time Transformer   Attention: Achieving O(1) Computation and O(1) KV Cache during Autoregressive   Inference
**Authors**: Zhongpan Tang

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T19:23:35Z

**Summary**: Although the Transformer has become the cornerstone of modern AI, its autoregressive inference suffers from a linearly growing KV Cache and a computational complexity of O(N^2 d), severely hindering its ability to process ultra-long sequences. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the TConstFormer architecture, building upon our previous work, TLinFormer. TConstFormer employs an innovative periodic state update mechanism to achieve a truly constant-size O(1) KV Cache. The computational complexity of this mechanism is also O(1) in an amortized sense: it performs purely constant-time computations for $k-1$ consecutive steps (e.g., $k=256$) and executes a single linear-time global information synchronization only on the $k$-th step. Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that TConstFormer exhibits an overwhelming advantage over baseline models in terms of speed, memory efficiency, and overall performance on long-text inference tasks. This breakthrough paves the way for efficient and robust streaming language model applications.

### Democratizing Agentic AI with Fast Test-Time Scaling on the Edge
**Authors**: Hao Mark Chen, Zhiwen Mo, Guanxi Lu, Shuang Liang, Lingxiao Ma, Wayne Luk, Hongxiang Fan

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T19:12:04Z

**Summary**: Deploying agentic AI on edge devices is crucial for privacy and responsiveness, but memory constraints typically relegate these systems to smaller Large Language Models (LLMs) with inferior reasoning capabilities. Test-Time Scaling (TTS) can bridge this reasoning gap by dedicating more compute during inference, but existing methods incur prohibitive overhead on edge hardware. To overcome this, we introduce FlashTTS, a serving system that makes TTS practical for memory-constrained LLM reasoning. FlashTTS introduces three synergistic optimizations: (i) Speculative Beam Extension to mitigate system stragglers from irregular reasoning paths; (ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model Memory Allocation to dynamically balance memory between generation and verification; and (iii) Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling to maximize KV-cache reuse. Built as a plug-and-play library for vLLM, FlashTTS enables edge LLMs on a single consumer GPU (24 GB) to match the accuracy and latency of large cloud models. Our evaluation demonstrates that FlashTTS achieves an average 2.2x higher goodput and reduces latency by 38%-68% compared to a vLLM baseline, paving the way for democratized, high-performance agentic AI on edge devices.

### Towards Compute-Optimal Many-Shot In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Shahriar Golchin, Yanfei Chen, Rujun Han, Manan Gandhi, Tianli Yu, Swaroop Mishra, Mihai Surdeanu, Rishabh Agarwal, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T18:45:22Z

**Summary**: Long-context large language models (LLMs) are able to process inputs containing up to several million tokens. In the scope of in-context learning (ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1) high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and (3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.

### Neural Visibility Cache for Real-Time Light Sampling
**Authors**: Jakub Bokšanský, Daniel Meister

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T09:58:17Z

**Summary**: Direct illumination with many lights is an inherent component of physically-based rendering, remaining challenging, especially in real-time scenarios. We propose an online-trained neural cache that stores visibility between lights and 3D positions. We feed light visibility to weighted reservoir sampling (WRS) to sample a light source. The cache is implemented as a fully-fused multilayer perceptron (MLP) with multi-resolution hash-grid encoding, enabling online training and efficient inference on modern GPUs in real-time frame rates. The cache can be seamlessly integrated into existing rendering frameworks and can be used in combination with other real-time techniques such as spatiotemporal reservoir sampling (ReSTIR).

### FedSEA-LLaMA: A Secure, Efficient and Adaptive Federated Splitting   Framework for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zishuai Zhang, Hainan zhang, Weihua Li, Qinnan zhang, jin Dong, Yongxin Tong, Zhiming Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T07:40:34Z

**Summary**: Private data holds promise for improving LLMs due to its high quality, but its scattered distribution across data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their deployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based federated split models are proposed, which offload most model parameters to the server (or distributed clients) while retaining only a small portion on the client to ensure data privacy. Despite this design, they still face three challenges: 1) Peer-to-peer key encryption struggles to secure transmitted vectors effectively; 2) The auto-regressive nature of LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially, causing high communication overhead; 3) Fixed partition points lack adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FedSEA-LLaMA, a Secure, Efficient, and Adaptive Federated splitting framework based on LLaMA2. First, we inject Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states to enable secure end-to-end vector transmission. Second, we employ attention-mask compression and KV cache collaboration to reduce communication costs, accelerating training and inference. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points for input/output blocks based on specific task requirements. Experiments on natural language understanding, summarization, and conversational QA tasks show that FedSEA-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2 and achieves up to 8x speedups in training and inference. Further analysis of privacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the effectiveness of FedSEA-LLaMA in security and adaptability.

### Enhancing LLM Efficiency: Targeted Pruning for Prefill-Decode   Disaggregation in Inference
**Authors**: Hao Zhang, Mengsi Lyu, Yulong Ao, Yonghua Lin

**Updated**: 2025-08-29T02:29:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD unified settings without disaggregation. Under the default settings, our method achieves a 20.56% inference speedup and a 4.95 times reduction in data transmission bandwidth consumption.

### TinyServe: Query-Aware Cache Selection for Efficient LLM Serving
**Authors**: Dong Liu, Yanxuan Yu

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T16:17:18Z

**Summary**: Serving large language models (LLMs) efficiently remains challenging due to the high memory and latency overhead of key-value (KV) cache access during autoregressive decoding. We present \textbf{TinyServe}, a lightweight and extensible serving system for deploying tiny LLMs (e.g., TinyLLaMA, GPT2-345M) with support for structured KV sparsity, plugin-based token selection, and hardware-efficient attention kernels. Unlike prior simulation frameworks, TinyServe executes real-time decoding with configurable sparsity strategies and fine-grained instrumentation.   To reduce decoding cost, we introduce a \textit{query-aware page selection} mechanism that leverages bounding-box metadata to estimate attention relevance between the query and KV cache blocks. This enables selective KV loading with minimal overhead and no model modifications. Our fused CUDA kernel integrates page scoring, sparse memory access, and masked attention in a single pass.   Experiments show that TinyServe achieves up to \textbf{3.4x} speedup and over \textbf{2x} memory savings with negligible accuracy drop. Additional analysis of cache reuse, page hit rate, and multi-GPU scaling confirms its practicality as an efficient system-level design for LLM training and inference research on resource-constrained hardware.

### Deep Multiple Quantization Network on Long Behavior Sequence for   Click-Through Rate Prediction
**Authors**: Zhuoxing Wei, Qi Liu, Qingchen Xie

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T14:58:47Z

**Summary**: In Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, the long behavior sequence, comprising the user's long period of historical interactions with items has a vital influence on assessing the user's interest in the candidate item. Existing approaches strike efficiency and effectiveness through a two-stage paradigm: first retrieving hundreds of candidate-related items and then extracting interest intensity vector through target attention. However, we argue that the discrepancy in target attention's relevance distribution between the retrieved items and the full long behavior sequence inevitably leads to a performance decline. To alleviate the discrepancy, we propose the Deep Multiple Quantization Network (DMQN) to process long behavior sequence end-to-end through compressing the long behavior sequence. Firstly, the entire spectrum of long behavior sequence will be quantized into multiple codeword sequences based on multiple independent codebooks. Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Unit is incorporated to facilitate the interaction of reduced codeword sequences. Then, attention between the candidate and multiple codeword sequences will output the interest vector. To enable online serving, intermediate representations of the codeword sequences are cached, significantly reducing latency. Our extensive experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of DMQN. The A/B test in our advertising system shows that DMQN improves CTR by 3.5% and RPM by 2.0%.

### SOT-MRAM Bitcell Scaling with BEOL Read Selectors: A DTCO Study
**Authors**: Yang Xiang, Fernando García-Redondo, Arvind Sharma, Van Dai Nguyen, Andrea Fantini, Philippe Matagne, Siddharth Rao, Subhali Subhechha, Lynn Verschueren, Mohammed Aftab Baig, Marie Garcia Bardon, Geert Hellings

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T08:49:24Z

**Summary**: This work explores the cross-node scaling potential of SOT-MRAM for last-level caches (LLCs) under heterogeneous system scaling paradigm. We perform extensive Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) exercises to evaluate the bitcell footprint for different cell configurations at a representative 7 nm technology and to assess their implications on read and write power-performance. We crucially identify the MTJ routing struggle in conventional two-transistor one-resistor (2T1R) SOT-MRAMs as the primary bitcell area scaling challenge and propose to use BEOL read selectors (BEOL RSs) that enable (10 -- 40) % bitcell area reduction and eventually match sub-N3 SRAM. On writability, we affirm that BEOL RS-based bitcells could meet the required SOT switching current, provided the magnetic free layer properties be engineered in line with LLC-specific, (0.1 -- 100) s retention targets. This is particularly to attribute to their (i) more available Si fins for write transistor and (ii) lower bitline resistance at reduced cell width. We nevertheless underscore the read tradeoff associated with BEOL RSs, with the low-drive IGZO-FET selector sacrificing the latency up to (3 -- 5) ns and the imperfectly rectifying diode selectors suffering (2.5 -- 5)$\times$ energy cost relative to 2T1R. This article thus highlights the realistic prospects and hurdles of BEOL RSs towards holistic power-performance-area scaling of SOT-MRAM.

### Matrixed-Spectrum Decomposition Accelerated Linear Boltzmann Transport   Equation Solver for Fast Scatter Correction in Multi-Spectral CT
**Authors**: Guoxi Zhu, Li Zhang, Zhiqiang Chen, Hewei Gao

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T08:05:42Z

**Summary**: X-ray scatter has been a serious concern in computed tomography (CT), leading to image artifacts and distortion of CT values. The linear Boltzmann transport equation (LBTE) is recognized as a fast and accurate approach for scatter estimation. However, for multi-spectral CT, it is cumbersome to compute multiple scattering components for different spectra separately when applying LBTE-based scatter correction. In this work, we propose a Matrixed-Spectrum Decomposition accelerated LBTE solver (MSD-LBTE) that can be used to compute X-ray scatter distributions from CT acquisitions at two or more different spectra simultaneously, in a unified framework with no sacrifice in accuracy and nearly no increase in computation in theory. First, a matrixed-spectrum solver of LBTE is obtained by introducing an additional label dimension to expand the phase space. Then, we propose a ``spectrum basis'' for LBTE and a principle of selection of basis using the QR decomposition, along with the above solver to construct the MSD-LBTE. Based on MSD-LBTE, a unified scatter correction method can be established for multi-spectral CT. We validate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method by comparing it with the Monte Carlo method, including the computational time. We also evaluate the scatter correction performance using two different phantoms for fast-kV switching based dual-energy CT, and using an elliptical phantom in a numerical simulation for kV-modulation enabled CT scans, validating that our proposed method can significantly reduce the computational cost at multiple spectra and effectively reduce scatter artifact in reconstructed CT images.

### MegaCacheX: Towards Cost-Effective Hierarchical Collaborative Content   Caching in Emerging Mega-Constellations
**Authors**: Haoyang Shi, Xing Zhang, Sitong Li, Minghang Li, Xinming Lu, Shaoxiang Xu, Guoquan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T05:22:25Z

**Summary**: Significant latency in global content delivery primarily arises from insufficient terrestrial infrastructure. Deploying space-based content delivery networks within emerging mega-constellations provides an effective means to bridge the digital divide. However, space-based caching faces constraints from physical-layer dynamics, including dynamic topologies, time-varying inter-satellite link conditions, and limited onboard energy. In addition, existing mechanisms often lack fine-grained content categorization and global optimization. This paper proposes MegaCacheX, a cost-effective hierarchical framework for collaborative content distribution that achieves "Earth-independence" by providing cloud services directly from space. Specifically, data centers in Sun-synchronous orbit act as primary content sources, while caching nodes in mega-constellations and ground stations collaboratively form a distributed edge layer. MegaCacheX optimizes caching strategies by integrating content popularity, regional user distribution, and satellite trajectory predictions. Multi-tier caching nodes serve as service anchors, enabling seamless content delivery with low latency. A prototype implemented on a microservices-based, containerized testbed demonstrates that MegaCacheX reduces global content access latency by about 36% compared to baseline approaches, while maintaining cost efficiency.

### Breaking Diffusion with Cache: Exploiting Approximate Caches in   Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Desen Sun, Shuncheng Jie, Sihang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T04:46:44Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models that produce content, such as images, from user prompts, but they are computationally intensive. To mitigate this cost, recent academic and industry work has adopted approximate caching, which reuses intermediate states from similar prompts in a cache. While efficient, this optimization introduces new security risks by breaking isolation among users. This work aims to comprehensively assess new security vulnerabilities arising from approximate caching. First, we demonstrate a remote covert channel established with the cache, where a sender injects prompts with special keywords into the cache and a receiver can recover that even after days, to exchange information. Second, we introduce a prompt stealing attack using the cache, where an attacker can recover existing cached prompts based on cache hit prompts. Finally, we introduce a poisoning attack that embeds the attacker's logos into the previously stolen prompt, to render them in future user prompts that hit the cache. These attacks are all performed remotely through the serving system, which indicates severe security vulnerabilities in approximate caching.

### Rethinking Transformer Connectivity: TLinFormer, A Path to Exact, Full   Context-Aware Linear Attention
**Authors**: Zhongpan Tang

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T04:10:19Z

**Summary**: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency}, \textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

### ASVD: Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition for Compressing   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhihang Yuan, Yuzhang Shang, Yue Song, Dawei Yang, Qiang Wu, Yan Yan, Guangyu Sun

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T03:57:52Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a new post-training compression paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate their wider adoption. We delve into LLM weight low-rank decomposition, and find that the challenges of this task stem from (1) the distribution variance in the LLM activations and (2) the sensitivity difference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by transforming the weight matrix based on the activation distribution. This transformation allows the outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into the transformed weight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers. In this way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the success of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced. ASVD can further achieve 50% KV cache reductions without performance drop in a training-free manner.

### Climber: Toward Efficient Scaling Laws for Large Recommendation Models
**Authors**: Songpei Xu, Shijia Wang, Da Guo, Xianwen Guo, Qiang Xiao, Bin Huang, Guanlin Wu, Chuanjiang Luo

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T01:40:30Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based generative models have achieved remarkable success across domains with various scaling law manifestations. However, our extensive experiments reveal persistent challenges when applying Transformer to recommendation systems: (1) Transformer scaling is not ideal with increased computational resources, due to structural incompatibilities with recommendation-specific features such as multi-source data heterogeneity; (2) critical online inference latency constraints (tens of milliseconds) that intensify with longer user behavior sequences and growing computational demands. We propose Climber, an efficient recommendation framework comprising two synergistic components: the model architecture for efficient scaling and the co-designed acceleration techniques. Our proposed model adopts two core innovations: (1) multi-scale sequence extraction that achieves a time complexity reduction by a constant factor, enabling more efficient scaling with sequence length; (2) dynamic temperature modulation adapting attention distributions to the multi-scenario and multi-behavior patterns. Complemented by acceleration techniques, Climber achieves a 5.15$\times$ throughput gain without performance degradation by adopting a "single user, multiple item" batched processing and memory-efficient Key-Value caching. Comprehensive offline experiments on multiple datasets validate that Climber exhibits a more ideal scaling curve. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly documented framework where controlled model scaling drives continuous online metric growth (12.19\% overall lift) without prohibitive resource costs. Climber has been successfully deployed on Netease Cloud Music, one of China's largest music streaming platforms, serving tens of millions of users daily.

### AdaptCache: KV Cache Native Storage Hierarchy for Low-Delay and   High-Quality Language Model Serving
**Authors**: Shaoting Feng, Hanchen Li, Kuntai Du, Zhuohan Gu, Yuhan Liu, Jiayi Yao, Siddhant Ray, Samuel Shen, Yihua Cheng, Ganesh Ananthanarayanan, Junchen Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-08-28T00:46:51Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) applications often reuse previously processed context, such as chat history and documents, which introduces significant redundant computation. Existing LLM serving systems address such redundant computation by storing the KV caches of processed context and loading the corresponding KV cache when a new request reuses the context. Further, as these LLM applications scale, the total size of KV caches becomes excessively large and requires both DRAM and SSD for full storage.   However, prior work that stores KV caches in DRAM and SSD suffers from high loading delays, as most KV cache hits come from SSD, which is slow to load. To increase the KV cache hit rate on DRAM, we identify lossy KV cache compression as a promising approach. We design a lossy compression system that decides the compression algorithm, compression rate and device placement for each KV cache entry to maximise DRAM hits and minimise loading delay without significantly degrading generation quality. Compared to various static compression baselines across three tasks, our system AdaptCache achieves 1.43--2.4 x delay savings at the same quality and 6--55% quality improvements at the same delay.

 ### How Theory-Informed Priors Affect DESI Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy
**Authors**: Michael W. Toomey, Gabriele Montefalcone, Evan McDonough, Katherine Freese

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:59:31Z

**Summary**: Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have been interpreted to suggest that dark energy may be evolving. In this work, we examine how prior choices affect such conclusions. Specifically, we study the biases introduced by the customary use of uniform priors on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameters, $w_0$ and $w_a$, when assessing evidence for evolving dark energy. To do so, we construct theory-informed priors on $(w_0, w_a)$ using a normalizing flow (NF), trained on two representative quintessence models, which learns the distribution of these parameters conditional on the underlying $\Lambda$CDM parameters. In the combined $\textit{Planck}$ CMB + DESI BAO analysis we find that the apparent tension with a cosmological constant in the CPL framework can be reduced from $\sim 3.1\sigma$ to $\sim 1.3\sigma$ once theory-informed priors are applied, rendering the result effectively consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. For completeness, we also analyze combinations that include Type Ia supernova data, showing similar shifts toward the $\Lambda$CDM limit. Taken together, the observed sensitivity to prior choices in these analyses arises because uniform priors - often mischaracterized as "uninformative" - can actually bias inferences toward unphysical parameter regions. Consequently, our results underscore the importance of adopting physically motivated priors to ensure robust cosmological inferences, especially when evaluating new hypotheses with only marginal statistical support. Lastly, our NF-based framework achieves these results by post-processing existing MCMC chains, requiring $\approx 1$ hour of additional CPU compute time on top of the base analysis - a dramatic speedup over direct model sampling that highlights the scalability of this approach for testing diverse theoretical models.

### 3D Aware Region Prompted Vision Language Model
**Authors**: An-Chieh Cheng, Yang Fu, Yukang Chen, Zhijian Liu, Xiaolong Li, Subhashree Radhakrishnan, Song Han, Yao Lu, Jan Kautz, Pavlo Molchanov, Hongxu Yin, Xiaolong Wang, Sifei Liu

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:59:06Z

**Summary**: We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings, which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth 3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric measurements.

### Do Natural Language Descriptions of Model Activations Convey Privileged   Information?
**Authors**: Millicent Li, Alberto Mario Ceballos Arroyo, Giordano Rogers, Naomi Saphra, Byron C. Wallace

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:59:04Z

**Summary**: Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model, or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that they succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals, suggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated them, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful insights into the operations of LLMs.

**Authors**: Xixi Wu, Kuan Li, Yida Zhao, Liwen Zhang, Litu Ou, Huifeng Yin, Zhongwang Zhang, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Minhao Cheng, Shuai Wang, Hong Cheng, Jingren Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:57:22Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation, we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of 4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web agents.

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:57:19Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving. However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named AgentFounder. We evaluate our AgentFounder-30B on 10 benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art performance while retains strong tool-use ability, notably 39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.

### High-Dimensional Bayesian Model Comparison in Cosmology with   GPU-accelerated Nested Sampling and Neural Emulators
**Authors**: Toby Lovick, David Yallup, Davide Piras, Alessio Spurio Mancini, Will Handley

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:57:05Z

**Summary**: We demonstrate a GPU-accelerated nested sampling framework for efficient high-dimensional Bayesian inference in cosmology. Using JAX-based neural emulators and likelihoods for cosmic microwave background and cosmic shear analyses, our approach provides parameter constraints and direct calculation of Bayesian evidence. In the 39 dimensional $\Lambda$CDM vs $w_0w_a$ shear analysis, we produce Bayes Factors and a robust error bar in just 2 days on a single A100 GPU, without loss of accuracy. Where CPU-based nested sampling can now be outpaced by methods relying on MCMC sampling and decoupled evidence estimation, we demonstrate that with GPU acceleration nested sampling offers the necessary speed-up to put it on equal computational footing with these methods, especially where reliable model comparison is paramount. We put forward both nested and gradient-based sampling as useful tools for the modern cosmologist, where cutting-edge inference pipelines can yield orders of magnitude improvements in computation time.

### WebSailor-V2: Bridging the Chasm to Proprietary Agents via Synthetic   Data and Scalable Reinforcement Learning

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:57:03Z

**Summary**: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability. Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks, matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

### JoPA:Explaining Large Language Model's Generation via Joint Prompt   Attribution
**Authors**: Yurui Chang, Bochuan Cao, Yujia Wang, Jinghui Chen, Lu Lin

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:48:53Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in complex text generation tasks. However, the contribution of the input prompt to the generated content still remains obscure to humans, underscoring the necessity of understanding the causality between input and output pairs. Existing works for providing prompt-specific explanation often confine model output to be classification or next-word prediction. Few initial attempts aiming to explain the entire language generation often treat input prompt texts independently, ignoring their combinatorial effects on the follow-up generation. In this study, we introduce a counterfactual explanation framework based on Joint Prompt Attribution, JoPA, which aims to explain how a few prompt texts collaboratively influences the LLM's complete generation. Particularly, we formulate the task of prompt attribution for generation interpretation as a combinatorial optimization problem, and introduce a probabilistic algorithm to search for the casual input combination in the discrete space. We define and utilize multiple metrics to evaluate the produced explanations, demonstrating both the faithfulness and efficiency of our framework.

### Inferring Soil Drydown Behaviour with Adaptive Bayesian Online   Changepoint Analysis
**Authors**: Mengyi Gong, Christopher Nemeth, Rebecca Killick, Peter Strauss, John Quinton

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:44:58Z

**Summary**: Continuous soil-moisture measurements provide a direct lens on subsurface hydrological processes, notably the post-rainfall "drydown" phase. Because these records consist of distinct, segment-specific behaviours whose forms and scales vary over time, realistic inference demands a model that captures piecewise dynamics while accommodating parameters that are unknown a priori. Building on Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD), we introduce two complementary extensions: a particle-filter variant that substitutes exact marginalisation with sequential Monte Carlo to enable real-time inference when critical parameters cannot be integrated out analytically, and an online-gradient variant that embeds stochastic gradient updates within BOCPD to learn application-relevant parameters on the fly without prohibitive computational cost. After validating both algorithms on synthetic data that replicate the temporal structure of field observations-detailing hyperparameter choices, priors, and cost-saving strategies-we apply them to soil-moisture series from experimental sites in Austria and the United States, quantifying site-specific drydown rates and demonstrating the advantages of our adaptive framework over static models.

### RepIt: Representing Isolated Targets to Steer Language Models
**Authors**: Vincent Siu, Nathan W. Henry, Nicholas Crispino, Yang Liu, Dawn Song, Chenguang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:35:36Z

**Summary**: While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control of model behavior.

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:29:32Z

**Summary**: We detail experimental results inferring ionization and temperature for warm dense copper plasmas at several times solid density (15 to 25 g/cm$^3$) and temperatures of 10 to 21 eV. Experiments performed at the OMEGA Laser Facility generate uniform warm dense matter conditions via symmetric shock compression of a buried copper layer. The plasma is probed with a laser-generated x-ray source to collect the K-shell x-ray absorption spectrum. Fitting bound-bound absorption contributions from constituent charge states of copper provides an estimated $\overline{Z}$ of approximately 4 to 7 for these warm dense copper plasmas. We find that these partially ionized plasmas have K-edge shifts of 12 to 30 eV and bound-bound resonance 1s$\rightarrow$3p absorption shifts of 4 to 26 eV with respect to the cold K-edge. This study provides necessary experimental data to improve ionization and opacity models in the warm dense matter regime.

### LLMs for energy and macronutrients estimation using only text data from   24-hour dietary recalls: a parameter-efficient fine-tuning experiment using a   10-shot prompt
**Authors**: Rodrigo M Carrillo-Larco

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:26:17Z

**Summary**: BACKGROUND: Most artificial intelligence tools used to estimate nutritional content rely on image input. However, whether large language models (LLMs) can accurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of foods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable simpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used 24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM was prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and five macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their quantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate whether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the ground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber and total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male, mean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean absolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across endpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better, with energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC exceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a chain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed solely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values from 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden, text-based dietary monitoring tools.

### Learning Discrete Bayesian Networks with Hierarchical Dirichlet   Shrinkage
**Authors**: Alexander Dombowsky, David B. Dunson

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:24:35Z

**Summary**: Discrete Bayesian networks (DBNs) provide a broadly useful framework for modeling dependence structures in multivariate categorical data. There is a vast literature on methods for inferring conditional probabilities and graphical structure in DBNs, but data sparsity and parametric assumptions are major practical issues. In this article, we detail a comprehensive Bayesian framework for learning DBNs. First, we propose a hierarchical prior for the conditional probabilities that enables complicated interactions between parent variables and stability in sparse regimes. We give a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm utilizing parallel Langevin proposals to generate exact posterior samples, avoiding the pitfalls of variational approximations. Moreover, we verify that the full conditional distribution of the concentration parameters is log-concave under mild conditions, facilitating efficient sampling. We then propose two methods for learning network structures, including parent sets, Markov blankets, and DAGs, from categorical data. The first cycles through individual edges each MCMC iteration, whereas the second updates the entire structure as a single step. We evaluate the accuracy, power, and MCMC performance of our methods on several simulation studies. Finally, we apply our methodology to uncover prognostic network structure from primary breast cancer samples.

### Beyond Private or Public: Large Language Models as Quasi-Public Goods in   the AI Economy
**Authors**: Yukun Zhang, TianYang Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:22:00Z

**Summary**: This paper conceptualizes Large Language Models (LLMs) as a form of mixed public goods within digital infrastructure, analyzing their economic properties through a comprehensive theoretical framework. We develop mathematical models to quantify the non-rivalry characteristics, partial excludability, and positive externalities of LLMs. Through comparative analysis of open-source and closed-source development paths, we identify systematic differences in resource allocation efficiency, innovation trajectories, and access equity. Our empirical research evaluates the spillover effects and network externalities of LLMs across different domains, including knowledge diffusion, innovation acceleration, and industry transformation. Based on these findings, we propose policy recommendations for balancing innovation incentives with equitable access, including public-private partnership mechanisms, computational resource democratization, and governance structures that optimize social welfare. This interdisciplinary approach contributes to understanding the economic nature of foundation AI models and provides policy guidance for their development as critical digital infrastructure

### ResidualViT for Efficient Temporally Dense Video Encoding
**Authors**: Mattia Soldan, Fabian Caba Heilbron, Bernard Ghanem, Josef Sivic, Bryan Russell

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:12:23Z

**Summary**: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation, require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT) architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model. Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost (up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

### Large Language Model-assisted Meta-optimizer for Automated Design of   Constrained Evolutionary Algorithm
**Authors**: Xu Yang, Rui Wang, Kaiwen Li, Wenhua Li, Weixiong Huang

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:02:24Z

**Summary**: Meta-black-box optimization has been significantly advanced through the use of large language models (LLMs), yet in fancy on constrained evolutionary optimization. In this work, AwesomeDE is proposed that leverages LLMs as the strategy of meta-optimizer to generate update rules for constrained evolutionary algorithm without human intervention. On the meanwhile, $RTO^2H$ framework is introduced for standardize prompt design of LLMs. The meta-optimizer is trained on a diverse set of constrained optimization problems. Key components, including prompt design and iterative refinement, are systematically analyzed to determine their impact on design quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency and solution accuracy. Furthermore, AwesomeDE is shown to generalize well across distinct problem domains, suggesting its potential for broad applicability. This research contributes to the field by providing a scalable and data-driven methodology for automated constrained algorithm design, while also highlighting limitations and directions for future work.

### Evaluating LLM Alignment on Personality Inference from Real-World   Interview Data
**Authors**: Jianfeng Zhu, Julina Maharjan, Xinyu Li, Karin G. Coifman, Ruoming Jin

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T16:54:35Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring nuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents, counselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings underscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and motivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and alignment-oriented fine-tuning.

### SuPreME: A Supervised Pre-training Framework for Multimodal ECG   Representation Learning
**Authors**: Mingsheng Cai, Jiuming Jiang, Wenhao Huang, Che Liu, Rossella Arcucci

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T16:49:11Z

**Summary**: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is critical for diagnosing and monitoring cardiac health, but obtaining large-scale annotated ECG datasets is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent ECG Self-Supervised Learning (eSSL) methods mitigate this by learning features without extensive labels but fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and require extensive task-specific fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SuPreME}$, a $\textbf{Su}$pervised $\textbf{Pre}$-training framework for $\textbf{M}$ultimodal $\textbf{E}$CG representation learning. SuPreME is pre-trained using structured diagnostic labels derived from ECG report entities through a one-time offline extraction with Large Language Models (LLMs), which help denoise, standardize cardiac concepts, and improve clinical representation learning. By fusing ECG signals with textual cardiac queries instead of fixed labels, SuPreME enables zero-shot classification of unseen conditions without further fine-tuning. We evaluate SuPreME on six downstream datasets covering 106 cardiac conditions, achieving superior zero-shot AUC performance of $77.20\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art eSSLs by $4.98\%$.

### Is the Top Still Spinning? Evaluating Subjectivity in Narrative   Understanding
**Authors**: Melanie Subbiah, Akankshya Mishra, Grace Kim, Liyan Tang, Greg Durrett, Kathleen McKeown

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T16:47:26Z

**Summary**: Determining faithfulness of a claim to a source document is an important problem across many domains. This task is generally treated as a binary judgment of whether the claim is supported or unsupported in relation to the source. In many cases, though, whether a claim is supported can be ambiguous. For instance, it may depend on making inferences from given evidence, and different people can reasonably interpret the claim as either supported or unsupported based on their agreement with those inferences. Forcing binary labels upon such claims lowers the reliability of evaluation. In this work, we reframe the task to manage the subjectivity involved with factuality judgments of ambiguous claims. We introduce LLM-generated edits of summaries as a method of providing a nuanced evaluation of claims: how much does a summary need to be edited to be unambiguous? Whether a claim gets rewritten and how much it changes can be used as an automatic evaluation metric, the Ambiguity Rewrite Metric (ARM), with a much richer feedback signal than a binary judgment of faithfulness. We focus on the area of narrative summarization as it is particularly rife with ambiguity and subjective interpretation. We show that ARM produces a 21% absolute improvement in annotator agreement on claim faithfulness, indicating that subjectivity is reduced.

### Metacognitive Reuse: Turning Recurring LLM Reasoning Into Concise   Behaviors
**Authors**: Aniket Didolkar, Nicolas Ballas, Sanjeev Arora, Anirudh Goyal

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T16:44:26Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting extended chains of thought. During the process, they often re-derive the same intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise, reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook" which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to conclude.

### Simulating Clinical AI Assistance using Multimodal LLMs: A Case Study in   Diabetic Retinopathy
**Authors**: Nadim Barakat, William Lotter

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T16:42:19Z

**Summary**: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open, lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician trust in clinical workflows.

### Single-stream Policy Optimization
**Authors**: Zhongwen Xu, Zihan Ding

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T16:39:11Z

**Summary**: We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample. Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary. Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25, +4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.

### Scaling Up Throughput-oriented LLM Inference Applications on   Heterogeneous Opportunistic GPU Clusters with Pervasive Context Management
**Authors**: Thanh Son Phung, Douglas Thain

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T16:06:33Z

**Summary**: The widespread growth in LLM developments increasingly demands more computational power from clusters than what they can supply. Traditional LLM applications inherently require huge static resource allocations, which force users to either wait in a long job queue and accept progress delay, or buy expensive hardware to fulfill their needs and exacerbate the demand-supply problem. However, not all LLM applications are latency-sensitive and can instead be executed in a throughput-oriented way. This throughput orientation allows a dynamic allocation that opportunistically pools available resources over time, avoiding both the long queue and expensive GPU purchases. Effectively utilizing opportunistic resources brings numerous challenges nevertheless. Our solution, pervasive context management, exploits the common computational context in LLM applications and provides mechanisms and policies that allow seamless context reuse on opportunistic resources. Our evaluation shows an LLM application with pervasive context management on opportunistic resources reduces its execution time by 98.1%.

### The Few-shot Dilemma: Over-prompting Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yongjian Tang, Doruk Tuncel, Christian Koerner, Thomas Runkler

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T16:00:06Z

**Summary**: Over-prompting, a phenomenon where excessive examples in prompts lead to diminished performance in Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges the conventional wisdom about in-context few-shot learning. To investigate this few-shot dilemma, we outline a prompting framework that leverages three standard few-shot selection methods - random sampling, semantic embedding, and TF-IDF vectors - and evaluate these methods across multiple LLMs, including GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, DeepSeek-V3, Gemma-3, LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.2, and Mistral. Our experimental results reveal that incorporating excessive domain-specific examples into prompts can paradoxically degrade performance in certain LLMs, which contradicts the prior empirical conclusion that more relevant few-shot examples universally benefit LLMs. Given the trend of LLM-assisted software engineering and requirement analysis, we experiment with two real-world software requirement classification datasets. By gradually increasing the number of TF-IDF-selected and stratified few-shot examples, we identify their optimal quantity for each LLM. This combined approach achieves superior performance with fewer examples, avoiding the over-prompting problem, thus surpassing the state-of-the-art by 1% in classifying functional and non-functional requirements.

**Authors**: Andrew Bell, Yan Kit Choi, Steffen E Petersen, Andrew King, Muhummad Sohaib Nazir, Alistair A Young

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:59:27Z

**Summary**: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring inference-time optimisation. Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$ faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in large CMR datasets.

### SURGIN: SURrogate-guided Generative INversion for subsurface multiphase   flow with quantified uncertainty
**Authors**: Zhao Feng, Bicheng Yan, Luanxiao Zhao, Xianda Shen, Renyu Zhao, Wenhao Wang, Fengshou Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:42:22Z

**Summary**: We present a direct inverse modeling method named SURGIN, a SURrogate-guided Generative INversion framework tailed for subsurface multiphase flow data assimilation. Unlike existing inversion methods that require adaptation for each new observational configuration, SURGIN features a zero-shot conditional generation capability, enabling real-time assimilation of unseen monitoring data without task-specific retraining. Specifically, SURGIN synergistically integrates a U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (U-FNO) surrogate with a score-based generative model (SGM), framing the conditional generation as a surrogate prediction-guidance process in a Bayesian perspective. Instead of directly learning the conditional generation of geological parameters, an unconditional SGM is first pretrained in a self-supervised manner to capture the geological prior, after which posterior sampling is performed by leveraging a differentiable U-FNO surrogate to enable efficient forward evaluations conditioned on unseen observations. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate SURGIN's capability to decently infer heterogeneous geological fields and predict spatiotemporal flow dynamics with quantified uncertainty across diverse measurement settings. By unifying generative learning with surrogate-guided Bayesian inference, SURGIN establishes a new paradigm for inverse modeling and uncertainty quantification in parametric functional spaces.

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:33:16Z

**Summary**: Real-world vision language reasoning scenarios often include diverse and complex tasks. However, vision language reinforcement learning has primarily focused on a narrow set of tasks (e.g. geometry or chart reasoning), limiting the improvement of Vision Language Models' (VLMs) general reasoning. Therefore, we propose a novel Code2Logic approach, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize verifiable game reasoning tasks at scale via adapting game code. Using the Code2Logic, we developed the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is verifiable and scalable, offers controllable difficulty gradation and is diverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Then we apply Game-RL, which is simple reinforcement learning on GameQA. Surprisingly, despite training solely on game tasks, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization, specifically Qwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33% across 7 diverse vision-language benchmarks. Our code, dataset and models are available at the GitHub repository.

### Efficient Cold-Start Recommendation via BPE Token-Level Embedding   Initialization with LLM
**Authors**: Yushang Zhao, Xinyue Han, Qian Leng, Qianyi Sun, Haotian Lyu, Chengrui Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:32:51Z

**Summary**: The cold-start issue is the challenge when we talk about recommender systems, especially in the case when we do not have the past interaction data of new users or new items. Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as conventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment with shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation strategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by applying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained token-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to using coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can be used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate recommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our mechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over benchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings show that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit Rate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same capability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more interpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting. The practical application of token-level semantic initialization as a lightweight, but nevertheless effective extension to modern recommender systems in the zero-shot setting is indicated within this work.

### Semiparametric Causal Inference for Right-Censored Outcomes with Many   Weak Invalid Instruments
**Authors**: Qiushi Bu, Wen Su, Xingqiu Zhao, Zhonghua Liu

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:29:45Z

**Summary**: We propose a semiparametric framework for causal inference with right-censored survival outcomes and many weak invalid instruments, motivated by Mendelian randomization in biobank studies where classical methods may fail. We adopt an accelerated failure time model and construct a moment condition based on augmented inverse probability of censoring weighting, incorporating both uncensored and censored observations. Under a heteroscedasticity-based condition on the treatment model, we establish point identification of the causal effect despite censoring and invalid instruments. We propose GEL-NOW (Generalized Empirical Likelihood with Non-Orthogonal and Weak moments) for valid inference under these conditions. A divergent number of Neyman orthogonal nuisance functions is estimated using deep neural networks. A key challenge is that the conditional censoring distribution is a non-Neyman orthogonal nuisance, contributing to the first-order asymptotics of the estimator for the target causal effect parameter. We derive the asymptotic distribution and explicitly incorporate this additional uncertainty into the asymptotic variance formula. We also introduce a censoring-adjusted over-identification test that accounts for this variance component. Simulation studies and UK Biobank applications demonstrate the method's robustness and practical utility.

### Any-Step Density Ratio Estimation via Interval-Annealed Secant Alignment
**Authors**: Wei Chen, Shigui Li, Jiacheng Li, Jian Xu, Zhiqi Lin, Junmei Yang, Delu Zeng, John Paisley, Qibin Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:29:33Z

**Summary**: Estimating density ratios is a fundamental problem in machine learning, but existing methods often trade off accuracy for efficiency. We propose \textit{Interval-annealed Secant Alignment Density Ratio Estimation (ISA-DRE)}, a framework that enables accurate, any-step estimation without numerical integration.   Instead of modeling infinitesimal tangents as in prior methods, ISA-DRE learns a global secant function, defined as the expectation of all tangents over an interval, with provably lower variance, making it more suitable for neural approximation. This is made possible by the \emph{Secant Alignment Identity}, a self-consistency condition that formally connects the secant with its underlying tangent representations.   To mitigate instability during early training, we introduce \emph{Contraction Interval Annealing}, a curriculum strategy that gradually expands the alignment interval during training. This process induces a contraction mapping, which improves convergence and training stability.   Empirically, ISA-DRE achieves competitive accuracy with significantly fewer function evaluations compared to prior methods, resulting in much faster inference and making it well suited for real-time and interactive applications.

### Causal Feedback Discovery using Convergence Cross Mapping on Sea Ice   Data
**Authors**: Francis Nji, Seraj Al Mahmud Mostafa, Jianwu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:28:23Z

**Summary**: Identifying causal relationships in climate systems remains challenging due to nonlinear, coupled dynamics that limit the effectiveness of linear and stochastic causal discovery approaches. This study benchmarks Convergence Cross Mapping (CCM) against Granger causality, PCMCI, and VarLiNGAM using both synthetic datasets with ground truth causal links and 41 years of Arctic climate data (1979--2021). Unlike stochastic models that rely on autoregressive residual dependence, CCM leverages Takens' state-space reconstruction and delay-embedding to reconstruct attractor manifolds from time series. Cross mapping between reconstructed manifolds exploits deterministic signatures of causation, enabling the detection of weak and bidirectional causal links that linear models fail to resolve. Results demonstrate that CCM achieves higher specificity and fewer false positives on synthetic benchmarks, while maintaining robustness under observational noise and limited sample lengths. On Arctic data, CCM reveals significant causal interactions between sea ice extent and atmospheric variables like specific humidity, longwave radiation, and surface temperature with a $p$-value of $0.009$, supporting ice-albedo feedbacks and moisture-radiation couplings central to Arctic amplification. In contrast, stochastic approaches miss these nonlinear dependencies or infer spurious causal relations. This work establishes CCM as a robust causal inference tool for nonlinear climate dynamics and provides the first systematic benchmarking framework for method selection in climate research.

### More performant and scalable: Rethinking contrastive vision-language   pre-training of radiology in the LLM era
**Authors**: Yingtai Li, Haoran Lai, Xiaoqian Zhou, Shuai Ming, Wenxin Ma, Wei Wei, Shaohua Kevin Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:27:14Z

**Summary**: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments) without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale "silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard" dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to facilitate {\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems.

### Robust Sensitivity Analysis via Augmented Percentile Bootstrap under   Simultaneous Violations of Unconfoundedness and Overlap
**Authors**: Han Cui, Xinran Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:20:54Z

**Summary**: The identification of causal effects in observational studies typically relies on two standard assumptions: unconfoundedness and overlap. However, both assumptions are often questionable in practice: unconfoundedness is inherently untestable, and overlap may fail in the presence of extreme unmeasured confounding. While various approaches have been developed to address unmeasured confounding and extreme propensity scores separately, few methods accommodate simultaneous violations of both assumptions. In this paper, we propose a sensitivity analysis framework that relaxes both unconfoundedness and overlap, building upon the marginal sensitivity model. Specifically, we allow the bound on unmeasured confounding to hold for only a subset of the population, thereby accommodating heterogeneity in confounding and allowing treatment probabilities to be zero or one. Moreover, unlike prior work, our approach does not require bounded outcomes and focuses on overlap-weighted average treatment effects, which are both practically meaningful and robust to non-overlap. We develop computationally efficient methods to obtain worst-case bounds via linear programming, and introduce a novel augmented percentile bootstrap procedure for statistical inference. This bootstrap method handles parameters defined through over-identified estimating equations involving unobserved variables and may be of independent interest. Our work provides a unified and flexible framework for sensitivity analysis under violations of both unconfoundedness and overlap.

### TrojanRobot: Physical-world Backdoor Attacks Against VLM-based Robotic   Manipulation
**Authors**: Xianlong Wang, Hewen Pan, Hangtao Zhang, Minghui Li, Shengshan Hu, Ziqi Zhou, Lulu Xue, Aishan Liu, Yunpeng Jiang, Leo Yu Zhang, Xiaohua Jia

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:19:32Z

**Summary**: Robotic manipulation in the physical world is increasingly empowered by \textit{large language models} (LLMs) and \textit{vision-language models} (VLMs), leveraging their understanding and perception capabilities. Recently, various attacks against such robotic policies have been proposed, with backdoor attacks drawing considerable attention for their high stealth and strong persistence capabilities. However, existing backdoor efforts are limited to simulators and suffer from physical-world realization. To address this, we propose \textit{TrojanRobot}, a highly stealthy and broadly effective robotic backdoor attack in the physical world. Specifically, we introduce a module-poisoning approach by embedding a backdoor module into the modular robotic policy, enabling backdoor control over the policy's visual perception module thereby backdooring the entire robotic policy. Our vanilla implementation leverages a backdoor-finetuned VLM to serve as the backdoor module. To enhance its generalization in physical environments, we propose a prime implementation, leveraging the LVLM-as-a-backdoor paradigm and developing three types of prime attacks, \ie, \textit{permutation}, \textit{stagnation}, and \textit{intentional} attacks, thus achieving finer-grained backdoors. Extensive experiments on the UR3e manipulator with 18 task instructions using robotic policies based on four VLMs demonstrate the broad effectiveness and physical-world stealth of TrojanRobot. Our attack's video demonstrations are available via a github link https://trojanrobot.github.io.

### On the Correlation between Individual Fairness and Predictive Accuracy   in Probabilistic Models
**Authors**: Alessandro Antonucci, Eric Rossetto, Ivan Duvnjak

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:17:13Z

**Summary**: We investigate individual fairness in generative probabilistic classifiers by analysing the robustness of posterior inferences to perturbations in private features. Building on established results in robustness analysis, we hypothesise a correlation between robustness and predictive accuracy, specifically, instances exhibiting greater robustness are more likely to be classified accurately. We empirically assess this hypothesis using a benchmark of fourteen datasets with fairness concerns, employing Bayesian networks as the underlying generative models. To address the computational complexity associated with robustness analysis over multiple private features with Bayesian networks, we reformulate the problem as a most probable explanation task in an auxiliary Markov random field. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis about the correlation, suggesting novel directions to mitigate the traditional trade-off between fairness and accuracy.

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:13:13Z

**Summary**: Search has emerged as core infrastructure for LLM-based agents and is widely viewed as critical on the path toward more general intelligence. Finance is a particularly demanding proving ground: analysts routinely conduct complex, multi-step searches over time-sensitive, domain-specific data, making it ideal for assessing both search proficiency and knowledge-grounded reasoning. Yet no existing open financial datasets evaluate data searching capability of end-to-end agents, largely because constructing realistic, complicated tasks requires deep financial expertise and time-sensitive data is hard to evaluate. We present FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source agent benchmark for realistic, open-domain financial search and reasoning. FinSearchComp comprises three tasks -- Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and Complex Historical Investigation -- closely reproduce real-world financial analyst workflows. To ensure difficulty and reliability, we engage 70 professional financial experts for annotation and implement a rigorous multi-stage quality-assurance pipeline. The benchmark includes 635 questions spanning global and Greater China markets, and we evaluate 21 models (products) on it. Grok 4 (web) tops the global subset, approaching expert-level accuracy. DouBao (web) leads on the Greater China subset. Experimental analyses show that equipping agents with web search and financial plugins substantially improves results on FinSearchComp, and the country origin of models and tools impact performance significantly.By aligning with realistic analyst tasks and providing end-to-end evaluation, FinSearchComp offers a professional, high-difficulty testbed for complex financial search and reasoning.

### References Matter: Investigating the Impact of Reference Set Variation   on Summarization Evaluation
**Authors**: Silvia Casola, Yang Janet Liu, Siyao Peng, Oliver Kraus, Albert Gatt, Barbara Plank

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:11:20Z

**Summary**: Human language production exhibits remarkable richness and variation, reflecting diverse communication styles and intents. However, this variation is often overlooked in summarization evaluation. While having multiple reference summaries is known to improve correlation with human judgments, the impact of the reference set on reference-based metrics has not been systematically investigated. This work examines the sensitivity of widely used reference-based metrics in relation to the choice of reference sets, analyzing three diverse multi-reference summarization datasets: SummEval, GUMSum, and DUC2004. We demonstrate that many popular metrics exhibit significant instability. This instability is particularly concerning for n-gram-based metrics like ROUGE, where model rankings vary depending on the reference sets, undermining the reliability of model comparisons. We also collect human judgments on LLM outputs for genre-diverse data and examine their correlation with metrics to supplement existing findings beyond newswire summaries, finding weak-to-no correlation. Taken together, we recommend incorporating reference set variation into summarization evaluation to enhance consistency alongside correlation with human judgments, especially when evaluating LLMs.

### LLM Hallucination Detection: A Fast Fourier Transform Method Based on   Hidden Layer Temporal Signals
**Authors**: Jinxin Li, Gang Tu, ShengYu Cheng, Junjie Hu, Jinting Wang, Rui Chen, Zhilong Zhou, Dongbo Shan

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:08:19Z

**Summary**: Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models (LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis, that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over 10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.

### MSDNet: Efficient 4D Radar Super-Resolution via Multi-Stage Distillation
**Authors**: Minqing Huang, Shouyi Lu, Boyuan Zheng, Ziyao Li, Xiao Tang, Guirong Zhuo

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:05:11Z

**Summary**: 4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling, resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

**Authors**: Lingli Cao, Shanshan Li, Ying Fan, Danyang Li, Chenxing Zhong

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:01:23Z

**Summary**: Background: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has given rise to AI-native applications, a new paradigm in software engineering that fundamentally redefines how software is designed, developed, and evolved. Despite their growing prominence, AI-native applications still lack a unified engineering definition and architectural blueprint, leaving practitioners without systematic guidance for system design, quality assurance, and technology selection.   Objective: This study seeks to establish a comprehensive understanding of AI-native applications by identifying their defining characteristics, key quality attributes, and typical technology stacks, as well as by clarifying the opportunities and challenges they present.   Method: We conducted a grey literature review, integrating conceptual perspectives retrieved from targeted Google and Bing searches with practical insights derived from leading open-source projects on GitHub. A structured protocol encompassing source selection, quality assessment, and thematic analysis was applied to synthesize findings across heterogeneous sources.   Results: We finally identified 106 studies based on the selection criteria. The analysis reveals that AI-native applications are distinguished by two core pillars: the central role of AI as the system's intelligence paradigm and their inherently probabilistic, non-deterministic nature. Critical quality attributes include reliability, usability, performance efficiency, and AI-specific observability. In addition, a typical technology stack has begun to emerge, comprising LLM orchestration frameworks, vector databases, and AI-native observability platforms. These systems emphasize response quality, cost-effectiveness, and outcome predictability, setting them apart from conventional software systems.   Conclusion: This study is the first to propose a dual-layered engineering blueprint...

### Discovering Mathematical Equations with Diffusion Language Model
**Authors**: Xiaoxu Han, Chengzhen Ning, Jinghui Zhong, Fubiao Yang, Yu Wang, Xin Mu

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T14:53:44Z

**Summary**: Discovering valid and meaningful mathematical equations from observed data plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. While this task, symbolic regression, remains challenging due to the vast search space and the trade-off between accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we introduce DiffuSR, a pre-training framework for symbolic regression built upon a continuous-state diffusion language model. DiffuSR employs a trainable embedding layer within the diffusion process to map discrete mathematical symbols into a continuous latent space, modeling equation distributions effectively. Through iterative denoising, DiffuSR converts an initial noisy sequence into a symbolic equation, guided by numerical data injected via a cross-attention mechanism. We also design an effective inference strategy to enhance the accuracy of the diffusion-based equation generator, which injects logit priors into genetic programming. Experimental results on standard symbolic regression benchmarks demonstrate that DiffuSR achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art autoregressive methods and generates more interpretable and diverse mathematical expressions.

### Reasoning with Preference Constraints: A Benchmark for Language Models   in Many-to-One Matching Markets
**Authors**: Marylou Fauchard, Florian Carichon, Margarida Carvalho, Golnoosh Farnadi

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T14:48:46Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However, applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem, a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs, like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought, In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial optimization problems with preferential constraints.

### The Belief State Transformer
**Authors**: Edward S. Hu, Kwangjun Ahn, Qinghua Liu, Haoran Xu, Manan Tomar, Ada Langford, Jayden Teoh, Bryon Xu, David Yan, Dinesh Jayaraman, Alex Lamb, John Langford

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T14:40:13Z

**Summary**: We introduce the "Belief State Transformer", a next-token predictor that takes both a prefix and suffix as inputs, with a novel objective of predicting both the next token for the prefix and the previous token for the suffix. The Belief State Transformer effectively learns to solve challenging problems that conventional forward-only transformers struggle with, in a domain-independent fashion. Key to this success is learning a compact belief state that captures all relevant information necessary for accurate predictions. Empirical ablations show that each component of the model is essential in difficult scenarios where standard Transformers fall short. For the task of story writing with known prefixes and suffixes, our approach outperforms the Fill-in-the-Middle method for reaching known goals and demonstrates improved performance even when the goals are unknown. Altogether, the Belief State Transformer enables more efficient goal-conditioned decoding, better test-time inference, and high-quality text representations on small scale problems.

### Empowering LLMs with Parameterized Skills for Adversarial Long-Horizon   Planning
**Authors**: Sijia Cui, Shuai Xu, Aiyao He, Yanna Wang, Bo Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T14:36:30Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to the development of LLM-based AI agents. A key challenge is the creation of agents that can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon environments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to interact with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions, and (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to stimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable actions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate high-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges, we introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning framework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon environments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill library containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill planner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized skills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a long-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and challenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting outperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully crafted few-shot examples, surpasses the top-tier scripted agent, CoacAI. Additionally, we design comprehensive evaluation metrics and test 6 closed-source and 2 open-source LLMs within the PLAP framework, ultimately releasing an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability. Our code is available at https://github.com/AI-Research-TeamX/PLAP.

### Can Code-Switched Texts Activate a Knowledge Switch in LLMs? A Case   Study on English-Korean Code-Switching
**Authors**: Seoyeon Kim, Huiseo Kim, Chanjun Park, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T14:24:05Z

**Summary**: Recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate multilingual abilities, yet they are English-centric due to dominance of English in training corpora. The limited resource for low-resource languages remains a crucial challenge. Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate between languages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuances that can be otherwise lost in translation and elicits language-specific knowledge in human communications. In light of this, we investigate whether code-switching can activate, or identify and leverage knowledge for reasoning when LLMs solve low-resource language tasks. To facilitate the research, we first present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset. We provide comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs by subdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledge leveraging. Our results demonstrate that compared to English text, CS can faithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs especially on language-specific domains, suggesting the potential of code-switching on low-resource language tasks.

### Accelerating Discovery: Rapid Literature Screening with LLMs
**Authors**: Santiago Matalonga, Domenico Amalfitano, Jean Carlo Rossa Hauck, Martín Solari, Guilherme H. Travassos

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T14:01:44Z

**Summary**: Background: Conducting Multi Vocal Literature Reviews (MVLRs) is often time and effort-intensive. Researchers must review and filter a large number of unstructured sources, which frequently contain sparse information and are unlikely to be included in the final study. Our experience conducting an MVLR on Context-Aware Software Systems (CASS) Testing in the avionics domain exemplified this challenge, with over 8,000 highly heterogeneous documents requiring review. Therefore, we developed a Large Language Model (LLM) assistant to support the search and filtering of documents. Aims: To develop and validate an LLM based tool that can support researchers in performing the search and filtering of documents for an MVLR without compromising the rigor of the research protocol. Method: We applied sound engineering practices to develop an on-premises LLM-based tool incorporating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to process candidate sources. Progress towards the aim was quantified using the Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) as the primary metric to ensure the performance of the LLM based tool. Convenience sampling, supported by human judgment and statistical sampling, were used to verify and validate the tool's quality-in-use. Results: The tool currently demonstrates a PPA agreement with human researchers of 90% for sources that are not relevant to the study. Development details are shared to support domain-specific adaptation of the tool. Conclusions: Using LLM-based tools to support academic researchers in rigorous MVLR is feasible. These tools can free valuable time for higher-level, abstract tasks. However, researcher participation remains essential to ensure that the tool supports thorough research.

### Counterfactual Simulatability of LLM Explanations for Generation Tasks
**Authors**: Marvin Limpijankit, Yanda Chen, Melanie Subbiah, Nicholas Deas, Kathleen McKeown

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:55:55Z

**Summary**: LLMs can be unpredictable, as even slight alterations to the prompt can cause the output to change in unexpected ways. Thus, the ability of models to accurately explain their behavior is critical, especially in high-stakes settings. One approach for evaluating explanations is counterfactual simulatability, how well an explanation allows users to infer the model's output on related counterfactuals. Counterfactual simulatability has been previously studied for yes/no question answering tasks. We provide a general framework for extending this method to generation tasks, using news summarization and medical suggestion as example use cases. We find that while LLM explanations do enable users to better predict LLM outputs on counterfactuals in the summarization setting, there is significant room for improvement for medical suggestion. Furthermore, our results suggest that the evaluation for counterfactual simulatability may be more appropriate for skill-based tasks as opposed to knowledge-based tasks.

### Shaping Explanations: Semantic Reward Modeling with Encoder-Only   Transformers for GRPO
**Authors**: Francesco Pappone, Ruggero Marino Lazzaroni, Federico Califano, Niccolò Gentile, Roberto Marras

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:39:29Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like text, aligning their outputs with complex, qualitative goals like pedagogical soundness remains a significant challenge. Standard reinforcement learning techniques often rely on slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or on brittle, keyword-based metrics like ROUGE, which fail to capture the semantic essence of a high-quality explanation. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to reward shaping within the Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) framework. Our central contribution is the use of a small, efficient encoder-only transformer as a semantic reward model. This model provides a dense, semantically rich reward signal based on the cosine similarity between a generated explanation and a ground-truth reference, guiding the policy towards explanations that are not just factually correct but also structurally and conceptually aligned with expert reasoning. We apply this method to the task of training a model for the Italian medical-school entrance examinations, following standard domain-adaptive continued pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our results demonstrate that GRPO with our proposed semantic reward significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over a strong SFT baseline, showcasing the power of using lightweight encoder models for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks

### TAPS: Tool-Augmented Personalisation via Structured Tagging
**Authors**: Ekaterina Taktasheva, Jeff Dalton

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:36:33Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in tool-augmented large language models have enabled them to interact with external tools, enhancing their ability to perform complex user tasks. However, existing approaches overlook the role of personalisation in guiding tool use. This work investigates how user preferences can be effectively integrated into goal-oriented dialogue agents. Through extensive analysis, we identify key weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to personalise tool use. To this end, we introduce TAPS, a novel solution that enhances personalised tool use by leveraging a structured tagging tool and an uncertainty-based tool detector. TAPS significantly improves the ability of LLMs to incorporate user preferences, achieving the new state-of-the-art for open source models on the NLSI task.

### Chernoff Information as a Privacy Constraint for Adversarial   Classification and Membership Advantage
**Authors**: Ayşe Ünsal, Melek Önen

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:35:35Z

**Summary**: This work inspects a privacy metric based on Chernoff information, namely Chernoff differential privacy, due to its significance in characterization of the optimal classifier's performance. Adversarial classification, as any other classification problem is built around minimization of the (average or correct detection) probability of error in deciding on either of the classes in the case of binary classification. Unlike the classical hypothesis testing problem, where the false alarm and mis-detection probabilities are handled separately resulting in an asymmetric behavior of the best error exponent, in this work, we characterize the relationship between $\varepsilon\textrm{-}$differential privacy, the best error exponent of one of the errors (when the other is fixed) and the best average error exponent. Accordingly, we re-derive Chernoff differential privacy in connection with $\varepsilon\textrm{-}$differential privacy using the Radon-Nikodym derivative, and prove its relation with Kullback-Leibler (KL) differential privacy. Subsequently, we present numerical evaluation results, which demonstrates that Chernoff information outperforms Kullback-Leibler divergence as a function of the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$ and the impact of the adversary's attack in Laplace mechanisms. Lastly, we introduce a new upper bound on adversary's membership advantage in membership inference attacks using Chernoff DP and numerically compare its performance with existing alternatives based on $(\varepsilon, \delta)\textrm{-}$differential privacy in the literature.

### Context-Aware Membership Inference Attacks against Pre-trained Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Hongyan Chang, Ali Shahin Shamsabadi, Kleomenis Katevas, Hamed Haddadi, Reza Shokri

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:30:05Z

**Summary**: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) aim at determining if a data point was part of the model's training set. Prior MIAs that are built for classification models fail at LLMs, due to ignoring the generative nature of LLMs across token sequences. In this paper, we present a novel attack on pre-trained LLMs that adapts MIA statistical tests to the perplexity dynamics of subsequences within a data point. Our method significantly outperforms prior approaches, revealing context-dependent memorization patterns in pre-trained LLMs.

### A Closed-Form Transition Density Expansion for Elliptic and   Hypo-Elliptic SDEs
**Authors**: Yuga Iguchi, Alexandros Beskos

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:25:21Z

**Summary**: We introduce a closed-form expansion for the transition density of elliptic and hypo-elliptic multivariate Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), over a period $\Delta\in (0,1)$, in terms of powers of $\Delta^{j/2}$, $j\ge 0$. Our methodology provides approximations of the transition density, easily evaluated via any software that performs symbolic calculations. A major part of the paper is devoted to an analytical control of the remainder in our expansion for fixed $\Delta\in(0,1)$. The obtained error bounds validate theoretically the methodology, by characterising the size of the distance from the true value. It is the first time that such a closed-form expansion becomes available for the important class of hypo-elliptic SDEs, to the best of our knowledge. For elliptic SDEs, closed-form expansions are available, with some works identifying the size of the error for fixed $\Delta$, as per our contribution. Our methodology allows for a uniform treatment of elliptic and hypo-elliptic SDEs, when earlier works are intrinsically restricted to an elliptic setting. We show numerical applications highlighting the effectiveness of our method, by carrying out parameter inference for hypo-elliptic SDEs that do not satisfy stated conditions. The latter are sufficient for controlling the remainder terms, but the closed-form expansion itself is applicable in general settings.

### HERO: Rethinking Visual Token Early Dropping in High-Resolution Large   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Xu Li, Yuxuan Liang, Xiaolei Chen, Yi Zheng, Haotian Chen, Bin Li, Xiangyang Xue

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:22:08Z

**Summary**: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities. However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient inference in HR-LVLMs.

### EIFBENCH: Extremely Complex Instruction Following Benchmark for Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Tao Zou, Xinghua Zhang, Haiyang Yu, Minzheng Wang, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:19:41Z

**Summary**: With the development and widespread application of large language models (LLMs), the new paradigm of "Model as Product" is rapidly evolving, and demands higher capabilities to address complex user needs, often requiring precise workflow execution which involves the accurate understanding of multiple tasks. However, existing benchmarks focusing on single-task environments with limited constraints lack the complexity required to fully reflect real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present the Extremely Complex Instruction Following Benchmark (EIFBENCH), meticulously crafted to facilitate a more realistic and robust evaluation of LLMs. EIFBENCH not only includes multi-task scenarios that enable comprehensive assessment across diverse task types concurrently, but also integrates a variety of constraints, replicating complex operational environments. Furthermore, we propose the Segment Policy Optimization (SegPO) algorithm to enhance the LLM's ability to accurately fulfill multi-task workflow. Evaluations on EIFBENCH have unveiled considerable performance discrepancies in existing LLMs when challenged with these extremely complex instructions. This finding underscores the necessity for ongoing optimization to navigate the intricate challenges posed by LLM applications.

### Automating Code Generation for Semiconductor Equipment Control from   Developer Utterances with LLMs
**Authors**: Youngkyoung Kim, Sanghyeok Park, Misoo Kim, Gangho Yoon, Eunseok Lee, Simon S. Woo

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:12:11Z

**Summary**: Semiconductors form the backbone of modern electronics, with their manufacturing and testing relying on highly specialized equipment and domain-specific programming languages. Equipment languages such as the Algorithmic Pattern Generator (ALPG) are critical for precise hardware control but are challenging to program due to their low-level syntax and steep learning curve. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level code from natural language, their effectiveness on low-level equipment languages remains limited. To address this, we propose Progressive Knowledge Enhancement (PKE), a novel multi-stage prompting framework that progressively extracts and activates the latent knowledge within LLMs, guiding them from simple to complex examples without extensive fine-tuning. Empirical evaluation on an industrial ALPG dataset shows that PKE significantly outperforms standard prompting and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generating correct ALPG code, achieving 11.1\% and 15.2\% higher exact match scores compared to the second-best technique. Further analysis of individual components confirms that progressive knowledge extraction based on difficulty enhances accuracy. Our study offer a practical approach to boosting LLM capabilities for specialized low-level programming, supporting greater productivity in semiconductor software development.

### CredID: Credible Multi-Bit Watermark for Large Language Models   Identification
**Authors**: Haoyu Jiang, Xuhong Wang, Ping Yi, Shanzhe Lei, Yilun Lin

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:11:17Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in complex natural language processing tasks but raise privacy and security concerns due to the lack of identity recognition. This paper proposes a multi-party credible watermarking framework (CredID) involving a trusted third party (TTP) and multiple LLM vendors to address these issues. In the watermark embedding stage, vendors request a seed from the TTP to generate watermarked text without sending the user's prompt. In the extraction stage, the TTP coordinates each vendor to extract and verify the watermark from the text. This provides a credible watermarking scheme while preserving vendor privacy. Furthermore, current watermarking algorithms struggle with text quality, information capacity, and robustness, making it challenging to meet the diverse identification needs of LLMs. Thus, we propose a novel multi-bit watermarking algorithm and an open-source toolkit to facilitate research. Experiments show our CredID enhances watermark credibility and efficiency without compromising text quality. Additionally, we successfully utilized this framework to achieve highly accurate identification among multiple LLM vendors.

### Break the Checkbox: Challenging Closed-Style Evaluations of Cultural   Alignment in LLMs
**Authors**: Mohsinul Kabir, Ajwad Abrar, Sophia Ananiadou

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:10:21Z

**Summary**: A large number of studies rely on closed-style multiple-choice surveys to evaluate cultural alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we challenge this constrained evaluation paradigm and explore more realistic, unconstrained approaches. Using the World Values Survey (WVS) and Hofstede Cultural Dimensions as case studies, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit stronger cultural alignment in less constrained settings, where responses are not forced. Additionally, we show that even minor changes, such as reordering survey choices, lead to inconsistent outputs, exposing the limitations of closed-style evaluations. Our findings advocate for more robust and flexible evaluation frameworks that focus on specific cultural proxies, encouraging more nuanced and accurate assessments of cultural alignment in LLMs.

### From Understanding to Generation: An Efficient Shortcut for Evaluating   Language Models
**Authors**: Viktor Hangya, Fabian Küch, Darina Gold

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:10:04Z

**Summary**: Iterative evaluation of LLMs during training is essential to ensure expected capability development, but can be time- and compute-intensive. While NLU tasks, where the model selects from fixed answer choices, are cheap to evaluate, essential capabilities like reasoning and code generation rely on the more time-consuming NLG (token-by-token generation) format. In this work, our aim is to decrease the computational burden of NLG benchmarks in order to enable monitoring crucial LLM capabilities during model training. We reformulate generative tasks into computationally cheaper NLU alternatives. We test the performance correlation between the original and reformulated tasks using 8 LMs of various sizes and 4 capabilities: mathematical reasoning, code generation, factual knowledge and reading comprehension. Our results show a strong correlation between task formats, supporting capability assessment via cheaper alternatives and achieving over 35x average reduction in evaluation time.

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many domains, yet their application to specialized fields remains constrained by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data. We present a novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference. Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves 75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models -- when fine tuned properly -- can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is infeasible. Beyond expanding research in the growing field of specialized small language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety, security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various industries.

### MIA-EPT: Membership Inference Attack via Error Prediction for Tabular   Data
**Authors**: Eyal German, Daniel Samira, Yuval Elovici, Asaf Shabtai

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:03:54Z

**Summary**: Synthetic data generation plays an important role in enabling data sharing, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. Recent advances in diffusion models have made it possible to generate realistic, high-quality tabular data, but they may also memorize training records and leak sensitive information. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) exploit this vulnerability by determining whether a record was used in training. While MIAs have been studied in images and text, their use against tabular diffusion models remains underexplored despite the unique risks of structured attributes and limited record diversity. In this paper, we introduce MIAEPT, Membership Inference Attack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data, a novel black-box attack specifically designed to target tabular diffusion models. MIA-EPT constructs errorbased feature vectors by masking and reconstructing attributes of target records, disclosing membership signals based on how well these attributes are predicted. MIA-EPT operates without access to the internal components of the generative model, relying only on its synthetic data output, and was shown to generalize across multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models. We validate MIA-EPT on three diffusion-based synthesizers, achieving AUC-ROC scores of up to 0.599 and TPR@10% FPR values of 22.0% in our internal tests. Under the MIDST 2025 competition conditions, MIA-EPT achieved second place in the Black-box Multi-Table track (TPR@10% FPR = 20.0%). These results demonstrate that our method can uncover substantial membership leakage in synthetic tabular data, challenging the assumption that synthetic data is inherently privacy-preserving. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/eyalgerman/MIA-EPT.

### Reading Between the Prompts: How Stereotypes Shape LLM's Implicit   Personalization
**Authors**: Vera Neplenbroek, Arianna Bisazza, Raquel Fernández

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:56:24Z

**Summary**: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) infer user's demographic information from subtle cues in the conversation -- a phenomenon called implicit personalization. Prior work has shown that such inferences can lead to lower quality responses for users assumed to be from minority groups, even when no demographic information is explicitly provided. In this work, we systematically explore how LLMs respond to stereotypical cues using controlled synthetic conversations, by analyzing the models' latent user representations through both model internals and generated answers to targeted user questions. Our findings reveal that LLMs do infer demographic attributes based on these stereotypical signals, which for a number of groups even persists when the user explicitly identifies with a different demographic group. Finally, we show that this form of stereotype-driven implicit personalization can be effectively mitigated by intervening on the model's internal representations using a trained linear probe to steer them toward the explicitly stated identity. Our results highlight the need for greater transparency and control in how LLMs represent user identity.

### Perception Before Reasoning: Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning for Visual   Reasoning in Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Yan Chen, Long Li, Teng Xi, Long Zeng, Jingdong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:51:11Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance. However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

**Authors**: Raul Zaharia, Dragoş Gavriluţ, Gheorghiţă Mutu

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:46:39Z

**Summary**: Cybersecurity threats continue to become more sophisticated and diverse in their artifacts, boosting both their volume and complexity. To overcome those challenges, we present GView, an open-source forensic analysis framework with visual and AI-enhanced reasoning. It started with focus on the practical cybersecurity industry. It has evolved significantly, incorporating large language models (LLMs) to dynamically enhance reasoning and ease the forensic workflows. This paper surveys both the current state of GView with its published papers alongside those that are in the publishing process. It also includes its innovative use of logical inference through predicates and inference rules for both the analyzed documents and the user's actions for better suggestions. We highlight the extensible architecture, showcasing its potential as a bridge between the practical forensics worlds with the academic research.

### Validating Solidity Code Defects using Symbolic and Concrete Execution   powered by Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ştefan-Claudiu Susan, Andrei Arusoaie, Dorel Lucanu

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:46:11Z

**Summary**: The high rate of false alarms from static analysis tools and Large Language Models (LLMs) complicates vulnerability detection in Solidity Smart Contracts, demanding methods that can formally or empirically prove the presence of defects. This paper introduces a novel detection pipeline that integrates custom Slither-based detectors, LLMs, Kontrol, and Forge. Our approach is designed to reliably detect defects and generate proofs. We currently perform experiments with promising results for seven types of critical defects. We demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy by presenting our findings for three vulnerabilities -- Reentrancy, Complex Fallback, and Faulty Access Control Policies -- that are challenging for current verification solutions, which often generate false alarms or fail to detect them entirely. We highlight the potential of either symbolic or concrete execution in correctly classifying such code faults. By chaining these instruments, our method effectively validates true positives, significantly reducing the manual verification burden. Although we identify potential limitations, such as the inconsistency and the cost of LLMs, our findings establish a robust framework for combining heuristic analysis with formal verification to achieve more reliable and automated smart contract auditing.

**Authors**: Phung Duc Luong, Le Tran Gia Bao, Nguyen Vu Khai Tam, Dong Huu Nguyen Khoa, Nguyen Huu Quyen, Van-Hau Pham, Phan The Duy

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:45:45Z

**Summary**: This work introduces xOffense, an AI-driven, multi-agent penetration testing framework that shifts the process from labor-intensive, expert-driven manual efforts to fully automated, machine-executable workflows capable of scaling seamlessly with computational infrastructure. At its core, xOffense leverages a fine-tuned, mid-scale open-source LLM (Qwen3-32B) to drive reasoning and decision-making in penetration testing. The framework assigns specialized agents to reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation, with an orchestration layer ensuring seamless coordination across phases. Fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought penetration testing data further enables the model to generate precise tool commands and perform consistent multi-step reasoning. We evaluate xOffense on two rigorous benchmarks: AutoPenBench and AI-Pentest-Benchmark. The results demonstrate that xOffense consistently outperforms contemporary methods, achieving a sub-task completion rate of 79.17%, decisively surpassing leading systems such as VulnBot and PentestGPT. These findings highlight the potential of domain-adapted mid-scale LLMs, when embedded within structured multi-agent orchestration, to deliver superior, cost-efficient, and reproducible solutions for autonomous penetration testing.

### HiChunk: Evaluating and Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with   Hierarchical Chunking
**Authors**: Wensheng Lu, Keyu Chen, Ruizhi Qiao, Xing Sun

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:36:35Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the response capabilities of language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, document chunking as an important part of RAG system often lacks effective evaluation tools. This paper first analyzes why existing RAG evaluation benchmarks are inadequate for assessing document chunking quality, specifically due to evidence sparsity. Based on this conclusion, we propose HiCBench, which includes manually annotated multi-level document chunking points, synthesized evidence-dense quetion answer(QA) pairs, and their corresponding evidence sources. Additionally, we introduce the HiChunk framework, a multi-level document structuring framework based on fine-tuned LLMs, combined with the Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm to improve retrieval quality. Experiments demonstrate that HiCBench effectively evaluates the impact of different chunking methods across the entire RAG pipeline. Moreover, HiChunk achieves better chunking quality within reasonable time consumption, thereby enhancing the overall performance of RAG systems.

### A Visualized Framework for Event Cooperation with Generative Agents
**Authors**: Yuyang Tian, Shunqiang Mao, Wenchang Gao, Lanlan Qiu, Tianxing He

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:33:54Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the simulation of agent societies, enabling autonomous planning, memory formation, and social interactions. However, existing frameworks often overlook systematic evaluations for event organization and lack visualized integration with physically grounded environments, limiting agents' ability to navigate spaces and interact with items realistically. We develop MiniAgentPro, a visualization platform featuring an intuitive map editor for customizing environments and a simulation player with smooth animations. Based on this tool, we introduce a comprehensive test set comprising eight diverse event scenarios with basic and hard variants to assess agents' ability. Evaluations using GPT-4o demonstrate strong performance in basic settings but highlight coordination challenges in hard variants.

### Semantic Alignment-Enhanced Code Translation via an LLM-Based   Multi-Agent System
**Authors**: Zhiqiang Yuan, Weitong Chen, Hanlin Wang, Kai Yu, Xin Peng, Yiling Lou

**Updated**: 2025-09-17T05:54:41Z

**Summary**: Code translation converts code from one programming language to another while maintaining its original functionality, which is crucial for software migration, system refactoring, and cross-platform development. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming and often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based methods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for automated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising, LLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax errors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to self-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error messages.   In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT, which enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and semantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including Initial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error Fixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block in the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and source program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the fixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark from recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On our benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation technique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency; additionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of TRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent.

### ByDeWay: Boost Your multimodal LLM with DEpth prompting in a   Training-Free Way
**Authors**: Rajarshi Roy, Devleena Das, Ankesh Banerjee, Arjya Bhattacharjee, Kousik Dasgupta, Subarna Tripathi

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:31:06Z

**Summary**: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

### Binary imposters: Mergers in massive hierarchical triple stars
**Authors**: F. Kummer, G. Simion, S. Toonen, A. de Koter

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:29:00Z

**Summary**: Massive stars are often born in triples, where gravitational dynamics and stellar interactions play a crucial role in shaping their evolution. One such pathway includes the merger of the inner binary, transforming the system to a binary with a distinct formation history. Therefore, the interpretation of observed binary properties and their inferred formation history may require the consideration of a potential triple origin. We aim to investigate the population of stellar mergers in massive hierarchical triples. Specifically, we assess how frequently mergers occur, and characterise the properties of the post-merger binaries and their subsequent evolution. We combine the triple population synthesis code TRES, which self-consistently models stellar evolution, binary interaction, and gravitational dynamics, with the binary population synthesis code SeBa to simulate 10^5 dynamically stable, massive triples from the zero-age main sequence through merger and post-merger evolution. We explore the effects of a range of physical models for the initial stellar properties, mass transfer, and merger. We find that stellar mergers are a common outcome, occurring in 20-32% of massive triples. Most mergers happen relatively early in the evolution of the system and involve two main-sequence (MS) stars, producing rejuvenated merger remnants that can appear significantly younger than their tertiary companions. Consequently, we predict that 2-10% of all wide MS+MS binaries (P>100 days) have a measurable age discrepancy, and serve as a promising way to identify merged stars. The post-merger systems preferentially evolve into wide, eccentric binaries, with ~80% avoiding further interaction. However, a notable fraction (16-22%) undergoes a second mass-transfer phase, which may result in the formation of high-mass X-ray binaries or mergers of compact objects that spiral in via gravitational-wave emission.

### TokenSkip: Controllable Chain-of-Thought Compression in LLMs
**Authors**: Heming Xia, Chak Tou Leong, Wenjie Wang, Yongqi Li, Wenjie Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:21:22Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been proven effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recent advancements, such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, suggest that scaling up the length of CoT sequences during inference could further boost LLM reasoning performance. However, due to the autoregressive nature of LLM decoding, longer CoT outputs lead to a linear increase in inference latency, adversely affecting user experience, particularly when the CoT exceeds 10,000 tokens. To address this limitation, we analyze the semantic importance of tokens within CoT outputs and reveal that their contributions to reasoning vary. Building on this insight, we propose TokenSkip, a simple yet effective approach that enables LLMs to selectively skip less important tokens, allowing for controllable CoT compression. Extensive experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSkip in reducing CoT token usage while preserving strong reasoning performance. Notably, when applied to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, TokenSkip reduces reasoning tokens by 40% (from 313 to 181) on GSM8K, with less than a 0.4% performance drop. We release our code and checkpoints in https://github.com/hemingkx/TokenSkip.

### SitLLM: Large Language Models for Sitting Posture Health Understanding   via Pressure Sensor Data
**Authors**: Jian Gao, Fufangchen Zhao, Yiyang Zhang, Danfeng Yan

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:06:05Z

**Summary**: Poor sitting posture is a critical yet often overlooked factor contributing to long-term musculoskeletal disorders and physiological dysfunctions. Existing sitting posture monitoring systems, although leveraging visual, IMU, or pressure-based modalities, often suffer from coarse-grained recognition and lack the semantic expressiveness necessary for personalized feedback. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SitLLM}, a lightweight multimodal framework that integrates flexible pressure sensing with large language models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained posture understanding and personalized health-oriented response generation. SitLLM comprises three key components: (1) a \textit{Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding Module} that partitions pressure maps into spatial patches and injects local noise perturbations for robust feature extraction; (2) a \textit{Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment Module} that reprograms sensor embeddings into the LLM's semantic space via multi-head cross-attention using the pre-trained vocabulary embeddings; and (3) a \textit{Multi-Context Prompt Module} that fuses feature-level, structure-level, statistical-level, and semantic-level contextual information to guide instruction comprehension.

### HPIM: Heterogeneous Processing-In-Memory-based Accelerator for Large   Language Models Inference
**Authors**: Cenlin Duan, Jianlei Yang, Rubing Yang, Yikun Wang, Yiou Wang, Lingkun Long, Yingjie Qi, Xiaolin He, Ao Zhou, Xueyan Wang, Weisheng Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:04:00Z

**Summary**: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) presents significant challenges due to their enormous memory footprints, low arithmetic intensity, and stringent latency requirements, particularly during the autoregressive decoding stage. Traditional compute-centric accelerators, such as GPUs, suffer from severe resource underutilization and memory bandwidth bottlenecks in these memory-bound workloads. To overcome these fundamental limitations, we propose HPIM, the first memory-centric heterogeneous Processing-In-Memory (PIM) accelerator that integrates SRAM-PIM and HBM-PIM subsystems designed specifically for LLM inference. HPIM employs a software-hardware co-design approach that combines a specialized compiler framework with a heterogeneous hardware architecture. It intelligently partitions workloads based on their characteristics: latency-critical attention operations are mapped to the SRAM-PIM subsystem to exploit its ultra-low latency and high computational flexibility, while weight-intensive GEMV computations are assigned to the HBM-PIM subsystem to leverage its high internal bandwidth and large storage capacity. Furthermore, HPIM introduces a tightly coupled pipeline strategy across SRAM-PIM and HBM-PIM subsystems to maximize intra-token parallelism, thereby significantly mitigating serial dependency of the autoregressive decoding stage. Comprehensive evaluations using a cycle-accurate simulator demonstrate that HPIM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art accelerators, achieving a peak speedup of up to 22.8x compared to the NVIDIA A100 GPU. Moreover, HPIM exhibits superior performance over contemporary PIM-based accelerators, highlighting its potential as a highly practical and scalable solution for accelerating large-scale LLM inference.

### From Surveys to Narratives: Rethinking Cultural Value Adaptation in LLMs
**Authors**: Muhammad Farid Adilazuarda, Chen Cecilia Liu, Iryna Gurevych, Alham Fikri Aji

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T11:55:23Z

**Summary**: Adapting cultural values in Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant challenges, particularly due to biases and limited training data. Prior work primarily aligns LLMs with different cultural values using World Values Survey (WVS) data. However, it remains unclear whether this approach effectively captures cultural nuances or produces distinct cultural representations for various downstream tasks. In this paper, we systematically investigate WVS-based training for cultural value adaptation and find that relying solely on survey data can homogenize cultural norms and interfere with factual knowledge. To investigate these issues, we augment WVS with encyclopedic and scenario-based cultural narratives from Wikipedia and NormAd. While these narratives may have variable effects on downstream tasks, they consistently improve cultural distinctiveness than survey data alone. Our work highlights the inherent complexity of aligning cultural values with the goal of guiding task-specific behavior. We release our code at https://github.com/faridlazuarda/from-surveys-to-narratives.

### Toward PDDL Planning Copilot
**Authors**: Yarin Benyamin, Argaman Mordoch, Shahaf S. Shperberg, Roni Stern

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T11:51:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.

### Optimized quantum sensor networks for ultralight dark matter detection
**Authors**: Adriel I. Santoso, Le Bin Ho

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T11:50:27Z

**Summary**: Dark matter (DM) remains one of the most compelling unresolved problems in fundamental physics, motivating the search for new detection approaches. We propose a network-based quantum sensor architecture to enhance sensitivity to ultralight DM fields. Each node in the network is a superconducting qubit, interconnected via controlled-Z gates in symmetric topologies such as line, ring, star, and fully connected graphs. We investigate four- and nine-qubit systems, optimizing both state preparation and measurement using a variational quantum metrology framework. This approach minimizes the quantum and classical Cram\'er-Rao bounds to identify optimal configurations. Bayesian inference is employed to extract the DM-induced phase shift from measurement outcomes. Our results show that optimized network configurations significantly outperform conventional GHZ-based protocols while maintaining shallow circuit depths compatible with noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. Sensitivity remains robust under local dephasing noise. These findings highlight the importance of network structure in quantum sensing and point toward scalable strategies for quantum-enhanced DM detection.

### Dynamic Local Average Treatment Effects in Time Series
**Authors**: Alessandro Casini, Adam McCloskey, Luca Rolla, Raimondo Pala

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T11:47:59Z

**Summary**: This paper discusses identification, estimation, and inference on dynamic local average treatment effects (LATEs) in instrumental variables (IVs) settings. First, we show that compliers--observations whose treatment status is affected by the instrument--can be identified individually in time series data using smoothness assumptions and local comparisons of treatment assignments. Second, we show that this result enables not only better interpretability of IV estimates but also direct testing of the exclusion restriction by comparing outcomes among identified non-compliers across instrument values. Third, we document pervasive weak identification in applied work using IVs with time series data by surveying recent publications in leading economics journals. However, we find that strong identification often holds in large subsamples for which the instrument induces changes in the treatment. Motivated by this, we introduce a method based on dynamic programming to detect the most strongly-identified subsample and show how to use this subsample to improve estimation and inference. We also develop new identification-robust inference procedures that focus on the most strongly-identified subsample, offering efficiency gains relative to existing full sample identification-robust inference when identification fails over parts of the sample. Finally, we apply our results to heteroskedasticity-based identification of monetary policy effects. We find that about 75% of observations are compliers (i.e., cases where the variance of the policy shifts up on FOMC announcement days), and we fail to reject the exclusion restriction. Estimation using the most strongly-identified subsample helps reconcile conflicting IV and GMM estimates in the literature.

### Evaluating Large Language Models for Code Translation: Effects of Prompt   Language and Prompt Design
**Authors**: Aamer Aljagthami, Mohammed Banabila, Musab Alshehri, Mohammed Kabini, Mohammad D. Alahmadi

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T11:30:10Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for automated source-code translation, a capability critical to software migration, maintenance, and interoperability. Yet comparative evidence on how model choice, prompt design, and prompt language shape translation quality across multiple programming languages remains limited. This study conducts a systematic empirical assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs for code translation among C++, Java, Python, and C#, alongside a traditional baseline (TransCoder). Using BLEU and CodeBLEU, we quantify syntactic fidelity and structural correctness under two prompt styles (concise instruction and detailed specification) and two prompt languages (English and Arabic), with direction-aware evaluation across language pairs. Experiments show that detailed prompts deliver consistent gains across models and translation directions, and English prompts outperform Arabic by 13-15%. The top-performing model attains the highest CodeBLEU on challenging pairs such as Java to C# and Python to C++. Our evaluation shows that each LLM outperforms TransCoder across the benchmark. These results demonstrate the value of careful prompt engineering and prompt language choice, and provide practical guidance for software modernization and cross-language interoperability.

### How Much Do LLMs Hallucinate across Languages? On Multilingual   Estimation of LLM Hallucination in the Wild
**Authors**: Saad Obaid ul Islam, Anne Lauscher, Goran Glavaš

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T11:12:12Z

**Summary**: In the age of misinformation, hallucination -- the tendency of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate non-factual or unfaithful responses -- represents the main risk for their global utility. Despite LLMs becoming increasingly multilingual, the vast majority of research on detecting and quantifying LLM hallucination are (a) English-centric and (b) focus on machine translation (MT) and summarization, tasks that are less common ``in the wild'' than open information seeking. In contrast, we aim to quantify the extent of LLM hallucination across languages in knowledge-intensive long-form question answering. To this end, we train a multilingual hallucination detection model and conduct a large-scale study across 30 languages and 6 open-source LLM families. We start from an English hallucination detection dataset and rely on MT to generate (noisy) training data in other languages. We also manually annotate gold data for five high-resource languages; we then demonstrate, for these languages, that the estimates of hallucination rates are similar between silver (LLM-generated) and gold test sets, validating the use of silver data for estimating hallucination rates for other languages. For the final rates estimation, we build a knowledge-intensive QA dataset for 30 languages with LLM-generated prompts and Wikipedia articles as references. We find that, while LLMs generate longer responses with more hallucinated tokens for higher-resource languages, there is no correlation between length-normalized hallucination rates of languages and their digital representation. Further, we find that smaller LLMs exhibit larger hallucination rates than larger models.

### Do LLMs Understand Wine Descriptors Across Cultures? A Benchmark for   Cultural Adaptations of Wine Reviews
**Authors**: Chenye Zou, Xingyue Wen, Tianyi Hu, Qian Janice Wang, Daniel Hershcovich

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T11:10:30Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to culture-aware language tasks. We introduce the novel problem of adapting wine reviews across Chinese and English, which goes beyond literal translation by incorporating regional taste preferences and culture-specific flavor descriptors. In a case study on cross-cultural wine review adaptation, we compile the first parallel corpus of professional reviews, containing 8k Chinese and 16k Anglophone reviews. We benchmark both neural-machine-translation baselines and state-of-the-art LLMs with automatic metrics and human evaluation. For the latter, we propose three culture-oriented criteria -- Cultural Proximity, Cultural Neutrality, and Cultural Genuineness -- to assess how naturally a translated review resonates with target-culture readers. Our analysis shows that current models struggle to capture cultural nuances, especially in translating wine descriptions across different cultures. This highlights the challenges and limitations of translation models in handling cultural content.

### Investigating ReLoRA: Effects on the Learning Dynamics of Small Language   Models
**Authors**: Yuval Weiss, David Demitri Africa, Paula Buttery, Richard Diehl Martinez

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T11:06:58Z

**Summary**: Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA have revolutionised the fine-tuning of LLMs. Still, their extension to pretraining via ReLoRA is less well understood, especially for small language models (SLMs), which offer lower computational and environmental costs. This work is the first systematic study of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and learning dynamics. Through ablation experiments, we find that ReLoRA generally performs worse than standard training on loss, Paloma perplexity and BLiMP, with the gap widening for the larger models. Further analysis of the learning dynamics of the models indicates that ReLoRA reinforces the rank deficiencies found in smaller models. These results indicate that low-rank update strategies may not transfer easily to SLM pretraining, highlighting the need for more research in the low-compute regime.

### Spatiotemporal graph neural process for reconstruction, extrapolation,   and classification of cardiac trajectories
**Authors**: Jaume Banus, Augustin C. Ogier, Roger Hullin, Philippe Meyer, Ruud B. van Heeswijk, Jonas Richiardi

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:57:51Z

**Summary**: We present a probabilistic framework for modeling structured spatiotemporal dynamics from sparse observations, focusing on cardiac motion. Our approach integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible approach for analyzing cardiac motion and offers a foundation for graph-based learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data.

### Black-box Model Merging for Language-Model-as-a-Service with Massive   Model Repositories
**Authors**: Shilian Chen, Jie Zhou, Tianyu Huai, Yujiang Lu, Junsong Li, Bihao Zhan, Qianjun Pan, Yutao Yang, Xin Li, Qin Chen, Hang Yan, Liang He

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:55:50Z

**Summary**: Model merging refers to the process of integrating multiple distinct models into a unified model that preserves and combines the strengths and capabilities of the individual models. Most existing approaches rely on task vectors to combine models, typically under the assumption that model parameters are accessible. However, for extremely large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, which are often provided solely as black-box services through API interfaces (Language-Model-as-a-Service), model weights are not available to end users. This presents a significant challenge, which we refer to as black-box model merging (BMM) with massive LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a derivative-free optimization framework based on the evolutionary algorithm (Evo-Merging) that enables effective model merging using only inference-time API queries. Our method consists of two key components: (1) sparsity-based denoising, designed to identify and filter out irrelevant or redundant information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling, which dynamically computes optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on their performance. We also provide a formal justification, along with a theoretical analysis, for our asymmetric sparsification. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines.

### Protecting participants or population? Comparison of k-anonymous   Origin-Destination matrices
**Authors**: Pietro Armenante, Kai Huang, Nikhil Jha, Luca Vassio

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:54:00Z

**Summary**: Origin-Destination (OD) matrices are a core component of research on users' mobility and summarize how individuals move between geographical regions. These regions should be small enough to be representative of user mobility, without incurring substantial privacy risks. There are two added values of the NetMob2025 challenge dataset. Firstly, the data is extensive and contains a lot of socio-demographic information that can be used to create multiple OD matrices, based on the segments of the population. Secondly, a participant is not merely a record in the data, but a statistically weighted proxy for a segment of the real population. This opens the door to a fundamental shift in the anonymization paradigm. A population-based view of privacy is central to our contribution. By adjusting our anonymization framework to account for representativeness, we are also protecting the inferred identity of the actual population, rather than survey participants alone. The challenge addressed in this work is to produce and compare OD matrices that are k-anonymous for survey participants and for the whole population. We compare several traditional methods of anonymization to k-anonymity by generalizing geographical areas. These include generalization over a hierarchy (ATG and OIGH) and the classical Mondrian. To this established toolkit, we add a novel method, i.e., ODkAnon, a greedy algorithm aiming at balancing speed and quality. Unlike previous approaches, which primarily address the privacy aspects of the given datasets, we aim to contribute to the generation of privacy-preserving OD matrices enriched with socio-demographic segmentation that achieves k-anonymity on the actual population.

### Comprehend, Divide, and Conquer: Feature Subspace Exploration via   Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Weiliang Zhang, Xiaohan Huang, Yi Du, Ziyue Qiao, Qingqing Long, Zhen Meng, Yuanchun Zhou, Meng Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:52:32Z

**Summary**: Feature selection aims to preprocess the target dataset, find an optimal and most streamlined feature subset, and enhance the downstream machine learning task. Among filter, wrapper, and embedded-based approaches, the reinforcement learning (RL)-based subspace exploration strategy provides a novel objective optimization-directed perspective and promising performance. Nevertheless, even with improved performance, current reinforcement learning approaches face challenges similar to conventional methods when dealing with complex datasets. These challenges stem from the inefficient paradigm of using one agent per feature and the inherent complexities present in the datasets. This observation motivates us to investigate and address the above issue and propose a novel approach, namely HRLFS. Our methodology initially employs a Large Language Model (LLM)-based hybrid state extractor to capture each feature's mathematical and semantic characteristics. Based on this information, features are clustered, facilitating the construction of hierarchical agents for each cluster and sub-cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of our approach. Compared to contemporary or the one-feature-one-agent RL-based approaches, HRLFS improves the downstream ML performance with iterative feature subspace exploration while accelerating total run time by reducing the number of agents involved.

### A Learnable Fully Interacted Two-Tower Model for Pre-Ranking System
**Authors**: Chao Xiong, Xianwen Yu, Wei Xu, Lei Cheng, Chuan Yuan, Linjian Mo

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:52:03Z

**Summary**: Pre-ranking plays a crucial role in large-scale recommender systems by significantly improving the efficiency and scalability within the constraints of providing high-quality candidate sets in real time. The two-tower model is widely used in pre-ranking systems due to a good balance between efficiency and effectiveness with decoupled architecture, which independently processes user and item inputs before calculating their interaction (e.g. dot product or similarity measure). However, this independence also leads to the lack of information interaction between the two towers, resulting in less effectiveness. In this paper, a novel architecture named learnable Fully Interacted Two-tower Model (FIT) is proposed, which enables rich information interactions while ensuring inference efficiency. FIT mainly consists of two parts: Meta Query Module (MQM) and Lightweight Similarity Scorer (LSS). Specifically, MQM introduces a learnable item meta matrix to achieve expressive early interaction between user and item features. Moreover, LSS is designed to further obtain effective late interaction between the user and item towers. Finally, experimental results on several public datasets show that our proposed FIT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline pre-ranking models.

### FusionMAE: large-scale pretrained model to optimize and simplify   diagnostic and control of fusion plasma

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:50:29Z

**Summary**: In magnetically confined fusion device, the complex, multiscale, and nonlinear dynamics of plasmas necessitate the integration of extensive diagnostic systems to effectively monitor and control plasma behaviour. The complexity and uncertainty arising from these extensive systems and their tangled interrelations has long posed a significant obstacle to the acceleration of fusion energy development. In this work, a large-scale model, fusion masked auto-encoder (FusionMAE) is pre-trained to compress the information from 88 diagnostic signals into a concrete embedding, to provide a unified interface between diagnostic systems and control actuators. Two mechanisms are proposed to ensure a meaningful embedding: compression-reduction and missing-signal reconstruction. Upon completion of pre-training, the model acquires the capability for 'virtual backup diagnosis', enabling the inference of missing diagnostic data with 96.7% reliability. Furthermore, the model demonstrates three emergent capabilities: automatic data analysis, universal control-diagnosis interface, and enhancement of control performance on multiple tasks. This work pioneers large-scale AI model integration in fusion energy, demonstrating how pre-trained embeddings can simplify the system interface, reducing necessary diagnostic systems and optimize operation performance for future fusion reactors.

### Worst-Case Symbolic Constraints Analysis and Generalisation with Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Daniel Koh, Yannic Noller, Corina S. Pasareanu, Adrians Skapars, Youcheng Sun

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:35:33Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on coding tasks such as generation, completion and repair, but their ability to handle complex symbolic reasoning over code still remains underexplored. We introduce the task of worst-case symbolic constraints analysis, which requires inferring the symbolic constraints that characterise worst-case program executions; these constraints can be solved to obtain inputs that expose performance bottlenecks or denial-of-service vulnerabilities in software systems. We show that even state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) struggle when applied directly on this task. To address this challenge, we propose WARP, an innovative neurosymbolic approach that computes worst-case constraints on smaller concrete input sizes using existing program analysis tools, and then leverages LLMs to generalise these constraints to larger input sizes. Concretely, WARP comprises: (1) an incremental strategy for LLM-based worst-case reasoning, (2) a solver-aligned neurosymbolic framework that integrates reinforcement learning with SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solving, and (3) a curated dataset of symbolic constraints. Experimental results show that WARP consistently improves performance on worst-case constraint reasoning. Leveraging the curated constraint dataset, we use reinforcement learning to fine-tune a model, WARP-1.0-3B, which significantly outperforms size-matched and even larger baselines. These results demonstrate that incremental constraint reasoning enhances LLMs' ability to handle symbolic reasoning and highlight the potential for deeper integration between neural learning and formal methods in rigorous program analysis.

### Jailbreaking Large Language Models Through Content Concretization
**Authors**: Johan Wahréus, Ahmed Hussain, Panos Papadimitratos

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:34:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for task automation and content generation, yet their safety mechanisms remain vulnerable to circumvention through different jailbreaking techniques. In this paper, we introduce \textit{Content Concretization} (CC), a novel jailbreaking technique that iteratively transforms abstract malicious requests into concrete, executable implementations. CC is a two-stage process: first, generating initial LLM responses using lower-tier, less constrained safety filters models, then refining them through higher-tier models that process both the preliminary output and original prompt. We evaluate our technique using 350 cybersecurity-specific prompts, demonstrating substantial improvements in jailbreak Success Rates (SRs), increasing from 7\% (no refinements) to 62\% after three refinement iterations, while maintaining a cost of 7.5\textcent~per prompt. Comparative A/B testing across nine different LLM evaluators confirms that outputs from additional refinement steps are consistently rated as more malicious and technically superior. Moreover, manual code analysis reveals that generated outputs execute with minimal modification, although optimal deployment typically requires target-specific fine-tuning. With eventual improved harmful code generation, these results highlight critical vulnerabilities in current LLM safety frameworks.

### InferLog: Accelerating LLM Inference for Online Log Parsing via   ICL-oriented Prefix Caching
**Authors**: Yilun Wang, Pengfei Chen, Haiyu Huang, Zilong He, Gou Tan, Chuanfu Zhang, Jingkai He, Zibin Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:33:29Z

**Summary**: Modern software systems generate massive volumes of runtime logs, necessitating efficient and accurate log parsing to enable critical downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and root cause analysis. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system.   In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.

### Rethinking the Evaluation of Alignment Methods: Insights into Diversity,   Generalisation, and Safety
**Authors**: Denis Janiak, Julia Moska, Dawid Motyka, Karolina Seweryn, Paweł Walkowiak, Bartosz Żuk, Arkadiusz Janz

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:32:59Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) require careful alignment to balance competing objectives - factuality, safety, conciseness, proactivity, and diversity. Existing studies focus on individual techniques or specific dimensions, lacking a holistic assessment of the inherent trade-offs. We propose a unified evaluation framework that compares LLM alignment methods (PPO, DPO, ORPO, KTO) across these five axes, using both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. Leveraging a specialized LLM-as-Judge prompt, validated through human studies, we reveal that DPO and KTO excel in factual accuracy, PPO and DPO lead in safety, and PPO best balances conciseness with proactivity. Our findings provide insights into trade-offs of common alignment methods, guiding the development of more balanced and reliable LLMs.

### UtterTune: LoRA-Based Target-Language Pronunciation Edit and Control in   Multilingual Text-to-Speech
**Authors**: Shuhei Kato

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:28:11Z

**Summary**: We propose UtterTune, a lightweight adaptation method that fine-tunes a multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) system based on a large language model (LLM) architecture, designed to enhance the controllability of pronunciation in a target language while preserving performance in others. While LLM architectures have enabled TTS models to achieve remarkable naturalness, accurately modeling grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) mapping and prosody remains challenging, especially when the model omits an explicit G2P module and directly processes minimally encoded text (e.g., byte-pair encoding). UtterTune leverages low-rank adaptation to enable the control of segmental pronunciation and pitch accent at the phoneme level for Japanese speech, the target language in this paper, while maintaining naturalness and speaker similarity in a zero-shot setting. Objective and subjective evaluations confirm its effectiveness.

### HLSMAC: A New StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge for High-Level Strategic   Decision-Making
**Authors**: Xingxing Hong, Yungong Wang, Dexin Jin, Ye Yuan, Ximing Huang, Zijian Wu, Wenxin Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:26:12Z

**Summary**: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception, thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency, to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic decision-making.

### HoloDx: Knowledge- and Data-Driven Multimodal Diagnosis of Alzheimer's   Disease
**Authors**: Qiuhui Chen, Jintao Wang, Gang Wang, Yi Hong

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:22:22Z

**Summary**: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires effectively integrating multimodal data and clinical expertise. However, existing methods often struggle to fully utilize multimodal information and lack structured mechanisms to incorporate dynamic domain knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose HoloDx, a knowledge- and data-driven framework that enhances AD diagnosis by aligning domain knowledge with multimodal clinical data. HoloDx incorporates a knowledge injection module with a knowledge-aware gated cross-attention, allowing the model to dynamically integrate domain-specific insights from both large language models (LLMs) and clinical expertise. Also, a memory injection module with a designed prototypical memory attention enables the model to retain and retrieve subject-specific information, ensuring consistency in decision-making. By jointly leveraging these mechanisms, HoloDx enhances interpretability, improves robustness, and effectively aligns prior knowledge with current subject data. Evaluations on five AD datasets demonstrate that HoloDx outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior diagnostic accuracy and strong generalization across diverse cohorts. The source code will be released upon publication acceptance.

### Evolution of the infrared luminosity function and its corresponding   dust-obscured star formation rate density out to z~6
**Authors**: M. P. Koprowski, J. V. Wijesekera, J. S. Dunlop, K. Lisiecki, D. J. McLeod, R. J. McLure, M. J. Michałowski, M. Solar

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:19:37Z

**Summary**: We present a new determination of the evolving far-infrared galaxy luminosity function (FIR LF) and the resulting inferred evolution of dust-obscured star-formation rate density (SFRD) out to redshift z~6. To establish the evolving co-moving number density of FIR-bright objects, we make use of the high-resolution ALMA follow-up study (AS2UDS), of the JCMT SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey (S2CLS) sub-mm imaging in the UKIDSS UDS survey field. In order to estimate the contributions of faint/low-mass sources we implement a method in which the faint-end of the IR LF is inferred by stacking (in stellar mass and redshift bins) the optical/near-infrared samples of star-forming galaxies into the appropriate FIR Herschel and sub-mm JCMT maps. Using this information we determine the faint-end slope of the FIR LF in two intermediate redshift bins (where it can be robustly established) and then adopt this result at all other redshifts. The evolution of the characteristic luminosity of the galaxy FIR LF, L*, is found to be increase monotonically with redshift, evolving as z^1.38+-0.07, while the characteristic number density is well fitted by double power-law function, constant at z<2.24 and declining as z^-4.95+-0.73 at higher redshifts. The evolution of the corresponding dust-obscured star-formation rate density was then calculated and is here compared with the results from a number of recent studies in the literature. Our analysis confirms that dust-obscured star-formation activity dominates SFRD at cosmic noon, but then becomes progressively less important with increasing redshift: while dusty star-forming galaxies are still found out to the highest redshifts explored here, UV-visible star formation dominates at z>4, and dust-obscured activity contributes <25% of SFRD by z~6.

### A Novel Compression Framework for YOLOv8: Achieving Real-Time Aerial   Object Detection on Edge Devices via Structured Pruning and Channel-Wise   Distillation
**Authors**: Melika Sabaghian, Mohammad Ali Keyvanrad, Seyyedeh Mahila Moghadami

**Updated**: 2025-09-17T12:59:25Z

**Summary**: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels, significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to 13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from 26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

### All Roads Lead to Rome: Graph-Based Confidence Estimation for Large   Language Model Reasoning
**Authors**: Caiqi Zhang, Chang Shu, Ehsan Shareghi, Nigel Collier

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:02:52Z

**Summary**: Confidence estimation is essential for the reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs). Existing methods are primarily designed for factual QA tasks and often fail to generalize to reasoning tasks. To address this gap, we propose a set of training-free, graph-based confidence estimation methods tailored to reasoning tasks. Our approach models reasoning paths as directed graphs and estimates confidence by exploiting graph properties such as centrality, path convergence, and path weighting. Experiments with two LLMs on three reasoning datasets demonstrate improved confidence estimation and enhanced performance on two downstream tasks.

**Authors**: Leekyeung Han, Hyunji Min, Gyeom Hwangbo, Jonghyun Choi, Paul Hongsuck Seo

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T09:49:34Z

**Summary**: We introduce DialNav, a novel collaborative embodied dialog task, where a navigation agent (Navigator) and a remote guide (Guide) engage in multi-turn dialog to reach a goal location. Unlike prior work, DialNav aims for holistic evaluation and requires the Guide to infer the Navigator's location, making communication essential for task success. To support this task, we collect and release the Remote Assistance in Navigation (RAIN) dataset, human-human dialog paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both navigation and dialog, and conduct extensive experiments analyzing the impact of different Navigator and Guide models. We highlight key challenges and publicly release the dataset, code, and evaluation framework to foster future research in embodied dialog.

## Keyword: LLM Deployment 
 ### Do Natural Language Descriptions of Model Activations Convey Privileged   Information?
**Authors**: Millicent Li, Alberto Mario Ceballos Arroyo, Giordano Rogers, Naomi Saphra, Byron C. Wallace

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:59:04Z

**Summary**: Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model, or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that they succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals, suggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated them, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful insights into the operations of LLMs.

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:57:22Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation, we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of 4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web agents.

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:57:19Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving. However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named AgentFounder. We evaluate our AgentFounder-30B on 10 benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art performance while retains strong tool-use ability, notably 39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.

### WebSailor-V2: Bridging the Chasm to Proprietary Agents via Synthetic   Data and Scalable Reinforcement Learning

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:57:03Z

**Summary**: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability. Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks, matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

### JoPA:Explaining Large Language Model's Generation via Joint Prompt   Attribution
**Authors**: Yurui Chang, Bochuan Cao, Yujia Wang, Jinghui Chen, Lu Lin

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:48:53Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in complex text generation tasks. However, the contribution of the input prompt to the generated content still remains obscure to humans, underscoring the necessity of understanding the causality between input and output pairs. Existing works for providing prompt-specific explanation often confine model output to be classification or next-word prediction. Few initial attempts aiming to explain the entire language generation often treat input prompt texts independently, ignoring their combinatorial effects on the follow-up generation. In this study, we introduce a counterfactual explanation framework based on Joint Prompt Attribution, JoPA, which aims to explain how a few prompt texts collaboratively influences the LLM's complete generation. Particularly, we formulate the task of prompt attribution for generation interpretation as a combinatorial optimization problem, and introduce a probabilistic algorithm to search for the casual input combination in the discrete space. We define and utilize multiple metrics to evaluate the produced explanations, demonstrating both the faithfulness and efficiency of our framework.

### RepIt: Representing Isolated Targets to Steer Language Models
**Authors**: Vincent Siu, Nathan W. Henry, Nicholas Crispino, Yang Liu, Dawn Song, Chenguang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:35:36Z

**Summary**: While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control of model behavior.

### LLMs for energy and macronutrients estimation using only text data from   24-hour dietary recalls: a parameter-efficient fine-tuning experiment using a   10-shot prompt
**Authors**: Rodrigo M Carrillo-Larco

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:26:17Z

**Summary**: BACKGROUND: Most artificial intelligence tools used to estimate nutritional content rely on image input. However, whether large language models (LLMs) can accurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of foods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable simpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used 24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM was prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and five macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their quantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate whether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the ground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber and total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male, mean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean absolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across endpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better, with energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC exceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a chain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed solely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values from 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden, text-based dietary monitoring tools.

### Beyond Private or Public: Large Language Models as Quasi-Public Goods in   the AI Economy
**Authors**: Yukun Zhang, TianYang Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:22:00Z

**Summary**: This paper conceptualizes Large Language Models (LLMs) as a form of mixed public goods within digital infrastructure, analyzing their economic properties through a comprehensive theoretical framework. We develop mathematical models to quantify the non-rivalry characteristics, partial excludability, and positive externalities of LLMs. Through comparative analysis of open-source and closed-source development paths, we identify systematic differences in resource allocation efficiency, innovation trajectories, and access equity. Our empirical research evaluates the spillover effects and network externalities of LLMs across different domains, including knowledge diffusion, innovation acceleration, and industry transformation. Based on these findings, we propose policy recommendations for balancing innovation incentives with equitable access, including public-private partnership mechanisms, computational resource democratization, and governance structures that optimize social welfare. This interdisciplinary approach contributes to understanding the economic nature of foundation AI models and provides policy guidance for their development as critical digital infrastructure

### Learning from a Biased Sample
**Authors**: Roshni Sahoo, Lihua Lei, Stefan Wager

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:04:19Z

**Summary**: The empirical risk minimization approach to data-driven decision making requires access to training data drawn under the same conditions as those that will be faced when the decision rule is deployed. However, in a number of settings, we may be concerned that our training sample is biased in the sense that some groups (characterized by either observable or unobservable attributes) may be under- or over-represented relative to the general population; and in this setting empirical risk minimization over the training set may fail to yield rules that perform well at deployment. We propose a model of sampling bias called conditional $\Gamma$-biased sampling, where observed covariates can affect the probability of sample selection arbitrarily much but the amount of unexplained variation in the probability of sample selection is bounded by a constant factor. Applying the distributionally robust optimization framework, we propose a method for learning a decision rule that minimizes the worst-case risk incurred under a family of test distributions that can generate the training distribution under $\Gamma$-biased sampling. We apply a result of Rockafellar and Uryasev to show that this problem is equivalent to an augmented convex risk minimization problem. We give statistical guarantees for learning a model that is robust to sampling bias via the method of sieves, and propose a deep learning algorithm whose loss function captures our robust learning target. We empirically validate our proposed method in a case study on prediction of mental health scores from health survey data and a case study on ICU length of stay prediction.

### Large Language Model-assisted Meta-optimizer for Automated Design of   Constrained Evolutionary Algorithm
**Authors**: Xu Yang, Rui Wang, Kaiwen Li, Wenhua Li, Weixiong Huang

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T17:02:24Z

**Summary**: Meta-black-box optimization has been significantly advanced through the use of large language models (LLMs), yet in fancy on constrained evolutionary optimization. In this work, AwesomeDE is proposed that leverages LLMs as the strategy of meta-optimizer to generate update rules for constrained evolutionary algorithm without human intervention. On the meanwhile, $RTO^2H$ framework is introduced for standardize prompt design of LLMs. The meta-optimizer is trained on a diverse set of constrained optimization problems. Key components, including prompt design and iterative refinement, are systematically analyzed to determine their impact on design quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency and solution accuracy. Furthermore, AwesomeDE is shown to generalize well across distinct problem domains, suggesting its potential for broad applicability. This research contributes to the field by providing a scalable and data-driven methodology for automated constrained algorithm design, while also highlighting limitations and directions for future work.

### Evaluating LLM Alignment on Personality Inference from Real-World   Interview Data
**Authors**: Jianfeng Zhu, Julina Maharjan, Xinyu Li, Karin G. Coifman, Ruoming Jin

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T16:54:35Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring nuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents, counselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings underscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and motivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and alignment-oriented fine-tuning.

### SuPreME: A Supervised Pre-training Framework for Multimodal ECG   Representation Learning
**Authors**: Mingsheng Cai, Jiuming Jiang, Wenhao Huang, Che Liu, Rossella Arcucci

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T16:49:11Z

**Summary**: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is critical for diagnosing and monitoring cardiac health, but obtaining large-scale annotated ECG datasets is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent ECG Self-Supervised Learning (eSSL) methods mitigate this by learning features without extensive labels but fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and require extensive task-specific fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SuPreME}$, a $\textbf{Su}$pervised $\textbf{Pre}$-training framework for $\textbf{M}$ultimodal $\textbf{E}$CG representation learning. SuPreME is pre-trained using structured diagnostic labels derived from ECG report entities through a one-time offline extraction with Large Language Models (LLMs), which help denoise, standardize cardiac concepts, and improve clinical representation learning. By fusing ECG signals with textual cardiac queries instead of fixed labels, SuPreME enables zero-shot classification of unseen conditions without further fine-tuning. We evaluate SuPreME on six downstream datasets covering 106 cardiac conditions, achieving superior zero-shot AUC performance of $77.20\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art eSSLs by $4.98\%$. Results demonstrate SuPreME's effectiveness in leveraging structured, clinically relevant knowledge for high-quality ECG representations.

### Is the Top Still Spinning? Evaluating Subjectivity in Narrative   Understanding
**Authors**: Melanie Subbiah, Akankshya Mishra, Grace Kim, Liyan Tang, Greg Durrett, Kathleen McKeown

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T16:47:26Z

**Summary**: Determining faithfulness of a claim to a source document is an important problem across many domains. This task is generally treated as a binary judgment of whether the claim is supported or unsupported in relation to the source. In many cases, though, whether a claim is supported can be ambiguous. For instance, it may depend on making inferences from given evidence, and different people can reasonably interpret the claim as either supported or unsupported based on their agreement with those inferences. Forcing binary labels upon such claims lowers the reliability of evaluation. In this work, we reframe the task to manage the subjectivity involved with factuality judgments of ambiguous claims. We introduce LLM-generated edits of summaries as a method of providing a nuanced evaluation of claims: how much does a summary need to be edited to be unambiguous? Whether a claim gets rewritten and how much it changes can be used as an automatic evaluation metric, the Ambiguity Rewrite Metric (ARM), with a much richer feedback signal than a binary judgment of faithfulness. We focus on the area of narrative summarization as it is particularly rife with ambiguity and subjective interpretation. We show that ARM produces a 21% absolute improvement in annotator agreement on claim faithfulness, indicating that subjectivity is reduced.

### Metacognitive Reuse: Turning Recurring LLM Reasoning Into Concise   Behaviors
**Authors**: Aniket Didolkar, Nicolas Ballas, Sanjeev Arora, Anirudh Goyal

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T16:44:26Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting extended chains of thought. During the process, they often re-derive the same intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise, reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook" which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to conclude.

### Simulating Clinical AI Assistance using Multimodal LLMs: A Case Study in   Diabetic Retinopathy
**Authors**: Nadim Barakat, William Lotter

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T16:42:19Z

**Summary**: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open, lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician trust in clinical workflows.

### Single-stream Policy Optimization
**Authors**: Zhongwen Xu, Zihan Ding

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T16:39:11Z

**Summary**: We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample. Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary. Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25, +4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.

### Curriculum Multi-Task Self-Supervision Improves Lightweight   Architectures for Onboard Satellite Hyperspectral Image Segmentation
**Authors**: Hugo Carlesso, Josiane Mothe, Radu Tudor Ionescu

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T16:37:59Z

**Summary**: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL) framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/hugocarlesso/CMTSSL.

### Scaling Up Throughput-oriented LLM Inference Applications on   Heterogeneous Opportunistic GPU Clusters with Pervasive Context Management
**Authors**: Thanh Son Phung, Douglas Thain

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T16:06:33Z

**Summary**: The widespread growth in LLM developments increasingly demands more computational power from clusters than what they can supply. Traditional LLM applications inherently require huge static resource allocations, which force users to either wait in a long job queue and accept progress delay, or buy expensive hardware to fulfill their needs and exacerbate the demand-supply problem. However, not all LLM applications are latency-sensitive and can instead be executed in a throughput-oriented way. This throughput orientation allows a dynamic allocation that opportunistically pools available resources over time, avoiding both the long queue and expensive GPU purchases. Effectively utilizing opportunistic resources brings numerous challenges nevertheless. Our solution, pervasive context management, exploits the common computational context in LLM applications and provides mechanisms and policies that allow seamless context reuse on opportunistic resources. Our evaluation shows an LLM application with pervasive context management on opportunistic resources reduces its execution time by 98.1%.

### The Few-shot Dilemma: Over-prompting Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yongjian Tang, Doruk Tuncel, Christian Koerner, Thomas Runkler

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T16:00:06Z

**Summary**: Over-prompting, a phenomenon where excessive examples in prompts lead to diminished performance in Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges the conventional wisdom about in-context few-shot learning. To investigate this few-shot dilemma, we outline a prompting framework that leverages three standard few-shot selection methods - random sampling, semantic embedding, and TF-IDF vectors - and evaluate these methods across multiple LLMs, including GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, DeepSeek-V3, Gemma-3, LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.2, and Mistral. Our experimental results reveal that incorporating excessive domain-specific examples into prompts can paradoxically degrade performance in certain LLMs, which contradicts the prior empirical conclusion that more relevant few-shot examples universally benefit LLMs. Given the trend of LLM-assisted software engineering and requirement analysis, we experiment with two real-world software requirement classification datasets. By gradually increasing the number of TF-IDF-selected and stratified few-shot examples, we identify their optimal quantity for each LLM. This combined approach achieves superior performance with fewer examples, avoiding the over-prompting problem, thus surpassing the state-of-the-art by 1% in classifying functional and non-functional requirements.

### Enhancement of torque transmission capability in Magneto-Rheological   fluid-based Clutch using novel hybrid corrugated plane transmission surface   strategy
**Authors**: Jithin Vijaykumar, Loyad Joseph Losan, Saddala Reddy Tharun, Murthi Ram Chandra Reddy, Mood Rahul, Jagadeesha T

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:41:21Z

**Summary**: In an increased automated world, miniaturization is the key to widespread deployment of advanced technologies. Enhancing the torque transmissibility by abiding to the spatial constraints imposed by radial space availability has consistently remained a hurdle in the implementation of Magneto-Rheological (MR) clutches that use shear mode of MR fluid (MRF). This proves the necessity of a novel design capable of providing required transmission capability with a reduced transmission surface area. The present study analyzes a corrugated transmissible surface design which improves torque transmissibility with the help of increased transmission area and proper alignment of field lines passing through the MRF gap. In this paper, the impact of various dimensional parameters of a hybrid corrugated plane type MR clutch (MRC) design was studied with the aid of magnetic analysis performed on COMSOL Multiphysics software. The results obtained shows that various parameters in the design of MR clutches, such as annular and radial MR gaps, disc width, individual corrugation heights, corrugation width, bobbin thickness and radii of plane surface influences the torque transmission capability of MR clutches. Also, an optimization of the hybrid corrugated plane MR Clutch of the chosen geometry has been conducted with the transmission capability increasing by 39.37% compared with the non-optimized geometrical configuration.

### Characterizing Phishing Pages by JavaScript Capabilities
**Authors**: Aleksandr Nahapetyan, Kanv Khare, Kevin Schwarz, Bradley Reaves, Alexandros Kapravelos

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:39:23Z

**Summary**: In 2024, the Anti-Phishing Work Group identified over one million phishing pages. Phishers achieve this scale by using phishing kits -- ready-to-deploy phishing websites -- to rapidly deploy phishing campaigns with specific data exfiltration, evasion, or mimicry techniques. In contrast, researchers and defenders continue to fight phishing on a page-by-page basis and rely on manual analysis to recognize static features for kit identification.   This paper aims to aid researchers and analysts by automatically differentiating groups of phishing pages based on the underlying kit, automating a previously manual process, and enabling us to measure how popular different client-side techniques are across these groups. For kit detection, our system has an accuracy of 97% on a ground-truth dataset of 548 kit families deployed across 4,562 phishing URLs. On an unlabeled dataset, we leverage the complexity of 434,050 phishing pages' JavaScript logic to group them into 11,377 clusters, annotating the clusters with what phishing techniques they employ. We find that UI interactivity and basic fingerprinting are universal techniques, present in 90% and 80% of the clusters, respectively. On the other hand, mouse detection via the browser's mouse API is among the rarest behaviors, despite being used in a deployment of a 7-year-old open-source phishing kit. Our methods and findings provide new ways for researchers and analysts to tackle the volume of phishing pages.

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:34:43Z

**Summary**: With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous navigation. However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal, since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video sequences, providing valuable insights and direction for future research.

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:33:16Z

**Summary**: Real-world vision language reasoning scenarios often include diverse and complex tasks. However, vision language reinforcement learning has primarily focused on a narrow set of tasks (e.g. geometry or chart reasoning), limiting the improvement of Vision Language Models' (VLMs) general reasoning. Therefore, we propose a novel Code2Logic approach, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize verifiable game reasoning tasks at scale via adapting game code. Using the Code2Logic, we developed the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is verifiable and scalable, offers controllable difficulty gradation and is diverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Then we apply Game-RL, which is simple reinforcement learning on GameQA. Surprisingly, despite training solely on game tasks, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization, specifically Qwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33% across 7 diverse vision-language benchmarks. Our code, dataset and models are available at the GitHub repository.

### Efficient Cold-Start Recommendation via BPE Token-Level Embedding   Initialization with LLM
**Authors**: Yushang Zhao, Xinyue Han, Qian Leng, Qianyi Sun, Haotian Lyu, Chengrui Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:32:51Z

**Summary**: The cold-start issue is the challenge when we talk about recommender systems, especially in the case when we do not have the past interaction data of new users or new items. Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as conventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment with shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation strategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by applying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained token-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to using coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can be used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate recommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our mechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over benchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings show that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit Rate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same capability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more interpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting. The practical application of token-level semantic initialization as a lightweight, but nevertheless effective extension to modern recommender systems in the zero-shot setting is indicated within this work.

### More performant and scalable: Rethinking contrastive vision-language   pre-training of radiology in the LLM era
**Authors**: Yingtai Li, Haoran Lai, Xiaoqian Zhou, Shuai Ming, Wenxin Ma, Wei Wei, Shaohua Kevin Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:27:14Z

**Summary**: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments) without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale "silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard" dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to facilitate {\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems. Our code is avaiable at https://github.com/SadVoxel/More-performant-and-scalable.

### Compressed Video Quality Enhancement: Classifying and Benchmarking over   Standards
**Authors**: Xiem HoangVan, Dang BuiDinh, Sang NguyenQuang, Wen-Hsiao Peng

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:24:32Z

**Summary**: Compressed video quality enhancement (CVQE) is crucial for improving user experience with lossy video codecs like H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, and H.266/VVC. While deep learning based CVQE has driven significant progress, existing surveys still suffer from limitations: lack of systematic classification linking methods to specific standards and artifacts, insufficient comparative analysis of architectural paradigms across coding types, and underdeveloped benchmarking practices. To address these gaps, this paper presents three key contributions. First, it introduces a novel taxonomy classifying CVQE methods across architectural paradigms, coding standards, and compressed-domain feature utilization. Second, it proposes a unified benchmarking framework integrating modern compression protocols and standard test sequences for fair multi-criteria evaluation. Third, it provides a systematic analysis of the critical trade-offs between reconstruction performance and computational complexity observed in state-of-the-art methods and highlighting promising directions for future research. This comprehensive review aims to establish a foundation for consistent assessment and informed model selection in CVQE research and deployment.

### WHU-STree: A Multi-modal Benchmark Dataset for Street Tree Inventory
**Authors**: Ruifei Ding, Zhe Chen, Wen Fan, Chen Long, Huijuan Xiao, Yelu Zeng, Zhen Dong, Bisheng Yang

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:23:40Z

**Summary**: Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city, richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50 species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics, WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory. We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization, spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree asset management. The WHU-STree dataset is accessible at: https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/WHU-STree.

### TrojanRobot: Physical-world Backdoor Attacks Against VLM-based Robotic   Manipulation
**Authors**: Xianlong Wang, Hewen Pan, Hangtao Zhang, Minghui Li, Shengshan Hu, Ziqi Zhou, Lulu Xue, Aishan Liu, Yunpeng Jiang, Leo Yu Zhang, Xiaohua Jia

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:19:32Z

**Summary**: Robotic manipulation in the physical world is increasingly empowered by \textit{large language models} (LLMs) and \textit{vision-language models} (VLMs), leveraging their understanding and perception capabilities. Recently, various attacks against such robotic policies have been proposed, with backdoor attacks drawing considerable attention for their high stealth and strong persistence capabilities. However, existing backdoor efforts are limited to simulators and suffer from physical-world realization. To address this, we propose \textit{TrojanRobot}, a highly stealthy and broadly effective robotic backdoor attack in the physical world. Specifically, we introduce a module-poisoning approach by embedding a backdoor module into the modular robotic policy, enabling backdoor control over the policy's visual perception module thereby backdooring the entire robotic policy. Our vanilla implementation leverages a backdoor-finetuned VLM to serve as the backdoor module. To enhance its generalization in physical environments, we propose a prime implementation, leveraging the LVLM-as-a-backdoor paradigm and developing three types of prime attacks, \ie, \textit{permutation}, \textit{stagnation}, and \textit{intentional} attacks, thus achieving finer-grained backdoors. Extensive experiments on the UR3e manipulator with 18 task instructions using robotic policies based on four VLMs demonstrate the broad effectiveness and physical-world stealth of TrojanRobot. Our attack's video demonstrations are available via a github link https://trojanrobot.github.io.

**Authors**: Jiawei Wang, Haowei Sun, Xintao Yan, Shuo Feng, Jun Gao, Henry X. Liu

**Updated**: 2025-09-17T04:40:30Z

**Summary**: Safe and scalable deployment of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving requires extensive and diverse data, particularly safety-critical events. Existing data are mostly generated from simulators with a significant sim-to-real gap or collected from on-road testing that is costly and unsafe. This paper presents TeraSim-World, an automated pipeline that synthesizes realistic and geographically diverse safety-critical data for E2E autonomous driving at anywhere in the world. Starting from an arbitrary location, TeraSim-World retrieves real-world maps and traffic demand from geospatial data sources. Then, it simulates agent behaviors from naturalistic driving datasets, and orchestrates diverse adversities to create corner cases. Informed by street views of the same location, it achieves photorealistic, geographically grounded sensor rendering via the frontier video generation model Cosmos-Drive. By bridging agent and sensor simulations, TeraSim-World provides a scalable and critical data synthesis framework for training and evaluation of E2E autonomous driving systems. Codes and videos are available at https://wjiawei.com/terasim-world-web/ .

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:13:13Z

**Summary**: Search has emerged as core infrastructure for LLM-based agents and is widely viewed as critical on the path toward more general intelligence. Finance is a particularly demanding proving ground: analysts routinely conduct complex, multi-step searches over time-sensitive, domain-specific data, making it ideal for assessing both search proficiency and knowledge-grounded reasoning. Yet no existing open financial datasets evaluate data searching capability of end-to-end agents, largely because constructing realistic, complicated tasks requires deep financial expertise and time-sensitive data is hard to evaluate. We present FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source agent benchmark for realistic, open-domain financial search and reasoning. FinSearchComp comprises three tasks -- Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and Complex Historical Investigation -- closely reproduce real-world financial analyst workflows. To ensure difficulty and reliability, we engage 70 professional financial experts for annotation and implement a rigorous multi-stage quality-assurance pipeline. The benchmark includes 635 questions spanning global and Greater China markets, and we evaluate 21 models (products) on it. Grok 4 (web) tops the global subset, approaching expert-level accuracy. DouBao (web) leads on the Greater China subset. Experimental analyses show that equipping agents with web search and financial plugins substantially improves results on FinSearchComp, and the country origin of models and tools impact performance significantly.By aligning with realistic analyst tasks and providing end-to-end evaluation, FinSearchComp offers a professional, high-difficulty testbed for complex financial search and reasoning.

### References Matter: Investigating the Impact of Reference Set Variation   on Summarization Evaluation
**Authors**: Silvia Casola, Yang Janet Liu, Siyao Peng, Oliver Kraus, Albert Gatt, Barbara Plank

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:11:20Z

**Summary**: Human language production exhibits remarkable richness and variation, reflecting diverse communication styles and intents. However, this variation is often overlooked in summarization evaluation. While having multiple reference summaries is known to improve correlation with human judgments, the impact of the reference set on reference-based metrics has not been systematically investigated. This work examines the sensitivity of widely used reference-based metrics in relation to the choice of reference sets, analyzing three diverse multi-reference summarization datasets: SummEval, GUMSum, and DUC2004. We demonstrate that many popular metrics exhibit significant instability. This instability is particularly concerning for n-gram-based metrics like ROUGE, where model rankings vary depending on the reference sets, undermining the reliability of model comparisons. We also collect human judgments on LLM outputs for genre-diverse data and examine their correlation with metrics to supplement existing findings beyond newswire summaries, finding weak-to-no correlation. Taken together, we recommend incorporating reference set variation into summarization evaluation to enhance consistency alongside correlation with human judgments, especially when evaluating LLMs.

### LLM Hallucination Detection: A Fast Fourier Transform Method Based on   Hidden Layer Temporal Signals
**Authors**: Jinxin Li, Gang Tu, ShengYu Cheng, Junjie Hu, Jinting Wang, Rui Chen, Zhilong Zhou, Dongbo Shan

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:08:19Z

**Summary**: Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models (LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis, that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over 10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.

### Towards the Next Generation of Software: Insights from Grey Literature   on AI-Native Applications
**Authors**: Lingli Cao, Shanshan Li, Ying Fan, Danyang Li, Chenxing Zhong

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T15:01:23Z

**Summary**: Background: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has given rise to AI-native applications, a new paradigm in software engineering that fundamentally redefines how software is designed, developed, and evolved. Despite their growing prominence, AI-native applications still lack a unified engineering definition and architectural blueprint, leaving practitioners without systematic guidance for system design, quality assurance, and technology selection.   Objective: This study seeks to establish a comprehensive understanding of AI-native applications by identifying their defining characteristics, key quality attributes, and typical technology stacks, as well as by clarifying the opportunities and challenges they present.   Method: We conducted a grey literature review, integrating conceptual perspectives retrieved from targeted Google and Bing searches with practical insights derived from leading open-source projects on GitHub. A structured protocol encompassing source selection, quality assessment, and thematic analysis was applied to synthesize findings across heterogeneous sources.   Results: We finally identified 106 studies based on the selection criteria. The analysis reveals that AI-native applications are distinguished by two core pillars: the central role of AI as the system's intelligence paradigm and their inherently probabilistic, non-deterministic nature. Critical quality attributes include reliability, usability, performance efficiency, and AI-specific observability. In addition, a typical technology stack has begun to emerge, comprising LLM orchestration frameworks, vector databases, and AI-native observability platforms. These systems emphasize response quality, cost-effectiveness, and outcome predictability, setting them apart from conventional software systems.   Conclusion: This study is the first to propose a dual-layered engineering blueprint...

### Agentic AI for Financial Crime Compliance
**Authors**: Henrik Axelsen, Valdemar Licht, Jan Damsgaard

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T14:53:51Z

**Summary**: The cost and complexity of financial crime compliance (FCC) continue to rise, often without measurable improvements in effectiveness. While AI offers potential, most solutions remain opaque and poorly aligned with regulatory expectations. This paper presents the design and deployment of an agentic AI system for FCC in digitally native financial platforms. Developed through an Action Design Research (ADR) process with a fintech firm and regulatory stakeholders, the system automates onboarding, monitoring, investigation, and reporting, emphasizing explainability, traceability, and compliance-by-design. Using artifact-centric modeling, it assigns clearly bounded roles to autonomous agents and enables task-specific model routing and audit logging. The contribution includes a reference architecture, a real-world prototype, and insights into how Agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory constraints. Our findings extend IS literature on AI-enabled compliance by demonstrating how automation, when embedded within accountable governance structures, can support transparency and institutional trust in high-stakes, regulated environments.

### Reasoning with Preference Constraints: A Benchmark for Language Models   in Many-to-One Matching Markets
**Authors**: Marylou Fauchard, Florian Carichon, Margarida Carvalho, Golnoosh Farnadi

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T14:48:46Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However, applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem, a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs, like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought, In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial optimization problems with preferential constraints.

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T14:40:49Z

**Summary**: We propose an O(100)m Atom Interferometer (AI) experiment -- AICE -- to be installed against a wall of the PX46 access shaft to the LHC. This experiment would probe unexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for gravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which existing and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics studies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the AICE detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a uniquely promising location for an AI experiment. We foresee that, if the CERN management encourages this Letter of Intent, a significant fraction of the Terrestrial Very Long Baseline Atom Interferometer (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration may wish to contribute to AICE.

### Empowering LLMs with Parameterized Skills for Adversarial Long-Horizon   Planning
**Authors**: Sijia Cui, Shuai Xu, Aiyao He, Yanna Wang, Bo Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T14:36:30Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to the development of LLM-based AI agents. A key challenge is the creation of agents that can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon environments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to interact with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions, and (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to stimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable actions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate high-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges, we introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning framework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon environments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill library containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill planner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized skills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a long-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and challenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting outperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully crafted few-shot examples, surpasses the top-tier scripted agent, CoacAI. Additionally, we design comprehensive evaluation metrics and test 6 closed-source and 2 open-source LLMs within the PLAP framework, ultimately releasing an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability. Our code is available at https://github.com/AI-Research-TeamX/PLAP.

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T14:24:05Z

**Summary**: Recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate multilingual abilities, yet they are English-centric due to dominance of English in training corpora. The limited resource for low-resource languages remains a crucial challenge. Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate between languages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuances that can be otherwise lost in translation and elicits language-specific knowledge in human communications. In light of this, we investigate whether code-switching can activate, or identify and leverage knowledge for reasoning when LLMs solve low-resource language tasks. To facilitate the research, we first present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset. We provide comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs by subdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledge leveraging. Our results demonstrate that compared to English text, CS can faithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs especially on language-specific domains, suggesting the potential of code-switching on low-resource language tasks.

**Authors**: Santiago Matalonga, Domenico Amalfitano, Jean Carlo Rossa Hauck, Martín Solari, Guilherme H. Travassos

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T14:01:44Z

**Summary**: Background: Conducting Multi Vocal Literature Reviews (MVLRs) is often time and effort-intensive. Researchers must review and filter a large number of unstructured sources, which frequently contain sparse information and are unlikely to be included in the final study. Our experience conducting an MVLR on Context-Aware Software Systems (CASS) Testing in the avionics domain exemplified this challenge, with over 8,000 highly heterogeneous documents requiring review. Therefore, we developed a Large Language Model (LLM) assistant to support the search and filtering of documents. Aims: To develop and validate an LLM based tool that can support researchers in performing the search and filtering of documents for an MVLR without compromising the rigor of the research protocol. Method: We applied sound engineering practices to develop an on-premises LLM-based tool incorporating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to process candidate sources. Progress towards the aim was quantified using the Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) as the primary metric to ensure the performance of the LLM based tool. Convenience sampling, supported by human judgment and statistical sampling, were used to verify and validate the tool's quality-in-use. Results: The tool currently demonstrates a PPA agreement with human researchers of 90% for sources that are not relevant to the study. Development details are shared to support domain-specific adaptation of the tool. Conclusions: Using LLM-based tools to support academic researchers in rigorous MVLR is feasible. These tools can free valuable time for higher-level, abstract tasks. However, researcher participation remains essential to ensure that the tool supports thorough research.

### Online Learning Based Efficient Resource Allocation for LoRaWAN Network
**Authors**: Ruiqi Wang, Wenjun Li, Jing Ren, Tongyu Song, Xiong Wang, Sheng Wang, Shizhong Xu

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:58:52Z

**Summary**: The deployment of large-scale LoRaWAN networks requires jointly optimizing conflicting metrics like Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and Energy Efficiency (EE) by dynamically allocating transmission parameters, including Carrier Frequency, Spreading Factor, and Transmission Power. Existing methods often oversimplify this challenge, focusing on a single metric or lacking the adaptability needed for dynamic channel environments, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose two online learning-based resource allocation frameworks that intelligently navigate the PDR-EE trade-off. Our foundational proposal, D-LoRa, is a fully distributed framework that models the problem as a Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit. By decomposing the joint parameter selection and employing specialized, disaggregated reward functions, D-LoRa dramatically reduces learning complexity and enables nodes to autonomously adapt to network dynamics. To further enhance performance in LoRaWAN networks, we introduce CD-LoRa, a hybrid framework that integrates a lightweight, centralized initialization phase to perform a one-time, quasi-optimal channel assignment and action space pruning, thereby accelerating subsequent distributed learning. Extensive simulations and real-world field experiments demonstrate the superiority of our frameworks, showing that D-LoRa excels in non-stationary environments while CD-LoRa achieves the fastest convergence in stationary conditions. In physical deployments, our methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines, improving PDR by up to 10.8% and EE by 26.1%, confirming their practical effectiveness for scalable and efficient LoRaWAN networks.

### Counterfactual Simulatability of LLM Explanations for Generation Tasks
**Authors**: Marvin Limpijankit, Yanda Chen, Melanie Subbiah, Nicholas Deas, Kathleen McKeown

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:55:55Z

**Summary**: LLMs can be unpredictable, as even slight alterations to the prompt can cause the output to change in unexpected ways. Thus, the ability of models to accurately explain their behavior is critical, especially in high-stakes settings. One approach for evaluating explanations is counterfactual simulatability, how well an explanation allows users to infer the model's output on related counterfactuals. Counterfactual simulatability has been previously studied for yes/no question answering tasks. We provide a general framework for extending this method to generation tasks, using news summarization and medical suggestion as example use cases. We find that while LLM explanations do enable users to better predict LLM outputs on counterfactuals in the summarization setting, there is significant room for improvement for medical suggestion. Furthermore, our results suggest that the evaluation for counterfactual simulatability may be more appropriate for skill-based tasks as opposed to knowledge-based tasks.

### Shaping Explanations: Semantic Reward Modeling with Encoder-Only   Transformers for GRPO
**Authors**: Francesco Pappone, Ruggero Marino Lazzaroni, Federico Califano, Niccolò Gentile, Roberto Marras

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:39:29Z

**Summary**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like text, aligning their outputs with complex, qualitative goals like pedagogical soundness remains a significant challenge. Standard reinforcement learning techniques often rely on slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or on brittle, keyword-based metrics like ROUGE, which fail to capture the semantic essence of a high-quality explanation. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to reward shaping within the Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) framework. Our central contribution is the use of a small, efficient encoder-only transformer as a semantic reward model. This model provides a dense, semantically rich reward signal based on the cosine similarity between a generated explanation and a ground-truth reference, guiding the policy towards explanations that are not just factually correct but also structurally and conceptually aligned with expert reasoning. We apply this method to the task of training a model for the Italian medical-school entrance examinations, following standard domain-adaptive continued pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our results demonstrate that GRPO with our proposed semantic reward significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over a strong SFT baseline, showcasing the power of using lightweight encoder models for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks

**Authors**: Ekaterina Taktasheva, Jeff Dalton

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:36:33Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in tool-augmented large language models have enabled them to interact with external tools, enhancing their ability to perform complex user tasks. However, existing approaches overlook the role of personalisation in guiding tool use. This work investigates how user preferences can be effectively integrated into goal-oriented dialogue agents. Through extensive analysis, we identify key weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to personalise tool use. To this end, we introduce TAPS, a novel solution that enhances personalised tool use by leveraging a structured tagging tool and an uncertainty-based tool detector. TAPS significantly improves the ability of LLMs to incorporate user preferences, achieving the new state-of-the-art for open source models on the NLSI task.

### Context-Aware Membership Inference Attacks against Pre-trained Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Hongyan Chang, Ali Shahin Shamsabadi, Kleomenis Katevas, Hamed Haddadi, Reza Shokri

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:30:05Z

**Summary**: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) aim at determining if a data point was part of the model's training set. Prior MIAs that are built for classification models fail at LLMs, due to ignoring the generative nature of LLMs across token sequences. In this paper, we present a novel attack on pre-trained LLMs that adapts MIA statistical tests to the perplexity dynamics of subsequences within a data point. Our method significantly outperforms prior approaches, revealing context-dependent memorization patterns in pre-trained LLMs.

### EIFBENCH: Extremely Complex Instruction Following Benchmark for Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Tao Zou, Xinghua Zhang, Haiyang Yu, Minzheng Wang, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:19:41Z

**Summary**: With the development and widespread application of large language models (LLMs), the new paradigm of "Model as Product" is rapidly evolving, and demands higher capabilities to address complex user needs, often requiring precise workflow execution which involves the accurate understanding of multiple tasks. However, existing benchmarks focusing on single-task environments with limited constraints lack the complexity required to fully reflect real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present the Extremely Complex Instruction Following Benchmark (EIFBENCH), meticulously crafted to facilitate a more realistic and robust evaluation of LLMs. EIFBENCH not only includes multi-task scenarios that enable comprehensive assessment across diverse task types concurrently, but also integrates a variety of constraints, replicating complex operational environments. Furthermore, we propose the Segment Policy Optimization (SegPO) algorithm to enhance the LLM's ability to accurately fulfill multi-task workflow. Evaluations on EIFBENCH have unveiled considerable performance discrepancies in existing LLMs when challenged with these extremely complex instructions. This finding underscores the necessity for ongoing optimization to navigate the intricate challenges posed by LLM applications.

### Automating Code Generation for Semiconductor Equipment Control from   Developer Utterances with LLMs
**Authors**: Youngkyoung Kim, Sanghyeok Park, Misoo Kim, Gangho Yoon, Eunseok Lee, Simon S. Woo

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:12:11Z

**Summary**: Semiconductors form the backbone of modern electronics, with their manufacturing and testing relying on highly specialized equipment and domain-specific programming languages. Equipment languages such as the Algorithmic Pattern Generator (ALPG) are critical for precise hardware control but are challenging to program due to their low-level syntax and steep learning curve. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level code from natural language, their effectiveness on low-level equipment languages remains limited. To address this, we propose Progressive Knowledge Enhancement (PKE), a novel multi-stage prompting framework that progressively extracts and activates the latent knowledge within LLMs, guiding them from simple to complex examples without extensive fine-tuning. Empirical evaluation on an industrial ALPG dataset shows that PKE significantly outperforms standard prompting and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generating correct ALPG code, achieving 11.1\% and 15.2\% higher exact match scores compared to the second-best technique. Further analysis of individual components confirms that progressive knowledge extraction based on difficulty enhances accuracy. Our study offer a practical approach to boosting LLM capabilities for specialized low-level programming, supporting greater productivity in semiconductor software development.

### CredID: Credible Multi-Bit Watermark for Large Language Models   Identification
**Authors**: Haoyu Jiang, Xuhong Wang, Ping Yi, Shanzhe Lei, Yilun Lin

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:11:17Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in complex natural language processing tasks but raise privacy and security concerns due to the lack of identity recognition. This paper proposes a multi-party credible watermarking framework (CredID) involving a trusted third party (TTP) and multiple LLM vendors to address these issues. In the watermark embedding stage, vendors request a seed from the TTP to generate watermarked text without sending the user's prompt. In the extraction stage, the TTP coordinates each vendor to extract and verify the watermark from the text. This provides a credible watermarking scheme while preserving vendor privacy. Furthermore, current watermarking algorithms struggle with text quality, information capacity, and robustness, making it challenging to meet the diverse identification needs of LLMs. Thus, we propose a novel multi-bit watermarking algorithm and an open-source toolkit to facilitate research. Experiments show our CredID enhances watermark credibility and efficiency without compromising text quality. Additionally, we successfully utilized this framework to achieve highly accurate identification among multiple LLM vendors.

### Break the Checkbox: Challenging Closed-Style Evaluations of Cultural   Alignment in LLMs
**Authors**: Mohsinul Kabir, Ajwad Abrar, Sophia Ananiadou

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:10:21Z

**Summary**: A large number of studies rely on closed-style multiple-choice surveys to evaluate cultural alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we challenge this constrained evaluation paradigm and explore more realistic, unconstrained approaches. Using the World Values Survey (WVS) and Hofstede Cultural Dimensions as case studies, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit stronger cultural alignment in less constrained settings, where responses are not forced. Additionally, we show that even minor changes, such as reordering survey choices, lead to inconsistent outputs, exposing the limitations of closed-style evaluations. Our findings advocate for more robust and flexible evaluation frameworks that focus on specific cultural proxies, encouraging more nuanced and accurate assessments of cultural alignment in LLMs.

### From Understanding to Generation: An Efficient Shortcut for Evaluating   Language Models
**Authors**: Viktor Hangya, Fabian Küch, Darina Gold

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:10:04Z

**Summary**: Iterative evaluation of LLMs during training is essential to ensure expected capability development, but can be time- and compute-intensive. While NLU tasks, where the model selects from fixed answer choices, are cheap to evaluate, essential capabilities like reasoning and code generation rely on the more time-consuming NLG (token-by-token generation) format. In this work, our aim is to decrease the computational burden of NLG benchmarks in order to enable monitoring crucial LLM capabilities during model training. We reformulate generative tasks into computationally cheaper NLU alternatives. We test the performance correlation between the original and reformulated tasks using 8 LMs of various sizes and 4 capabilities: mathematical reasoning, code generation, factual knowledge and reading comprehension. Our results show a strong correlation between task formats, supporting capability assessment via cheaper alternatives and achieving over 35x average reduction in evaluation time.

### Spiking Vocos: An Energy-Efficient Neural Vocoder
**Authors**: Yukun Chen, Zhaoxi Mu, Andong Li, Peilin Li, Xinyu Yang

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:09:13Z

**Summary**: Despite the remarkable progress in the synthesis speed and fidelity of neural vocoders, their high energy consumption remains a critical barrier to practical deployment on computationally restricted edge devices. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), widely recognized for their high energy efficiency due to their event-driven nature, offer a promising solution for low-resource scenarios. In this paper, we propose Spiking Vocos, a novel spiking neural vocoder with ultra-low energy consumption, built upon the efficient Vocos framework. To mitigate the inherent information bottleneck in SNNs, we design a Spiking ConvNeXt module to reduce Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations and incorporate an amplitude shortcut path to preserve crucial signal dynamics. Furthermore, to bridge the performance gap with its Artificial Neural Network (ANN) counterpart, we introduce a self-architectural distillation strategy to effectively transfer knowledge. A lightweight Temporal Shift Module is also integrated to enhance the model's ability to fuse information across the temporal dimension with negligible computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to its ANN counterpart, with UTMOS and PESQ scores of 3.74 and 3.45 respectively, while consuming only 14.7% of the energy. The source code is available at https://github.com/pymaster17/Spiking-Vocos.

### Multi-Model Synthetic Training for Mission-Critical Small Language   Models
**Authors**: Nolan Platt, Pragyansmita Nayak

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T13:04:48Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many domains, yet their application to specialized fields remains constrained by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data. We present a novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference. Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves 75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models -- when fine tuned properly -- can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is infeasible. Beyond expanding research in the growing field of specialized small language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety, security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various industries.

### Reading Between the Prompts: How Stereotypes Shape LLM's Implicit   Personalization
**Authors**: Vera Neplenbroek, Arianna Bisazza, Raquel Fernández

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:56:24Z

**Summary**: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) infer user's demographic information from subtle cues in the conversation -- a phenomenon called implicit personalization. Prior work has shown that such inferences can lead to lower quality responses for users assumed to be from minority groups, even when no demographic information is explicitly provided. In this work, we systematically explore how LLMs respond to stereotypical cues using controlled synthetic conversations, by analyzing the models' latent user representations through both model internals and generated answers to targeted user questions. Our findings reveal that LLMs do infer demographic attributes based on these stereotypical signals, which for a number of groups even persists when the user explicitly identifies with a different demographic group. Finally, we show that this form of stereotype-driven implicit personalization can be effectively mitigated by intervening on the model's internal representations using a trained linear probe to steer them toward the explicitly stated identity. Our results highlight the need for greater transparency and control in how LLMs represent user identity.

### Perception Before Reasoning: Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning for Visual   Reasoning in Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Yan Chen, Long Li, Teng Xi, Long Zeng, Jingdong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:51:11Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance. However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

This paper surveys both the current state of GView with its published papers alongside those that are in the publishing process. It also includes its innovative use of logical inference through predicates and inference rules for both the analyzed documents and the user's actions for better suggestions. We highlight the extensible architecture, showcasing its potential as a bridge between the practical forensics worlds with the academic research.

### DVDP: An End-to-End Policy for Mobile Robot Visual Docking with RGB-D   Perception
**Authors**: Haohan Min, Zhoujian Li, Yu Yang, Jinyu Chen, Shenghai Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:46:22Z

**Summary**: Automatic docking has long been a significant challenge in the field of mobile robotics. Compared to other automatic docking methods, visual docking methods offer higher precision and lower deployment costs, making them an efficient and promising choice for this task. However, visual docking methods impose strict requirements on the robot's initial position at the start of the docking process. To overcome the limitations of current vision-based methods, we propose an innovative end-to-end visual docking method named DVDP(direct visual docking policy). This approach requires only a binocular RGB-D camera installed on the mobile robot to directly output the robot's docking path, achieving end-to-end automatic docking. Furthermore, we have collected a large-scale dataset of mobile robot visual automatic docking dataset through a combination of virtual and real environments using the Unity 3D platform and actual mobile robot setups. We developed a series of evaluation metrics to quantify the performance of the end-to-end visual docking method. Extensive experiments, including benchmarks against leading perception backbones adapted into our framework, demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance. Finally, real-world deployment on the SCOUT Mini confirmed DVDP's efficacy, with our model generating smooth, feasible docking trajectories that meet physical constraints and reach the target pose.

### Validating Solidity Code Defects using Symbolic and Concrete Execution   powered by Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ştefan-Claudiu Susan, Andrei Arusoaie, Dorel Lucanu

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:46:11Z

**Summary**: The high rate of false alarms from static analysis tools and Large Language Models (LLMs) complicates vulnerability detection in Solidity Smart Contracts, demanding methods that can formally or empirically prove the presence of defects. This paper introduces a novel detection pipeline that integrates custom Slither-based detectors, LLMs, Kontrol, and Forge. Our approach is designed to reliably detect defects and generate proofs. We currently perform experiments with promising results for seven types of critical defects. We demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy by presenting our findings for three vulnerabilities -- Reentrancy, Complex Fallback, and Faulty Access Control Policies -- that are challenging for current verification solutions, which often generate false alarms or fail to detect them entirely. We highlight the potential of either symbolic or concrete execution in correctly classifying such code faults. By chaining these instruments, our method effectively validates true positives, significantly reducing the manual verification burden. Although we identify potential limitations, such as the inconsistency and the cost of LLMs, our findings establish a robust framework for combining heuristic analysis with formal verification to achieve more reliable and automated smart contract auditing.

**Authors**: Phung Duc Luong, Le Tran Gia Bao, Nguyen Vu Khai Tam, Dong Huu Nguyen Khoa, Nguyen Huu Quyen, Van-Hau Pham, Phan The Duy

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:45:45Z

**Summary**: This work introduces xOffense, an AI-driven, multi-agent penetration testing framework that shifts the process from labor-intensive, expert-driven manual efforts to fully automated, machine-executable workflows capable of scaling seamlessly with computational infrastructure. At its core, xOffense leverages a fine-tuned, mid-scale open-source LLM (Qwen3-32B) to drive reasoning and decision-making in penetration testing. The framework assigns specialized agents to reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation, with an orchestration layer ensuring seamless coordination across phases. Fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought penetration testing data further enables the model to generate precise tool commands and perform consistent multi-step reasoning. We evaluate xOffense on two rigorous benchmarks: AutoPenBench and AI-Pentest-Benchmark. The results demonstrate that xOffense consistently outperforms contemporary methods, achieving a sub-task completion rate of 79.17%, decisively surpassing leading systems such as VulnBot and PentestGPT. These findings highlight the potential of domain-adapted mid-scale LLMs, when embedded within structured multi-agent orchestration, to deliver superior, cost-efficient, and reproducible solutions for autonomous penetration testing.

### HiChunk: Evaluating and Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with   Hierarchical Chunking
**Authors**: Wensheng Lu, Keyu Chen, Ruizhi Qiao, Xing Sun

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:36:35Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the response capabilities of language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, document chunking as an important part of RAG system often lacks effective evaluation tools. This paper first analyzes why existing RAG evaluation benchmarks are inadequate for assessing document chunking quality, specifically due to evidence sparsity. Based on this conclusion, we propose HiCBench, which includes manually annotated multi-level document chunking points, synthesized evidence-dense quetion answer(QA) pairs, and their corresponding evidence sources. Additionally, we introduce the HiChunk framework, a multi-level document structuring framework based on fine-tuned LLMs, combined with the Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm to improve retrieval quality. Experiments demonstrate that HiCBench effectively evaluates the impact of different chunking methods across the entire RAG pipeline. Moreover, HiChunk achieves better chunking quality within reasonable time consumption, thereby enhancing the overall performance of RAG systems.

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the simulation of agent societies, enabling autonomous planning, memory formation, and social interactions. However, existing frameworks often overlook systematic evaluations for event organization and lack visualized integration with physically grounded environments, limiting agents' ability to navigate spaces and interact with items realistically. We develop MiniAgentPro, a visualization platform featuring an intuitive map editor for customizing environments and a simulation player with smooth animations. Based on this tool, we introduce a comprehensive test set comprising eight diverse event scenarios with basic and hard variants to assess agents' ability. Evaluations using GPT-4o demonstrate strong performance in basic settings but highlight coordination challenges in hard variants.

**Authors**: Zhiqiang Yuan, Weitong Chen, Hanlin Wang, Kai Yu, Xin Peng, Yiling Lou

**Summary**: Code translation converts code from one programming language to another while maintaining its original functionality, which is crucial for software migration, system refactoring, and cross-platform development. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming and often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based methods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for automated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising, LLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax errors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to self-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error messages.   In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT, which enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and semantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including Initial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error Fixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block in the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and source program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the fixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark from recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On our benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation technique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency; additionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of TRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent.

### ByDeWay: Boost Your multimodal LLM with DEpth prompting in a   Training-Free Way
**Authors**: Rajarshi Roy, Devleena Das, Ankesh Banerjee, Arjya Bhattacharjee, Kousik Dasgupta, Subarna Tripathi

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:31:06Z

**Summary**: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

### Joint Transmit and Pinching Beamforming Design for Pinching   Antenna-assisted Symbiotic Radio
**Authors**: Ze Wang, Guoping Zhang, Hongbo Xu, Wei Liu, Ming Zeng, Fang Fang, Dusit Niyato

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:23:45Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates a novel downlink symbiotic radio framework enabled by the pinching antenna system (PASS), designed to enhance both primary and secondary transmissions through reconfigurable antenna positioning. This reconfigurability introduces additional degrees of freedom for adaptive pinching beamforming, thereby enabling constructive signal enhancement and interference suppression tailored to the locations of the backscatter device, the Internet of Things (IoT) receiver, and the primary receivers. To fully exploit these benefits, we formulate a joint transmit and pinching beamforming optimization problem that maximizes the achievable sum rate while satisfying the IoT receiver's detection error probability constraint and feasible deployment constraints for the pinching antennas. The resulting problem is inherently nonconvex and highly coupled. To address this challenge, we develop two complementary solution approaches. The first is a learning-aided gradient descent method, where the constrained optimization is reformulated into a differentiable form and solved through end-to-end learning. In this approach, the pinching antenna position matrix is reparameterized to automatically satisfy minimum spacing constraints, while transmit power and waveguide length limits are enforced via projection and normalization. The second approach is an optimization-based successive convex approximation-particle swarm optimization method, which first determines the transmit beamforming solution using successive convex approximation and subsequently optimizes pinching beamforming via a particle swarm optimization search over candidate pinching antenna placements.

### TokenSkip: Controllable Chain-of-Thought Compression in LLMs
**Authors**: Heming Xia, Chak Tou Leong, Wenjie Wang, Yongqi Li, Wenjie Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:21:22Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been proven effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recent advancements, such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, suggest that scaling up the length of CoT sequences during inference could further boost LLM reasoning performance. However, due to the autoregressive nature of LLM decoding, longer CoT outputs lead to a linear increase in inference latency, adversely affecting user experience, particularly when the CoT exceeds 10,000 tokens. To address this limitation, we analyze the semantic importance of tokens within CoT outputs and reveal that their contributions to reasoning vary. Building on this insight, we propose TokenSkip, a simple yet effective approach that enables LLMs to selectively skip less important tokens, allowing for controllable CoT compression. Extensive experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSkip in reducing CoT token usage while preserving strong reasoning performance. Notably, when applied to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, TokenSkip reduces reasoning tokens by 40% (from 313 to 181) on GSM8K, with less than a 0.4% performance drop. We release our code and checkpoints in https://github.com/hemingkx/TokenSkip.

### Drone Detection Using a Low-Power Neuromorphic Virtual Tripwire
**Authors**: Anton Eldeborg Lundin, Rasmus Winzell, Hanna Hamrell, David Gustafsson, Hannes Ovrén

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:08:03Z

**Summary**: Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras (event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations that lack power infrastructure.

### SitLLM: Large Language Models for Sitting Posture Health Understanding   via Pressure Sensor Data
**Authors**: Jian Gao, Fufangchen Zhao, Yiyang Zhang, Danfeng Yan

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:06:05Z

**Summary**: Poor sitting posture is a critical yet often overlooked factor contributing to long-term musculoskeletal disorders and physiological dysfunctions. Existing sitting posture monitoring systems, although leveraging visual, IMU, or pressure-based modalities, often suffer from coarse-grained recognition and lack the semantic expressiveness necessary for personalized feedback. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SitLLM}, a lightweight multimodal framework that integrates flexible pressure sensing with large language models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained posture understanding and personalized health-oriented response generation. SitLLM comprises three key components: (1) a \textit{Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding Module} that partitions pressure maps into spatial patches and injects local noise perturbations for robust feature extraction; (2) a \textit{Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment Module} that reprograms sensor embeddings into the LLM's semantic space via multi-head cross-attention using the pre-trained vocabulary embeddings; and (3) a \textit{Multi-Context Prompt Module} that fuses feature-level, structure-level, statistical-level, and semantic-level contextual information to guide instruction comprehension.

### HPIM: Heterogeneous Processing-In-Memory-based Accelerator for Large   Language Models Inference
**Authors**: Cenlin Duan, Jianlei Yang, Rubing Yang, Yikun Wang, Yiou Wang, Lingkun Long, Yingjie Qi, Xiaolin He, Ao Zhou, Xueyan Wang, Weisheng Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T12:04:00Z

**Summary**: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) presents significant challenges due to their enormous memory footprints, low arithmetic intensity, and stringent latency requirements, particularly during the autoregressive decoding stage. Traditional compute-centric accelerators, such as GPUs, suffer from severe resource underutilization and memory bandwidth bottlenecks in these memory-bound workloads. To overcome these fundamental limitations, we propose HPIM, the first memory-centric heterogeneous Processing-In-Memory (PIM) accelerator that integrates SRAM-PIM and HBM-PIM subsystems designed specifically for LLM inference. HPIM employs a software-hardware co-design approach that combines a specialized compiler framework with a heterogeneous hardware architecture. It intelligently partitions workloads based on their characteristics: latency-critical attention operations are mapped to the SRAM-PIM subsystem to exploit its ultra-low latency and high computational flexibility, while weight-intensive GEMV computations are assigned to the HBM-PIM subsystem to leverage its high internal bandwidth and large storage capacity. Furthermore, HPIM introduces a tightly coupled pipeline strategy across SRAM-PIM and HBM-PIM subsystems to maximize intra-token parallelism, thereby significantly mitigating serial dependency of the autoregressive decoding stage. Comprehensive evaluations using a cycle-accurate simulator demonstrate that HPIM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art accelerators, achieving a peak speedup of up to 22.8x compared to the NVIDIA A100 GPU. Moreover, HPIM exhibits superior performance over contemporary PIM-based accelerators, highlighting its potential as a highly practical and scalable solution for accelerating large-scale LLM inference.

### From Surveys to Narratives: Rethinking Cultural Value Adaptation in LLMs
**Authors**: Muhammad Farid Adilazuarda, Chen Cecilia Liu, Iryna Gurevych, Alham Fikri Aji

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T11:55:23Z

**Summary**: Adapting cultural values in Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant challenges, particularly due to biases and limited training data. Prior work primarily aligns LLMs with different cultural values using World Values Survey (WVS) data. However, it remains unclear whether this approach effectively captures cultural nuances or produces distinct cultural representations for various downstream tasks. In this paper, we systematically investigate WVS-based training for cultural value adaptation and find that relying solely on survey data can homogenize cultural norms and interfere with factual knowledge. To investigate these issues, we augment WVS with encyclopedic and scenario-based cultural narratives from Wikipedia and NormAd. While these narratives may have variable effects on downstream tasks, they consistently improve cultural distinctiveness than survey data alone. Our work highlights the inherent complexity of aligning cultural values with the goal of guiding task-specific behavior. We release our code at https://github.com/faridlazuarda/from-surveys-to-narratives.

### Toward PDDL Planning Copilot
**Authors**: Yarin Benyamin, Argaman Mordoch, Shahaf S. Shperberg, Roni Stern

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T11:51:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.

### SlumpGuard: An AI-Powered Real-Time System for Automated Concrete Slump   Prediction via Video Analysis
**Authors**: Youngmin Kim, Giyeong Oh, Kwangsoo Youm, Youngjae Yu

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T11:49:30Z

**Summary**: Concrete workability is essential for construction quality, with the slump test being the most common on-site method for its assessment. However, traditional slump testing is manual, time-consuming, and prone to inconsistency, limiting its applicability for real-time monitoring. To address these challenges, we propose SlumpGuard, an AI-powered, video-based system that automatically analyzes concrete flow from the truck chute to assess workability in real time. Our system enables full-batch inspection without manual intervention, improving both the accuracy and efficiency of quality control. We present the system design, the construction of a dedicated dataset, and empirical results from real-world deployment, demonstrating the effectiveness of SlumpGuard as a practical solution for modern concrete quality assurance.

### Evaluating Large Language Models for Code Translation: Effects of Prompt   Language and Prompt Design
**Authors**: Aamer Aljagthami, Mohammed Banabila, Musab Alshehri, Mohammed Kabini, Mohammad D. Alahmadi

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T11:30:10Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for automated source-code translation, a capability critical to software migration, maintenance, and interoperability. Yet comparative evidence on how model choice, prompt design, and prompt language shape translation quality across multiple programming languages remains limited. This study conducts a systematic empirical assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs for code translation among C++, Java, Python, and C#, alongside a traditional baseline (TransCoder). Using BLEU and CodeBLEU, we quantify syntactic fidelity and structural correctness under two prompt styles (concise instruction and detailed specification) and two prompt languages (English and Arabic), with direction-aware evaluation across language pairs. Experiments show that detailed prompts deliver consistent gains across models and translation directions, and English prompts outperform Arabic by 13-15%. The top-performing model attains the highest CodeBLEU on challenging pairs such as Java to C# and Python to C++. Our evaluation shows that each LLM outperforms TransCoder across the benchmark. These results demonstrate the value of careful prompt engineering and prompt language choice, and provide practical guidance for software modernization and cross-language interoperability.

### How Much Do LLMs Hallucinate across Languages? On Multilingual   Estimation of LLM Hallucination in the Wild
**Authors**: Saad Obaid ul Islam, Anne Lauscher, Goran Glavaš

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T11:12:12Z

**Summary**: In the age of misinformation, hallucination -- the tendency of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate non-factual or unfaithful responses -- represents the main risk for their global utility. Despite LLMs becoming increasingly multilingual, the vast majority of research on detecting and quantifying LLM hallucination are (a) English-centric and (b) focus on machine translation (MT) and summarization, tasks that are less common ``in the wild'' than open information seeking. In contrast, we aim to quantify the extent of LLM hallucination across languages in knowledge-intensive long-form question answering. To this end, we train a multilingual hallucination detection model and conduct a large-scale study across 30 languages and 6 open-source LLM families. We start from an English hallucination detection dataset and rely on MT to generate (noisy) training data in other languages. We also manually annotate gold data for five high-resource languages; we then demonstrate, for these languages, that the estimates of hallucination rates are similar between silver (LLM-generated) and gold test sets, validating the use of silver data for estimating hallucination rates for other languages. For the final rates estimation, we build a knowledge-intensive QA dataset for 30 languages with LLM-generated prompts and Wikipedia articles as references. We find that, while LLMs generate longer responses with more hallucinated tokens for higher-resource languages, there is no correlation between length-normalized hallucination rates of languages and their digital representation. Further, we find that smaller LLMs exhibit larger hallucination rates than larger models.

### Do LLMs Understand Wine Descriptors Across Cultures? A Benchmark for   Cultural Adaptations of Wine Reviews
**Authors**: Chenye Zou, Xingyue Wen, Tianyi Hu, Qian Janice Wang, Daniel Hershcovich

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T11:10:30Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to culture-aware language tasks. We introduce the novel problem of adapting wine reviews across Chinese and English, which goes beyond literal translation by incorporating regional taste preferences and culture-specific flavor descriptors. In a case study on cross-cultural wine review adaptation, we compile the first parallel corpus of professional reviews, containing 8k Chinese and 16k Anglophone reviews. We benchmark both neural-machine-translation baselines and state-of-the-art LLMs with automatic metrics and human evaluation. For the latter, we propose three culture-oriented criteria -- Cultural Proximity, Cultural Neutrality, and Cultural Genuineness -- to assess how naturally a translated review resonates with target-culture readers. Our analysis shows that current models struggle to capture cultural nuances, especially in translating wine descriptions across different cultures. This highlights the challenges and limitations of translation models in handling cultural content.

### Investigating ReLoRA: Effects on the Learning Dynamics of Small Language   Models
**Authors**: Yuval Weiss, David Demitri Africa, Paula Buttery, Richard Diehl Martinez

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T11:06:58Z

**Summary**: Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA have revolutionised the fine-tuning of LLMs. Still, their extension to pretraining via ReLoRA is less well understood, especially for small language models (SLMs), which offer lower computational and environmental costs. This work is the first systematic study of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and learning dynamics. Through ablation experiments, we find that ReLoRA generally performs worse than standard training on loss, Paloma perplexity and BLiMP, with the gap widening for the larger models. Further analysis of the learning dynamics of the models indicates that ReLoRA reinforces the rank deficiencies found in smaller models. These results indicate that low-rank update strategies may not transfer easily to SLM pretraining, highlighting the need for more research in the low-compute regime.

### Forget What's Sensitive, Remember What Matters: Token-Level Differential   Privacy in Memory Sculpting for Continual Learning
**Authors**: Bihao Zhan, Jie Zhou, Junsong Li, Yutao Yang, Shilian Chen, Qianjun Pan, Xin Li, Wen Wu, Xingjiao Wu, Qin Chen, Hang Yan, Liang He

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T11:01:59Z

**Summary**: Continual Learning (CL) models, while adept at sequential knowledge acquisition, face significant and often overlooked privacy challenges due to accumulating diverse information. Traditional privacy methods, like a uniform Differential Privacy (DP) budget, indiscriminately protect all data, leading to substantial model utility degradation and hindering CL deployment in privacy-sensitive areas. To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced continual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers what matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential Privacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the semantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for private entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general knowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This module leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to intelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and parameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that PeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility, outperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks while ensuring robust privacy.

### Black-box Model Merging for Language-Model-as-a-Service with Massive   Model Repositories
**Authors**: Shilian Chen, Jie Zhou, Tianyu Huai, Yujiang Lu, Junsong Li, Bihao Zhan, Qianjun Pan, Yutao Yang, Xin Li, Qin Chen, Hang Yan, Liang He

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:55:50Z

**Summary**: Model merging refers to the process of integrating multiple distinct models into a unified model that preserves and combines the strengths and capabilities of the individual models. Most existing approaches rely on task vectors to combine models, typically under the assumption that model parameters are accessible. However, for extremely large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, which are often provided solely as black-box services through API interfaces (Language-Model-as-a-Service), model weights are not available to end users. This presents a significant challenge, which we refer to as black-box model merging (BMM) with massive LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a derivative-free optimization framework based on the evolutionary algorithm (Evo-Merging) that enables effective model merging using only inference-time API queries. Our method consists of two key components: (1) sparsity-based denoising, designed to identify and filter out irrelevant or redundant information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling, which dynamically computes optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on their performance. We also provide a formal justification, along with a theoretical analysis, for our asymmetric sparsification. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines.

### First Practical Experiences Integrating Quantum Computers with HPC   Resources: A Case Study With a 20-qubit Superconducting Quantum Computer
**Authors**: Eric Mansfield, Stefan Seegerer, Panu Vesanen, Jorge Echavarria, Burak Mete, Muhammad Nufail Farooqi, Laura Schulz

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:53:57Z

**Summary**: Incorporating Quantum Computers into High Performance Computing (HPC) environments (commonly referred to as HPC+QC integration) marks a pivotal step in advancing computational capabilities for scientific research. Here we report the integration of a superconducting 20-qubit quantum computer into the HPC infrastructure at Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ), one of the first practical implementations of its kind. This yielded four key lessons: (1) quantum computers have stricter facility requirements than classical systems, yet their deployment in HPC environments is feasible when preceded by a rigorous site survey to ensure compliance; (2) quantum computers are inherently dynamic systems that require regular recalibration that is automatic and controllable by the HPC scheduler; (3) redundant power and cooling infrastructure is essential; and (4) effective hands-on onboarding should be provided for both quantum experts and new users. The identified conclusions provide a roadmap to guide future HPC center integrations.

### Comprehend, Divide, and Conquer: Feature Subspace Exploration via   Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Weiliang Zhang, Xiaohan Huang, Yi Du, Ziyue Qiao, Qingqing Long, Zhen Meng, Yuanchun Zhou, Meng Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:52:32Z

**Summary**: Feature selection aims to preprocess the target dataset, find an optimal and most streamlined feature subset, and enhance the downstream machine learning task. Among filter, wrapper, and embedded-based approaches, the reinforcement learning (RL)-based subspace exploration strategy provides a novel objective optimization-directed perspective and promising performance. Nevertheless, even with improved performance, current reinforcement learning approaches face challenges similar to conventional methods when dealing with complex datasets. These challenges stem from the inefficient paradigm of using one agent per feature and the inherent complexities present in the datasets. This observation motivates us to investigate and address the above issue and propose a novel approach, namely HRLFS. Our methodology initially employs a Large Language Model (LLM)-based hybrid state extractor to capture each feature's mathematical and semantic characteristics. Based on this information, features are clustered, facilitating the construction of hierarchical agents for each cluster and sub-cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of our approach. Compared to contemporary or the one-feature-one-agent RL-based approaches, HRLFS improves the downstream ML performance with iterative feature subspace exploration while accelerating total run time by reducing the number of agents involved.

### Robust Decision-Making Via Free Energy Minimization
**Authors**: Allahkaram Shafiei, Hozefa Jesawada, Karl Friston, Giovanni Russo

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:43:40Z

**Summary**: Despite their groundbreaking performance, state-of-the-art autonomous agents can misbehave when training and environmental conditions become inconsistent, with minor mismatches leading to undesirable behaviors or even catastrophic failures. Robustness towards these training/environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge when deploying agents in the real world. Here, we introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model (DR-FREE) that instills this core property by design. It directly wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms via free energy minimization. By combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a novel resolution engine, DR-FREE returns a policy that is optimal-yet-robust against ambiguity. The policy has an explicit, soft-max, structure that reveals the mechanistic role of ambiguity on optimal decisions and requisite Bayesian belief updating. We evaluate DR-FREE on an experimental testbed involving real rovers navigating an ambiguous environment filled with obstacles. Across all the experiments, DR-FREE enables robots to successfully navigate towards their goal even when, in contrast, state-of-the-art free energy models fail. In short, DR-FREE can tackle scenarios that elude previous methods: this milestone may inspire both deployment in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest for a biologically plausible explanation of how natural agents -- with little or no training -- survive in capricious environments.

### Worst-Case Symbolic Constraints Analysis and Generalisation with Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Daniel Koh, Yannic Noller, Corina S. Pasareanu, Adrians Skapars, Youcheng Sun

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:35:33Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on coding tasks such as generation, completion and repair, but their ability to handle complex symbolic reasoning over code still remains underexplored. We introduce the task of worst-case symbolic constraints analysis, which requires inferring the symbolic constraints that characterise worst-case program executions; these constraints can be solved to obtain inputs that expose performance bottlenecks or denial-of-service vulnerabilities in software systems. We show that even state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) struggle when applied directly on this task. To address this challenge, we propose WARP, an innovative neurosymbolic approach that computes worst-case constraints on smaller concrete input sizes using existing program analysis tools, and then leverages LLMs to generalise these constraints to larger input sizes. Concretely, WARP comprises: (1) an incremental strategy for LLM-based worst-case reasoning, (2) a solver-aligned neurosymbolic framework that integrates reinforcement learning with SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solving, and (3) a curated dataset of symbolic constraints. Experimental results show that WARP consistently improves performance on worst-case constraint reasoning. Leveraging the curated constraint dataset, we use reinforcement learning to fine-tune a model, WARP-1.0-3B, which significantly outperforms size-matched and even larger baselines. These results demonstrate that incremental constraint reasoning enhances LLMs' ability to handle symbolic reasoning and highlight the potential for deeper integration between neural learning and formal methods in rigorous program analysis.

### Jailbreaking Large Language Models Through Content Concretization
**Authors**: Johan Wahréus, Ahmed Hussain, Panos Papadimitratos

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:34:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for task automation and content generation, yet their safety mechanisms remain vulnerable to circumvention through different jailbreaking techniques. In this paper, we introduce \textit{Content Concretization} (CC), a novel jailbreaking technique that iteratively transforms abstract malicious requests into concrete, executable implementations. CC is a two-stage process: first, generating initial LLM responses using lower-tier, less constrained safety filters models, then refining them through higher-tier models that process both the preliminary output and original prompt. We evaluate our technique using 350 cybersecurity-specific prompts, demonstrating substantial improvements in jailbreak Success Rates (SRs), increasing from 7\% (no refinements) to 62\% after three refinement iterations, while maintaining a cost of 7.5\textcent~per prompt. Comparative A/B testing across nine different LLM evaluators confirms that outputs from additional refinement steps are consistently rated as more malicious and technically superior. Moreover, manual code analysis reveals that generated outputs execute with minimal modification, although optimal deployment typically requires target-specific fine-tuning. With eventual improved harmful code generation, these results highlight critical vulnerabilities in current LLM safety frameworks.

### InferLog: Accelerating LLM Inference for Online Log Parsing via   ICL-oriented Prefix Caching
**Authors**: Yilun Wang, Pengfei Chen, Haiyu Huang, Zilong He, Gou Tan, Chuanfu Zhang, Jingkai He, Zibin Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:33:29Z

**Summary**: Modern software systems generate massive volumes of runtime logs, necessitating efficient and accurate log parsing to enable critical downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and root cause analysis. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system.   In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.

**Authors**: Denis Janiak, Julia Moska, Dawid Motyka, Karolina Seweryn, Paweł Walkowiak, Bartosz Żuk, Arkadiusz Janz

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:32:59Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) require careful alignment to balance competing objectives - factuality, safety, conciseness, proactivity, and diversity. Existing studies focus on individual techniques or specific dimensions, lacking a holistic assessment of the inherent trade-offs. We propose a unified evaluation framework that compares LLM alignment methods (PPO, DPO, ORPO, KTO) across these five axes, using both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. Leveraging a specialized LLM-as-Judge prompt, validated through human studies, we reveal that DPO and KTO excel in factual accuracy, PPO and DPO lead in safety, and PPO best balances conciseness with proactivity. Our findings provide insights into trade-offs of common alignment methods, guiding the development of more balanced and reliable LLMs.

### UtterTune: LoRA-Based Target-Language Pronunciation Edit and Control in   Multilingual Text-to-Speech
**Authors**: Shuhei Kato

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:28:11Z

**Summary**: We propose UtterTune, a lightweight adaptation method that fine-tunes a multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) system based on a large language model (LLM) architecture, designed to enhance the controllability of pronunciation in a target language while preserving performance in others. While LLM architectures have enabled TTS models to achieve remarkable naturalness, accurately modeling grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) mapping and prosody remains challenging, especially when the model omits an explicit G2P module and directly processes minimally encoded text (e.g., byte-pair encoding). UtterTune leverages low-rank adaptation to enable the control of segmental pronunciation and pitch accent at the phoneme level for Japanese speech, the target language in this paper, while maintaining naturalness and speaker similarity in a zero-shot setting. Objective and subjective evaluations confirm its effectiveness.

### HLSMAC: A New StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge for High-Level Strategic   Decision-Making
**Authors**: Xingxing Hong, Yungong Wang, Dexin Jin, Ye Yuan, Ximing Huang, Zijian Wu, Wenxin Li

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:26:12Z

**Summary**: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception, thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency, to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic decision-making.

### HoloDx: Knowledge- and Data-Driven Multimodal Diagnosis of Alzheimer's   Disease
**Authors**: Qiuhui Chen, Jintao Wang, Gang Wang, Yi Hong

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:22:22Z

**Summary**: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires effectively integrating multimodal data and clinical expertise. However, existing methods often struggle to fully utilize multimodal information and lack structured mechanisms to incorporate dynamic domain knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose HoloDx, a knowledge- and data-driven framework that enhances AD diagnosis by aligning domain knowledge with multimodal clinical data. HoloDx incorporates a knowledge injection module with a knowledge-aware gated cross-attention, allowing the model to dynamically integrate domain-specific insights from both large language models (LLMs) and clinical expertise. Also, a memory injection module with a designed prototypical memory attention enables the model to retain and retrieve subject-specific information, ensuring consistency in decision-making. By jointly leveraging these mechanisms, HoloDx enhances interpretability, improves robustness, and effectively aligns prior knowledge with current subject data. Evaluations on five AD datasets demonstrate that HoloDx outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior diagnostic accuracy and strong generalization across diverse cohorts. The source code will be released upon publication acceptance.

### A Novel Compression Framework for YOLOv8: Achieving Real-Time Aerial   Object Detection on Edge Devices via Structured Pruning and Channel-Wise   Distillation
**Authors**: Melika Sabaghian, Mohammad Ali Keyvanrad, Seyyedeh Mahila Moghadami

**Updated**: 2025-09-17T12:59:25Z

**Summary**: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels, significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to 13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from 26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

### All Roads Lead to Rome: Graph-Based Confidence Estimation for Large   Language Model Reasoning
**Authors**: Caiqi Zhang, Chang Shu, Ehsan Shareghi, Nigel Collier

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T10:02:52Z

**Summary**: Confidence estimation is essential for the reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs). Existing methods are primarily designed for factual QA tasks and often fail to generalize to reasoning tasks. To address this gap, we propose a set of training-free, graph-based confidence estimation methods tailored to reasoning tasks. Our approach models reasoning paths as directed graphs and estimates confidence by exploiting graph properties such as centrality, path convergence, and path weighting. Experiments with two LLMs on three reasoning datasets demonstrate improved confidence estimation and enhanced performance on two downstream tasks.

### Conan-Embedding-v2: Training an LLM from Scratch for Text Embeddings
**Authors**: Shiyu Li, Yang Tang, Ruijie Liu, Shi-Zhe Chen, Xi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T09:48:11Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated excellent performance in text embedding tasks. Previous work usually use LoRA to fine-tune existing LLMs, which are limited by the data and training gap between LLMs and embedding models. In this work, we introduce Conan-embedding-v2, a new 1.4B-parameter LLM trained from scratch and fine-tuned as a text embedder. First, we add news data and multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on this, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to better integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs use a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional mask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less effective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually transition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more comprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard negative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative examples throughout the training process. Being intuitive and effective, with only approximately 1.4B parameters, Conan-embedding-v2 achieves SOTA performance on both the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese MTEB (May 19, 2025).

### The LLM Already Knows: Estimating LLM-Perceived Question Difficulty via   Hidden Representations
**Authors**: Yubo Zhu, Dongrui Liu, Zecheng Lin, Wei Tong, Sheng Zhong, Jing Shao

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T09:38:41Z

**Summary**: Estimating the difficulty of input questions as perceived by large language models (LLMs) is essential for accurate performance evaluation and adaptive inference. Existing methods typically rely on repeated response sampling, auxiliary models, or fine-tuning the target model itself, which may incur substantial computational costs or compromise generality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for difficulty estimation that leverages only the hidden representations produced by the target LLM. We model the token-level generation process as a Markov chain and define a value function to estimate the expected output quality given any hidden state. This allows for efficient and accurate difficulty estimation based solely on the initial hidden state, without generating any output tokens. Extensive experiments across both textual and multimodal tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines in difficulty estimation. Moreover, we apply our difficulty estimates to guide adaptive reasoning strategies, including Self-Consistency, Best-of-N, and Self-Refine, achieving higher inference efficiency with fewer generated tokens.

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T09:35:09Z

**Summary**: Recommender systems have been widely used in various large-scale user-oriented platforms for many years. However, compared to the rapid developments in the AI community, recommendation systems have not achieved a breakthrough in recent years. For instance, they still rely on a multi-stage cascaded architecture rather than an end-to-end approach, leading to computational fragmentation and optimization inconsistencies, and hindering the effective application of key breakthrough technologies from the AI community in recommendation scenarios.   To address these issues, we propose OneRec, which reshapes the recommendation system through an end-to-end generative approach and achieves promising results. Firstly, we have enhanced the computational FLOPs of the current recommendation model by 10 $\times$ and have identified the scaling laws for recommendations within certain boundaries. Secondly, reinforcement learning techniques, previously difficult to apply for optimizing recommendations, show significant potential in this framework. Lastly, through infrastructure optimizations, we have achieved 23.7% and 28.8% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) on flagship GPUs during training and inference, respectively, aligning closely with the LLM community. This architecture significantly reduces communication and storage overhead, resulting in operating expense that is only 10.6% of traditional recommendation pipelines. Deployed in Kuaishou/Kuaishou Lite APP, it handles 25% of total queries per second, enhancing overall App Stay Time by 0.54% and 1.24%, respectively. Additionally, we have observed significant increases in metrics such as 7-day Lifetime, which is a crucial indicator of recommendation experience. We also provide practical lessons and insights derived from developing, optimizing, and maintaining a production-scale recommendation system with significant real-world impact.

### Emphasising Structured Information: Integrating Abstract Meaning   Representation into LLMs for Enhanced Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation
**Authors**: Bohao Yang, Kun Zhao, Dong Liu, Chen Tang, Liang Zhan, Chenghua Lin

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T09:27:11Z

**Summary**: Automatic open-domain dialogue evaluation has attracted increasing attention, yet remains challenging due to the complexity of assessing response appropriateness. Traditional evaluation metrics, typically trained with true positive and randomly selected negative responses, tend to assign higher scores to responses that share greater content similarity with contexts. However, adversarial negative responses, despite possessing high lexical overlap with contexts, can be semantically incongruous. Consequently, existing metrics struggle to effectively evaluate such responses, resulting in low correlations with human judgments. While recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-domain dialogue evaluation, they still face challenges in handling adversarial negative examples. We propose a novel evaluation framework that integrates Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) enhanced domain-specific language models (SLMs) with LLMs. Our SLMs explicitly incorporate AMR graph information through a gating mechanism for enhanced semantic representation learning, while both SLM predictions and AMR knowledge are integrated into LLM prompts for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on open-domain dialogue evaluation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our comprehensive ablation studies reveal that AMR graph information contributes substantially more to performance improvements. Our framework achieves strong correlations with human judgments across multiple datasets, establishing a new benchmark for dialogue evaluation. Our code and data are publicly available.

### Cumulative Consensus Score: Label-Free and Model-Agnostic Evaluation of   Object Detectors in Deployment
**Authors**: Avinaash Manoharan, Xiangyu Yin, Domenik Helm, Chih-Hong Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T09:24:37Z

**Summary**: Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations. In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90% congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

### Towards personalized, precise and survey-free environment recognition:   AI-enhanced sensor fusion without pre-deployment
**Authors**: Ruichen Wang, Zhikang Ni, Pengzhou Wang, Xiya Cao, Zhi Li, Bao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T09:24:08Z

**Summary**: Accurate and personalized environment recognition is essential for seamless indoor positioning and optimized connectivity, yet traditional fingerprinting requires costly site surveys and lacks user-level adaptation. We present a survey-free, on-device sensor-fusion framework that builds a personalized, lightweight multi-source fingerprint (FP) database from pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR), WiFi/cellular, GNSS, and interaction time tags. Matching is performed by an AI-enhanced dynamic time warping module (AIDTW) that aligns noisy, asynchronous sequences. To turn perception into continually improving actions, a cloud-edge online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) loop aggregates desensitized summaries and human feedback in the cloud to optimize a policy via proximal policy optimization (PPO), and periodically distills updates to devices. Across indoor/outdoor scenarios, our system reduces network-transition latency (measured by time-to-switch, TTS) by 32-65% in daily environments compared with conventional baselines, without site-specific pre-deployment.

### Tool-R1: Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Agentic Tool Use
**Authors**: Yabo Zhang, Yihan Zeng, Qingyun Li, Zhen Hu, Kavin Han, Wangmeng Zuo

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T09:22:21Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function, combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1 substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks. These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications. Our code will be available at https://github.com/YBYBZhang/Tool-R1.

### Leveraging Large Language Models to Effectively Generate Visual Data for   Canine Musculoskeletal Diagnoses
**Authors**: Martin Thißen, Thi Ngoc Diep Tran, Barbara Esteve Ratsch, Ben Joel Schönbein, Ute Trapp, Beate Egner, Romana Piat, Elke Hergenröther

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T09:22:17Z

**Summary**: It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications, offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000 synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation) diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations. These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques can be adapted to other fields.

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T09:20:46Z

**Summary**: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have transformed recommender systems through end-to-end generation. OneRec reformulates recommendation as an autoregressive generation task, achieving high Model FLOPs Utilization. While OneRec-V1 has shown significant empirical success in real-world deployment, two critical challenges hinder its scalability and performance: (1) inefficient computational allocation where 97.66% of resources are consumed by sequence encoding rather than generation, and (2) limitations in reinforcement learning relying solely on reward models.   To address these challenges, we propose OneRec-V2, featuring: (1) Lazy Decoder-Only Architecture: Eliminates encoder bottlenecks, reducing total computation by 94% and training resources by 90%, enabling successful scaling to 8B parameters. (2) Preference Alignment with Real-World User Interactions: Incorporates Duration-Aware Reward Shaping and Adaptive Ratio Clipping to better align with user preferences using real-world feedback.   Extensive A/B tests on Kuaishou demonstrate OneRec-V2's effectiveness, improving App Stay Time by 0.467%/0.741% while balancing multi-objective recommendations. This work advances generative recommendation scalability and alignment with real-world feedback, representing a step forward in the development of end-to-end recommender systems.

### TransDiffuser: Diverse Trajectory Generation with Decorrelated   Multi-modal Representation for End-to-end Autonomous Driving
**Authors**: Xuefeng Jiang, Yuan Ma, Pengxiang Li, Leimeng Xu, Xin Wen, Kun Zhan, Zhongpu Xia, Peng Jia, Xianpeng Lang, Sheng Sun

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T09:17:36Z

**Summary**: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable potential across diverse domains, from vision generation to language modeling. Transferring its generative capabilities to modern end-to-end autonomous driving systems has also emerged as a promising direction. However, existing diffusion-based trajectory generative models often exhibit mode collapse where different random noises converge to similar trajectories after the denoising process.Therefore, state-of-the-art models often rely on anchored trajectories from pre-defined trajectory vocabulary or scene priors in the training set to mitigate collapse and enrich the diversity of generated trajectories, but such inductive bias are not available in real-world deployment, which can be challenged when generalizing to unseen scenarios. In this work, we investigate the possibility of effectively tackling the mode collapse challenge without the assumption of pre-defined trajectory vocabulary or pre-computed scene priors. Specifically, we propose TransDiffuser, an encoder-decoder based generative trajectory planning model, where the encoded scene information and motion states serve as the multi-modal conditional input of the denoising decoder. Different from existing approaches, we exploit a simple yet effective multi-modal representation decorrelation optimization mechanism during the denoising process to enrich the latent representation space which better guides the downstream generation. Without any predefined trajectory anchors or pre-computed scene priors, TransDiffuser achieves the PDMS of 94.85 on the closed-loop planning-oriented benchmark NAVSIM, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative evaluation further showcases TransDiffuser generates more diverse and plausible trajectories which explore more drivable area.

### Contrastive Representation Learning for Robust Sim-to-Real Transfer of   Adaptive Humanoid Locomotion
**Authors**: Yidan Lu, Rurui Yang, Qiran Kou, Mengting Chen, Tao Fan, Peter Cui, Yinzhao Dong, Peng Lu

**Updated**: 2025-09-16T09:15:52Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning has produced remarkable advances in humanoid locomotion, yet a fundamental dilemma persists for real-world deployment: policies must choose between the robustness of reactive proprioceptive control or the proactivity of complex, fragile perception-driven systems. This paper resolves this dilemma by introducing a paradigm that imbues a purely proprioceptive policy with proactive capabilities, achieving the foresight of perception without its deployment-time costs. Our core contribution is a contrastive learning framework that compels the actor's latent state to encode privileged environmental information from simulation. Crucially, this ``distilled awareness" empowers an adaptive gait clock, allowing the policy to proactively adjust its rhythm based on an inferred understanding of the terrain. This synergy resolves the classic trade-off between rigid, clocked gaits and unstable clock-free policies. We validate our approach with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer to a full-sized humanoid, demonstrating highly robust locomotion over challenging terrains, including 30 cm high steps and 26.5{\deg} slopes, proving the effectiveness of our method.

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable ability to comprehend instructions and generate human-like text, enabling sophisticated agent simulation beyond basic behavior replication. However, the potential for creating freely customisable characters remains underexplored. We introduce the Customisable Conversation Agent Framework, which employs LLMs to simulate real-world characters through personalised characteristic feature injection, enabling diverse character creation according to user preferences. We propose the SimsConv dataset, comprising 68 customised characters and 13,971 multi-turn role-playing dialogues across 1,360 real-world scenes. Characters are initially customised using pre-defined elements (career, aspiration, traits, skills), then expanded through personal and social profiles. Building on this, we present SimsChat, a freely customisable role-playing agent incorporating various realistic settings and topic-specified character interactions. Experimental results on both SimsConv and WikiRoleEval datasets demonstrate SimsChat's superior performance in maintaining character consistency, knowledge accuracy, and appropriate question rejection compared to existing models. Our framework provides valuable insights for developing more accurate and customisable human simulacra. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Bernard-Yang/SimsChat.
