**Authors**: Jinming Lou, Wenyang Luo, Yufan Liu, Bing Li, Xinmiao Ding, Weiming Hu, Jiajiong Cao, Yuming Li, Chenguang Ma

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:05:34Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have gained substantial interest in diffusion generative modeling due to their outstanding performance. However, their high computational cost, arising from the quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanisms and multi-step inference, presents a significant bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose TokenCache, a novel post-training acceleration method that leverages the token-based multi-block architecture of transformers to reduce redundant computations among tokens across inference steps. TokenCache specifically addresses three critical questions in the context of diffusion transformers: (1) which tokens should be pruned to eliminate redundancy, (2) which blocks should be targeted for efficient pruning, and (3) at which time steps caching should be applied to balance speed and quality. In response to these challenges, TokenCache introduces a Cache Predictor that assigns importance scores to tokens, enabling selective pruning without compromising model performance. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive block selection strategy to focus on blocks with minimal impact on the network's output, along with a Two-Phase Round-Robin (TPRR) scheduling policy to optimize caching intervals throughout the denoising process. Experimental results across various models demonstrate that TokenCache achieves an effective trade-off between generation quality and inference speed for diffusion transformers. Our code will be publicly available.

### In-place Switch: Reprogramming based SLC Cache Design for Hybrid 3D SSDs
**Authors**: Xufeng Yang, Zhengjian Cong, Congming Gao

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T03:31:39Z

**Summary**: Recently, 3D SSDs are widely adopted in PCs, data centers, and cloud storage systems. To increase capacity, high bit-density cells, such as Triple-Level Cell (TLC), are utilized within 3D SSDs. However, due to the inferior performance of TLC, a portion of TLCs is configured to operate as Single-Level Cell (SLC) to provide high performance, with host data initially directed to the SLCs. In SLC/TLC hybrid 3D SSDs, a portion of the TLC space is designated as an SLC cache to achieve high SSD performance by writing host data at the SLC speed. Given the limited size of the SLC cache, block reclamation is necessary to free up the SLC cache during idle periods. However, our preliminary studies indicate that the SLC cache can lead to a performance cliff if filled rapidly and cause significant write amplification when data migration occurs during idle times.   In this work, we propose leveraging a reprogram operation to address these challenges. Specifically, when the SLC cache is full or during idle periods, a reprogram operation is performed to switch used SLC pages to TLC pages in place (termed In-place Switch, IPS). Subsequently, other free TLC space is allocated as the new SLC cache. IPS can continuously provide sufficient SLC cache within SSDs, significantly improving write performance and reducing write amplification. Experimental results demonstrate that IPS can reduce write latency and write amplification by up to 0.75 times and 0.53 times, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art SLC cache technologies.

### FlooNoC: A 645 Gbps/link 0.15 pJ/B/hop Open-Source NoC with Wide   Physical Links and End-to-End AXI4 Parallel Multi-Stream Support
**Authors**: Tim Fischer, Michael Rogenmoser, Thomas Benz, Frank K. Gürkaynak, Luca Benini

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T07:44:47Z

**Summary**: The new generation of domain-specific AI accelerators is characterized by rapidly increasing demands for bulk data transfers, as opposed to small, latency-critical cache line transfers typical of traditional cache-coherent systems. In this paper, we address this critical need by introducing the FlooNoC Network-on-Chip (NoC), featuring very wide, fully Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI4) compliant links designed to meet the massive bandwidth needs at high energy efficiency. At the transport level, non-blocking transactions are supported for latency tolerance. Additionally, a novel end-to-end ordering approach for AXI4, enabled by a multi-stream capable Direct Memory Access (DMA) engine simplifies network interfaces and eliminates inter-stream dependencies. Furthermore, dedicated physical links are instantiated for short, latency-critical messages. A complete end-to-end reference implementation in 12nm FinFET technology demonstrates the physical feasibility and power performance area (PPA) benefits of our approach. Utilizing wide links on high levels of metal, we achieve a bandwidth of 645 Gbps per link and a total aggregate bandwidth of 103 Tbps for an 8x4 mesh of processors cluster tiles, with a total of 288 RISC-V cores. The NoC imposes a minimal area overhead of only 3.5% per compute tile and achieves a leading-edge energy efficiency of 0.15 pJ/B/hop at 0.8 V. Compared to state-of-the-art NoCs, our system offers three times the energy efficiency and more than double the link bandwidth. Furthermore, compared to a traditional AXI4-based multi-layer interconnect, our NoC achieves a 30% reduction in area, corresponding to a 47% increase in GFLOPSDP within the same floorplan.

### NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 Heterojunction Diode Achieving Breakdown Voltage >3   kV with Plasma Etch Field-Termination
**Authors**: Yizheng Liu, Saurav Roy, Carl Peterson, Arkka Bhattacharyya, Sriram Krishnamoorthy

**Updated**: 2024-09-25T21:37:01Z

**Summary**: This work reports the fabrication and characterization of a NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterojunction diode (HJD) that uses a metallic nickel (Ni) target to deposit NiOx layers via reactive RF magnetron sputtering and lift-off processing with >3 kV breakdown voltage, record-low reverse current leakage under high reverse bias, and high junction electric fields (>3.34 MV/cm). The heterojunction diodes are fabricated via bilayer NiOx sputtering followed by self-aligned mesa-etching for field-termination on both large (1-mm2) and small area (100-{\mu}m diameter) devices. The HJD exhibits a ~135 A/cm2 forward current density at 5 V with a rectifying ratio of ~1010. The minimum differential specific on-resistance is measured to be 17.26 m{\Omega} cm2. The breakdown voltage on 100-{\mu}m diameter pads was measured to be greater than 3 kV with a noise floor-level reverse leakage current density (10-8~10-6 A/cm2) until 3 kV, accomplishing a parallel-plane junction electric field to be at least 3.34 MV/cm at 3 kV with a power figure of merit (PFOM) >0.52 GW/cm2. Temperature-dependent forward current density-voltage (J-V) measurements are performed from room temperature (25 C) to 200 C which showed a temperature coefficient of resistance ({\alpha}) equaling 1.56, higher than that of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs), indicating potential conductivity degradation within NiOx at elevated temperatures.

### Mnemosyne: Parallelization Strategies for Efficiently Serving   Multi-Million Context Length LLM Inference Requests Without Approximations
**Authors**: Amey Agrawal, Junda Chen, Íñigo Goiri, Ramachandran Ramjee, Chaojie Zhang, Alexey Tumanov, Esha Choukse

**Updated**: 2024-09-25T18:21:05Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) evolve to handle increasingly longer contexts, serving inference requests for context lengths in the range of millions of tokens presents unique challenges. While existing techniques are effective for training, they fail to address the unique challenges of inference, such as varying prefill and decode phases and their associated latency constraints - like Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Between Tokens (TBT). Furthermore, there are no long context inference solutions that allow batching requests to increase the hardware utilization today.   In this paper, we propose three key innovations for efficient interactive long context LLM inference, without resorting to any approximation: adaptive chunking to reduce prefill overheads in mixed batching, Sequence Pipeline Parallelism (SPP) to lower TTFT, and KV Cache Parallelism (KVP) to minimize TBT. These contributions are combined into a 3D parallelism strategy, enabling Mnemosyne to scale interactive inference to context lengths at least up to 10 million tokens with high throughput enabled with batching. To our knowledge, Mnemosyne is the first to be able to achieve support for 10 million long context inference efficiently, while satisfying production-grade SLOs on TBT (30ms) on contexts up to and including 10 million.

### Adaptive Cost Model for Query Optimization
**Authors**: Nikita Vasilenko, Alexander Demin, Denis Ponomaryov

**Updated**: 2024-09-25T17:55:07Z

**Summary**: The principal component of conventional database query optimizers is a cost model that is used to estimate expected performance of query plans. The accuracy of the cost model has direct impact on the optimality of execution plans selected by the optimizer and thus, on the resulting query latency. Several common parameters of cost models in modern DBMS are related to the performance of CPU and I/O and are typically set by a database administrator upon system tuning. However these performance characteristics are not stable and therefore, a single point estimation may not suffice for all DB load regimes. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Cost Model (ACM) which dynamically optimizes CPU- and I/O-related plan cost parameters at DB runtime. By continuously monitoring query execution statistics and the state of DB buffer cache ACM adjusts cost parameters without the need for manual intervention from a database administrator. This allows for responding to changes in the workload and system performance ensuring more optimal query execution plans. We describe the main ideas in the implementation of ACM and report on a preliminary experimental evaluation showing 20\% end-to-end latency improvement on TPC-H benchmark.

### Event-Triggered Non-Linear Control of Offshore MMC Grids for   Asymmetrical AC Faults
**Authors**: Naajein Cherat, Vaibhav Nougain, Milovan Majstorović, Peter Palensky, Aleksandra Lekić

**Updated**: 2024-09-25T08:52:07Z

**Summary**: Fault ride-through capability studies of MMC-HVDC connected wind power plants have focused primarily on the DC link and onshore AC grid faults. Offshore AC faults, mainly asymmetrical faults have not gained much attention in the literature despite being included in the future development at national levels in the ENTSO-E HVDC code. The proposed work gives an event-triggered control to stabilize the system once the offshore AC fault has occurred, identified, and isolated. Different types of control actions such as proportional-integral (PI) controller and super-twisted sliding mode control (STSMC) are used to smoothly transition the post-fault system to a new steady state operating point by suppressing the negative sequence control. Initially, the effect of a negative sequence current control scheme on the transient behavior of the power system with a PI controller is discussed in this paper. Further, a non-linear control strategy (STSMC) is proposed which gives quicker convergence of the system post-fault in comparison to PI control action. These post-fault control operations are only triggered in the presence of a fault in the system, i.e., they are event-triggered. The validity of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by simulation on a $\pm$525 kV, three-terminal meshed MMC-HVDC system model in Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS).

### Block-Attention for Efficient RAG
**Authors**: East Sun, Yan Wang, Lan Tian

**Updated**: 2024-09-25T06:46:42Z

**Summary**: We introduce Block-Attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Unlike existing works that encodes the whole context, its main idea lies in dividing the retrieved documents into blocks, where each block calculates key-value (KV) states independently except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-Attention enables us to pre-compute the KV states for all passages and cache them in memory, significantly reducing the latency and the computation cost during inference. The implementation involves block segmentation, positional encoding calculation, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-Attention mechanism. Experiments on four RAG benchmarks demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block Attention model can achieve performance comparable to (68.4\% vs 67.9\% on Llama3) or even better (62.8\% vs 59.6\% on Mistral) than self-attention models. Notably, Block-Attention reduces the TTFT (the time to first token) and FLOPs (floating point operations) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared with the self-attention model, the time consumption and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7\% and 99.8\%, respectively.

### AlignedKV: Reducing Memory Access of KV-Cache with Precision-Aligned   Quantization
**Authors**: Yifan Tan, Haoze Wang, Chao Yan, Yangdong Deng

**Updated**: 2024-09-25T01:39:02Z

**Summary**: Model quantization has become a crucial technique to address the issues of large memory consumption and long inference times associated with LLMs. Mixed-precision quantization, which distinguishes between important and unimportant parameters, stands out among numerous quantization schemes as it achieves a balance between precision and compression rate. However, existing approaches can only identify important parameters through qualitative analysis and manual experiments without quantitatively analyzing how their importance is determined. We propose a new criterion, so-called 'precision alignment', to build a quantitative framework to holistically evaluate the importance of parameters in mixed-precision quantization. Our observations on floating point addition under various real-world scenarios suggest that two addends should have identical precision, otherwise the information in the higher-precision number will be wasted. Such an observation offers an essential principle to determine the precision of each parameter in matrix multiplication operation. As the first step towards applying the above discovery to large model inference, we develop a dynamic KV-Cache quantization technique to effectively reduce memory access latency. Different from existing quantization approaches that focus on memory saving, this work directly aims to accelerate LLM inference through quantifying floating numbers. The proposed technique attains a 25% saving of memory access and delivers up to 1.3x speedup in the computation of attention in the decoding phase of LLM, with almost no loss of precision.

**Authors**: Antoine Murat, Clément Burgelin, Athanasios Xygkis, Igor Zablotchi, Marcos K. Aguilera, Rachid Guerraoui

**Updated**: 2024-09-24T17:28:47Z

**Summary**: Memory disaggregation is an emerging data center architecture that improves resource utilization and scalability. Replication is key to ensure the fault tolerance of applications, but replicating shared data in disaggregated memory is hard. We propose SWARM (Swift WAit-free Replication in disaggregated Memory), the first replication scheme for in-disaggregated-memory shared objects to provide (1) single-roundtrip reads and writes in the common case, (2) strong consistency (linearizability), and (3) strong liveness (wait-freedom). SWARM makes two independent contributions. The first is Safe-Guess, a novel wait-free replication protocol with single-roundtrip operations. The second is In-n-Out, a novel technique to provide conditional atomic update and atomic retrieval of large buffers in disaggregated memory in one roundtrip. Using SWARM, we build SWARM-KV, a low-latency, strongly consistent and highly available disaggregated key-value store. We evaluate SWARM-KV and find that it has marginal latency overhead compared to an unreplicated key-value store, and that it offers much lower latency and better availability than FUSEE, a state-of-the-art replicated disaggregated key-value store.

### Wind lulls and slews; consequences for the stability of future UK   electricity systems
**Authors**: Anthony D Stephens, David R Walwyn

**Updated**: 2024-09-24T14:16:26Z

**Summary**: As the United Kingdom wind fleet increases in size, wind lulls and slews will increasingly challenge the stability of its electricity system. The paper describes the use of models based on real time records and including solar slews, to investigate the most extreme wind variations likely to be encountered in future, enabling strategies to be devised to mitigate them. Wind lulls are surprisingly frequent, occasionally lasting a week or more, and are always likely to be beyond the capabilities of stored or imported electrical energy to mitigate them. The models indicate that there will be a continuing need for gas powered generation to mitigate wind lulls. Currently, Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGTs) provide most of the dispatchable generation. However, CCGTs are not sufficiently fast acting to cope with the wind and solar slews anticipated in future. The paper suggests that a range of already proven fast-acting sources of dispatchable generation, including Open Cycle Gas Turbines (OCGTs), Internal Combustion Gas-Fired Reciprocating engines (ICGRs) and stored electrical energy systems, should be capable of coping with the largest wind and solar slews likely to be encountered up to the year 2035. Examples are given of the recent introduction of these fast-acting sources of generation which, it is suggested, will progressively replace CCGTs as the wind and solar fleets increase in size. Moreover, we see the pattern of recent investments, summarised in the paper, as a good indication of likely future investments, with OCGT investments mainly serving the 440 kV grid, and ICGRs and stored electrical energy more local networks.

### The Bicameral Cache: a split cache for vector architectures
**Authors**: Susana Rebolledo, Borja Perez, Jose Luis Bosque, Peter Hsu

**Updated**: 2024-09-24T11:37:43Z

**Summary**: The Bicameral Cache is a cache organization proposal for a vector architecture that segregates data according to their access type, distinguishing scalar from vector references. Its aim is to avoid both types of references from interfering in each other's data locality, with a special focus on prioritizing the performance on vector references. The proposed system incorporates an additional, non-polluting prefetching mechanism to help populate the long vector cache lines in advance to increase the hit rate by further exploiting the spatial locality on vector data. Its evaluation was conducted on the Cavatools simulator, comparing the performance to a standard conventional cache, over different typical vector benchmarks for several vector lengths. The results proved the proposed cache speeds up performance on stride-1 vector benchmarks, while hardly impacting non-stride-1's. In addition, the prefetching feature consistently provided an additional value.

### SEAL: Suite for Evaluating API-use of LLMs
**Authors**: Woojeong Kim, Ashish Jagmohan, Aditya Vempaty

**Updated**: 2024-09-23T20:16:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have limitations in handling tasks that require real-time access to external APIs. While several benchmarks like ToolBench and APIGen have been developed to assess LLMs' API-use capabilities, they often suffer from issues such as lack of generalizability, limited multi-step reasoning coverage, and instability due to real-time API fluctuations. In this paper, we introduce SEAL, an end-to-end testbed designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world API usage. SEAL standardizes existing benchmarks, integrates an agent system for testing API retrieval and planning, and addresses the instability of real-time APIs by introducing a GPT-4-powered API simulator with caching for deterministic evaluations. Our testbed provides a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that covers API retrieval, API calls, and final responses, offering a reliable framework for structured performance comparison in diverse real-world scenarios. SEAL is publicly available, with ongoing updates for new benchmarks.

### BlockLLM: Multi-tenant Finer-grained Serving for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Bodun Hu, Jiamin Li, Le Xu, Myungjin Lee, Akshay Jajoo, Geon-Woo Kim, Hong Xu, Aditya Akella

**Updated**: 2024-09-23T20:09:28Z

**Summary**: The increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) across various applications has led to a significant shift in the design of deep learning serving systems. Deploying LLMs, particularly in multi-tenant environments, poses substantial challenges due to their high computational and memory demands. We introduce BlockLLM, a serving system that leverages component sharing among fine-tuned LLM models to provide an efficient and flexible solution for LLM workloads. BlockLLM partitions models into finer-grained blocks, enabling the reuse of model components and independent provisioning to improve computation efficiency. BlockLLM comprises an offline block zoo for storing blocks and an online system to serve requests through chains of blocks. It offers multi-fold flexibilities: (1) Adaptive assembly of blocks on-the-fly through equivalence evaluation among blocks in the zoo; (2) Per-block batch size configuration and best-effort KV cache coordination at the individual block level; (3) Speculative execution and locality-aware block placement to reduce communication costs from dynamic block resource allocation. Our evaluation shows that BlockLLM reduces memory and storage footprints and improves computational efficiency, outperforming existing serving approach in 95%ile latency and GPU utilization by 33.5% and 20.1%, respectively, with minimal impact on accuracy

### RepoGenReflex: Enhancing Repository-Level Code Completion with Verbal   Reinforcement and Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Jicheng Wang, Yifeng He, Hao Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-23T19:53:37Z

**Summary**: In real-world software engineering tasks, solving a problem often requires understanding and modifying multiple functions, classes, and files across a large codebase. Therefore, on the repository level, it is crucial to extract the relevant information to achieve accurate code completion effectively. Existing code completion tools have achieved some success, but they struggle to optimize the retrieval and generation process dynamically. In this paper, we propose RepoGenReflex, a generic, dynamic, effective framework to address this challenge. By leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced with Verbal Reinforcement Learning (VRL), it can dynamically choose the optimal results for repository-level code completion. RepoGenReflex uses Reflector to give directional feedback to the next loop. RepoGenReflex chooses the optimal results stored in the Experience cache based on the RAG-VRL loop. To validate the framework's generalization ability, we propose a new benchmark RepoGenEval, which consists of the latest, high-quality real-world repositories in line completion scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that RepoGenReflex achieves significant improvements after optimizing the Reflector component, resulting in enhanced accuracy and relevance of code completions. Additionally, RepoGenReflex consistently demonstrates superior performance and effectiveness across standard code completion tasks, highlighting the robustness and adaptability of our framework.

### Steward: Natural Language Web Automation
**Authors**: Brian Tang, Kang G. Shin

**Updated**: 2024-09-23T18:06:32Z

**Summary**: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in serving as the foundation for AI assistants. One emerging application of LLMs, navigating through websites and interacting with UI elements across various web pages, remains somewhat underexplored. We introduce Steward, a novel LLM-powered web automation tool designed to serve as a cost-effective, scalable, end-to-end solution for automating web interactions. Traditional browser automation frameworks like Selenium, Puppeteer, and Playwright are not scalable for extensive web interaction tasks, such as studying recommendation algorithms on platforms like YouTube and Twitter. These frameworks require manual coding of interactions, limiting their utility in large-scale or dynamic contexts. Steward addresses these limitations by integrating LLM capabilities with browser automation, allowing for natural language-driven interaction with websites. Steward operates by receiving natural language instructions and reactively planning and executing a sequence of actions on websites, looping until completion, making it a practical tool for developers and researchers to use. It achieves high efficiency, completing actions in 8.52 to 10.14 seconds at a cost of $0.028 per action or an average of $0.18 per task, which is further reduced to 4.8 seconds and $0.022 through a caching mechanism. It runs tasks on real websites with a 40% completion success rate. We discuss various design and implementation challenges, including state representation, action sequence selection, system responsiveness, detecting task completion, and caching implementation.

### CSPS: A Communication-Efficient Sequence-Parallelism based Serving   System for Transformer based Models with Long Prompts
**Authors**: Zeyu Zhang, Haiying Shen

**Updated**: 2024-09-23T15:16:29Z

**Summary**: Long-sequence generative large-language model (LLM) applications have become increasingly popular. In this paper, through trace-based experiments, we found that the existing method for long sequences results in a high Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) due to sequential chunk processing, long Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) from batching long-sequence prefills and decodes, and low throughput due to constrained key-value cache (KVC) for long sequences. To address these issues, we propose two Sequence-Parallelism (SP) architectures for both tensor parallelism (TP) and non-TP. However, SP introduces two challenges: 1) network communication and computation become performance bottlenecks; 2) the latter two issues above are mitigated but not resolved, and SP's resultant KV value distribution across GPUs still requires communication for decode, increasing TBT. Hence, we propose a Communication-efficient Sparse Attention (CSA) and communication-computation-communication three-phase pipelining. We also propose SP-based decode that processes decode separately from prefill, distributes KV values of a request across different GPUs, and novelly moves Query (Q) values instead of KV values to reduce communication overhead. These methods constitute a communication-efficient Sequence-Parallelism based LLM Serving System (SPS2). Our trace-driven evaluation demonstrates that SPS2 improves the average TTFT, TBT, and response time by up to 7.5x, 1.92x, and 9.8x and improves the prefill and decode throughput by 8.2x and 5.2x while maintaining the accuracy compared to Sarathi-Serve. We distributed our source code.

### Inference-Friendly Models With MixAttention
**Authors**: Shashank Rajput, Ying Sheng, Sean Owen, Vitaliy Chiley

**Updated**: 2024-09-23T13:37:25Z

**Summary**: The size of the key-value (KV) cache plays a critical role in determining both the maximum context length and the number of concurrent requests supported during inference in modern language models. The KV cache size grows proportionally with the number of attention heads and the tokens processed, leading to increased memory consumption and slower inference for long inputs. In this work, we explore the use of MixAttention, a model architecture modification closely related to a blog published by Character.AI. MixAttention combines sliding window attention, where only a small subset of recent tokens is stored in the KV cache, with KV cache sharing across layers. Our experiments demonstrate that MixAttention significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed without sacrificing model performance in both short and long-context tasks. We also explore various configurations of this architecture, identifying those that maintain quality across evaluation metrics while optimizing resource efficiency.

### Mutation-Based Deep Learning Framework Testing Method in JavaScript   Environment
**Authors**: Yinglong Zou, Juan Zhai, Chunrong Fang, Jiawei Liu, Tao Zheng, Zhenyu Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-23T12:37:56Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) applications in JavaScript environment have become increasingly popular. As the infrastructure for DL applications, JavaScript DL frameworks play a crucial role in the development and deployment. It is essential to ensure the quality of JavaScript DL frameworks. However, the bottleneck of limited computational resources in the JavaScript environment brings new challenges to framework testing. Specifically, JavaScript DL frameworks are equipped with various optimization mechanisms (e.g., cache reuse, inference acceleration) to overcome the bottleneck of limited computational resources. These optimization mechanisms are overlooked by existing methods, resulting in many bugs in JavaScript DL frameworks being missed. To address the above challenges, we propose a mutation-based JavaScript DL framework testing method named DLJSFuzzer. DLJSFuzzer designs 13 tensor mutation rules targeting the cache reuse mechanism to generate test input tensors. Besides, DLJSFuzzer designs eight model mutation rules targeting the inference acceleration mechanism to generate test input models. To evaluate the effectiveness of DLJSFuzzer, we conduct experiments on the most widely-used JavaScript DL framework, TensorFlow.js. The experimental results show that DLJSFuzzer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. DLJSFuzzer successfully detects 21 unique crashes and 126 unique NaN & Inconsistency bugs. All detected crashes have been reported to the open-source community, with 12 of them already confirmed by developers. Additionally, DLJSFuzzer has improved by over 47% in model generation efficiency and over 91% in bug detection efficiency compared to all baselines.

**Authors**: Junyang Zhang, Mu Yuan, Ruiguang Zhong, Puhan Luo, Huiyou Zhan, Ningkang Zhang, Chengchen Hu, Xiangyang Li

**Updated**: 2024-09-23T09:22:59Z

**Summary**: The Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) integrates computer vision and natural language processing techniques, offering substantial application potential. However, these models demand extensive resources during inference. Adaptive attention techniques can dynamically reduce computational redundancy and thus improve efficiency. Although current adaptive attention methods significantly reduce the memory requirements of Transformer-based language models, they are not tailored for LVLMs. We observe that LVLMs generate responses from both remote image tokens and local text tokens, and different modalities have different attention patterns. This observation inspires us to manage the attention for each modality separately. Specifically, for visual input, we store the cache of potentially useful information but only compute the most critical parts. For language input, we care more about local information. Based on our observation and analysis of vision-language attention patterns, we develop A-VL, a plug-and-play adaptive attention tailored for LVLM inference. Extensive evaluations on three vision-language tasks and five datasets show the effectiveness of our designs. Our approach A-VL outperforms existing adaptive attention methods in reducing memory usage and computational load without compromising performance.

### CritiPrefill: A Segment-wise Criticality-based Approach for Prefilling   Acceleration in LLMs
**Authors**: Junlin Lv, Yuan Feng, Xike Xie, Xin Jia, Qirong Peng, Guiming Xie

**Updated**: 2024-09-23T02:24:33Z

**Summary**: Large language models have achieved notable success across various domains, yet efficient inference is still limited by the quadratic computation complexity of the attention mechanism. The inference consists of prefilling and decoding phases. Although several attempts have been made to accelerate decoding, the inefficiency of the prefilling phase, especially for long-context tasks, remains a challenge. In this paper, we observe a locality in query criticality during the prefilling phase of long-context processing: adjacent query tokens tend to focus on similar subsets of the past Key-Value (KV) cache. Based on this observation, we propose CritiPrefill, a criticality-based segment-wise prefilling method. This method partitions the input sequence's queries and KV cache into segments and blocks, utilizing a segment-wise algorithm to estimate the query criticality. By pruning non-critical computations between query segments and cache blocks in the self-attention mechanism, the prefilling process can be significantly accelerated. Extensive evaluations on multiple long-context datasets show up to 2.7x speedup on Llama3-8B and 3.0x speedup on Yi-9B for 128K context length on a single A100 GPU, with minimal quality degradation.

### D2D Coded Caching from Two Classes of Optimal DPDAs using Cross   Resolvable Designs
**Authors**: Rashid Ummer N. T., B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2024-09-22T07:24:02Z

**Summary**: Coded caching in a wireless device-to-device (D2D) network was first studied by Ji \textit{et al.} in [4] (referred to as the JCM scheme). In a D2D network, a central server first places the data in the user cache memories and all the user's demands are served by inter-user coded multicast transmissions. Low subpacketization level D2D coded caching schemes are desirable for practical implementations. Wang \textit{et al.} in [7] proposed an array called D2D placement delivery array (DPDA) which characterizes the placement phase and the delivery phase in a D2D network. A lower bound on the transmission load of a DPDA is derived and only the JCM scheme achieves this lower bound, but requires a subpacketization level that grows exponentially with the number of users. Low subpacketization level D2D schemes can be obtained by constructing appropriate DPDAs. In this paper, we propose two new classes of DPDA constructions that give low subpacketization level D2D schemes using cross resolvable designs. The first class of constructed DPDA achieves the known lower bound on the transmission load of DPDA while requiring a subpacketization level lesser than that of the JCM scheme. We propose another lower bound on the transmission load of a DPDA and show that the second class of constructed DPDA achieves this lower bound.

### Sub-millisecond electric field sensing with an individual rare-earth   doped ferroelectric nanocrystal
**Authors**: Athulya Muraleedharan, Jingye Zou, Maxime Vallet, Abdelali Zaki, Christine Bogicevic, Charles Paillard, Karen Perronet, François Treussart

**Updated**: 2024-09-21T20:45:41Z

**Summary**: Understanding the dynamics of electrical signals within neuronal assemblies is crucial to unraveling complex brain function. Despite recent advances in employing optically active nanostructures in transmembrane potential sensing, there remains room for improvement in terms of response time and sensitivity. Here, we report the development of such a nanosensor capable of detecting electric fields with a submillisecond response time at the single particle level. We achieve this by using ferroelectric nanocrystals doped with rare earth ions producing upconversion (UC). When such a nanocrystal experiences a variation of surrounding electric potential, its surface charge density changes, inducing electric polarization modifications that vary, via converse piezoelectric effect, the crystal field around the ions. The latter variation is finally converted into UC spectral changes, enabling optical detection of electric potential. To develop such a sensor, we synthesized erbium and ytterbium-doped barium titanate crystals of size $\approx160$~nm. We observed distinct changes in the UC spectrum when individual nanocrystals were subjected to an external field via a conductive AFM tip, with a response time of 100~$\mu$s. Furthermore, our sensor exhibits a remarkable sensitivity of 4.8~kV/cm/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$, enabling time-resolved detection of fast changing electric field of amplitude comparable to that generated during a neuron action potential.

### CSKV: Training-Efficient Channel Shrinking for KV Cache in Long-Context   Scenarios
**Authors**: Luning Wang, Shiyao Li, Xuefei Ning, Zhihang Yuan, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Yu Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-21T13:01:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to process long-context tasks. However, the large memory overhead of the key-value (KV) cache poses significant challenges in long-context scenarios. Existing training-free KV cache compression methods typically focus on quantization and token pruning, which have compression limits, and excessive sparsity can lead to severe performance degradation. Other methods design new architectures with less KV overhead but require significant training overhead. To address the above two drawbacks, we further explore the redundancy in the channel dimension and apply an architecture-level design with minor training costs. Therefore, we introduce CSKV, a training-efficient Channel Shrinking technique for KV cache compression: (1) We first analyze the singular value distribution of the KV cache, revealing significant redundancy and compression potential along the channel dimension. Based on this observation, we propose using low-rank decomposition for key and value layers and storing the low-dimension features. (2) To preserve model performance, we introduce a bi-branch KV cache, including a window-based full-precision KV cache and a low-precision compressed KV cache. (3) To reduce the training costs, we minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss for the compressed KV cache instead of retraining the entire LLMs. Extensive experiments show that CSKV can reduce the memory overhead of the KV cache by 80% while maintaining the model's long-context capability. Moreover, we show that our method can be seamlessly combined with quantization to further reduce the memory overhead, achieving a compression ratio of up to 95%.

### A Simple and Effective $L_2$ Norm-Based Strategy for KV Cache   Compression
**Authors**: Alessio Devoto, Yu Zhao, Simone Scardapane, Pasquale Minervini

**Updated**: 2024-09-21T12:33:00Z

**Summary**: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often hindered by the extensive memory requirements of the Key-Value (KV) cache, especially as context lengths increase. Existing approaches to reduce the KV cache size involve either fine-tuning the model to learn a compression strategy or leveraging attention scores to reduce the sequence length. We analyse the attention distributions in decoder-only Transformers-based models and observe that attention allocation patterns stay consistent across most layers. Surprisingly, we find a clear correlation between the $L_2$ and the attention scores over cached KV pairs, where a low $L_2$ of a key embedding usually leads to a high attention score during decoding. This finding indicates that the influence of a KV pair is potentially determined by the key embedding itself before being queried. Based on this observation, we compress the KV cache based on the $L_2$ of key embeddings. Our experimental results show that this simple strategy can reduce the KV cache size by 50% on language modelling and needle-in-a-haystack tasks and 90% on passkey retrieval tasks without losing accuracy. Moreover, without relying on the attention scores, this approach remains compatible with FlashAttention, enabling broader applicability.

**Updated**: 2024-09-21T09:10:02Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) broaden their capabilities to manage thousands of API calls, they are confronted with complex data operations across vast datasets with significant overhead to the underlying system. In this work, we introduce LLM-dCache to optimize data accesses by treating cache operations as callable API functions exposed to the tool-augmented agent. We grant LLMs the autonomy to manage cache decisions via prompting, seamlessly integrating with existing function-calling mechanisms. Tested on an industry-scale massively parallel platform that spans hundreds of GPT endpoints and terabytes of imagery, our method improves Copilot times by an average of 1.24x across various LLMs and prompting techniques.

**Authors**: Tommaso Bonato, Abdul Kabbani, Ahmad Ghalayini, Mohammad Dohadwala, Michael Papamichael, Daniele De Sensi, Torsten Hoefler

**Updated**: 2024-09-20T16:59:29Z

**Summary**: Most datacenter transport protocols traditionally depend on in-order packet delivery, a legacy design choice that prioritizes simplicity. However, technological advancements, such as RDMA, now enable the relaxation of this requirement, allowing for more efficient utilization of modern datacenter topologies like FatTree and Dragonfly. With the growing prevalence of AI/ML workloads, the demand for improved link utilization has intensified, creating challenges for single-path load balancers due to problems like ECMP collisions. In this paper, we present ARCANE, a novel, adaptive per-packet traffic load-balancing algorithm designed to work seamlessly with existing congestion control mechanisms. ARCANE dynamically routes packets to bypass congested areas and network failures, all while maintaining a lightweight footprint with minimal state requirements. Our evaluation shows that ARCANE delivers significant performance gains over traditional load-balancing methods, including packet spraying and other advanced solutions, substantially enhancing both performance and link utilization in modern datacenter networks.

**Authors**: Ayush RoyChowdhury, Mulong Luo, Prateek Sahu, Sarbartha Banerjee, Mohit Tiwari

**Updated**: 2024-09-20T15:51:17Z

**Summary**: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.   In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.

### RPAF: A Reinforcement Prediction-Allocation Framework for Cache   Allocation in Large-Scale Recommender Systems
**Authors**: Shuo Su, Xiaoshuang Chen, Yao Wang, Yulin Wu, Ziqiang Zhang, Kaiqiao Zhan, Ben Wang, Kun Gai

**Updated**: 2024-09-20T03:02:42Z

**Summary**: Modern recommender systems are built upon computation-intensive infrastructure, and it is challenging to perform real-time computation for each request, especially in peak periods, due to the limited computational resources. Recommending by user-wise result caches is widely used when the system cannot afford a real-time recommendation. However, it is challenging to allocate real-time and cached recommendations to maximize the users' overall engagement. This paper shows two key challenges to cache allocation, i.e., the value-strategy dependency and the streaming allocation. Then, we propose a reinforcement prediction-allocation framework (RPAF) to address these issues. RPAF is a reinforcement-learning-based two-stage framework containing prediction and allocation stages. The prediction stage estimates the values of the cache choices considering the value-strategy dependency, and the allocation stage determines the cache choices for each individual request while satisfying the global budget constraint. We show that the challenge of training RPAF includes globality and the strictness of budget constraints, and a relaxed local allocator (RLA) is proposed to address this issue. Moreover, a PoolRank algorithm is used in the allocation stage to deal with the streaming allocation problem. Experiments show that RPAF significantly improves users' engagement under computational budget constraints.

### 3DGS-LM: Faster Gaussian-Splatting Optimization with Levenberg-Marquardt
**Authors**: Lukas Höllein, Aljaž Božič, Michael Zollhöfer, Matthias Nießner

**Updated**: 2024-09-19T16:31:44Z

**Summary**: We present 3DGS-LM, a new method that accelerates the reconstruction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by replacing its ADAM optimizer with a tailored Levenberg-Marquardt (LM). Existing methods reduce the optimization time by decreasing the number of Gaussians or by improving the implementation of the differentiable rasterizer. However, they still rely on the ADAM optimizer to fit Gaussian parameters of a scene in thousands of iterations, which can take up to an hour. To this end, we change the optimizer to LM that runs in conjunction with the 3DGS differentiable rasterizer. For efficient GPU parallization, we propose a caching data structure for intermediate gradients that allows us to efficiently calculate Jacobian-vector products in custom CUDA kernels. In every LM iteration, we calculate update directions from multiple image subsets using these kernels and combine them in a weighted mean. Overall, our method is 30% faster than the original 3DGS while obtaining the same reconstruction quality. Our optimization is also agnostic to other methods that acclerate 3DGS, thus enabling even faster speedups compared to vanilla 3DGS.

### Learning Harmonized Representations for Speculative Sampling
**Authors**: Lefan Zhang, Xiaodan Wang, Yanhua Huang, Ruiwen Xu

**Updated**: 2024-09-19T15:46:57Z

**Summary**: Speculative sampling is a promising approach to accelerate the decoding stage for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent advancements that leverage target LLM's contextual information, such as hidden states and KV cache, have shown significant practical improvements. However, these approaches suffer from inconsistent context between training and decoding. We also observe another discrepancy between the training and decoding objectives in existing speculative sampling methods. In this work, we propose a solution named HArmonized Speculative Sampling (HASS) that learns harmonized representations to address these issues. HASS accelerates the decoding stage without adding inference overhead through harmonized objective distillation and harmonized context alignment. Experiments on four LLaMA models demonstrate that HASS achieves 2.81x-4.05x wall-clock time speedup ratio averaging across three datasets, surpassing EAGLE-2 by 8%-20%.

### On the Regret of Coded Caching with Adversarial Requests
**Authors**: Anupam Nayak, Kota Srinivas Reddy, Nikhil Karamchandani

**Updated**: 2024-09-19T01:13:03Z

**Summary**: We study the well-known coded caching problem in an online learning framework, wherein requests arrive sequentially, and an online policy can update the cache contents based on the history of requests seen thus far. We introduce a caching policy based on the Follow-The-Perturbed-Leader principle and show that for any time horizon T and any request sequence, it achieves a sub-linear regret of \mathcal{O}(\sqrt(T) ) with respect to an oracle that knows the request sequence beforehand. Our study marks the first examination of adversarial regret in the coded caching setup. Furthermore, we also address the issue of switching cost by establishing an upper bound on the expected number of cache updates made by our algorithm under unrestricted switching and also provide an upper bound on the regret under restricted switching when cache updates can only happen in a pre-specified subset of timeslots. Finally, we validate our theoretical insights with numerical results using a real-world dataset

### Trajectory Anomaly Detection with Language Models
**Authors**: Jonathan Mbuya, Dieter Pfoser, Antonios Anastasopoulos

**Updated**: 2024-09-18T17:33:31Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach for trajectory anomaly detection using an autoregressive causal-attention model, termed LM-TAD. This method leverages the similarities between language statements and trajectories, both of which consist of ordered elements requiring coherence through external rules and contextual variations. By treating trajectories as sequences of tokens, our model learns the probability distributions over trajectories, enabling the identification of anomalous locations with high precision. We incorporate user-specific tokens to account for individual behavior patterns, enhancing anomaly detection tailored to user context. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LM-TAD on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In particular, the model outperforms existing methods on the Pattern of Life (PoL) dataset by detecting user-contextual anomalies and achieves competitive results on the Porto taxi dataset, highlighting its adaptability and robustness. Additionally, we introduce the use of perplexity and surprisal rate metrics for detecting outliers and pinpointing specific anomalous locations within trajectories. The LM-TAD framework supports various trajectory representations, including GPS coordinates, staypoints, and activity types, proving its versatility in handling diverse trajectory data. Moreover, our approach is well-suited for online trajectory anomaly detection, significantly reducing computational latency by caching key-value states of the attention mechanism, thereby avoiding repeated computations.

### Autonomous Navigation in Ice-Covered Waters with Learned Predictions on   Ship-Ice Interactions
**Authors**: Ninghan Zhong, Alessandro Potenza, Stephen L. Smith

**Updated**: 2024-09-18T17:09:42Z

**Summary**: Autonomous navigation in ice-covered waters poses significant challenges due to the frequent lack of viable collision-free trajectories. When complete obstacle avoidance is infeasible, it becomes imperative for the navigation strategy to minimize collisions. Additionally, the dynamic nature of ice, which moves in response to ship maneuvers, complicates the path planning process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model to estimate the coarse dynamics of ice movements triggered by ship actions through occupancy estimation. To ensure real-time applicability, we propose a novel approach that caches intermediate prediction results and seamlessly integrates the predictive model into a graph search planner. We evaluate the proposed planner both in simulation and in a physical testbed against existing approaches and show that our planner significantly reduces collisions with ice when compared to the state-of-the-art. Codes and demos of this work are available at https://github.com/IvanIZ/predictive-asv-planner.

### Optimal Offline ORAM with Perfect Security via Simple Oblivious Priority   Queues
**Authors**: Thore Thießen, Jan Vahrenhold

**Updated**: 2024-09-18T14:31:33Z

**Summary**: Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a well-researched primitive to hide the memory access pattern of a RAM computation; it has a variety of applications in trusted computing, outsourced storage, and multiparty computation. In this paper, we study the so-called offline ORAM in which the sequence of memory access locations to be hidden is known in advance. Apart from their theoretical significance, offline ORAMs can be used to construct efficient oblivious algorithms.   We obtain the first optimal offline ORAM with perfect security from oblivious priority queues via time-forward processing. For this, we present a simple construction of an oblivious priority queue with perfect security. Our construction achieves an asymptotically optimal (amortized) runtime of $\Theta(\log N)$ per operation for a capacity of $N$ elements and is of independent interest.   Building on our construction, we additionally present efficient external-memory instantiations of our oblivious, perfectly-secure construction: For the cache-aware setting, we match the optimal I/O complexity of $\Theta(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M})$ per operation (amortized), and for the cache-oblivious setting we achieve a near-optimal I/O complexity of $O(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M} \log\log_M N)$ per operation (amortized).

### RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector   Retrieval
**Authors**: Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu

**Updated**: 2024-09-18T13:11:13Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attention computation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inference latency and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both accelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By leveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention proposes to use approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most relevant ones with vector search during generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS indexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in attention mechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of query vectors. Our evaluation shows that RetrievalAttention only needs to access 1--3% of data while maintaining high model accuracy. This leads to significant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs with much lower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) for serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.

### Proportional scintillation in liquid xenon: demonstration in a   single-phase liquid-only time projection chamber
**Authors**: Florian Tönnies, Adam Brown, Baris Kiyim, Fabian Kuger, Sebastian Lindemann, Patrick Meinhardt, Marc Schumann, Andrew Stevens

**Updated**: 2024-09-18T08:22:23Z

**Summary**: The largest direct dark matter search experiments to date employ dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) with liquid noble gas targets. These detect both the primary photons generated by particle interactions in the liquid target, as well as proportional secondary scintillation light created by the ionization electrons in a strong electric field in the gas phase between the liquid-gas interface and the anode. In this work, we describe the detection of charge signals in a small-scale single-phase liquid-xenon-only TPC, that features the well-established TPC geometry with light readout above and below a cylindrical target. In the single-phase TPC, the proportional scintillation light (S2) is generated in liquid xenon in close proximity to 10 {\mu}m diameter anode wires. The detector was characterized and the proportional scintillation process was studied using the 32.1 keV and 9.4 keV signals from 83mKr decays. A charge gain factor g2 of up to (1.9 $\pm$ 0.3) PE/electron was reached at an anode voltage 4.4 kV higher than the gate electrode 5 mm below it, corresponding to (29 $\pm$ 6) photons emitted per ionization electron. The duration of S2 signals is dominated by electron diffusion and approaches the xenon de-excitation timescale for very short electron drift times. The electron drift velocity and the longitudinal diffusion constant were measured at a drift field of 470 V/cm. The results agree with the literature and demonstrate that a single-phase TPC can be operated successfully.

### ASVD: Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition for Compressing   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhihang Yuan, Yuzhang Shang, Yue Song, Qiang Wu, Yan Yan, Guangyu Sun

**Updated**: 2024-09-18T04:53:46Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a new post-training compression paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate their wider adoption. We delve into LLM weight low-rank factorization, and find that the challenges of this task stem from the outlier phenomenon in the LLM activations and the sensitivity difference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by scaling the weight matrix based on the activation distribution, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers. ASVD can compress a network by 10-20%, without compromising the performance of LLMs. Based on the success of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced. Thanks to the 50-75% reduction in the rank of the KV projection matrices, ASVD can further achieve 50% KV cache reductions without performance drop in a training-free manner.

**Summary**: We developed a jitted compiler for training Artificial Neural Networks using C++, LLVM and Cuda. It features object-oriented characteristics, strong typing, parallel workers for data pre-processing, pythonic syntax for expressions, PyTorch like model declaration and Automatic Differentiation. We implement the mechanisms of cache and pooling in order to manage VRAM, cuBLAS for high performance matrix multiplication and cuDNN for convolutional layers. Our experiments with Residual Convolutional Neural Networks on ImageNet, we reach similar speed but degraded performance. Also, the GRU network experiments show similar accuracy, but our compiler have degraded speed in that task. However, our compiler demonstrates promising results at the CIFAR-10 benchmark, in which we reach the same performance and about the same speed as PyTorch. We make the code publicly available at: https://github.com/NoSavedDATA/NoSavedKaleidoscope

**Authors**: Wei Shao, Chandra Thapa, Rayne Holland, Sarah Ali Siddiqui, Seyit Camtepe

**Updated**: 2024-09-17T15:07:05Z

**Summary**: Network slicing in 5G and the future 6G networks will enable the creation of multiple virtualized networks on a shared physical infrastructure. This innovative approach enables the provision of tailored networks to accommodate specific business types or industry users, thus delivering more customized and efficient services. However, the shared memory and cache in network slicing introduce security vulnerabilities that have yet to be fully addressed. In this paper, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based side-channel cache attack framework specifically designed for network slicing environments. Unlike traditional cache attack methods, our framework leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically identify and exploit cache locations storing sensitive information, such as authentication keys and user registration data. We assume that one slice network is compromised and demonstrate how the attacker can induce another shared slice to send registration requests, thereby estimating the cache locations of critical data. By formulating the cache timing channel attack as a reinforcement learning-driven guessing game between the attack slice and the victim slice, our model efficiently explores possible actions to pinpoint memory blocks containing sensitive information. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach, achieving a success rate of approximately 95\% to 98\% in accurately identifying the storage locations of sensitive data. This high level of accuracy underscores the potential risks in shared network slicing environments and highlights the need for robust security measures to safeguard against such advanced side-channel attacks.

**Authors**: Carsten Speckmann, Andrea Angeletti, Lukáš Kývala, David Lamprecht, Felix Herterich, Clemens Mangler, Lado Filipovic, Christoph Dellago, Cesare Franchini, Jani Kotakoski

**Updated**: 2024-09-17T11:54:24Z

**Summary**: Phosphorene, a puckered two-dimensional allotrope of phosphorus, has sparked considerable interest in recent years due to its potential especially for optoelectronic applications with its layer-number-dependant direct band gap and strongly bound excitons. However, detailed experimental characterization of its intrinsic defects as well as its defect creation characteristics under electron irradiation are scarce. Here, we report on the creation and stability of a variety of defect configurations under 60 kV electron irradiation in mono- and bilayer phosphorene including the first experimental reports of stable adatom-vacancy-complexes. Displacement cross section measurements in bilayer phosphorene yield a value of 7.7 +- 1.4 barn with an estimated lifetime of adatom-vacancy-complexes of 19.9 +- 0.7 s, while some are stable for up to 68 s under continuous electron irradiation. Surprisingly, ab initio-based simulations indicate that the complexes should readily recombine, even in structures strained by up to 3 %. The presented results will help to improve the understanding of the wide variety of defects in phosphorene, their creation, and their stability, which may enable new pathways for defect engineered phosphorene devices.

### KVPruner: Structural Pruning for Faster and Memory-Efficient Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Bo Lv, Quan Zhou, Xuanang Ding, Yan Wang, Zeming Ma

**Updated**: 2024-09-17T10:35:30Z

**Summary**: The bottleneck associated with the key-value(KV) cache presents a significant challenge during the inference processes of large language models. While depth pruning accelerates inference, it requires extensive recovery training, which can take up to two weeks. On the other hand, width pruning retains much of the performance but offers slight speed gains. To tackle these challenges, we propose KVPruner to improve model efficiency while maintaining performance. Our method uses global perplexity-based analysis to determine the importance ratio for each block and provides multiple strategies to prune non-essential KV channels within blocks. Compared to the original model, KVPruner reduces runtime memory usage by 50% and boosts throughput by over 35%. Additionally, our method requires only two hours of LoRA fine-tuning on small datasets to recover most of the performance.

### Skip TLB flushes for reused pages within mmap's
**Authors**: Frederic Schimmelpfennig, André Brinkmann, Hossein Asadi, Reza Salkhordeh

**Updated**: 2024-09-17T07:28:56Z

**Summary**: Memory access efficiency is significantly enhanced by caching recent address translations in the CPUs' Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs). However, since the operating system is not aware of which core is using a particular mapping, it flushes TLB entries across all cores where the application runs whenever addresses are unmapped, ensuring security and consistency. These TLB flushes, known as TLB shootdowns, are costly and create a performance and scalability bottleneck. A key contributor to TLB shootdowns is memory-mapped I/O, particularly during mmap-munmap cycles and page cache evictions. Often, the same physical pages are reassigned to the same process post-eviction, presenting an opportunity for the operating system to reduce the frequency of TLB shootdowns. We demonstrate, that by slightly extending the mmap function, TLB shootdowns for these "recycled pages" can be avoided.   Therefore we introduce and implement the "fast page recycling" (FPR) feature within the mmap system call. FPR-mmaps maintain security by only triggering TLB shootdowns when a page exits its recycling cycle and is allocated to a different process. To ensure consistency when FPR-mmap pointers are used, we made minor adjustments to virtual memory management to avoid the ABA problem. Unlike previous methods to mitigate shootdown effects, our approach does not require any hardware modifications and operates transparently within the existing Linux virtual memory framework.   Our evaluations across a variety of CPU, memory, and storage setups, including persistent memory and Optane SSDs, demonstrate that FPR delivers notable performance gains, with improvements of up to 28% in real-world applications and 92% in micro-benchmarks. Additionally, we show that TLB shootdowns are a significant source of bottlenecks, previously misattributed to other components of the Linux kernel.

### Resources on the Move for Smart City: A Disruptive Perspective on the   Grand Convergence of Sensing, Communications, Computing, Storage, and   Intelligence
**Authors**: Yuguang Fang, Yiqin Deng, Xianhao Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-17T04:39:04Z

**Summary**: The most commonly seen things on streets in any city are vehicles. However, most of them are used to transport people or goods. What if they also carry resources and capabilities for sensing, communications, computing, storage, and intelligence (SCCSI)? We will have a web of sensors to monitor the city, a network of powerful communicators to transport data around, a grid of computing power to conduct data analytics and machine learning (ML), a network of distributed storage to buffer/cache data/job for optimization, and a set of movable AI/ML toolboxes made available for specialized smart applications. This perspective article presents how to leverage SCCSI-empowered vehicles to design such a service network, simply called SCCSI network, to help build a smart city with a cost-effective and sustainable solution. It showcases how multi-dimensional technologies, namely, sensing, communications, computing, storage, and intelligence, converge to a unifying technology to solve grand challenges for resource demands from emerging large-scale applications. Thus, with SCCSI-empowered vehicles on the ground, over the air, and on the sea, SCCSI network can make resources and capabilities on the move, practically pushing SCCSI services to the edge! We hope this article serves as a spark to stimulate more disruptive thinking to address grand challenges of paramount importance.

### Do Large Language Models Need a Content Delivery Network?
**Authors**: Yihua Cheng, Kuntai Du, Jiayi Yao, Junchen Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-09-16T18:46:24Z

**Summary**: As the use of large language models (LLMs) expands rapidly, so does the range of knowledge needed to supplement various LLM queries. Thus, enabling flexible and efficient injection of new knowledge in LLM inference is critical. Three high-level options exist: (i) embedding the knowledge in LLM's weights (i.e., fine-tuning), (ii) including the knowledge as a part of LLM's text input (i.e., in-context learning), or (iii) injecting the KV caches of the new knowledge to LLM during prefill. This paper argues that, although fine-tuning and in-context learning are popular, using KV caches as the medium of knowledge could simultaneously enable more modular management of knowledge injection and more efficient LLM serving with low cost and fast response. To realize these benefits, we envision a Knowledge Delivery Network (KDN), a new system component in LLM services that dynamically optimizes the storage, transfer, and composition of KV cache across LLM engines and other compute and storage resources. We believe that, just like content delivery networks (CDNs), such as Akamai, enabled the success of the Internet ecosystem through their efficient data delivery, KDNs will be critical to the success of LLM applications through their efficient knowledge delivery. We have open-sourced a KDN prototype at https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

**Updated**: 2024-09-16T13:52:46Z

**Summary**: Within the RoadMap project we investigated the microphysical aspects of particle collisions during saltation on the Martian surface in laboratory experiments. Following the size distribution of ejected particles, their aerodynamic properties and aggregation status upon ejection, we now focus on the electrification and charge distribution of ejected particles. We analyzed rebound and ejection trajectories of grains in a vacuum setup with a strong electric field of 100 kV/m and deduced particle charges from their acceleration. The ejected particles have sizes of about 10 to 100 microns. They carry charges up to $10^5$ e or charge densities up to $> 10^7$ e/mm$^2$. Within the given size range, we find a small bias towards positive charges.

### Decoupling DNS Update Timing from TTL Values
**Authors**: Yehuda Afek, Ariel Litmanovich

**Updated**: 2024-09-16T11:56:09Z

**Summary**: A relatively simple safety-belt mechanism for improving DNS system availability and efficiency is proposed here. While it may seem ambitious, a careful examination shows it is both feasible and beneficial for the DNS system. The mechanism called "DNS Real-time Update" (DNSRU), a service that facilitates real-time and secure updates of cached domain records in DNS resolvers worldwide, even before the expiration of the corresponding Time To Live (TTL) values. This service allows Internet domain owners to quickly rectify any erroneous global IP address distribution, even if a long TTL value is associated with it. By addressing this critical DNS high availability issue, DNSRU eliminates the need for short TTL values and their associated drawbacks. Therefore, DNSRU DNSRU reduces the traffic load on authoritative servers while enhancing the system's fault tolerance. In this paper we show that our DNSRU design is backward compatible, supports gradual deployment, secure, efficient, and feasible.

### DARDA: Domain-Aware Real-Time Dynamic Neural Network Adaptation
**Authors**: Shahriar Rifat, Jonathan Ashdown, Francesco Restuccia

**Updated**: 2024-09-15T14:49:30Z

**Summary**: Test Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a practical solution to mitigate the performance degradation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the presence of corruption/ noise affecting inputs. Existing approaches in TTA continuously adapt the DNN, leading to excessive resource consumption and performance degradation due to accumulation of error stemming from lack of supervision. In this work, we propose Domain-Aware Real-Time Dynamic Adaptation (DARDA) to address such issues. Our key approach is to proactively learn latent representations of some corruption types, each one associated with a sub-network state tailored to correctly classify inputs affected by that corruption. After deployment, DARDA adapts the DNN to previously unseen corruptions in an unsupervised fashion by (i) estimating the latent representation of the ongoing corruption; (ii) selecting the sub-network whose associated corruption is the closest in the latent space to the ongoing corruption; and (iii) adapting DNN state, so that its representation matches the ongoing corruption. This way, DARDA is more resource efficient and can swiftly adapt to new distributions caused by different corruptions without requiring a large variety of input data. Through experiments with two popular mobile edge devices - Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson Nano - we show that DARDA reduces energy consumption and average cache memory footprint respectively by 1.74x and 2.64x with respect to the state of the art, while increasing the performance by 10.4%, 5.7% and 4.4% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and TinyImagenet.

### Language-Queried Target Sound Extraction Without Parallel Training Data
**Authors**: Hao Ma, Zhiyuan Peng, Xu Li, Yukai Li, Mingjie Shao, Qiuqiang Kong, Ju Liu

**Updated**: 2024-09-14T10:15:37Z

**Summary**: Language-queried target sound extraction (TSE) aims to extract specific sounds from mixtures based on language queries. Traditional fully-supervised training schemes require extensively annotated parallel audio-text data, which are labor-intensive. We introduce a language-free training scheme, requiring only unlabelled audio clips for TSE model training by utilizing the multi-modal representation alignment nature of the contrastive language-audio pre-trained model (CLAP). In a vanilla language-free training stage, target audio is encoded using the pre-trained CLAP audio encoder to form a condition embedding for the TSE model, while during inference, user language queries are encoded by CLAP text encoder. This straightforward approach faces challenges due to the modality gap between training and inference queries and information leakage from direct exposure to target audio during training. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented strategy. Specifically, we create an embedding cache using audio captions generated by a large language model (LLM). During training, target audio embeddings retrieve text embeddings from this cache to use as condition embeddings, ensuring consistent modalities between training and inference and eliminating information leakage. Extensive experiment results show that our retrieval-augmented approach achieves consistent and notable performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art with better generalizability.

### A Compressive Memory-based Retrieval Approach for Event Argument   Extraction
**Authors**: Wanlong Liu, Enqi Zhang, Li Zhou, Dingyi Zeng, Shaohuan Cheng, Chen Zhang, Malu Zhang, Wenyu Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-14T05:51:50Z

**Summary**: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of retrieval augmentation in the Event Argument Extraction (EAE) task. However, existing retrieval-based EAE methods have two main limitations: (1) input length constraints and (2) the gap between the retriever and the inference model. These issues limit the diversity and quality of the retrieved information. In this paper, we propose a Compressive Memory-based Retrieval (CMR) mechanism for EAE, which addresses the two limitations mentioned above. Our compressive memory, designed as a dynamic matrix that effectively caches retrieved information and supports continuous updates, overcomes the limitations of the input length. Additionally, after pre-loading all candidate demonstrations into the compressive memory, the model further retrieves and filters relevant information from memory based on the input query, bridging the gap between the retriever and the inference model. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets (RAMS, WikiEvents, ACE05), significantly outperforming existing retrieval-based EAE methods.

### WarmSwap: Sharing Dependencies for Accelerating Cold Starts in   Serverless Functions
**Authors**: Rui Li, Devesh Tiwari, Gene Cooperman

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T21:31:45Z

**Summary**: This work presents WarmSwap, a novel provider-side cold-start optimization for serverless computing. This optimization reduces cold-start time when booting and loading dependencies at runtime inside a function container. Previous approaches to the optimization of cold starts tend to fall into two categories: optimizing the infrastructure of serverless computing to benefit all serverless functions; or function-specific tuning for individual serverless functions. In contrast, WarmSwap offers a broad middle ground, which optimizes entire categories of serverless functions. WarmSwap eliminates the need to initialize middleware or software dependencies when launching a new serverless container, by migrating a pre-initialized live dependency image to the new function instance. WarmSwap respects the provider's cache constraints, as a single pre-warmed dependency image in the cache is shared among all serverless functions requiring that software dependency image. WarmSwap has been tested on seven representative functions from FunctionBench. The functions are chosen to compare with previous work. In those tests, WarmSwap accelerates cold-start executions for those serverless functions with large dependency requirements by a factor ranging from 1.2 to 2.2.

### Rethinking Programmed I/O for Fast Devices, Cheap Cores, and Coherent   Interconnects
**Authors**: Anastasiia Ruzhanskaia, Pengcheng Xu, David Cock, Timothy Roscoe

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T15:34:23Z

**Summary**: Conventional wisdom holds that an efficient interface between an OS running on a CPU and a high-bandwidth I/O device should be based on Direct Memory Access (DMA), descriptor rings, and interrupts: DMA offloads transfers from the CPU, descriptor rings provide buffering and queuing, and interrupts facilitate asynchronous interaction between cores and device with a lightweight notification mechanism. In this paper we question this wisdom in the light of modern hardware and workloads, particularly in cloud servers. We argue that the assumptions that led to this model are obsolete, and in many use-cases use of programmed I/O, where the CPU explicitly transfers data and control information to and from a device via loads and stores, actually results in a more efficient system. We quantitatively demonstrate these advantages using three use-cases: fine-grained RPC-style invocation of functions on an accelerator, offloading of operators in a streaming dataflow engine, and a network interface targeting for serverless functions. Moreover, we show that while these advantages are significant over a modern PCIe peripheral bus, a truly cache-coherent interconnect offers significant additional efficiency gains.

### Light Induced Orbital Magnetism in Metals via Inverse Faraday Effect
**Authors**: Priya Sharma, Alexander V. Balatsky

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T10:35:15Z

**Summary**: We present a microscopic calculation of the inverse Faraday effect in metals. We derive a static local magnetic moment induced on the application of high-frequency light, using the Eilenberger formulation of quasiclassical theory. We include the effect of disorder and formulate a theory applicable across the entire temperature range, in the absence of external applied fields. For light-induced electric fields of amplitude $\sim 100 kV/cm$, the induced fields are large, $\sim 0.1 T$ for metallic Nb! The predictions of our theory agree with recent experimental and theoretical results [1]. An extension of this approach to superconductors would open a new route of inducing orbital magnetic field and potentially vortices in superconductors.

### Super Monotonic Alignment Search
**Authors**: Junhyeok Lee, Hyeongju Kim

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T02:13:57Z

**Summary**: Monotonic alignment search (MAS), introduced by Glow-TTS, is one of the most popular algorithm in TTS to estimate unknown alignments between text and speech. Since this algorithm needs to search for the most probable alignment with dynamic programming by caching all paths, the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(T \times S)$. The authors of Glow-TTS run this algorithm on CPU, and while they mentioned it is difficult to parallelize, we found that MAS can be parallelized in text-length dimension and CPU execution consumes an inordinate amount of time for inter-device copy. Therefore, we implemented a Triton kernel and PyTorch JIT script to accelerate MAS on GPU without inter-device copy. As a result, Super-MAS Triton kernel is up to 72 times faster in the extreme-length case. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/supertone-inc/super-monotonic-align}.

### Learning to Compress Contexts for Efficient Knowledge-based Visual   Question Answering
**Authors**: Weixi Weng, Jieming Zhu, Hao Zhang, Xiaojun Meng, Rui Zhang, Chun Yuan

**Updated**: 2024-09-11T15:11:39Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated great zero-shot performance on visual question answering (VQA). However, when it comes to knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA), MLLMs may lack human commonsense or specialized domain knowledge to answer such questions and require obtaining necessary information from external knowledge sources. Previous works like Retrival-Augmented VQA-v2 (RAVQA-v2) focus on utilizing as much input information, such as image-based textual descriptions and retrieved knowledge, as possible to improve performance, but they all overlook the issue that with the number of input tokens increasing, inference efficiency significantly decreases, which contradicts the demands of practical applications. To address this issue, we propose Retrieval-Augmented MLLM with Compressed Contexts (RACC). RACC learns to compress and aggregate retrieved contexts, from which it generates a compact modulation in the form of Key-Value (KV) cache. This modulation is then used to adapt the downstream frozen MLLM, thereby achieving effective and efficient inference. RACC achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of 62.9% on OK-VQA. Moreover, it significantly reduces inference latency by 22.0%-59.7% compared to the prominent RAVQA-v2. Abundant experiments show RACC's broad applicability. It is compatible with various off-the-shelf MLLMs and can also handle different knowledge sources including textual and multimodal documents.

### Inf-MLLM: Efficient Streaming Inference of Multimodal Large Language   Models on a Single GPU
**Authors**: Zhenyu Ning, Jieru Zhao, Qihao Jin, Wenchao Ding, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-09-11T12:44:12Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are distinguished by their multimodal comprehensive ability and widely used in many real-world applications including GPT-4o, autonomous driving and robotics. Despite their impressive performance, the multimodal inputs always incur long context. The inference under long context requires caching massive Key and Value states (KV cache) of previous tokens, which introduces high latency and excessive memory consumption. Due to this reason, it is challenging to deploy streaming inference of MLLMs on edge devices, which largely constrains the power and usage of MLLMs in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce Inf-MLLM, an efficient inference framework for MLLMs, which enable streaming inference of MLLM on a single GPU with infinite context. Inf-MLLM is based on our key observation of the attention pattern in both LLMs and MLLMs called "attention saddles". Thanks to the newly discovered attention pattern, Inf-MLLM maintains a size-constrained KV cache by dynamically caching recent tokens and relevant tokens. Furthermore, Inf-MLLM proposes attention bias, a novel approach to enable MLLMs to capture long-term dependency. We show that Inf-MLLM enables multiple LLMs and MLLMs to achieve stable performance over 4M-token long texts and multi-round conversations with 1-hour-long videos on a single GPU. In addition, Inf-MLLM exhibits superior streaming reasoning quality than existing methods such as StreamingLLM and 2x speedup than H2O.

### Sub-cycle Nanotip Field Emission of Electrons Driven by Air Plasma   Generated THz Pulses
**Authors**: Benjamin Colmey, Rodrigo T. Paulino, David G. Cooke

**Updated**: 2024-09-11T11:40:23Z

**Summary**: Terahertz pulses generated by two-color laser plasmas have reported peak field strengths exceeding MV/cm, and when illuminating metal nanotips the near-field enhancement at the tip apex should result in extremely high bunch charges and electron energies via sub-cycle cold field emission. Here, electron emission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long filament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch charges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values expected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector. Investigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting vector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal restructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring significantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm, consistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their dependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our results surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of magnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing these by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is proposed.

### In-Loop Filtering via Trained Look-Up Tables
**Authors**: Zhuoyuan Li, Jiacheng Li, Yao Li, Li Li, Dong Liu, Feng Wu

**Updated**: 2024-09-11T08:12:55Z

**Summary**: In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology for removing the artifacts in image/video coding standards. Recently, neural network-based in-loop filtering methods achieve remarkable coding gains beyond the capability of advanced video coding standards, which becomes a powerful coding tool candidate for future video coding standards. However, the utilization of deep neural networks brings heavy time and computational complexity, and high demands of high-performance hardware, which is challenging to apply to the general uses of coding scene. To address this limitation, inspired by explorations in image restoration, we propose an efficient and practical in-loop filtering scheme by adopting the Look-up Table (LUT). We train the DNN of in-loop filtering within a fixed filtering reference range, and cache the output values of the DNN into a LUT via traversing all possible inputs. At testing time in the coding process, the filtered pixel is generated by locating input pixels (to-be-filtered pixel with reference pixels) and interpolating cached filtered pixel values. To further enable the large filtering reference range with the limited storage cost of LUT, we introduce the enhanced indexing mechanism in the filtering process, and clipping/finetuning mechanism in the training. The proposed method is implemented into the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) reference software, VTM-11.0. Experimental results show that the ultrafast, very fast, and fast mode of the proposed method achieves on average 0.13%/0.34%/0.51%, and 0.10%/0.27%/0.39% BD-rate reduction, under the all intra (AI) and random access (RA) configurations. Especially, our method has friendly time and computational complexity, only 101%/102%-104%/108% time increase with 0.13-0.93 kMACs/pixel, and only 164-1148 KB storage cost for a single model. Our solution may shed light on the journey of practical neural network-based coding tool evolution.

### Exploiting Deep Reinforcement Learning for Edge Caching in Cell-Free   Massive MIMO Systems
**Authors**: Yu Zhang, Shuaifei Chen, Jiayi Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-11T02:33:06Z

**Summary**: Cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output is promising to meet the stringent quality-of-experience (QoE) requirements of railway wireless communications by coordinating many successional access points (APs) to serve the onboard users coherently. A key challenge is how to deliver the desired contents timely due to the radical changing propagation environment caused by the growing train speed. In this paper, we propose to proactively cache the likely-requesting contents at the upcoming APs which perform the coherent transmission to reduce end-to-end delay. A long-term QoE-maximization problem is formulated and two cache placement algorithms are proposed. One is based on heuristic convex optimization (HCO) and the other exploits deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with soft actor-critic (SAC). Compared to the conventional benchmark, numerical results show the advantage of our proposed algorithms on QoE and hit probability. With the advanced DRL model, SAC outperforms HCO on QoE by predicting the user requests accurately.

### With Greater Text Comes Greater Necessity: Inference-Time Training Helps   Long Text Generation
**Authors**: Y. Wang, D. Ma, D. Cai

**Updated**: 2024-09-11T02:22:58Z

**Summary**: Long text generation, such as novel writing and discourse-level translation with extremely long contexts, presents significant challenges to current language models. Existing methods mainly focus on extending the model's context window through strategies like length extrapolation. However, these approaches demand substantial hardware resources during the training and/or inference phases. Our proposed method, Temp-Lora, introduces an alternative concept. Instead of relying on the KV cache to store all context information, we embeds this information directly into a temporary Lora module. In the process of long text generation, this module is progressively trained with text generated previously. This approach not only efficiently preserves contextual knowledge but also prevents any permanent alteration to the model's parameters given that the module is discarded post-generation. Extensive experiments on the PG19 language modeling benchmark and the GuoFeng discourse-level translation benchmark validate the effectiveness of Temp-Lora. Our results show that: 1) Temp-Lora substantially enhances generation quality for long text, as indicated by a 13.2% decrease in perplexity (PPL) on a subset of PG19, and a 29.3% decrease in PPL along with a 113.2% increase in BLEU score on a subset of GuoFeng, 2) Temp-Lora is compatible with and enhances most existing long text generation methods, and 3) Temp-Lora can greatly reduce computational costs by shortening the context window. For example, we can ensure a moderate improvement in generation quality (a decrease of 3.8% in PPL) while enabling a 51.5% memory usage reduction and a 60.0% decrease in latency for inference.

### DACAT: Dual-stream Adaptive Clip-aware Time Modeling for Robust Online   Surgical Phase Recognition
**Authors**: Kaixiang Yang, Qiang Li, Zhiwei Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-10T04:58:48Z

**Summary**: Surgical phase recognition has become a crucial requirement in laparoscopic surgery, enabling various clinical applications like surgical risk forecasting. Current methods typically identify the surgical phase using individual frame-wise embeddings as the fundamental unit for time modeling. However, this approach is overly sensitive to current observations, often resulting in discontinuous and erroneous predictions within a complete surgical phase. In this paper, we propose DACAT, a novel dual-stream model that adaptively learns clip-aware context information to enhance the temporal relationship. In one stream, DACAT pretrains a frame encoder, caching all historical frame-wise features. In the other stream, DACAT fine-tunes a new frame encoder to extract the frame-wise feature at the current moment. Additionally, a max clip-response read-out (Max-R) module is introduced to bridge the two streams by using the current frame-wise feature to adaptively fetch the most relevant past clip from the feature cache. The clip-aware context feature is then encoded via cross-attention between the current frame and its fetched adaptive clip, and further utilized to enhance the time modeling for accurate online surgical phase recognition. The benchmark results on three public datasets, i.e., Cholec80, M2CAI16, and AutoLaparo, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DACAT over existing state-of-the-art methods, with improvements in Jaccard scores of at least 4.5%, 4.6%, and 2.7%, respectively. Our code and models have been released at https://github.com/kk42yy/DACAT.

### Design and Implementation of Online Live Streaming System Using A 3D   Engine
**Authors**: Aizierjiang Aiersilan

**Updated**: 2024-09-10T04:24:22Z

**Summary**: With the growing demand for live video streaming, there is an increasing need for low-latency and high-quality transmission, especially with the advent of 5G networks. While 5G offers hardware-level improvements, effective software solutions for minimizing latency remain essential. Current methods, such as multi-channel streaming, fail to address latency issues fundamentally, often only adding new channels without optimizing overall performance. This thesis proposes a novel approach using a 3D engine (e.g., Unity 3D) to stream multi-input video data through a single channel with reduced latency. By leveraging 3D engine capabilities, such as World/Screen Space Cameras, 3D Canvases, and Webcam Textures, the proposed system consolidates video streams from multiple external cameras into a unified, low-latency output. The affiliated project of this thesis demonstrates the implementation of a low-latency multi-channel live video streaming system. It employs the RTSP protocol and examines video encoding techniques, alongside a client-side application based on Unity 3D. The system architecture includes a WebSocket server for persistent connections, an HTTP server for communication, a MySQL database for storage, Redis for caching, and Nginx for load balancing. Each module operates independently, ensuring flexibility and scalability in the system's design. A key innovation of this system is its use of a 3D scene to map multiple video inputs onto a virtual canvas, recorded by an in-engine camera for transmission. This design minimizes redundant data, enabling an efficient and director-guided live streaming network. The thesis concludes by discussing challenges encountered during the project and provides solutions for future improvement.

### Flash Cache: Reducing Bias in Radiance Cache Based Inverse Rendering
**Authors**: Benjamin Attal, Dor Verbin, Ben Mildenhall, Peter Hedman, Jonathan T. Barron, Matthew O'Toole, Pratul P. Srinivasan

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T17:59:57Z

**Summary**: State-of-the-art techniques for 3D reconstruction are largely based on volumetric scene representations, which require sampling multiple points to compute the color arriving along a ray. Using these representations for more general inverse rendering -- reconstructing geometry, materials, and lighting from observed images -- is challenging because recursively path-tracing such volumetric representations is expensive. Recent works alleviate this issue through the use of radiance caches: data structures that store the steady-state, infinite-bounce radiance arriving at any point from any direction. However, these solutions rely on approximations that introduce bias into the renderings and, more importantly, into the gradients used for optimization. We present a method that avoids these approximations while remaining computationally efficient. In particular, we leverage two techniques to reduce variance for unbiased estimators of the rendering equation: (1) an occlusion-aware importance sampler for incoming illumination and (2) a fast cache architecture that can be used as a control variate for the radiance from a high-quality, but more expensive, volumetric cache. We show that by removing these biases our approach improves the generality of radiance cache based inverse rendering, as well as increasing quality in the presence of challenging light transport effects such as specular reflections.

**Authors**: Yuntian Deng, Wenting Zhao, Jack Hessel, Xiang Ren, Claire Cardie, Yejin Choi

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T10:04:00Z

**Summary**: The increasing availability of real-world conversation data offers exciting opportunities for researchers to study user-chatbot interactions. However, the sheer volume of this data makes manually examining individual conversations impractical. To overcome this challenge, we introduce WildVis, an interactive tool that enables fast, versatile, and large-scale conversation analysis. WildVis provides search and visualization capabilities in the text and embedding spaces based on a list of criteria. To manage million-scale datasets, we implemented optimizations including search index construction, embedding precomputation and compression, and caching to ensure responsive user interactions within seconds. We demonstrate WildVis' utility through three case studies: facilitating chatbot misuse research, visualizing and comparing topic distributions across datasets, and characterizing user-specific conversation patterns. WildVis is open-source and designed to be extendable, supporting additional datasets and customized search and visualization functionalities.

### Cooperative Learning-Based Framework for VNF Caching and Placement   Optimization over Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks
**Authors**: Khai Doan, Marios Avgeris, Aris Leivadeas, Ioannis Lambadaris, Wonjae Shin

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T08:39:50Z

**Summary**: Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks (LSNs) are integral to supporting a broad range of modern applications, which are typically modeled as Service Function Chains (SFCs). Each SFC is composed of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), where each VNF performs a specific task. In this work, we tackle two key challenges in deploying SFCs across an LSN. Firstly, we aim to optimize the long-term system performance by minimizing the average end-to-end SFC execution delay, given that each satellite comes with a pre-installed/cached subset of VNFs. To achieve optimal SFC placement, we formulate an offline Dynamic Programming (DP) equation. To overcome the challenges associated with DP, such as its complexity, the need for probability knowledge, and centralized decision-making, we put forth an online Multi-Agent Q-Learning (MAQL) solution. Our MAQL approach addresses convergence issues in the non-stationary LSN environment by enabling satellites to share learning parameters and update their Q-tables based on distinct rules for their selected actions. Secondly, to determine the optimal VNF subsets for satellite caching, we develop a Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based learning mechanism that operates both offline and continuously in the background during runtime. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MAQL approach achieves near-optimal performance comparable to the DP model and significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, the BO-based approach effectively enhances the request serving rate over time.

### InstInfer: In-Storage Attention Offloading for Cost-Effective   Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Xiurui Pan, Endian Li, Qiao Li, Shengwen Liang, Yizhou Shan, Ke Zhou, Yingwei Luo, Xiaolin Wang, Jie Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T06:06:44Z

**Summary**: The widespread of Large Language Models (LLMs) marks a significant milestone in generative AI. Nevertheless, the increasing context length and batch size in offline LLM inference escalate the memory requirement of the key-value (KV) cache, which imposes a huge burden on the GPU VRAM, especially for resource-constraint scenarios (e.g., edge computing and personal devices). Several cost-effective solutions leverage host memory or SSDs to reduce storage costs for offline inference scenarios and improve the throughput. Nevertheless, they suffer from significant performance penalties imposed by intensive KV cache accesses due to limited PCIe bandwidth. To address these issues, we propose InstInfer, a novel LLM inference system that offloads the most performance-critical computation (i.e., attention in decoding phase) and data (i.e., KV cache) parts to Computational Storage Drives (CSDs), which minimize the enormous KV transfer overheads. InstInfer designs a dedicated flash-aware in-storage attention engine with KV cache management mechanisms to exploit the high internal bandwidths of CSDs instead of being limited by the PCIe bandwidth. The optimized P2P transmission between GPU and CSDs further reduces data migration overheads. Experimental results demonstrate that for a 13B model using an NVIDIA A6000 GPU, InstInfer improves throughput for long-sequence inference by up to 11.1$\times$, compared to existing SSD-based solutions such as FlexGen.

### Training-Free Style Consistent Image Synthesis with Condition and Mask   Guidance in E-Commerce
**Authors**: Guandong Li

**Updated**: 2024-09-07T07:50:13Z

**Summary**: Generating style-consistent images is a common task in the e-commerce field, and current methods are largely based on diffusion models, which have achieved excellent results. This paper introduces the concept of the QKV (query/key/value) level, referring to modifications in the attention maps (self-attention and cross-attention) when integrating UNet with image conditions. Without disrupting the product's main composition in e-commerce images, we aim to use a train-free method guided by pre-set conditions. This involves using shared KV to enhance similarity in cross-attention and generating mask guidance from the attention map to cleverly direct the generation of style-consistent images. Our method has shown promising results in practical applications.

### MiniCache: KV Cache Compression in Depth Dimension for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Akide Liu, Jing Liu, Zizheng Pan, Yefei He, Gholamreza Haffari, Bohan Zhuang

**Updated**: 2024-09-07T02:52:29Z

**Summary**: A critical approach for efficiently deploying computationally demanding large language models (LLMs) is Key-Value (KV) caching. The KV cache stores key-value states of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for repetitive computations and thereby lowering latency in autoregressive generation. However, the size of the KV cache grows linearly with sequence length, posing challenges for applications requiring long context input and extensive sequence generation. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach, called MiniCache, to compress the KV cache across layers from a novel depth perspective, significantly reducing the memory footprint for LLM inference. Our approach is based on the observation that KV cache states exhibit high similarity between the adjacent layers in the middle-to-deep portion of LLMs. To facilitate merging, we propose disentangling the states into the magnitude and direction components, interpolating the directions of the state vectors while preserving their lengths unchanged. Furthermore, we introduce a token retention strategy to keep highly distinct state pairs unmerged, thus preserving the information with minimal additional storage overhead. Our MiniCache is training-free and general, complementing existing KV cache compression strategies, such as quantization and sparsity. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of MiniCache utilizing various models including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, Phi-3, Mistral, and Mixtral across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its exceptional performance in achieving superior compression ratios and high throughput. On the ShareGPT dataset, LLaMA-2-7B with 4-bit MiniCache achieves a remarkable compression ratio of up to 5.02x, enhances inference throughput by approximately 5x, and reduces the memory footprint by 41% compared to the FP16 full cache baseline, all while maintaining near-lossless performance.

### QET: Enhancing Quantized LLM Parameters and KV cache Compression through   Element Substitution and Residual Clustering
**Authors**: Yanshu Wang, Wang Li, Zhaoqian Yao, Tong Yang

**Updated**: 2024-09-06T08:28:01Z

**Summary**: The matrix quantization entails representing matrix elements in a more space-efficient form to reduce storage usage, with dequantization restoring the original matrix for use. We formulate the Quantization Error Minimization (QEM) problem as minimizing the distance between a matrix before and after quantization, under the condition that the quantized matrix occupies the same memory space. Matrix quantization is crucial in various applications, including Large Language Models (LLMs) weight quantization, vector databases, KV cache quantization, graph compression, and image compression. Recent advancements in LLMs, such as GPT-4 and BERT, have highlighted the importance of matrix compression due to the large size of parameters and KV cache, which are stored as matrices.   We propose Quantum Entanglement Trees (QET) to address the QEM problem by leveraging the local orderliness of matrix elements, involving iterative element swapping to form a locally ordered matrix. This matrix is then grouped and quantized by columns. To enhance QET, we introduce two optimizations: further quantizing residuals to reduce MSE, and using masking and batch processing to accelerate the algorithm.   Experimental results demonstrate that QET can effectively reduce MSE to 5.05%, 13.33%, and 11.89% of the current best method on the LLM dataset, K cache, and V cache, respectively. Our contributions include the abstraction of the QEM problem, the design of the QET algorithm, and the proposal of two optimizations to improve accuracy and speed.

### A First Look At Efficient And Secure On-Device LLM Inference Against KV   Leakage
**Authors**: Huan Yang, Deyu Zhang, Yudong Zhao, Yuanchun Li, Yunxin Liu

**Updated**: 2024-09-06T06:16:55Z

**Summary**: Running LLMs on end devices has garnered significant attention recently due to their advantages in privacy preservation. With the advent of lightweight LLM models and specially designed GPUs, on-device LLM inference has achieved the necessary accuracy and performance metrics. However, we have identified that LLM inference on GPUs can leak privacy-sensitive intermediate information, specifically the KV pairs. An attacker could exploit these KV pairs to reconstruct the entire user conversation, leading to significant vulnerabilities. Existing solutions, such as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), are either too computation-intensive or resource-limited. To address these issues, we designed KV-Shield, which operates in two phases. In the initialization phase, it permutes the weight matrices so that all KV pairs are correspondingly permuted. During the runtime phase, the attention vector is inversely permuted to ensure the correctness of the layer output. All permutation-related operations are executed within the TEE, ensuring that insecure GPUs cannot access the original KV pairs, thus preventing conversation reconstruction. Finally, we theoretically analyze the correctness of KV-Shield, along with its advantages and overhead.

### Potential and Limitation of High-Frequency Cores and Caches
**Authors**: Kunal Pai, Anusheel Nand, Jason Lowe-Power

**Updated**: 2024-09-05T20:21:54Z

**Summary**: This paper explores the potential of cryogenic semiconductor computing and superconductor electronics as promising alternatives to traditional semiconductor devices. As semiconductor devices face challenges such as increased leakage currents and reduced performance at higher temperatures, these novel technologies offer high performance and low power computation. Conventional semiconductor electronics operating at cryogenic temperatures (below -150{\deg}C or 123.15 K) can benefit from reduced leakage currents and improved electron mobility. On the other hand, superconductor electronics, operating below 10 K, allow electrons to flow without resistance, offering the potential for ultra-low-power, high-speed computation. This study presents a comprehensive performance modeling and analysis of these technologies and provides insights into their potential benefits and limitations. We implement models of in-order and out-of-order cores operating at high clock frequencies associated with superconductor electronics and cryogenic semiconductor computing in gem5. We evaluate the performance of these components using workloads representative of real-world applications like NPB, SPEC CPU2006, and GAPBS. Our results show the potential speedups achievable by these components and the limitations posed by cache bandwidth. This work provides valuable insights into the performance implications and design trade-offs associated with cryogenic and superconductor technologies, laying the foundation for future research in this field using gem5.

### Libra: Architectural Support For Principled, Secure And Efficient   Balanced Execution On High-End Processors (Extended Version)
**Authors**: Hans Winderix, Marton Bognar, Lesly-Ann Daniel, Frank Piessens

**Updated**: 2024-09-05T17:56:19Z

**Summary**: Control-flow leakage (CFL) attacks enable an attacker to expose control-flow decisions of a victim program via side-channel observations. Linearization (i.e., elimination) of secret-dependent control flow is the main countermeasure against these attacks, yet it comes at a non-negligible cost. Conversely, balancing secret-dependent branches often incurs a smaller overhead, but is notoriously insecure on high-end processors. Hence, linearization has been widely believed to be the only effective countermeasure against CFL attacks. In this paper, we challenge this belief and investigate an unexplored alternative: how to securely balance secret-dependent branches on higher-end processors?   We propose Libra, a generic and principled hardware-software codesign to efficiently address CFL on high-end processors. We perform a systematic classification of hardware primitives leaking control flow from the literature, and provide guidelines to handle them with our design. Importantly, Libra enables secure control-flow balancing without the need to disable performance-critical hardware such as the instruction cache and the prefetcher. We formalize the semantics of Libra and propose a code transformation algorithm for securing programs, which we prove correct and secure. Finally, we implement and evaluate Libra on an out-of-order RISC-V processor, showing performance overhead on par with insecure balanced code, and outperforming state-of-the-art linearized code by 19.3%.

### Enabling Practical and Privacy-Preserving Image Processing
**Authors**: Chao Wang, Shubing Yang, Xiaoyan Sun, Jun Dai, Dongfang Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-09-05T14:22:02Z

**Summary**: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computations on encrypted data, preserving confidentiality without the need for decryption. However, FHE is often hindered by significant performance overhead, particularly for high-precision and complex data like images. Due to serious efficiency issues, traditional FHE methods often encrypt images by monolithic data blocks (such as pixel rows), instead of pixels. However, this strategy compromises the advantages of homomorphic operations and disables pixel-level image processing. In this study, we address these challenges by proposing and implementing a pixel-level homomorphic encryption approach, iCHEETAH, based on the CKKS scheme. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce three novel caching mechanisms to pre-encrypt radix values or frequently occurring pixel values, substantially reducing redundant encryption operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 19-fold improvement in encryption speed compared to the original CKKS, while maintaining high image quality. Additionally, real-world image applications such as mean filtering, brightness enhancement, image matching and watermarking are tested based on FHE, showcasing up to a 91.53% speed improvement. We also proved that our method is IND-CPA (Indistinguishability under Chosen Plaintext Attack) secure, providing strong encryption security. These results underscore the practicality and efficiency of iCHEETAH, marking a significant advancement in privacy-preserving image processing at scale.

### SELCC: Coherent Caching over Compute-Limited Disaggregated Memory
**Authors**: Ruihong Wang, Jianguo Wang, Walid G. Aref

**Updated**: 2024-09-05T01:12:04Z

**Summary**: Disaggregating memory from compute offers the opportunity to better utilize stranded memory in data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute nodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes to save on round-trip communication cost between the disaggregated memory and the compute nodes. However, the limited computing power on the disaggregated memory servers makes it challenging to maintain cache coherence among multiple compute-side caches over disaggregated shared memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a Shared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence without imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. SELCC builds on a one-sided shared-exclusive latch protocol by introducing lazy latch release and invalidation messages among the compute nodes so that it can guarantee both data access atomicity and cache coherence. SELCC minimizes communication round-trips by embedding the current cache copy holder IDs into RDMA latch words and prioritizes local concurrency control over global concurrency control. We instantiate the SELCC protocol onto compute-sided cache, forming an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory. This abstraction layer provides main-memory-like APIs to upper-level applications, and thus enabling existing data structures and algorithms to function over disaggregated memory with minimal code change. To demonstrate the usability of SELCC, we implement a B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms over SELCC's APIs. Micro-benchmark results show that the SELCC protocol achieves better performance compared to RPC-based cache-coherence protocols. Additionally, YCSB and TPC-C benchmarks indicate that applications over SELCC can achieve comparable or superior performance against competitors over disaggregated memory.

### Simultaneous Masking, Not Prompting Optimization: A Paradigm Shift in   Fine-tuning LLMs for Simultaneous Translation
**Authors**: Matthew Raffel, Victor Agostinelli, Lizhong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-05T01:06:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.

### SparQ Attention: Bandwidth-Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Luka Ribar, Ivan Chelombiev, Luke Hudlass-Galley, Charlie Blake, Carlo Luschi, Douglas Orr

**Updated**: 2024-09-04T10:04:52Z

**Summary**: The computational difficulties of large language model (LLM) inference remain a significant obstacle to their widespread deployment. The need for many applications to support long input sequences and process them in large batches typically causes token-generation to be bottlenecked by data transfer. For this reason, we introduce SparQ Attention, a technique for increasing the inference throughput of LLMs by utilising memory bandwidth more efficiently within the attention layers, through selective fetching of the cached history. Our proposed technique can be applied directly to off-the-shelf LLMs during inference, without requiring any modification to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. We show that SparQ Attention brings up to 8x savings in attention data transfers without substantial drops in accuracy, by evaluating Llama 2 and 3, Mistral, Gemma and Pythia models on a wide range of downstream tasks.

**Updated**: 2024-09-04T07:13:01Z

**Summary**: KV Vel is a non-eclipsing short-period (P = 0.3571 days) close binary containing a very hot subdwarf primary (77000 K) and a cool low-mass secondary star (3400 K) that is located at the center of the planetary nebula DS 1. The changes in the orbital period of the close binary were analyzed based on 262 new times of light maximum together with those compiled from the literature. It is discovered that the O-C curve shows a small-amplitude (0.0034 days) cyclic period variation with a period of 29.55 years. The explanation by the solar-type magnetic activity cycles of the cool component is ruled out because the required energies are much larger than the total radiant energy of this component in a whole cycle. Therefore, the cyclic variation was plausibly explained as the light-travel time effect via the presence of a tertiary component, which is supported by the periodic changes of the O-C curve and the rather symmetric and stable light curves obtained by TESS. The mass of the tertiary companion is determined to be M_3sini' = 0.060(7) M_sun. If the third body is coplanar with the central binary (i.e., i' = 62.5{\deg}), the mass of the tertiary component is computed as M_3 ~ 0.068 M\sun, and thus it would be below the stable hydrogen-burning limit and is a brown dwarf. The orbital separation is shorter than 9.35 astronomical units (AU). KV Vel together with its surrounding planetary nebula and the brown-dwarf companion may be formed through the common-envelope evolution after the primary filled its Roche lobe during the early asymptotic giant branch stage.

### Contemporary Model Compression on Large Language Models Inference
**Authors**: Dong Liu

**Updated**: 2024-09-03T15:35:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by achieving state-of-the-art results across a variety of tasks. However, the computational demands of LLM inference, including high memory consumption and slow processing speeds, pose significant challenges for real-world applications, particularly on resource-constrained devices. Efficient inference is crucial for scaling the deployment of LLMs to a broader range of platforms, including mobile and edge devices.   This survey explores contemporary techniques in model compression that address these challenges by reducing the size and computational requirements of LLMs while maintaining their performance. We focus on model-level compression methods, including quantization, knowledge distillation, and pruning, as well as system-level optimizations like KV cache efficient design. Each of these methodologies offers a unique approach to optimizing LLMs, from reducing numerical precision to transferring knowledge between models and structurally simplifying neural networks. Additionally, we discuss emerging trends in system-level design that further enhance the efficiency of LLM inference. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current advancements in model compression and their potential to make LLMs more accessible and practical for diverse applications.

### A Fresh Take on Stale Embeddings: Improving Dense Retriever Training   with Corrector Networks
**Authors**: Nicholas Monath, Will Grathwohl, Michael Boratko, Rob Fergus, Andrew McCallum, Manzil Zaheer

**Updated**: 2024-09-03T13:29:13Z

**Summary**: In dense retrieval, deep encoders provide embeddings for both inputs and targets, and the softmax function is used to parameterize a distribution over a large number of candidate targets (e.g., textual passages for information retrieval). Significant challenges arise in training such encoders in the increasingly prevalent scenario of (1) a large number of targets, (2) a computationally expensive target encoder model, (3) cached target embeddings that are out-of-date due to ongoing training of target encoder parameters. This paper presents a simple and highly scalable response to these challenges by training a small parametric corrector network that adjusts stale cached target embeddings, enabling an accurate softmax approximation and thereby sampling of up-to-date high scoring "hard negatives." We theoretically investigate the generalization properties of our proposed target corrector, relating the complexity of the network, staleness of cached representations, and the amount of training data. We present experimental results on large benchmark dense retrieval datasets as well as on QA with retrieval augmented language models. Our approach matches state-of-the-art results even when no target embedding updates are made during training beyond an initial cache from the unsupervised pre-trained model, providing a 4-80x reduction in re-embedding computational cost.

### Reward Augmentation in Reinforcement Learning for Testing Distributed   Systems
**Authors**: Andrea Borgarelli, Constantin Enea, Rupak Majumdar, Srinidhi Nagendra

**Updated**: 2024-09-02T15:07:05Z

**Summary**: Bugs in popular distributed protocol implementations have been the source of many downtimes in popular internet services. We describe a randomized testing approach for distributed protocol implementations based on reinforcement learning. Since the natural reward structure is very sparse, the key to successful exploration in reinforcement learning is reward augmentation. We show two different techniques that build on one another. First, we provide a decaying exploration bonus based on the discovery of new states -- the reward decays as the same state is visited multiple times. The exploration bonus captures the intuition from coverage-guided fuzzing of prioritizing new coverage points; in contrast to other schemes, we show that taking the maximum of the bonus and the Q-value leads to more effective exploration. Second, we provide waypoints to the algorithm as a sequence of predicates that capture interesting semantic scenarios. Waypoints exploit designer insight about the protocol and guide the exploration to ``interesting'' parts of the state space. Our reward structure ensures that new episodes can reliably get to deep interesting states even without execution caching. We have implemented our algorithm in Go. Our evaluation on three large benchmarks (RedisRaft, Etcd, and RSL) shows that our algorithm can significantly outperform baseline approaches in terms of coverage and bug finding.

### Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models
**Authors**: Poppy Collis, Ryan Singh, Paul F Kinghorn, Christopher L Buckley

**Updated**: 2024-09-02T08:41:45Z

**Summary**: An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work in computational neuroscience has considered this functional integration of discrete and continuous variables during decision-making under the formalism of active inference (Parr, Friston & de Vries, 2017; Parr & Friston, 2018). However, their focus is on the expressive physical implementation of categorical decisions and the hierarchical mixed generative model is assumed to be known. As a consequence, it is unclear how this framework might be extended to learning. We therefore present a novel hierarchical hybrid active inference agent in which a high-level discrete active inference planner sits above a low-level continuous active inference controller. We make use of recent work in recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) which implement end-to-end learning of meaningful discrete representations via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). The representations learned by the rSLDS inform the structure of the hybrid decision-making agent and allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and successful planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.

### Throughput Optimization in Cache-aided Networks: An Opportunistic   Probing and Scheduling Approach
**Authors**: Zhou Zhang, Saman Atapattu, Yizhu Wang, Marco Di Renzo

**Updated**: 2024-09-02T02:36:22Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the challenges of throughput optimization in wireless cache-aided cooperative networks. We propose an opportunistic cooperative probing and scheduling strategy for efficient content delivery. The strategy involves the base station probing the relaying channels and cache states of multiple cooperative nodes, thereby enabling opportunistic user scheduling for content delivery. Leveraging the theory of Sequentially Planned Decision (SPD) optimization, we dynamically formulate decisions on cooperative probing and stopping time. Our proposed Reward Expected Thresholds (RET)-based strategy optimizes opportunistic probing and scheduling. This approach significantly enhances system throughput by exploiting gains from local caching, cooperative transmission and time diversity. Simulations confirm the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed Media Access Control (MAC) strategy.

**Authors**: Jiajie Li, Jan-Niklas Schmelzle, Yixiao Du, Simon Heumos, Andrea Guarracino, Giulia Guidi, Pjotr Prins, Erik Garrison, Zhiru Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-02T00:05:20Z

**Summary**: Computational Pangenomics is an emerging field that studies genetic variation using a graph structure encompassing multiple genomes. Visualizing pangenome graphs is vital for understanding genome diversity. Yet, handling large graphs can be challenging due to the high computational demands of the graph layout process.   In this work, we conduct a thorough performance characterization of a state-of-the-art pangenome graph layout algorithm, revealing significant data-level parallelism, which makes GPUs a promising option for compute acceleration. However, irregular data access and the algorithm's memory-bound nature present significant hurdles. To overcome these challenges, we develop a solution implementing three key optimizations: a cache-friendly data layout, coalesced random states, and warp merging. Additionally, we propose a quantitative metric for scalable evaluation of pangenome layout quality.   Evaluated on 24 human whole-chromosome pangenomes, our GPU-based solution achieves a 57.3x speedup over the state-of-the-art multithreaded CPU baseline without layout quality loss, reducing execution time from hours to minutes.

### Towards 3D AI Hardware: Fine-Grain Hardware Characterization of 3D   Stacks for Heterogeneous System Integration & AI Systems
**Authors**: Eren Kurshan, Paul Franzon

**Updated**: 2024-08-31T15:45:44Z

**Summary**: 3D integration offers key advantages in improving system performance and efficiency for the End-of-Scaling era. It enables the incorporation of heterogeneous system components and disparate technologies, eliminates off-chip communication constraints, reduces on-chip latency and total power dissipation. Moreover, AIs demand for increased computational power, larger GPU cache capacity, energy efficiency and low power custom AI hardware integration all serve as drivers for 3D integration. Although 3D advantages such as enhanced interconnectivity and increased performance have been demonstrated through numerous technology sites, heterogeneous 3D system design raises numerous unanswered questions. Among the primary challenges are the temperature and lifetime reliability issues caused by the complex interaction patterns among system components. Such interactions are harder to model with current modeling tools and require detailed hardware characterization. This study presents the latest drivers for 3D integration and the resulting need for hardware emulation frameworks. It then presents a design to profile power, temperature, noise, inter-layer bandwidth and lifetime reliability characterization that can emulate a wide range of stacking alternatives. This framework allows for controlling activity levels at the macro-level, along with customized sensor infrastructure to characterize heat propagation, inter-layer noise, power delivery, reliability and inter-connectivity as well as the interactions among critical design objectives.

### Resource Management for IRS-Assisted Full-Duplex Integrated Sensing,   Communication and Computing Systems
**Authors**: Wanming Hao, Xue Wu, Xingwang Li, Gangcan Sun, Qingqing Wu, Liang Yang

**Updated**: 2024-08-31T06:33:50Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we investigate an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted full-duplex (FD) integrated sensing, communication and computing system. Specifically, an FD base station (BS) provides service for uplink and downlink transmission, and a local cache is connected to the BS through a backhaul link to store data. Meanwhile, active sensing elements are deployed on the IRS to receive target echo signals. On this basis, in order to evaluate the overall performance of the system under consideration, we propose a system utility maximization problem while ensuring the sensing quality, expressed as the difference between the sum of communication throughput, total computation bits (offloading bits and local computation bits) and the total backhaul cost for content delivery. This makes the problem difficult to solve due to the highly non-convex coupling of the optimization variables. To effectively solve this problem, we first design the most effective caching strategy. Then, we develop an algorithm based on weighted minimum mean square error, alternative direction method of multipliers, majorization-minimization framework, semi-definite relaxation techniques, and several complex transformations to jointly solve the optimization variables. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the utility performance of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme compared with the baseline scheme.

**Authors**: Advait Gilankar, Abishek Katta, Nabasindhu Das, Nidhin Kurian Kalarickal

**Updated**: 2024-08-31T04:20:58Z

**Summary**: This work demonstrates high-performance vertical NiO/Ga2O3 heterojunction diodes (HJDs) with a 2-step space-modulated junction termination extension. Distinct from the current state-of-the-art Ga2O3 HJDs, we achieve breakdown voltage exceeding 3 kV with a low turn on voltage (VON) of 0.8V, estimated at a forward current density (IF) of 1 A-cm-2. The measured devices exhibit excellent turn-on characteristics achieving 100 A-cm-2 current density at a forward bias of 1.5V along with a low differential specific on-resistance (Ron,sp) of 4.4 m{\Omega}-cm2. The SM-JTE was realized using concentric NiO rings with varying widths and spacing that approximates a gradual reduction in JTE charge. The unipolar figure of merit (FOM) calculated exceeds 2 GW-cm2 and is among the best reported for devices with a sub-1V turn-on. The fabricated devices also displayed minimal change in forward I-V characteristics post reverse bias stress of 3 kV applied during breakdown voltage testing.

### Adaptive Multi-Resolution Encoding for Interactive Large-Scale Volume   Visualization through Functional Approximation
**Authors**: Jianxin Sun, David Lenz, Hongfeng Yu, Tom Peterka

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T18:04:53Z

**Summary**: Functional approximation as a high-order continuous representation provides a more accurate value and gradient query compared to the traditional discrete volume representation. Volume visualization directly rendered from functional approximation generates high-quality rendering results without high-order artifacts caused by trilinear interpolations. However, querying an encoded functional approximation is computationally expensive, especially when the input dataset is large, making functional approximation impractical for interactive visualization. In this paper, we proposed a novel functional approximation multi-resolution representation, Adaptive-FAM, which is lightweight and fast to query. We also design a GPU-accelerated out-of-core multi-resolution volume visualization framework that directly utilizes the Adaptive-FAM representation to generate high-quality rendering with interactive responsiveness. Our method can not only dramatically decrease the caching time, one of the main contributors to input latency, but also effectively improve the cache hit rate through prefetching. Our approach significantly outperforms the traditional function approximation method in terms of input latency while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

**Authors**: Bobby Xiong, Davide Fioriti, Fabian Neumann, Iegor Riepin, Tom Brown

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T10:26:50Z

**Summary**: This paper provides the background, methodology and validation for constructing a representation of the European high-voltage grid, including and above 200 kV, based on public data provided by OpenStreetMap. The model-independent grid dataset is published under the Open Data Commons Open Database (ODbL 1.0) licence and can be used for large-scale electricity as well as energy system modelling. The dataset and workflow are provided as part of PyPSA-Eur -- an open-source, sector-coupled optimisation model of the European energy system. By integrating with the codebase for initiatives such as PyPSA-Earth, the value of open and maintainable high-voltage grid data extends to the global context. By accessing the latest data through the the Overpass turbo API, the dataset can be easily reconstructed and updated within minutes. To assess the data quality, this paper further compares the dataset with official statistics and representative model runs using PyPSA-Eur based on different electricity grid representations.

### MemLong: Memory-Augmented Retrieval for Long Text Modeling
**Authors**: Weijie Liu, Zecheng Tang, Juntao Li, Kehai Chen, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T02:01:56Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have yielded remarkable success across diverse fields. However, handling long contexts remains a significant challenge for LLMs due to the quadratic time and space complexity of attention mechanisms and the growing memory consumption of the key-value cache during generation. This work introduces MemLong: Memory-Augmented Retrieval for Long Text Generation, a method designed to enhance the capabilities of long-context language modeling by utilizing an external retriever for historical information retrieval. MemLong combines a non-differentiable ``ret-mem'' module with a partially trainable decoder-only language model and introduces a fine-grained, controllable retrieval attention mechanism that leverages semantic-level relevant chunks. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple long-context language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that MemLong consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art LLMs. More importantly, MemLong can extend the context length on a single 3090 GPU from 4k up to 80k. Our code is available at https://github.com/Bui1dMySea/MemLong

### Smart Helper-Aided F-RANs: Improving Delay and Reducing Fronthaul Load
**Authors**: Hesameddin Mokhtarzadeh, Mohammed S. Al-Abiad, Md Jahangir Hossain, Julian Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T17:43:26Z

**Summary**: In traditional Fog-Radio Access Networks (F-RANs), enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs) are connected to a macro base station (MBS) through fronthaul links. Deploying a massive number of eRRHs is not always feasible due to site constraints and the cost of fronthaul links. This paper introduces an innovative concept of using smart helpers (SHs) in F-RANs. These SHs do not require fronthaul links and listen to the nearby eRRHs' communications. Then, they smartly select and cache popular content. This capability enables SHs to serve users with frequent on-demand service requests potentially. As such, network operators have the flexibility to easily deploy SHs in various scenarios, such as dense urban areas and temporary public events, to expand their F-RANs and improve the quality of service (QoS). To study the performance of the proposed SH-aided F-RAN, we formulate an optimization problem of minimizing the average transmission delay that jointly optimizes cache resources and user scheduling. To tackle the formulated problem, we develop an innovative multi-stage algorithm that uses a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Various performance measures, e.g., the average transmission delay, fronthaul load, and cache hit rate of the proposed SH-aided F-RAN are evaluated numerically and compared with those of traditional F-RANs.

### VideoLLM-MoD: Efficient Video-Language Streaming with Mixture-of-Depths   Vision Computation
**Authors**: Shiwei Wu, Joya Chen, Kevin Qinghong Lin, Qimeng Wang, Yan Gao, Qianli Xu, Tong Xu, Yao Hu, Enhong Chen, Mike Zheng Shou

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T17:21:58Z

**Summary**: A well-known dilemma in large vision-language models (e.g., GPT-4, LLaVA) is that while increasing the number of vision tokens generally enhances visual understanding, it also significantly raises memory and computational costs, especially in long-term, dense video frame streaming scenarios. Although learnable approaches like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler have been developed to reduce the vision token burden, they overlook the context causally modeled by LLMs (i.e., key-value cache), potentially leading to missed visual cues when addressing user queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce vision compute by leveraging redundant vision tokens "skipping layers" rather than decreasing the number of vision tokens. Our method, VideoLLM-MoD, is inspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs and addresses the challenge of numerous vision tokens in long-term or streaming video. Specifically, for each transformer layer, we learn to skip the computation for a high proportion (e.g., 80\%) of vision tokens, passing them directly to the next layer. This approach significantly enhances model efficiency, achieving approximately \textasciitilde42\% time and \textasciitilde30\% memory savings for the entire training. Moreover, our method reduces the computation in the context and avoid decreasing the vision tokens, thus preserving or even improving performance compared to the vanilla model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of VideoLLM-MoD, showing its state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including narration, forecasting, and summarization tasks in COIN, Ego4D, and Ego-Exo4D datasets.

### GEAR: An Efficient KV Cache Compression Recipe for Near-Lossless   Generative Inference of LLM
**Authors**: Hao Kang, Qingru Zhang, Souvik Kundu, Geonhwa Jeong, Zaoxing Liu, Tushar Krishna, Tuo Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T16:48:58Z

**Summary**: Key-value (KV) caching has become the de-facto to accelerate generation speed for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, the growing cache demand with increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory bound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing methods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing all entries uniformly. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to represent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further compounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model generation and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose GEAR, an efficient KV cache compression framework that achieves near-lossless high-ratio compression. GEAR first applies quantization to majority of entries of similar magnitudes to ultra-low precision. It then employs a low rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse matrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating three techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to alternatives, GEAR achieves near-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression with up to 2.38x throughput improvement, while reducing peak-memory size up to 2.29x. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoKang-Timmy/GEAR.

### LightSLH: Provable and Low-Overhead Spectre v1 Mitigation through   Targeted Instruction Hardening
**Authors**: Yiming Zhu, Wenchao Huang, Yan Xiong

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T02:31:28Z

**Summary**: Several software mitigations have been proposed to defend against Spectre vulnerabilities. However, these countermeasures often suffer from high performance overhead, largely due to unnecessary protections. We propose LightSLH, designed to mitigate this overhead by hardening instructions only when they are under threat from Spectre vulnerabilities. LightSLH leverages program analysis techniques based on abstract interpretation to identify all instructions that could potentially lead to Spectre vulnerabilities and provides provable protection. To enhance analysis efficiency and precision, LightSLH employs novel taint and value domains. The taint domain enables bit-level taint tracking, while the value domain allows LightSLH to analyze complex program structures such as pointers and structures. Furthermore, LightSLH uses a two-stage abstract interpretation approach to circumvent potential analysis paralysis issues.   We demonstrate the security guarantees of LightSLH and evaluate its performance on cryptographic algorithm implementations from OpenSSL. LightSLH significantly reduces the overhead associated with speculative-load-hardening techniques. Our results show that LightSLH introduces no protection and thus no overhead on 4 out of the 7 studied algorithms, which contrasts with existing countermeasures that introduce additional overhead due to unnecessary hardening. Additionally, LightSLH performs, for the first time, a rigorous analysis of the security guarantees of RSA against Spectre v1, highlighting that the memory access patterns generated by the scatter-gather algorithm depend on secrets, even for observers at the cache line granularity, necessitating protection for such accesses.

### On the Impact of ISA Extension on Energy Consumption of I-Cache in   Extensible Processors
**Authors**: Noushin Behboudi, Mehdi Kamal, Ali Afzali-Kusha

**Updated**: 2024-08-28T17:28:12Z

**Summary**: As is widely known, the computational speed and power consumption are two critical parameters in microprocessor design. A solution for these issues is the application specific instruction set processor (ASIP) methodology, which can improve speed and reduce power consumption of the general purpose processor (GPP) technique. In ASIP, changing the instruction set architecture (ISA) of the processor will lead to alter the number and the mean time of accesses to the cache memory. This issue has a direct impact on the processor energy consumption. In this work, we study the impacts of extended ISA on the energy consumption of the extended ISA processor. Also, we demonstrate the extended ISA let the designer to reduce the cache size in order to minimize the energy consumption while meeting performance constraint.

### RIP Linked List
**Authors**: Benoît Sonntag, Dominique Colnet

**Updated**: 2024-08-28T08:41:45Z

**Summary**: Linked lists have long served as a valuable teaching tool in programming. However, the question arises: Are they truly practical for everyday program use? In most cases, it appears that array-based data structures offer distinct advantages, particularly in terms of memory efficiency and,more importantly, execution speed. While it's relatively straightforward to calculate the complexity of operations, gauging actual execution efficiency remains a challenge. This paper addresses this question by introducing a new benchmark. Our study compares various linked list implementations with several array-based alternatives. We also demonstrate the ease of incorporating memory caching for linked lists, enhancing their performance. Additionally, we introduce a new array-based data structure designed to excel in a wide range of operations.

### Efficient LLM Training and Serving with Heterogeneous Context Sharding   among Attention Heads
**Authors**: Xihui Lin, Yunan Zhang, Suyu Ge, Barun Patra, Vishrav Chaudhary, Hao Peng, Xia Song

**Updated**: 2024-08-27T22:06:20Z

**Summary**: Existing LLM training and inference frameworks struggle in boosting efficiency with sparsity while maintaining the integrity of context and model architecture. Inspired by the sharding concept in database and the fact that attention parallelizes over heads on accelerators, we propose Sparsely-Sharded (S2) Attention, an attention algorithm that allocates heterogeneous context partitions for different attention heads to divide and conquer. S2-Attention enforces each attention head to only attend to a partition of contexts following a strided sparsity pattern, while the full context is preserved as the union of all the shards. As attention heads are processed in separate thread blocks, the context reduction for each head can thus produce end-to-end speed-up and memory reduction. At inference, LLMs trained with S2-Attention can then take the KV cache reduction as free meals with guaranteed model quality preserve. In experiments, we show S2-Attentioncan provide as much as (1) 25.3X wall-clock attention speed-up over FlashAttention-2, resulting in 6X reduction in end-to-end training time and 10X inference latency, (2) on-par model training quality compared to default attention, (3)perfect needle retrieval accuracy over 32K context window. On top of the algorithm, we build DKernel, an LLM training and inference kernel library that allows users to customize sparsity patterns for their own models. We open-sourced DKerneland make it compatible with Megatron, Pytorch, and vLLM.

### Styx: Transactional Stateful Functions on Streaming Dataflows
**Authors**: Kyriakos Psarakis, George Siachamis, George Christodoulou, Marios Fragkoulis, Asterios Katsifodimos

**Updated**: 2024-08-27T17:30:41Z

**Summary**: Developing stateful cloud applications, such as low-latency workflows and microservices with strict consistency requirements, remains arduous for programmers. The Stateful Functions-as-a-Service (SFaaS) paradigm aims to serve these use cases. However, existing approaches either provide serializable transactional guarantees at the level of individual functions, or separate application logic from the state and use inefficient transactional protocols. These design choices increase the execution latency, limiting the adoption of SFaaS systems.   In this paper, we present Styx, a novel SFaaS runtime that executes serializable transactions across functions with exactly-once guarantees. Styx extends a deterministic transactional protocol to support an arbitrary call graph of stateful functions. It introduces a transaction-execution acknowledgment scheme that allows tracking a transactional workflow's SFaaS calls, guaranteeing atomicity and exactly-once processing. Finally, Styx features a function-execution caching mechanism and early transactional commit replies for optimized performance. Experiments with the YCSB-T, TPC-C, and Deathstar benchmarks show that Styx outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving at least one order of magnitude higher throughput while exhibiting near-linear scalability and low latency.

### Writing in the Margins: Better Inference Pattern for Long Context   Retrieval
**Authors**: Melisa Russak, Umar Jamil, Christopher Bryant, Kiran Kamble, Axel Magnuson, Mateusz Russak, Waseem AlShikh

**Updated**: 2024-08-27T09:34:38Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce Writing in the Margins (WiM), a new inference pattern for Large Language Models designed to optimize the handling of long input sequences in retrieval-oriented tasks. This approach leverages the chunked prefill of the key-value cache to perform segment-wise inference, which enables efficient processing of extensive contexts along with the generation and classification of intermediate information ("margins") that guide the model towards specific tasks. This method increases computational overhead marginally while significantly enhancing the performance of off-the-shelf models without the need for fine-tuning. Specifically, we observe that WiM provides an average enhancement of 7.5% in accuracy for reasoning skills (HotpotQA, MultiHop-RAG) and more than a 30.0% increase in the F1-score for aggregation tasks (CWE). Additionally, we show how the proposed pattern fits into an interactive retrieval design that provides end-users with ongoing updates about the progress of context processing, and pinpoints the integration of relevant information into the final response. We release our implementation of WiM using Hugging Face Transformers library at https://github.com/writer/writing-in-the-margins.

### PPVF: An Efficient Privacy-Preserving Online Video Fetching Framework   with Correlated Differential Privacy
**Authors**: Xianzhi Zhang, Yipeng Zhou, Di Wu, Quan Z. Sheng, Miao Hu, Linchang Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-08-27T02:03:36Z

**Summary**: Online video streaming has evolved into an integral component of the contemporary Internet landscape. Yet, the disclosure of user requests presents formidable privacy challenges. As users stream their preferred online videos, their requests are automatically seized by video content providers, potentially leaking users' privacy.   Unfortunately, current protection methods are not well-suited to preserving user request privacy from content providers while maintaining high-quality online video services. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel Privacy-Preserving Video Fetching (PPVF) framework, which utilizes trusted edge devices to pre-fetch and cache videos, ensuring the privacy of users' requests while optimizing the efficiency of edge caching. More specifically, we design PPVF with three core components: (1) \textit{Online privacy budget scheduler}, which employs a theoretically guaranteed online algorithm to select non-requested videos as candidates with assigned privacy budgets. Alternative videos are chosen by an online algorithm that is theoretically guaranteed to consider both video utilities and available privacy budgets.

### Quest: Query-Aware Sparsity for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Jiaming Tang, Yilong Zhao, Kan Zhu, Guangxuan Xiao, Baris Kasikci, Song Han

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T21:01:02Z

**Summary**: As the demand for long-context large language models (LLMs) increases, models with context windows of up to 128K or 1M tokens are becoming increasingly prevalent. However, long-context LLM inference is challenging since the inference speed decreases significantly as the sequence length grows. This slowdown is primarily caused by loading a large KV cache during self-attention. Previous works have shown that a small portion of critical tokens will dominate the attention outcomes. However, we observe the criticality of a token highly depends on the query. To this end, we propose Quest, a query-aware KV cache selection algorithm. Quest keeps track of the minimal and maximal Key values in KV cache pages and estimates the criticality of a given page using Query vectors. By only loading the Top-K critical KV cache pages for attention, Quest significantly speeds up self-attention without sacrificing accuracy. We show that Quest can achieve up to 2.23x self-attention speedup, which reduces inference latency by 7.03x while performing well on tasks with long dependencies with negligible accuracy loss. Code is available at http://github.com/mit-han-lab/Quest .

 ### PhysGen: Rigid-Body Physics-Grounded Image-to-Video Generation
**Authors**: Shaowei Liu, Zhongzheng Ren, Saurabh Gupta, Shenlong Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T17:59:57Z

**Summary**: We present PhysGen, a novel image-to-video generation method that converts a single image and an input condition (e.g., force and torque applied to an object in the image) to produce a realistic, physically plausible, and temporally consistent video. Our key insight is to integrate model-based physical simulation with a data-driven video generation process, enabling plausible image-space dynamics. At the heart of our system are three core components: (i) an image understanding module that effectively captures the geometry, materials, and physical parameters of the image; (ii) an image-space dynamics simulation model that utilizes rigid-body physics and inferred parameters to simulate realistic behaviors; and (iii) an image-based rendering and refinement module that leverages generative video diffusion to produce realistic video footage featuring the simulated motion. The resulting videos are realistic in both physics and appearance and are even precisely controllable, showcasing superior results over existing data-driven image-to-video generation works through quantitative comparison and comprehensive user study. PhysGen's resulting videos can be used for various downstream applications, such as turning an image into a realistic animation or allowing users to interact with the image and create various dynamics.

### ProMerge: Prompt and Merge for Unsupervised Instance Segmentation
**Authors**: Dylan Li, Gyungin Shin

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T17:59:42Z

**Summary**: Unsupervised instance segmentation aims to segment distinct object instances in an image without relying on human-labeled data. This field has recently seen significant advancements, partly due to the strong local correspondences afforded by rich visual feature representations from self-supervised models (e.g., DINO). Recent state-of-the-art approaches use self-supervised features to represent images as graphs and solve a generalized eigenvalue system (i.e., normalized-cut) to generate foreground masks. While effective, this strategy is limited by its attendant computational demands, leading to slow inference speeds. In this paper, we propose Prompt and Merge (ProMerge), which leverages self-supervised visual features to obtain initial groupings of patches and applies a strategic merging to these segments, aided by a sophisticated background-based mask pruning technique. ProMerge not only yields competitive results but also offers a significant reduction in inference time compared to state-of-the-art normalized-cut-based approaches. Furthermore, when training an object detector using our mask predictions as pseudo-labels, the resulting detector surpasses the current leading unsupervised model on various challenging instance segmentation benchmarks.

### LML: Language Model Learning a Dataset for Data-Augmented Prediction
**Authors**: Praneeth Vadlapati

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T17:58:50Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces a new approach to using Large Language Models (LLMs) for classification tasks, which are typically handled using Machine Learning (ML) models. Unlike ML models that rely heavily on data cleaning and feature engineering, this method streamlines the process using LLMs. This paper proposes a new concept called "Language Model Learning (LML)" powered by a new method called "Data-Augmented Prediction (DAP)". The classification is performed by LLMs using a method similar to humans manually exploring and understanding the data and deciding classifications using data as a reference. Training data is summarized and evaluated to determine the features that lead to the classification of each label the most. In the process of DAP, the system uses the data summary to automatically create a query, which is used to retrieve relevant rows from the dataset. A classification is generated by the LLM using data summary and relevant rows, ensuring satisfactory accuracy even with complex data. Usage of data summary and similar data in DAP ensures context-aware decision-making. The proposed method uses the words "Act as an Explainable Machine Learning Model" in the prompt to enhance the interpretability of the predictions by allowing users to review the logic behind each prediction. In some test cases, the system scored an accuracy above 90%, proving the effectiveness of the system and its potential to outperform conventional ML models in various scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/Pro-GenAI/LML-DAP

### Ruler: A Model-Agnostic Method to Control Generated Length for Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Jiaming Li, Lei Zhang, Yunshui Li, Ziqiang Liu, yuelin bai, Run Luo, Longze Chen, Min Yang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T17:44:58Z

**Summary**: The instruction-following ability of large language models enables humans to interact with AI agents in a natural way. However, when required to generate responses of a specific length, large language models often struggle to meet users' needs due to their inherent difficulty in accurately perceiving numerical constraints. To explore the ability of large language models to control the length of generated responses, we propose the Target Length Generation Task (TLG) and design two metrics, Precise Match (PM) and Flexible Match (FM) to evaluate the model's performance in adhering to specified response lengths. Furthermore, we introduce a novel, model-agnostic approach called Ruler, which employs Meta Length Tokens (MLTs) to enhance the instruction-following ability of large language models under length-constrained instructions. Specifically, Ruler equips LLMs with the ability to generate responses of a specified length based on length constraints within the instructions. Moreover, Ruler can automatically generate appropriate MLT when length constraints are not explicitly provided, demonstrating excellent versatility and generalization. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of Ruler across different LLMs on Target Length Generation Task, e.g., at All Level 27.97 average gain on PM, 29.57 average gain on FM. In addition, we conduct extensive ablation experiments to further substantiate the efficacy and generalization of Ruler. Our code and data is available at https://github.com/Geaming2002/Ruler.

**Authors**: Heqing Zou, Tianze Luo, Guiyang Xie, Victor, Zhang, Fengmao Lv, Guangcong Wang, Juanyang Chen, Zhuochen Wang, Hansheng Zhang, Huaijian Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T17:38:36Z

**Summary**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual encoders has recently shown promising performance in visual understanding tasks, leveraging their inherent capability to comprehend and generate human-like text for visual reasoning. Given the diverse nature of visual data, MultiModal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) exhibit variations in model designing and training for understanding images, short videos, and long videos. Our paper focuses on the substantial differences and unique challenges posed by long video understanding compared to static image and short video understanding. Unlike static images, short videos encompass sequential frames with both spatial and within-event temporal information, while long videos consist of multiple events with between-event and long-term temporal information. In this survey, we aim to trace and summarize the advancements of MM-LLMs from image understanding to long video understanding. We review the differences among various visual understanding tasks and highlight the challenges in long video understanding, including more fine-grained spatiotemporal details, dynamic events, and long-term dependencies. We then provide a detailed summary of the advancements in MM-LLMs in terms of model design and training methodologies for understanding long videos. Finally, we compare the performance of existing MM-LLMs on video understanding benchmarks of various lengths and discuss potential future directions for MM-LLMs in long video understanding.

### Interpreting Mass and Radius Measurements of Neutron Stars with Dark   Matter Halos
**Authors**: Shafayat Shawqi, Sharon M. Morsink

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T17:34:20Z

**Summary**: The high densities of neutron stars (NSs) could provide astrophysical locations for dark matter (DM) to accumulate. Depending on the DM model, these DM admixed NSs (DANSs) could have significantly different properties than pure baryonic NSs, accessible through X-ray observations of rotation-powered pulsars. We adopt the two-fluid formalism in general relativity to numerically simulate stable configurations of DANSs, assuming a fermionic equation of state (EOS) for the DM with repulsive self-interaction. The distribution of DM in the DANS as a halo affects the path of X-rays emitted from hot spots on the visible baryonic surface causing notable changes in the pulse profile observed by telescopes such as NICER, compared to pure baryonic NSs. We explore how various DM models affect the DM mass distribution, leading to different types of dark halos. We quantify the deviation in observed X-ray flux from stars with each of these halos. We identify the pitfalls in interpreting mass and radius measurements of NSs inferred from electromagnetic radiation and constraining the baryonic matter EOS, if these dark halos exist.

**Authors**: Gabriel Mejia, Daniela Ruiz, Paula Cárdenas, Leonardo Manrique, Daniela Vega, Pablo Arbeláez

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T17:29:43Z

**Summary**: Spatial Transcriptomics is a novel technology that aligns histology images with spatially resolved gene expression profiles. Although groundbreaking, it struggles with gene capture yielding high corruption in acquired data. Given potential applications, recent efforts have focused on predicting transcriptomic profiles solely from histology images. However, differences in databases, preprocessing techniques, and training hyperparameters hinder a fair comparison between methods. To address these challenges, we present a systematically curated and processed database collected from 26 public sources, representing an 8.6-fold increase compared to previous works. Additionally, we propose a state-of-the-art transformer based completion technique for inferring missing gene expression, which significantly boosts the performance of transcriptomic profile predictions across all datasets. Altogether, our contributions constitute the most comprehensive benchmark of gene expression prediction from histology images to date and a stepping stone for future research on spatial transcriptomics.

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T17:17:15Z

**Summary**: Simulated patient systems play a crucial role in modern medical education and research, providing safe, integrative learning environments and enabling clinical decision-making simulations. Large Language Models (LLM) could advance simulated patient systems by replicating medical conditions and patient-doctor interactions with high fidelity and low cost. However, ensuring the effectiveness and trustworthiness of these systems remains a challenge, as they require a large, diverse, and precise patient knowledgebase, along with a robust and stable knowledge diffusion to users. Here, we developed AIPatient, an advanced simulated patient system with AIPatient Knowledge Graph (AIPatient KG) as the input and the Reasoning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Reasoning RAG) agentic workflow as the generation backbone. AIPatient KG samples data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database, producing a clinically diverse and relevant cohort of 1,495 patients with high knowledgebase validity (F1 0.89). Reasoning RAG leverages six LLM powered agents spanning tasks including retrieval, KG query generation, abstraction, checker, rewrite, and summarization. This agentic framework reaches an overall accuracy of 94.15% in EHR-based medical Question Answering (QA), outperforming benchmarks that use either no agent or only partial agent integration. Our system also presents high readability (median Flesch Reading Ease 77.23; median Flesch Kincaid Grade 5.6), robustness (ANOVA F-value 0.6126, p<0.1), and stability (ANOVA F-value 0.782, p<0.1). The promising performance of the AIPatient system highlights its potential to support a wide range of applications, including medical education, model evaluation, and system integration.

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T16:54:36Z

**Summary**: Understanding and modeling collective intelligence is essential for addressing complex social systems. Directed graphs called fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) offer a powerful tool for encoding causal mental models, but extracting high-integrity FCMs from text is challenging. This study presents an approach using large language models (LLMs) to automate FCM extraction. We introduce novel graph-based similarity measures and evaluate them by correlating their outputs with human judgments through the Elo rating system. Results show positive correlations with human evaluations, but even the best-performing measure exhibits limitations in capturing FCM nuances. Fine-tuning LLMs improves performance, but existing measures still fall short. This study highlights the need for soft similarity measures tailored to FCM extraction, advancing collective intelligence modeling with NLP.

### Trained Without My Consent: Detecting Code Inclusion In Language Models   Trained on Code
**Authors**: Vahid Majdinasab, Amin Nikanjam, Foutse Khomh

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T16:54:33Z

**Summary**: Code auditing ensures that the developed code adheres to standards, regulations, and copyright protection by verifying that it does not contain code from protected sources. The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) as coding assistants in the software development process poses new challenges for code auditing. The dataset for training these models is mainly collected from publicly available sources. This raises the issue of intellectual property infringement as developers' codes are already included in the dataset. Therefore, auditing code developed using LLMs is challenging, as it is difficult to reliably assert if an LLM used during development has been trained on specific copyrighted codes, given that we do not have access to the training datasets of these models. Given the non-disclosure of the training datasets, traditional approaches such as code clone detection are insufficient for asserting copyright infringement. To address this challenge, we propose a new approach, TraWiC; a model-agnostic and interpretable method based on membership inference for detecting code inclusion in an LLM's training dataset. We extract syntactic and semantic identifiers unique to each program to train a classifier for detecting code inclusion. In our experiments, we observe that TraWiC is capable of detecting 83.87% of codes that were used to train an LLM. In comparison, the prevalent clone detection tool NiCad is only capable of detecting 47.64%. In addition to its remarkable performance, TraWiC has low resource overhead in contrast to pair-wise clone detection that is conducted during the auditing process of tools like CodeWhisperer reference tracker, across thousands of code snippets.

### Inference with Sequential Monte-Carlo Computation of $p$-values: Fast   and Valid Approaches
**Authors**: Ivo V. Stoepker, Rui M. Castro

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T16:46:02Z

**Summary**: Hypothesis tests calibrated by (re)sampling methods (such as permutation, rank and bootstrap tests) are useful tools for statistical analysis, at the computational cost of requiring Monte-Carlo sampling for calibration. It is common and almost universal practice to execute such tests with predetermined and large number of Monte-Carlo samples, and disregard any randomness from this sampling at the time of drawing and reporting inference. At best, this approach leads to computational inefficiency, and at worst to invalid inference. That being said, a number of approaches in the literature have been proposed to adaptively guide analysts in choosing the number of Monte-Carlo samples, by sequentially deciding when to stop collecting samples and draw inference. These works introduce varying competing notions of what constitutes "valid" inference, complicating the landscape for analysts seeking suitable methodology. Furthermore, the majority of these approaches solely guarantee a meaningful estimate of the testing outcome, not the $p$-value itself $\unicode{x2014}$ which is insufficient for many practical applications. In this paper, we survey the relevant literature, and build bridges between the scattered validity notions, highlighting some of their complementary roles. We also introduce a new practical methodology that provides an estimate of the $p$-value of the Monte-Carlo test, endowed with practically relevant validity guarantees. Moreover, our methodology is sequential, updating the $p$-value estimate after each new Monte-Carlo sample has been drawn, while retaining important validity guarantees regardless of the selected stopping time. We conclude this paper with a set of recommendations for the practitioner, both in terms of selection of methodology and manner of reporting results.

### IDGen: Item Discrimination Induced Prompt Generation for LLM Evaluation
**Authors**: Fan Lin, Shuyi Xie, Yong Dai, Wenlin Yao, Tianjiao Lang, Zishan Xu, Zhichao Hu, Xiao Xiao, Yuhong Liu, Yu Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T16:29:12Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow increasingly adept at managing complex tasks, the evaluation set must keep pace with these advancements to ensure it remains sufficiently discriminative. Item Discrimination (ID) theory, which is widely used in educational assessment, measures the ability of individual test items to differentiate between high and low performers. Inspired by this theory, we propose an ID-induced prompt synthesis framework for evaluating LLMs to ensure the evaluation set can continually update and refine according to model abilities. Our data synthesis framework prioritizes both breadth and specificity. It can generate prompts that comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs while revealing meaningful performance differences between models, allowing for effective discrimination of their relative strengths and weaknesses across various tasks and domains. To produce high-quality data, we incorporate a self-correct mechanism into our generalization framework, and develop two models to predict prompt discrimination and difficulty score to facilitate our data synthesis framework, contributing valuable tools to evaluation data synthesis research. We apply our generated data to evaluate five SOTA models. Our data achieves an average score of 51.92, accompanied by a variance of 10.06. By contrast, previous works (i.e., SELF-INSTRUCT and WizardLM) obtain an average score exceeding 67, with a variance below 3.2. The results demonstrate that the data generated by our framework is more challenging and discriminative compared to previous works. We will release a dataset of over 3,000 carefully crafted prompts to facilitate evaluation research of LLMs.

### Evolutionary emergence of biological intelligence
**Authors**: Takuya Isomura

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T16:16:17Z

**Summary**: Characterising the intelligence of biological organisms is challenging. This work considers intelligent algorithms developed evolutionarily within neural systems. Mathematical analyses unveil a natural equivalence between canonical neural networks, variational Bayesian inference under a class of partially observable Markov decision processes, and differentiable Turing machines, by showing that they minimise the shared Helmholtz energy. Consequently, canonical neural networks can biologically plausibly equip Turing machines and conduct variational Bayesian inferences of external Turing machines in the environment. Applying Helmholtz energy minimisation at the species level facilitates deriving active Bayesian model selection inherent in natural selection, resulting in the emergence of adaptive algorithms. In particular, canonical neural networks with two mental actions can separately memorise transition mappings of multiple external Turing machines to form a universal machine. These propositions were corroborated by numerical simulations of algorithm implementation and neural network evolution. These notions offer a universal characterisation of biological intelligence emerging from evolution in terms of Bayesian model selection and belief updating.

### Inferring Drug-induced Plasticity via Drug Screen Data
**Authors**: Chenyu Wu, Einar Bjarki Gunnarsson, Jasmine Foo, Kevin Leder

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T16:13:43Z

**Summary**: Resistance to therapy remains a significant challenge in cancer treatment, often due to the presence of a stem-like cell population that drives tumor recurrence post-treatment. Moreover, many anticancer drugs inadvertently induce plasticity, reverting differentiated cancer cells to drug-resistant stem-like states. Addressing this phenomenon is crucial for advancing cancer therapeutics. In this study, we introduce a robust statistical framework based on multi-type branching processes that can dissect tumor dynamics and drug effects from high throughput drug screening data. Through comprehensive in silico experiments, we show the efficacy of our framework in estimating parameters governing population dynamics and drug responses in a heterogeneous tumor population where cell state transitions are influenced by the drug. Finally, using recent in vitro data involving AGS-SORE6+/- cells treated with ciclopirox olamine, we show how our framework can be used to confirm the presence of drug-induced cell plasticity.

### BeanCounter: A low-toxicity, large-scale, and open dataset of   business-oriented text
**Authors**: Siyan Wang, Bradford Levy

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T16:07:54Z

**Summary**: Many of the recent breakthroughs in language modeling have resulted from scaling effectively the same model architecture to larger datasets. In this vein, recent work has highlighted performance gains from increasing training dataset size and quality, suggesting a need for novel sources of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce BeanCounter, a public dataset consisting of more than 159B tokens extracted from businesses' disclosures. We show that this data is indeed novel: less than 0.1% of BeanCounter appears in Common Crawl-based datasets and it is an order of magnitude larger than datasets relying on similar sources. Given the data's provenance, we hypothesize that BeanCounter is comparatively more factual and less toxic than web-based datasets. Exploring this hypothesis, we find that many demographic identities occur with similar prevalence in BeanCounter but with significantly less toxic context relative to other datasets. To demonstrate the utility of BeanCounter, we evaluate and compare two LLMs continually pre-trained on BeanCounter with their base models. We find an 18-33% reduction in toxic generation and improved performance within the finance domain for the continually pretrained models. Collectively, our work suggests that BeanCounter is a novel source of low-toxicity and high-quality domain-specific data with sufficient scale to train multi-billion parameter LLMs.

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T16:06:11Z

**Summary**: While next-token prediction is considered a promising path towards artificial general intelligence, it has struggled to excel in multimodal tasks, which are still dominated by diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) and compositional approaches (e.g., CLIP combined with LLMs). In this paper, we introduce Emu3, a new suite of state-of-the-art multimodal models trained solely with next-token prediction. By tokenizing images, text, and videos into a discrete space, we train a single transformer from scratch on a mixture of multimodal sequences. Emu3 outperforms several well-established task-specific models in both generation and perception tasks, surpassing flagship models such as SDXL and LLaVA-1.6, while eliminating the need for diffusion or compositional architectures. Emu3 is also capable of generating high-fidelity video via predicting the next token in a video sequence. We simplify complex multimodal model designs by converging on a singular focus: tokens, unlocking great potential for scaling both during training and inference. Our results demonstrate that next-token prediction is a promising path towards building general multimodal intelligence beyond language. We open-source key techniques and models to support further research in this direction.

### LLM Detectors Still Fall Short of Real World: Case of LLM-Generated   Short News-Like Posts
**Authors**: Henrique Da Silva Gameiro, Andrei Kucharavy, Ljiljana Dolamic

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T16:04:40Z

**Summary**: With the emergence of widely available powerful LLMs, disinformation generated by large Language Models (LLMs) has become a major concern. Historically, LLM detectors have been touted as a solution, but their effectiveness in the real world is still to be proven. In this paper, we focus on an important setting in information operations -- short news-like posts generated by moderately sophisticated attackers.   We demonstrate that existing LLM detectors, whether zero-shot or purpose-trained, are not ready for real-world use in that setting. All tested zero-shot detectors perform inconsistently with prior benchmarks and are highly vulnerable to sampling temperature increase, a trivial attack absent from recent benchmarks. A purpose-trained detector generalizing across LLMs and unseen attacks can be developed, but it fails to generalize to new human-written texts.   We argue that the former indicates domain-specific benchmarking is needed, while the latter suggests a trade-off between the adversarial evasion resilience and overfitting to the reference human text, with both needing evaluation in benchmarks and currently absent. We believe this suggests a re-consideration of current LLM detector benchmarking approaches and provides a dynamically extensible benchmark to allow it (https://github.com/Reliable-Information-Lab-HEVS/benchmark_llm_texts_detection).

### Computationally Efficient Estimation of Large Probit Models
**Authors**: Patrick Ding, Guido Imbens, Zhaonan Qu, Yinyu Ye

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T15:59:13Z

**Summary**: Probit models are useful for modeling correlated discrete responses in many disciplines, including consumer choice data in economics and marketing. However, the Gaussian latent variable feature of probit models coupled with identification constraints pose significant computational challenges for its estimation and inference, especially when the dimension of the discrete response variable is large. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating large probit models. Our work is distinct from existing methods in two important aspects. First, instead of simulation or sampling methods, we apply and customize expectation propagation (EP), a deterministic method originally proposed for approximate Bayesian inference, to estimate moments of the truncated multivariate normal (TMVN) in the E (expectation) step. Second, we take advantage of a symmetric identification condition to transform the constrained optimization problem in the M (maximization) step into a one-dimensional problem, which is solved efficiently using Newton's method instead of off-the-shelf solvers. Our method enables the analysis of correlated choice data in the presence of more than 100 alternatives, which is a reasonable size in modern applications, such as online shopping and booking platforms, but has been difficult in practice with probit models. We apply our probit estimation method to study ordering effects in hotel search results on Expedia's online booking platform.

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T15:53:55Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models have received significant attention due to their abilities to solve a wide range of complex tasks. However these models memorize a significant proportion of their training data, posing a serious threat when disclosed at inference time. To mitigate this unintended memorization, it is crucial to understand what elements are memorized and why. Most existing works provide a posteriori explanations, which has a limited interest in practice. To address this gap, we propose a new approach based on sliced mutual information to detect memorized samples a priori, in a classification setting. It is efficient from the early stages of training, and is readily adaptable to practical scenarios. Our method is supported by new theoretical results that we demonstrate, and requires a low computational budget. We obtain strong empirical results, paving the way for systematic inspection and protection of these vulnerable samples before memorization happens.

### Mitigating Selection Bias with Node Pruning and Auxiliary Options
**Authors**: Hyeong Kyu Choi, Weijie Xu, Chi Xue, Stephanie Eckman, Chandan K. Reddy

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T15:53:54Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often show unwarranted preference for certain choice options when responding to multiple-choice questions, posing significant reliability concerns in LLM-automated systems. To mitigate this selection bias problem, previous solutions utilized debiasing methods to adjust the model's input and/or output. Our work, in contrast, investigates the model's internal representation of the selection bias. Specifically, we introduce a novel debiasing approach, Bias Node Pruning (BNP), which eliminates the linear layer parameters that contribute to the bias. Furthermore, we present Auxiliary Option Injection (AOI), a simple yet effective input modification technique for debiasing, which is compatible even with black-box LLMs. To provide a more systematic evaluation of selection bias, we review existing metrics and introduce Choice Kullback-Leibler Divergence (CKLD), which addresses the insensitivity of the commonly used metrics to label imbalance. Experiments show that our methods are robust and adaptable across various datasets when applied to three LLMs.

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T15:45:17Z

**Summary**: Where and under what conditions the transfer of energy between electromagnetic fields and particles takes place in the solar wind remains an open question. We investigate the conditions that promote the growth of kinetic instabilities predicted by linear theory, to infer how turbulence and temperature-anisotropy-driven instabilities are interrelated. Using a large dataset from Solar Orbiter, we introduce the radial rate of strain, a novel measure computed from single-spacecraft data, that we interpret as a proxy for the double-adiabatic strain rate. The solar wind exhibits high absolute values of the radial rate of strain at locations with large temperature anisotropy. We measure the kurtosis and skewness of the radial rate of strain from the statistical moments to show that it is non-Gaussian for unstable intervals and increasingly intermittent at smaller scales with a power-law scaling. We conclude that the velocity field fluctuations in the solar wind contribute to the presence of temperature anisotropy sufficient to create potentially unstable conditions.

### Lipschitz inextendibility of weak null singularities from curvature   blow-up
**Authors**: Jan Sbierski

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T15:34:51Z

**Summary**: We prove the $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-inextendibility of weak null singularities without any symmetry assumptions. The proof introduces a new strategy to infer $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-inextendibility from the blow-up of curvature. The assumed blow-up is expected to be satisfied for weak null singularities in the interior of generic rotating black holes. Thus, we expect the result presented here to directly contribute to the resolution of the $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-formulation of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture in a neighbourhood of subextremal Kerr.

**Authors**: Kuo-Hsuan Hung, Kuan-Chen Wang, Kai-Chun Liu, Wei-Lun Chen, Xugang Lu, Yu Tsao, Chii-Wann Lin

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T15:22:44Z

**Summary**: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important non-invasive method for diagnosing cardiovascular disease. However, ECG signals are susceptible to noise contamination, such as electrical interference or signal wandering, which reduces diagnostic accuracy. Various ECG denoising methods have been proposed, but most existing methods yield suboptimal performance under very noisy conditions or require several steps during inference, leading to latency during online processing. In this paper, we propose a novel ECG denoising model, namely Mamba-based ECG Enhancer (MECG-E), which leverages the Mamba architecture known for its fast inference and outstanding nonlinear mapping capabilities. Experimental results indicate that MECG-E surpasses several well-known existing models across multiple metrics under different noise conditions. Additionally, MECG-E requires less inference time than state-of-the-art diffusion-based ECG denoisers, demonstrating the model's functionality and efficiency.

**Authors**: Tuan-Dung Bui, Duc-Thieu Luu-Van, Thanh-Phat Nguyen, Thu-Trang Nguyen, Son Nguyen, Hieu Dinh Vo

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T15:19:23Z

**Summary**: Code completion is essential in software development, helping developers by predicting code snippets based on context. Among completion tasks, Method Body Completion (MBC) is particularly challenging as it involves generating complete method bodies based on their signatures and context. This task becomes significantly harder in large repositories, where method bodies must integrate repositoryspecific elements such as custom APIs, inter-module dependencies, and project-specific conventions. In this paper, we introduce RAMBO, a novel RAG-based approach for repository-level MBC. Instead of retrieving similar method bodies, RAMBO identifies essential repository-specific elements, such as classes, methods, and variables/fields, and their relevant usages. By incorporating these elements and their relevant usages into the code generation process, RAMBO ensures more accurate and contextually relevant method bodies. Our experimental results with leading code LLMs across 40 Java projects show that RAMBO significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art repository-level MBC approaches, with the improvements of up to 46% in BLEU, 57% in CodeBLEU, 36% in Compilation Rate, and up to 3X in Exact Match. Notably, RAMBO surpassed RepoCoder Oracle method by up to 12% in Exact Match, setting a new benchmark for repository-level MBC.

### Exploring Prosocial Irrationality for LLM Agents: A Social Cognition   View
**Authors**: Xuan Liu, Jie Zhang, Song Guo, Haoyang Shang, Chengxu Yang, Quanyan Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T15:10:06Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to face hallucination issues due to the data they trained on often containing human bias; whether this is reflected in the decision-making process of LLM Agents remains under-explored. As LLM Agents are increasingly employed in intricate social environments, a pressing and natural question emerges: Can we utilize LLM Agents' systematic hallucinations to mirror human cognitive biases, thus exhibiting irrational social intelligence? In this paper, we probe the irrational behavior among contemporary LLM Agents by melding practical social science experiments with theoretical insights. Specifically, We propose CogMir, an open-ended Multi-LLM Agents framework that utilizes hallucination properties to assess and enhance LLM Agents' social intelligence through cognitive biases. Experimental results on CogMir subsets show that LLM Agents and humans exhibit high consistency in irrational and prosocial decision-making under uncertain conditions, underscoring the prosociality of LLM Agents as social entities and highlighting the significance of hallucination properties. Additionally, the CogMir framework demonstrates its potential as a valuable platform for encouraging more research into the social intelligence of LLM Agents.

**Authors**: Hamed Babaei Giglou, Jennifer D'Souza, Sören Auer

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T15:04:39Z

**Summary**: In response to the growing complexity and volume of scientific literature, this paper introduces the LLMs4Synthesis framework, designed to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating high-quality scientific syntheses. This framework addresses the need for rapid, coherent, and contextually rich integration of scientific insights, leveraging both open-source and proprietary LLMs. It also examines the effectiveness of LLMs in evaluating the integrity and reliability of these syntheses, alleviating inadequacies in current quantitative metrics. Our study contributes to this field by developing a novel methodology for processing scientific papers, defining new synthesis types, and establishing nine detailed quality criteria for evaluating syntheses. The integration of LLMs with reinforcement learning and AI feedback is proposed to optimize synthesis quality, ensuring alignment with established criteria. The LLMs4Synthesis framework and its components are made available, promising to enhance both the generation and evaluation processes in scientific research synthesis.

**Authors**: Tyreal Yizhou Qian, Bo Yu, Weizhe Li, Chenglong Xu

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T14:53:04Z

**Summary**: This study examined the public opinions of esports at the 2023 Asian Games and value co-creation during the event using an LLM-enhanced BERTopic modeling analysis. We identified five major themes representing public perceptions, as well as how major stakeholders co-created value within and beyond the esports ecosystem. Key findings highlighted the strategic use of social media marketing to influence public opinion and promote esports events and brands, emphasizing the importance of event logistics and infrastructure. Additionally, the study revealed the co-creation value contributed by stakeholders outside the traditional esports ecosystem, particularly in promoting national representation and performance. Our findings supported the ongoing efforts to legitimize esports as a sport, noting that mainstream recognition remains a challenge. The inclusion of esports as a medal event showcased broader acceptance and helped mitigate negative public perceptions. Moreover, contributions from non-traditional stakeholders underscored the value of cross-subcultural collaborations in esports.

### Improving Diversity of Commonsense Generation by Large Language Models   via In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Tianhui Zhang, Bei Peng, Danushka Bollegala

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T14:50:59Z

**Summary**: Generative Commonsense Reasoning (GCR) requires a model to reason about a situation using commonsense knowledge, while generating coherent sentences. Although the quality of the generated sentences is crucial, the diversity of the generation is equally important because it reflects the model's ability to use a range of commonsense knowledge facts. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown proficiency in enhancing the generation quality across various tasks through in-context learning (ICL) using given examples without the need for any fine-tuning. However, the diversity aspect in LLM outputs has not been systematically studied before. To address this, we propose a simple method that diversifies the LLM generations, while preserving their quality. Experimental results on three benchmark GCR datasets show that our method achieves an ideal balance between the quality and diversity. Moreover, the sentences generated by our proposed method can be used as training data to improve diversity in existing commonsense generators.

### Open-Nav: Exploring Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in   Continuous Environment with Open-Source LLMs
**Authors**: Yanyuan Qiao, Wenqi Lyu, Hui Wang, Zixu Wang, Zerui Li, Yuan Zhang, Mingkui Tan, Qi Wu

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T14:47:18Z

**Summary**: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks require an agent to follow textual instructions to navigate through 3D environments. Traditional approaches use supervised learning methods, relying heavily on domain-specific datasets to train VLN models. Recent methods try to utilize closed-source large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to solve VLN tasks in zero-shot manners, but face challenges related to expensive token costs and potential data breaches in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce Open-Nav, a novel study that explores open-source LLMs for zero-shot VLN in the continuous environment. Open-Nav employs a spatial-temporal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning approach to break down tasks into instruction comprehension, progress estimation, and decision-making. It enhances scene perceptions with fine-grained object and spatial knowledge to improve LLM's reasoning in navigation. Our extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that Open-Nav achieves competitive performance compared to using closed-source LLMs.

### A Survey on the Honesty of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Siheng Li, Cheng Yang, Taiqiang Wu, Chufan Shi, Yuji Zhang, Xinyu Zhu, Zesen Cheng, Deng Cai, Mo Yu, Lemao Liu, Jie Zhou, Yujiu Yang, Ngai Wong, Xixin Wu, Wai Lam

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T14:34:54Z

**Summary**: Honesty is a fundamental principle for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, requiring these models to recognize what they know and don't know and be able to faithfully express their knowledge. Despite promising, current LLMs still exhibit significant dishonest behaviors, such as confidently presenting wrong answers or failing to express what they know. In addition, research on the honesty of LLMs also faces challenges, including varying definitions of honesty, difficulties in distinguishing between known and unknown knowledge, and a lack of comprehensive understanding of related research. To address these issues, we provide a survey on the honesty of LLMs, covering its clarification, evaluation approaches, and strategies for improvement. Moreover, we offer insights for future research, aiming to inspire further exploration in this important area.

### DualDn: Dual-domain Denoising via Differentiable ISP
**Authors**: Ruikang Li, Yujin Wang, Shiqi Chen, Fan Zhang, Jinwei Gu, Tianfan Xue

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T14:30:24Z

**Summary**: Image denoising is a critical component in a camera's Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline. There are two typical ways to inject a denoiser into the ISP pipeline: applying a denoiser directly to captured raw frames (raw domain) or to the ISP's output sRGB images (sRGB domain). However, both approaches have their limitations. Residual noise from raw-domain denoising can be amplified by the subsequent ISP processing, and the sRGB domain struggles to handle spatially varying noise since it only sees noise distorted by the ISP. Consequently, most raw or sRGB domain denoising works only for specific noise distributions and ISP configurations. To address these challenges, we propose DualDn, a novel learning-based dual-domain denoising. Unlike previous single-domain denoising, DualDn consists of two denoising networks: one in the raw domain and one in the sRGB domain. The raw domain denoising adapts to sensor-specific noise as well as spatially varying noise levels, while the sRGB domain denoising adapts to ISP variations and removes residual noise amplified by the ISP. Both denoising networks are connected with a differentiable ISP, which is trained end-to-end and discarded during the inference stage. With this design, DualDn achieves greater generalizability compared to most learning-based denoising methods, as it can adapt to different unseen noises, ISP parameters, and even novel ISP pipelines. Experiments show that DualDn achieves state-of-the-art performance and can adapt to different denoising architectures. Moreover, DualDn can be used as a plug-and-play denoising module with real cameras without retraining, and still demonstrate better performance than commercial on-camera denoising.

### Probing Dark Energy Evolution Post-DESI 2024
**Authors**: Lili Orchard, Víctor H. Cárdenas

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T14:29:13Z

**Summary**: We study the evidence for dark energy (DE) evolution at low redshift, using baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs) from the DESI Early Data Release, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SNe-Ia), and redshift space distortions (RSDs) to constrain cosmological parameters. Furthermore, we make use of the angular acoustic scale to analyse the effect of introducing condensed CMB information on the cosmological parameters informing DE evolution. The analysis is divided into cases based on the variability of priors inferred from early-time physics. Using a quadratic parametrisation, $X(z)$, for DE density, we find evidence for DE evolution in all cases, both with and without the angular acoustic scale. We reconstruct $X(z)$ using best fit parameters and find that DE density starts to exhibit dynamical behaviour at $z \sim 0.5 $, assuming negative values beyond $z\sim 1.5$. The data show no significant preference for $X(z)$CDM over a $\Lambda$CDM, with both models performing equally well according to our chosen metrics of reduced $\chi^2$ and the Durbin-Watson statistic.

### Lego: Learning to Disentangle and Invert Personalized Concepts Beyond   Object Appearance in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Saman Motamed, Danda Pani Paudel, Luc Van Gool

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T14:04:35Z

**Summary**: Text-to-Image (T2I) models excel at synthesizing concepts such as nouns, appearances, and styles. To enable customized content creation based on a few example images of a concept, methods such as Textual Inversion and DreamBooth invert the desired concept and enable synthesizing it in new scenes. However, inverting personalized concepts that go beyond object appearance and style (adjectives and verbs) through natural language remains a challenge. Two key characteristics of these concepts contribute to the limitations of current inversion methods. 1) Adjectives and verbs are entangled with nouns (subject) and can hinder appearance-based inversion methods, where the subject appearance leaks into the concept embedding, and 2) describing such concepts often extends beyond single word embeddings.   In this study, we introduce Lego, a textual inversion method designed to invert subject-entangled concepts from a few example images. Lego disentangles concepts from their associated subjects using a simple yet effective Subject Separation step and employs a Context Loss that guides the inversion of single/multi-embedding concepts. In a thorough user study, Lego-generated concepts were preferred over 70% of the time when compared to the baseline in terms of authentically generating concepts according to a reference. Additionally, visual question answering using an LLM suggested Lego-generated concepts are better aligned with the text description of the concept.

### Charting the Future: Using Chart Question-Answering for Scalable   Evaluation of LLM-Driven Data Visualizations
**Authors**: James Ford, Xingmeng Zhao, Dan Schumacher, Anthony Rios

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T14:02:48Z

**Summary**: We propose a novel framework that leverages Visual Question Answering (VQA) models to automate the evaluation of LLM-generated data visualizations. Traditional evaluation methods often rely on human judgment, which is costly and unscalable, or focus solely on data accuracy, neglecting the effectiveness of visual communication. By employing VQA models, we assess data representation quality and the general communicative clarity of charts. Experiments were conducted using two leading VQA benchmark datasets, ChartQA and PlotQA, with visualizations generated by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and Meta's Llama 3.1 70B-Instruct models. Our results indicate that LLM-generated charts do not match the accuracy of the original non-LLM-generated charts based on VQA performance measures. Moreover, while our results demonstrate that few-shot prompting significantly boosts the accuracy of chart generation, considerable progress remains to be made before LLMs can fully match the precision of human-generated graphs. This underscores the importance of our work, which expedites the research process by enabling rapid iteration without the need for human annotation, thus accelerating advancements in this field.

**Authors**: Samuel Wiese, Jagoda Kaszowska-Mojsa, Joel Dyer, Jose Moran, Marco Pangallo, Francois Lafond, John Muellbauer, Anisoara Calinescu, J. Doyne Farmer

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T13:53:23Z

**Summary**: In the last few years, economic agent-based models have made the transition from qualitative models calibrated to match stylised facts to quantitative models for time series forecasting, and in some cases, their predictions have performed as well or better than those of standard models (see, e.g. Poledna et al. (2023a); Hommes et al. (2022); Pichler et al. (2022)). Here, we build on the model of Poledna et al., adding several new features such as housing markets, realistic synthetic populations of individuals with income, wealth and consumption heterogeneity, enhanced behavioural rules and market mechanisms, and an enhanced credit market. We calibrate our model for all 38 OECD member countries using state-of-the-art approximate Bayesian inference methods and test it by making out-of-sample forecasts. It outperforms both the Poledna and AR(1) time series models by a highly statistically significant margin. Our model is built within a platform we have developed, making it easy to build, run, and evaluate alternative models, which we hope will encourage future work in this area.

### Enhancing Explainability in Multimodal Large Language Models Using   Ontological Context
**Authors**: Jihen Amara, Birgitta König-Ries, Sheeba Samuel

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T13:44:55Z

**Summary**: Recently, there has been a growing interest in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to their remarkable potential in various tasks integrating different modalities, such as image and text, as well as applications such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, such models still face challenges in accurately captioning and interpreting specific visual concepts and classes, particularly in domain-specific applications. We argue that integrating domain knowledge in the form of an ontology can significantly address these issues. In this work, as a proof of concept, we propose a new framework that combines ontology with MLLMs to classify images of plant diseases. Our method uses concepts about plant diseases from an existing disease ontology to query MLLMs and extract relevant visual concepts from images. Then, we use the reasoning capabilities of the ontology to classify the disease according to the identified concepts. Ensuring that the model accurately uses the concepts describing the disease is crucial in domain-specific applications. By employing an ontology, we can assist in verifying this alignment. Additionally, using the ontology's inference capabilities increases transparency, explainability, and trust in the decision-making process while serving as a judge by checking if the annotations of the concepts by MLLMs are aligned with those in the ontology and displaying the rationales behind their errors. Our framework offers a new direction for synergizing ontologies and MLLMs, supported by an empirical study using different well-known MLLMs.

### Cottention: Linear Transformers With Cosine Attention
**Authors**: Gabriel Mongaras, Trevor Dohm, Eric C. Larson

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T13:38:36Z

**Summary**: Attention mechanisms, particularly softmax attention, have been instrumental in the success of transformer-based models such as GPT. However, the quadratic memory complexity of softmax attention with respect to sequence length poses significant challenges for processing longer sequences. We introduce Cottention, a novel attention mechanism that replaces the softmax operation with cosine similarity. By leveraging the properties of cosine similarity and rearranging the attention equation, Cottention achieves native linear memory complexity with respect to sequence length, making it inherently more memory-efficient than softmax attention. We demonstrate that Cottention can be reformulated as a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a finite hidden state, allowing for constant memory usage during inference. We evaluate Cottention on both the bidirectional BERT and causal GPT tasks, demonstrating comparable performance to softmax attention while significantly reducing memory requirements. To ensure efficient computation, we develop a custom CUDA kernel for Cottention. Our results show that Cottention is a promising alternative to softmax attention, enabling the processing of longer sequences without sacrificing performance, due to its native linear memory complexity and ability to maintain a constant memory footprint during inference.

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T13:20:18Z

**Summary**: As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) expand, it becomes increasingly important to evaluate them beyond basic knowledge assessment, focusing on higher-level language understanding. This study introduces MultiPragEval, the first multilingual pragmatic evaluation of LLMs, designed for English, German, Korean, and Chinese. Comprising 1200 question units categorized according to Grice's Cooperative Principle and its four conversational maxims, MultiPragEval enables an in-depth assessment of LLMs' contextual awareness and their ability to infer implied meanings. Our findings demonstrate that Claude3-Opus significantly outperforms other models in all tested languages, establishing a state-of-the-art in the field. Among open-source models, Solar-10.7B and Qwen1.5-14B emerge as strong competitors. By analyzing pragmatic inference, we provide valuable insights into the capabilities essential for advanced language comprehension in AI systems.

### The Impact of Unstated Norms in Bias Analysis of Language Models
**Authors**: Farnaz Kohankhaki, D. B. Emerson, Jacob-Junqi Tian, Laleh Seyyed-Kalantari, Faiza Khan Khattak

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T13:12:23Z

**Summary**: Bias in large language models (LLMs) has many forms, from overt discrimination to implicit stereotypes. Counterfactual bias evaluation is a widely used approach to quantifying bias and often relies on template-based probes that explicitly state group membership. It measures whether the outcome of a task, performed by an LLM, is invariant to a change of group membership. In this work, we find that template-based probes can lead to unrealistic bias measurements. For example, LLMs appear to mistakenly cast text associated with White race as negative at higher rates than other groups. We hypothesize that this arises artificially via a mismatch between commonly unstated norms, in the form of markedness, in the pretraining text of LLMs (e.g., Black president vs. president) and templates used for bias measurement (e.g., Black president vs. White president). The findings highlight the potential misleading impact of varying group membership through explicit mention in counterfactual bias quantification.

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:58:43Z

**Summary**: Young brown dwarfs exhibit atmospheric characteristics similar to those of super-Jupiters, providing a unique opportunity to study planetary atmospheres. The ESO SupJup Survey, utilizing CRIRES$^+$ on the Very Large Telescope, aims to assess the role of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C as a formation tracer. We present observations of three young brown dwarfs: 2MASS J12003792-7845082, TWA 28, and 2MASS J08561384-1342242, with the goal of constraining their chemical compositions, thermal profiles, surface gravities, spin rotations, and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C. Atmospheric retrievals of CRIRES$^+$ K-band spectra were conducted using the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS coupled with the Bayesian inference algorithm MultiNest, resulting in a detailed characterization of the atmospheres of these objects. We report the volume mixing ratios of main molecular and atomic species, including the novel detection of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in a brown dwarf's atmosphere, and determine $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C values of $81^{+28}_{-19}$ and $79^{+20}_{-14}$ in the atmospheres of TWA 28 and J0856, respectively, with strong significance ($>3\sigma$). Tentative evidence ($\sim 2\sigma$) of $^{13}$C in J1200 was found, with $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = $114^{+69}_{-33}$, along with $^{18}$O detected at moderate significance in J0856 (3.3$\sigma$) and TWA 28 (2.1$\sigma$). The retrieved thermal profiles indicate hot atmospheres (2300-2600 K) with low surface gravities and slow spins, consistent with young objects. The consistent carbon isotope ratios among the three objects, showing no significant deviation from the local ISM, suggest a fragmentation-based formation mechanism similar to star formation. The tentative detection of $^{18}$O in two objects highlights the potential of high-resolution spectroscopy to probe additional isotope ratios, such as $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O, in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters.

### Read Over the Lines: Attacking LLMs and Toxicity Detection Systems with   ASCII Art to Mask Profanity
**Authors**: Sergey Berezin, Reza Farahbakhsh, Noel Crespi

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:54:13Z

**Summary**: We introduce a novel family of adversarial attacks that exploit the inability of language models to interpret ASCII art. To evaluate these attacks, we propose the ToxASCII benchmark and develop two custom ASCII art fonts: one leveraging special tokens and another using text-filled letter shapes. Our attacks achieve a perfect 1.0 Attack Success Rate across ten models, including OpenAI's o1-preview and LLaMA 3.1.   Warning: this paper contains examples of toxic language used for research purposes.

**Authors**: Xiaoshuang Li, Zimo Huang, Mingyuan Meng, Eduardo Delamare, Dagan Feng, Lei Bi, Bin Sheng, Lingyong Jiang, Bo Li, Jinman Kim

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:44:06Z

**Summary**: Panoramic X-ray (PX) is a prevalent modality in dentistry practice owing to its wide availability and low cost. However, as a 2D projection of a 3D structure, PX suffers from anatomical information loss and PX diagnosis is limited compared to that with 3D imaging modalities. 2D-to-3D reconstruction methods have been explored for the ability to synthesize the absent 3D anatomical information from 2D PX for use in PX image analysis. However, there are challenges in leveraging such 3D synthesized reconstructions. First, inferring 3D depth from 2D images remains a challenging task with limited accuracy. The second challenge is the joint analysis of 2D PX with its 3D synthesized counterpart, with the aim to maximize the 2D-3D synergy while minimizing the errors arising from the synthesized image. In this study, we propose a new method termed 3DPX - PX image analysis guided by 2D-to-3D reconstruction, to overcome these challenges. 3DPX consists of (i) a novel progressive reconstruction network to improve 2D-to-3D reconstruction and, (ii) a contrastive-guided bidirectional multimodality alignment module for 3D-guided 2D PX classification and segmentation tasks. The reconstruction network progressively reconstructs 3D images with knowledge imposed on the intermediate reconstructions at multiple pyramid levels and incorporates Multilayer Perceptrons to improve semantic understanding. The downstream networks leverage the reconstructed images as 3D anatomical guidance to the PX analysis through feature alignment, which increases the 2D-3D synergy with bidirectional feature projection and decease the impact of potential errors with contrastive guidance. Extensive experiments on two oral datasets involving 464 studies demonstrate that 3DPX outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in various tasks including 2D-to-3D reconstruction, PX classification and lesion segmentation.

### Reward-Robust RLHF in LLMs
**Authors**: Yuzi Yan, Xingzhou Lou, Jialian Li, Yiping Zhang, Jian Xie, Chao Yu, Yu Wang, Dong Yan, Yuan Shen

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:36:58Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to progress toward more advanced forms of intelligence, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly seen as a key pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the reliance on reward-model-based (RM-based) alignment methods introduces significant challenges due to the inherent instability and imperfections of Reward Models (RMs), which can lead to critical issues such as reward hacking and misalignment with human intentions. In this paper, we introduce a reward-robust RLHF framework aimed at addressing these fundamental challenges, paving the way for more reliable and resilient learning in LLMs. Our approach introduces a novel optimization objective that carefully balances performance and robustness by incorporating Bayesian Reward Model Ensembles (BRME) to model the uncertainty set of reward functions. This allows the framework to integrate both nominal performance and minimum reward signals, ensuring more stable learning even with imperfect RMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms baselines across diverse benchmarks, showing improved accuracy and long-term stability. We also provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that reward-robust RLHF approaches the stability of constant reward settings, which proves to be acceptable even in a stochastic-case analysis. Together, these contributions highlight the framework potential to enhance both the performance and stability of LLM alignment.

### Heavy Elements Abundances Inferred from the First Adiabatic Exponent in   the Solar Envelope
**Authors**: V. A. Baturin, A. V. Oreshina, G. Buldgen, S. V. Ayukov, V. K. Gryaznov, I. L. Iosilevskiy, A. Noels, R. Scuflaire

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:28:20Z

**Summary**: The first adiabatic exponent profile, noted $\Gamma_1$, computed along adiabatic coordinats $(T, \rho)$ is in the focus of our study. Under conditions of almost fully ionized hydrogen and helium, the $\Gamma_1$ profile is quite sensitive to heavy elements ionization. $\Gamma_1$ decreases in regions where an element is partially ionized. The recent helioseismic structural inversion is obtained with an accuracy better than $10^{-4}$ in the most of the adiabatic convective zone that allows to study ionization variations. The aim is to determine the major heavy elements content in the solar convective zone. The method of our research is synthesis of the $\Gamma_1$ profile which is based on a linear combination of the contributions of individual heavy elements. The idea of the approach was proposed and justified by Baturin et al. (Astron. Astrophys., 660, A125, 2022). We find the best approximation of the inverted profile $\Gamma_1$ adjusting the abundances of major elements (C, N, O, Ne), meanwhile the abundances of elements heavier than neon are fixed. We synthesize the theoretical $\Gamma_1$ profile using the SAHA-S equation of state, and are able to reproduce the inverted profiles with an accuracy of $(1-2)\cdot 10^{-5}$. Total mass fraction of heavy elements found by this method is $Z=0.0148\pm 0.0004$. The oxygen logarithmic abundance is $8.70\pm 0.03$, carbon $8.44\pm 0.04$, nitrogen $8.12\pm 0.08$, and neon $8.17\pm 0.09$. The obtained estimations of oxygen and carbon agree with spectroscopic abundances by Asplund et al. (Astron. Astrophys., 653, A141, 2021).

### TinyVLA: Towards Fast, Data-Efficient Vision-Language-Action Models for   Robotic Manipulation
**Authors**: Junjie Wen, Yichen Zhu, Jinming Li, Minjie Zhu, Kun Wu, Zhiyuan Xu, Ning Liu, Ran Cheng, Chaomin Shen, Yaxin Peng, Feifei Feng, Jian Tang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:23:06Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable potential in visuomotor control and instruction comprehension through end-to-end learning processes. However, current VLA models face significant challenges: they are slow during inference and require extensive pre-training on large amounts of robotic data, making real-world deployment difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new family of compact vision-language-action models, called TinyVLA, which offers two key advantages over existing VLA models: (1) faster inference speeds, and (2) improved data efficiency, eliminating the need for pre-training stage. Our framework incorporates two essential components to build TinyVLA: (1) initializing the policy backbone with robust, high-speed multimodal models, and (2) integrating a diffusion policy decoder during fine-tuning to enable precise robot actions. We conducted extensive evaluations of TinyVLA in both simulation and on real robots, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model, OpenVLA, in terms of speed and data efficiency, while delivering comparable or superior performance. Additionally, TinyVLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities across various dimensions, including language instructions, novel objects, unseen positions, changes in object appearance, background variations, and environmental shifts, often matching or exceeding the performance of OpenVLA. We believe that \methodname offers an interesting perspective on utilizing pre-trained multimodal models for policy learning. Our project is at https://tiny-vla.github.io.

### Implicit Image-to-Image Schrodinger Bridge for Image Restoration
**Authors**: Yuang Wang, Siyeop Yoon, Pengfei Jin, Matthew Tivnan, Sifan Song, Zhennong Chen, Rui Hu, Li Zhang, Quanzheng Li, Zhiqiang Chen, Dufan Wu

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:23:04Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based models are widely recognized for their effectiveness in image restoration tasks; however, their iterative denoising process, which begins from Gaussian noise, often results in slow inference speeds. The Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^2$SB) presents a promising alternative by starting the generative process from corrupted images and leveraging training techniques from score-based diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce the Implicit Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^3$SB) to further accelerate the generative process of I$^2$SB. I$^3$SB reconfigures the generative process into a non-Markovian framework by incorporating the initial corrupted image into each step, while ensuring that the marginal distribution aligns with that of I$^2$SB. This allows for the direct use of the pretrained network from I$^2$SB. Extensive experiments on natural images, human face images, and medical images validate the acceleration benefits of I$^3$SB. Compared to I$^2$SB, I$^3$SB achieves the same perceptual quality with fewer generative steps, while maintaining equal or improved fidelity to the ground truth.

### QPaug: Question and Passage Augmentation for Open-Domain Question   Answering of LLMs
**Authors**: Minsang Kim, Cheoneum Park, Seungjun Baek

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:18:34Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has received much attention for Open-domain question-answering (ODQA) tasks as a means to compensate for the parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). While previous approaches focused on processing retrieved passages to remove irrelevant context, they still rely heavily on the quality of retrieved passages which can degrade if the question is ambiguous or complex. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient method called question and passage augmentation (QPaug) via LLMs for open-domain QA. QPaug first decomposes the original questions into multiple-step sub-questions. By augmenting the original question with detailed sub-questions and planning, we are able to make the query more specific on what needs to be retrieved, improving the retrieval performance. In addition, to compensate for the case where the retrieved passages contain distracting information or divided opinions, we augment the retrieved passages with self-generated passages by LLMs to guide the answer extraction. Experimental results show that QPaug outperforms the previous state-of-the-art and achieves significant performance gain over existing RAG methods. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/kmswin1/QPaug}.

### Plurals: A System for Guiding LLMs Via Simulated Social Ensembles
**Authors**: Joshua Ashkinaze, Emily Fry, Narendra Edara, Eric Gilbert, Ceren Budak

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:12:44Z

**Summary**: Recent debates raised concerns that language models may favor certain viewpoints. But what if the solution is not to aim for a 'view from nowhere' but rather to leverage different viewpoints? We introduce Plurals, a system and Python library for pluralistic AI deliberation. Plurals consists of Agents (LLMs, optionally with personas) which deliberate within customizable Structures, with Moderators overseeing deliberation. Plurals is a generator of simulated social ensembles. Plurals integrates with government datasets to create nationally representative personas, includes deliberation templates inspired by democratic deliberation theory, and allows users to customize both information-sharing structures and deliberation behavior within Structures. Six case studies demonstrate fidelity to theoretical constructs and efficacy. Three randomized experiments show simulated focus groups produced output resonant with an online sample of the relevant audiences (chosen over zero-shot generation in 75% of trials). Plurals is both a paradigm and a concrete system for pluralistic AI. The Plurals library is available at https://github.com/josh-ashkinaze/plurals and will be continually updated.

### Schrodinger's Memory: Large Language Models
**Authors**: Wei Wang, Qing Li

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:12:19Z

**Summary**: Memory is the foundation of all human activities; without memory, it would be nearly impossible for people to perform any task in daily life. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), their language capabilities are becoming increasingly comparable to those of humans. But do LLMs have memory? Based on current performance, LLMs do appear to exhibit memory. So, what is the underlying mechanism of this memory? Previous research has lacked a deep exploration of LLMs' memory capabilities and the underlying theory. In this paper, we use Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT) to explain the memory mechanism in LLMs. We also conduct experiments to verify the memory capabilities of various LLMs, proposing a new method to assess their abilities based on these memory ability. We argue that LLM memory operates like Schr\"odinger's memory, meaning that it only becomes observable when a specific memory is queried. We can only determine if the model retains a memory based on its output in response to the query; otherwise, it remains indeterminate. Finally, we expand on this concept by comparing the memory capabilities of the human brain and LLMs, highlighting the similarities and differences in their operational mechanisms.

### Platypose: Calibrated Zero-Shot Multi-Hypothesis 3D Human Motion   Estimation
**Authors**: Paweł A. Pierzchlewicz, Caio O. da Silva, R. James Cotton, Fabian H. Sinz

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:08:07Z

**Summary**: Single camera 3D pose estimation is an ill-defined problem due to inherent ambiguities from depth, occlusion or keypoint noise. Multi-hypothesis pose estimation accounts for this uncertainty by providing multiple 3D poses consistent with the 2D measurements. Current research has predominantly concentrated on generating multiple hypotheses for single frame static pose estimation or single hypothesis motion estimation. In this study we focus on the new task of multi-hypothesis motion estimation. Multi-hypothesis motion estimation is not simply multi-hypothesis pose estimation applied to multiple frames, which would ignore temporal correlation across frames. Instead, it requires distributions which are capable of generating temporally consistent samples, which is significantly more challenging than multi-hypothesis pose estimation or single-hypothesis motion estimation. To this end, we introduce Platypose, a framework that uses a diffusion model pretrained on 3D human motion sequences for zero-shot 3D pose sequence estimation. Platypose outperforms baseline methods on multiple hypotheses for motion estimation. Additionally, Platypose also achieves state-of-the-art calibration and competitive joint error when tested on static poses from Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW. Finally, because it is zero-shot, our method generalizes flexibly to different settings such as multi-camera inference.

### Beyond Single-Audio: Advancing Multi-Audio Processing in Audio Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Yiming Chen, Xianghu Yue, Xiaoxue Gao, Chen Zhang, Luis Fernando D'Haro, Robby T. Tan, Haizhou Li

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:06:53Z

**Summary**: Various audio-LLMs (ALLMs) have been explored recently for tackling different audio tasks simultaneously using a single, unified model. While existing evaluations of ALLMs primarily focus on single-audio tasks, real-world applications often involve processing multiple audio streams simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose the first multi-audio evaluation (MAE) benchmark that consists of 20 datasets from 11 multi-audio tasks encompassing both speech and sound scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on MAE demonstrate that the existing ALLMs, while being powerful in comprehending primary audio elements in individual audio inputs, struggling to handle multi-audio scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel multi-audio-LLM (MALLM) to capture audio context among multiple similar audios using discriminative learning on our proposed synthetic data. The results demonstrate that the proposed MALLM outperforms all baselines and achieves high data efficiency using synthetic data without requiring human annotations. The proposed MALLM opens the door for ALLMs towards multi-audio processing era and brings us closer to replicating human auditory capabilities in machines.

### Maybenot: A Framework for Traffic Analysis Defenses
**Authors**: Tobias Pulls, Ethan Witwer

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:06:15Z

**Summary**: End-to-end encryption is a powerful tool for protecting the privacy of Internet users. Together with the increasing use of technologies such as Tor, VPNs, and encrypted messaging, it is becoming increasingly difficult for network adversaries to monitor and censor Internet traffic. One remaining avenue for adversaries is traffic analysis: the analysis of patterns in encrypted traffic to infer information about the users and their activities. Recent improvements using deep learning have made traffic analysis attacks more effective than ever before.   We present Maybenot, a framework for traffic analysis defenses. Maybenot is designed to be easy to use and integrate into existing end-to-end encrypted protocols. It is implemented in the Rust programming language as a crate (library), together with a simulator to further the development of defenses. Defenses in Maybenot are expressed as probabilistic state machines that schedule actions to inject padding or block outgoing traffic. Maybenot is an evolution from the Tor Circuit Padding Framework by Perry and Kadianakis, designed to support a wide range of protocols and use cases.

### "Why" Has the Least Side Effect on Model Editing
**Authors**: Tsung-Hsuan Pan, Chung-Chi Chen, Hen-Hsen Huang, Hsin-Hsi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:05:12Z

**Summary**: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is an expensive endeavor, particularly as world knowledge continually evolves. To maintain relevance and accuracy of LLMs, model editing has emerged as a pivotal research area. While these methods hold promise, they can also produce unintended side effects. Their underlying factors and causes remain largely unexplored. This paper delves into a critical factor-question type-by categorizing model editing questions. Our findings reveal that the extent of performance degradation varies significantly across different question types, providing new insights for experimental design in knowledge editing. Furthermore, we investigate whether insights from smaller models can be extrapolated to larger models. Our results indicate discrepancies in findings between models of different sizes, suggesting that insights from smaller models may not necessarily apply to larger models. Additionally, we examine the impact of batch size on side effects, discovering that increasing the batch size can mitigate performance drops.

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:05:05Z

**Summary**: Question answering (QA) has been a long-standing focus in the NLP field, predominantly addressing reading comprehension and common sense QA. However, scenarios involving the preparation of answers to probable questions during professional oral presentations remain underexplored. In this paper, we pioneer the examination of this crucial yet overlooked topic by utilizing real-world QA conversation transcripts between company managers and professional analysts. We explore the proposed task using three causal knowledge graphs (KGs) and three large language models (LLMs). This work provides foundational insights into the application of LLMs in professional QA scenarios, highlighting the importance of causal KGs and perspective-taking in generating effective responses.

### The axis of systematic bias in SN~Ia cosmology and implications for DESI   2024 results
**Authors**: Suhail Dhawan, Brodie Popovic, Ariel Goobar

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T11:53:38Z

**Summary**: Relative distances between a high-redshift sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), anchored to a low-redshift sample, have been instrumental in drawing insights on the nature of the dark energy driving the accelerated expansion of the universe. A combination (hereafter called SBC) of the SNe~Ia with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) recently indicated deviations from the standard interpretation of dark energy as a cosmological constant. In this paper, we analyse various systematic uncertainties in the distance measurement of SNe~Ia and their impact on the inferred dark energy properties in the canonical Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model. We model systematic effects like photometric calibration, progenitor and dust evolution, and uncertainty in the galactic extinction law. We find that all the dominant systematic errors shift the dark energy inference towards the DESI 2024 results from an underlying $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. A small change in the calibration, and change in the Milky Way dust, can give rise to systematic-driven shifts on $w_0$-$w_a$ constraints, comparable to the deviation reported from the DESI 2024 results. We forecast that the systematic uncertainties can shift the inference of $w_0-w_a$ by a few times the error ellipse for future low- and high-$z$ SN~Ia compilations and hence, it is critical to circumvent them to robustly test for deviations from $\Lambda$. A slider and visualisation tool for quantifying the impact of systematic effects on the fitted cosmological parameters is publicly available at: https://github.com/sdhawan21/DEslider.git

### How green is continual learning, really? Analyzing the energy   consumption in continual training of vision foundation models
**Authors**: Tomaso Trinci, Simone Magistri, Roberto Verdecchia, Andrew D. Bagdanov

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T11:50:10Z

**Summary**: With the ever-growing adoption of AI, its impact on the environment is no longer negligible. Despite the potential that continual learning could have towards Green AI, its environmental sustainability remains relatively uncharted. In this work we aim to gain a systematic understanding of the energy efficiency of continual learning algorithms. To that end, we conducted an extensive set of empirical experiments comparing the energy consumption of recent representation-, prompt-, and exemplar-based continual learning algorithms and two standard baseline (fine tuning and joint training) when used to continually adapt a pre-trained ViT-B/16 foundation model. We performed our experiments on three standard datasets: CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and DomainNet. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, the Energy NetScore, which we use measure the algorithm efficiency in terms of energy-accuracy trade-off. Through numerous evaluations varying the number and size of the incremental learning steps, our experiments demonstrate that different types of continual learning algorithms have very different impacts on energy consumption during both training and inference. Although often overlooked in the continual learning literature, we found that the energy consumed during the inference phase is crucial for evaluating the environmental sustainability of continual learning models.

### Large Language Models are Limited in Out-of-Context Knowledge Reasoning
**Authors**: Peng Hu, Changjiang Gao, Ruiqi Gao, Jiajun Chen, Shujian Huang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T11:46:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and strong capabilities in performing in-context reasoning. However, previous work challenges their out-of-context reasoning ability, i.e., the ability to infer information from their training data, instead of from the context or prompt. This paper focuses on a significant aspect of out-of-context reasoning: Out-of-Context Knowledge Reasoning (OCKR), which is to combine multiple knowledge to infer new knowledge. We designed a synthetic dataset with seven representative OCKR tasks to systematically assess the OCKR capabilities of LLMs. Using this dataset, we evaluated several LLMs and discovered that their proficiency in this aspect is limited, regardless of whether the knowledge is trained in a separate or adjacent training settings. Moreover, training the model to reason with reasoning examples does not result in significant improvement, while training the model to perform explicit knowledge retrieval helps for retrieving attribute knowledge but not the relation knowledge, indicating that the model's limited OCKR capabilities are due to difficulties in knowledge retrieval. Furthermore, we treat cross-lingual knowledge transfer as a distinct form of OCKR, and evaluate this ability. Our results show that the evaluated model also exhibits limited ability in transferring knowledge across languages.

### Fusing Dynamics Equation: A Social Opinions Prediction Algorithm with   LLM-based Agents
**Authors**: Junchi Yao, Hongjie Zhang, Jie Ou, Dingyi Zuo, Zheng Yang, Zhicheng Dong

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T11:46:33Z

**Summary**: In the context where social media is increasingly becoming a significant platform for social movements and the formation of public opinion, accurately simulating and predicting the dynamics of user opinions is of great importance for understanding social phenomena, policy making, and guiding public opinion. However, existing simulation methods face challenges in capturing the complexity and dynamics of user behavior. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes an innovative simulation method for the dynamics of social media user opinions, the FDE-LLM algorithm, which incorporates opinion dynamics and epidemic model. This effectively constrains the actions and opinion evolution process of large language models (LLM), making them more aligned with the real cyber world. In particular, the FDE-LLM categorizes users into opinion leaders and followers. Opinion leaders are based on LLM role-playing and are constrained by the CA model, while opinion followers are integrated into a dynamic system that combines the CA model with the SIR model. This innovative design significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of the simulation. Experiments were conducted on four real Weibo datasets and validated using the open-source model ChatGLM. The results show that, compared to traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) opinion dynamics algorithms and LLM-based opinion diffusion algorithms, our FDE-LLM algorithm demonstrates higher accuracy and interpretability.

### Not the Silver Bullet: LLM-enhanced Programming Error Messages are   Ineffective in Practice
**Authors**: Eddie Antonio Santos, Brett A. Becker

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T11:45:56Z

**Summary**: The sudden emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has had a disruptive impact throughout the computing education community. LLMs have been shown to excel at producing correct code to CS1 and CS2 problems, and can even act as friendly assistants to students learning how to code. Recent work shows that LLMs demonstrate unequivocally superior results in being able to explain and resolve compiler error messages -- for decades, one of the most frustrating parts of learning how to code. However, LLM-generated error message explanations have only been assessed by expert programmers in artificial conditions. This work sought to understand how novice programmers resolve programming error messages (PEMs) in a more realistic scenario. We ran a within-subjects study with $n$ = 106 participants in which students were tasked to fix six buggy C programs. For each program, participants were randomly assigned to fix the problem using either a stock compiler error message, an expert-handwritten error message, or an error message explanation generated by GPT-4. Despite promising evidence on synthetic benchmarks, we found that GPT-4 generated error messages outperformed conventional compiler error messages in only 1 of the 6 tasks, measured by students' time-to-fix each problem. Handwritten explanations still outperform LLM and conventional error messages, both on objective and subjective measures.

### CausalBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Causal Learning Capability of   LLMs
**Authors**: Yu Zhou, Xingyu Wu, Beicheng Huang, Jibin Wu, Liang Feng, Kay Chen Tan

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T11:45:09Z

**Summary**: The ability to understand causality significantly impacts the competence of large language models (LLMs) in output explanation and counterfactual reasoning, as causality reveals the underlying data distribution. However, the lack of a comprehensive benchmark currently limits the evaluation of LLMs' causal learning capabilities. To fill this gap, this paper develops CausalBench based on data from the causal research community, enabling comparative evaluations of LLMs against traditional causal learning algorithms. To provide a comprehensive investigation, we offer three tasks of varying difficulties, including correlation, causal skeleton, and causality identification. Evaluations of 19 leading LLMs reveal that, while closed-source LLMs show potential for simple causal relationships, they significantly lag behind traditional algorithms on larger-scale networks ($>50$ nodes). Specifically, LLMs struggle with collider structures but excel at chain structures, especially at long-chain causality analogous to Chains-of-Thought techniques. This supports the current prompt approaches while suggesting directions to enhance LLMs' causal reasoning capability. Furthermore, CausalBench incorporates background knowledge and training data into prompts to thoroughly unlock LLMs' text-comprehension ability during evaluation, whose findings indicate that, LLM understand causality through semantic associations with distinct entities, rather than directly from contextual information or numerical distributions.

### Explainable Enrichment-Driven GrAph Reasoner (EDGAR) for Large Knowledge   Graphs with Applications in Drug Repurposing
**Authors**: Olawumi Olasunkanmi, Evan Morris, Yaphet Kebede, Harlin Lee, Stanley Ahalt, Alexander Tropsha, Chris Bizon

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T11:43:19Z

**Summary**: Knowledge graphs (KGs) represent connections and relationships between real-world entities. We propose a link prediction framework for KGs named Enrichment-Driven GrAph Reasoner (EDGAR), which infers new edges by mining entity-local rules. This approach leverages enrichment analysis, a well-established statistical method used to identify mechanisms common to sets of differentially expressed genes. EDGAR's inference results are inherently explainable and rankable, with p-values indicating the statistical significance of each enrichment-based rule.   We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on a large-scale biomedical KG, ROBOKOP, focusing on drug repurposing for Alzheimer disease (AD) as a case study. Initially, we extracted 14 known drugs from the KG and identified 20 contextual biomarkers through enrichment analysis, revealing functional pathways relevant to shared drug efficacy for AD. Subsequently, using the top 1000 enrichment results, our system identified 1246 additional drug candidates for AD treatment. The top 10 candidates were validated using evidence from medical literature.   EDGAR is deployed within ROBOKOP, complete with a web user interface. This is the first study to apply enrichment analysis to large graph completion and drug repurposing.

### MATHWELL: Generating Educational Math Word Problems Using Teacher   Annotations
**Authors**: Bryan R Christ, Jonathan Kropko, Thomas Hartvigsen

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T11:28:50Z

**Summary**: Math word problems are critical K-8 educational tools, but writing them is time consuming and requires extensive expertise. To be educational, problems must be solvable, have accurate answers, and, most importantly, be educationally appropriate. We propose that language models have potential to support K-8 math education by automatically generating word problems. However, evaluating educational appropriateness is hard to quantify. We fill this gap by having teachers evaluate problems generated by LLMs, who find existing models and data often fail to be educationally appropriate. We then explore automatically generating educational word problems, ultimately using our expert annotations to finetune a 70B language model. Our model, MATHWELL, is the first K-8 word problem generator targeted at educational appropriateness. Further expert studies find MATHWELL generates problems far more solvable, accurate, and appropriate than public models. MATHWELL also matches GPT-4's problem quality while attaining more appropriate reading levels for K-8 students and avoiding generating harmful questions.

### Incorporating Precedents for Legal Judgement Prediction on European   Court of Human Rights Cases
**Authors**: T. Y. S. S. Santosh, Mohamed Hesham Elganayni, Stanisław Sójka, Matthias Grabmair

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T11:24:35Z

**Summary**: Inspired by the legal doctrine of stare decisis, which leverages precedents (prior cases) for informed decision-making, we explore methods to integrate them into LJP models. To facilitate precedent retrieval, we train a retriever with a fine-grained relevance signal based on the overlap ratio of alleged articles between cases. We investigate two strategies to integrate precedents: direct incorporation at inference via label interpolation based on case proximity and during training via a precedent fusion module using a stacked-cross attention model. We employ joint training of the retriever and LJP models to address latent space divergence between them. Our experiments on LJP tasks from the ECHR jurisdiction reveal that integrating precedents during training coupled with joint training of the retriever and LJP model, outperforms models without precedents or with precedents incorporated only at inference, particularly benefiting sparser articles.

### Time-Varying Multi-Seasonal AR Models
**Authors**: Ganna Fagerberg, Mattias Villani, Robert Kohn

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T11:15:17Z

**Summary**: We propose a seasonal AR model with time-varying parameter processes in both the regular and seasonal parameters. The model is parameterized to guarantee stability at every time point and can accommodate multiple seasonal periods. The time evolution is modeled by dynamic shrinkage processes to allow for long periods of essentially constant parameters, periods of rapid change as well as abrupt jumps. A Gibbs sampler is developed with a particle Gibbs update step for the AR parameter trajectories. The near-degeneracy of the model, caused by the dynamic shrinkage processes, is shown to pose a challenge for particle methods. To address this, a more robust, faster and accurate approximate sampler based on the extended Kalman filter is proposed. The model and the numerical effectiveness of the Gibbs sampler are investigated on simulated and real data. An application to more than a century of monthly US industrial production data shows interesting clear changes in seasonality over time, particularly during the Great Depression and the recent Covid-19 pandemic. Keywords: Bayesian inference; Extended Kalman filter; Locally stationary processes; Particle MCMC; Seasonality.

### Defect density quantification in monolayer MoS2 using helium atom   micro-diffraction
**Authors**: Aleksandar Radic, Nick von Jeinsen, Ke Wang, Yiru Zhu, Ismail Sami, Vivian Perez, David Ward, Andrew Jardine, Manish Chhowalla, Sam Lambrick

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T11:08:02Z

**Summary**: Sulfur vacancy defects mediate a wide range of optoelectronic properties in MoS2, with precise control of defect density allowing for tuneable optoelectronic devices. However, accurate measurement of defect density in monolayer and few-layer samples poses a challenge due to their small scattering cross-sections to photon or electron probes. Conventional lab-based techniques such as Raman and photoluminescence can infer approximate defect density in micro-scale samples via optoelectronic properties, but they require validation using stoichiometric beam-line XPS. We introduce an ultra-low energy (~64 meV) and non-intrusive lab-based technique to quantify the surface defect density in micron-scale monolayer MoS2. Here we show that a recently developed technique, helium atom micro-diffraction (referred to as scanning helium microscopy (SHeM) in literature), can be used to directly measure vacancy-type defect density in 2D materials by performing atom diffraction from a microscopic spot. SHeM uses a neutral, inert, and thermal energy probe of helium-4 atoms to measure ordered and disordered atom-surface scattering allowing the level of surface order to be inferred. The presented method enables rapid, non-damaging, and material-agnostic lab-based quantification of defect density in 2D materials, a crucial step towards the wider adoption of 2D semiconductors in devices.

### Interpretable ML for High-Frequency Execution
**Authors**: Timothée Fabre, Vincent Ragel

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T11:07:28Z

**Summary**: Order placement tactics play a crucial role in high-frequency trading algorithms and their design is based on understanding the dynamics of the order book. Using high quality high-frequency data and a set of microstructural features, we exhibit strong state dependence properties of the fill probability function. We train a neural network to infer the fill probability function for a fixed horizon. Since we aim at providing a high-frequency execution framework, we use a simple architecture. A weighting method is applied to the loss function such that the model learns from censored data. By comparing numerical results obtained on both digital asset centralized exchanges (CEXs) and stock markets, we are able to analyze dissimilarities between feature importances of the fill probability of small tick crypto pairs and Euronext equities. The practical use of this model is illustrated with a fixed time horizon execution problem in which both the decision to post a limit order or to immediately execute and the optimal distance of placement are characterized. We discuss the importance of accurately estimating the clean-up cost that occurs in the case of a non-execution and we show it can be well approximated by a smooth function of market features. We finally assess the performance of our model with a backtesting approach that avoids the insertion of hypothetical orders and makes possible to test the order placement algorithm with orders that realistically impact the price formation process.

### Model-based Preference Optimization in Abstractive Summarization without   Human Feedback
**Authors**: Jaepill Choi, Kyubyung Chae, Jiwoo Song, Yohan Jo, Taesup Kim

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T10:35:45Z

**Summary**: In abstractive summarization, the challenge of producing concise and accurate summaries arises from the vast amount of information contained in the source document. Consequently, although Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, they often introduce inaccuracies by hallucinating content not found in the original source. While supervised fine-tuning methods that maximize likelihood contribute to this issue, they do not consistently enhance the faithfulness of the summaries. Preference-based optimization methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), can further refine the model to align with human preferences. However, these methods still heavily depend on costly human feedback. In this work, we introduce a novel and straightforward approach called Model-based Preference Optimization (MPO) to fine-tune LLMs for improved summarization abilities without any human feedback. By leveraging the model's inherent summarization capabilities, we create a preference dataset that is fully generated by the model using different decoding strategies. Our experiments on standard summarization datasets and various metrics demonstrate that our proposed MPO significantly enhances the quality of generated summaries without relying on human feedback.

### MoJE: Mixture of Jailbreak Experts, Naive Tabular Classifiers as Guard   for Prompt Attacks
**Authors**: Giandomenico Cornacchia, Giulio Zizzo, Kieran Fraser, Muhammad Zaid Hamed, Ambrish Rawat, Mark Purcell

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T10:16:37Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in diverse applications underscores the pressing need for robust security measures to thwart potential jailbreak attacks. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities within LLMs, endanger data integrity and user privacy. Guardrails serve as crucial protective mechanisms against such threats, but existing models often fall short in terms of both detection accuracy, and computational efficiency. This paper advocates for the significance of jailbreak attack prevention on LLMs, and emphasises the role of input guardrails in safeguarding these models. We introduce MoJE (Mixture of Jailbreak Expert), a novel guardrail architecture designed to surpass current limitations in existing state-of-the-art guardrails. By employing simple linguistic statistical techniques, MoJE excels in detecting jailbreak attacks while maintaining minimal computational overhead during model inference. Through rigorous experimentation, MoJE demonstrates superior performance capable of detecting 90% of the attacks without compromising benign prompts, enhancing LLMs security against jailbreak attacks.

### Do LLMs suffer from Multi-Party Hangover? A Diagnostic Approach to   Addressee Recognition and Response Selection in Conversations
**Authors**: Nicolò Penzo, Maryam Sajedinia, Bruno Lepri, Sara Tonelli, Marco Guerini

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T10:07:33Z

**Summary**: Assessing the performance of systems to classify Multi-Party Conversations (MPC) is challenging due to the interconnection between linguistic and structural characteristics of conversations. Conventional evaluation methods often overlook variances in model behavior across different levels of structural complexity on interaction graphs. In this work, we propose a methodological pipeline to investigate model performance across specific structural attributes of conversations. As a proof of concept we focus on Response Selection and Addressee Recognition tasks, to diagnose model weaknesses. To this end, we extract representative diagnostic subdatasets with a fixed number of users and a good structural variety from a large and open corpus of online MPCs. We further frame our work in terms of data minimization, avoiding the use of original usernames to preserve privacy, and propose alternatives to using original text messages. Results show that response selection relies more on the textual content of conversations, while addressee recognition requires capturing their structural dimension. Using an LLM in a zero-shot setting, we further highlight how sensitivity to prompt variations is task-dependent.

### Comparing Apples to Oranges: LLM-powered Multimodal Intention Prediction   in an Object Categorization Task
**Authors**: Hassan Ali, Philipp Allgeuer, Stefan Wermter

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T10:05:56Z

**Summary**: Human intention-based systems enable robots to perceive and interpret user actions to interact with humans and adapt to their behavior proactively. Therefore, intention prediction is pivotal in creating a natural interaction with social robots in human-designed environments. In this paper, we examine using Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer human intention in a collaborative object categorization task with a physical robot. We propose a novel multimodal approach that integrates user non-verbal cues, like hand gestures, body poses, and facial expressions, with environment states and user verbal cues to predict user intentions in a hierarchical architecture. Our evaluation of five LLMs shows the potential for reasoning about verbal and non-verbal user cues, leveraging their context-understanding and real-world knowledge to support intention prediction while collaborating on a task with a social robot.

### ASAG2024: A Combined Benchmark for Short Answer Grading
**Authors**: Gérôme Meyer, Philip Breuer, Jonathan Fürst

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T09:56:02Z

**Summary**: Open-ended questions test a more thorough understanding than closed-ended questions and are often a preferred assessment method. However, open-ended questions are tedious to grade and subject to personal bias. Therefore, there have been efforts to speed up the grading process through automation. Short Answer Grading (SAG) systems aim to automatically score students' answers. Despite growth in SAG methods and capabilities, there exists no comprehensive short-answer grading benchmark across different subjects, grading scales, and distributions. Thus, it is hard to assess the capabilities of current automated grading methods in terms of their generalizability. In this preliminary work, we introduce the combined ASAG2024 benchmark to facilitate the comparison of automated grading systems. Combining seven commonly used short-answer grading datasets in a common structure and grading scale. For our benchmark, we evaluate a set of recent SAG methods, revealing that while LLM-based approaches reach new high scores, they still are far from reaching human performance. This opens up avenues for future research on human-machine SAG systems.

### "Oh LLM, I'm Asking Thee, Please Give Me a Decision Tree": Zero-Shot   Decision Tree Induction and Embedding with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ricardo Knauer, Mario Koddenbrock, Raphael Wallsberger, Nicholas M. Brisson, Georg N. Duda, Deborah Falla, David W. Evans, Erik Rodner

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T09:53:48Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) provide powerful means to leverage prior knowledge for predictive modeling when data is limited. In this work, we demonstrate how LLMs can use their compressed world knowledge to generate intrinsically interpretable machine learning models, i.e., decision trees, without any training data. We find that these zero-shot decision trees can surpass data-driven trees on some small-sized tabular datasets and that embeddings derived from these trees perform on par with data-driven tree-based embeddings on average. Our knowledge-driven decision tree induction and embedding approaches therefore serve as strong new baselines for data-driven machine learning methods in the low-data regime.

**Summary**: This paper presents the submission of Huawei Translation Services Center (HW-TSC) to machine translation tasks of the 20th China Conference on Machine Translation (CCMT 2024). We participate in the bilingual machine translation task and multi-domain machine translation task. For these two translation tasks, we use training strategies such as regularized dropout, bidirectional training, data diversification, forward translation, back translation, alternated training, curriculum learning, and transductive ensemble learning to train neural machine translation (NMT) models based on the deep Transformer-big architecture. Furthermore, to explore whether large language model (LLM) can help improve the translation quality of NMT systems, we use supervised fine-tuning to train llama2-13b as an Automatic post-editing (APE) model to improve the translation results of the NMT model on the multi-domain machine translation task. By using these plyometric strategies, our submission achieves a competitive result in the final evaluation.

### Hit the Sweet Spot! Span-Level Ensemble for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yangyifan Xu, Jianghao Chen, Junhong Wu, Jiajun Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T09:41:29Z

**Summary**: Ensembling various LLMs to unlock their complementary potential and leverage their individual strengths is highly valuable. Previous studies typically focus on two main paradigms: sample-level and token-level ensembles. Sample-level ensemble methods either select or blend fully generated outputs, which hinders dynamic correction and enhancement of outputs during the generation process. On the other hand, token-level ensemble methods enable real-time correction through fine-grained ensemble at each generation step. However, the information carried by an individual token is quite limited, leading to suboptimal decisions at each step. To address these issues, we propose SweetSpan, a span-level ensemble method that effectively balances the need for real-time adjustments and the information required for accurate ensemble decisions. Our approach involves two key steps: First, we have each candidate model independently generate candidate spans based on the shared prefix. Second, we calculate perplexity scores to facilitate mutual evaluation among the candidate models and achieve robust span selection by filtering out unfaithful scores. To comprehensively evaluate ensemble methods, we propose a new challenging setting (ensemble models with significant performance gaps) in addition to the standard setting (ensemble the best-performing models) to assess the performance of model ensembles in more realistic scenarios. Experimental results in both standard and challenging settings across various language generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and versatility of our approach compared with previous ensemble methods.

### Using Deep Autoregressive Models as Causal Inference Engines
**Authors**: Daniel Jiwoong Im, Kevin Zhang, Nakul Verma, Kyunghyun Cho

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T09:37:09Z

**Summary**: Existing causal inference (CI) models are limited to primarily handling low-dimensional confounders and singleton actions. We propose an autoregressive (AR) CI framework capable of handling complex confounders and sequential actions common in modern applications. We accomplish this by {\em sequencification}, transforming data from an underlying causal diagram into a sequence of tokens. This approach not only enables training with data generated from any DAG but also extends existing CI capabilities to accommodate estimating several statistical quantities using a {\em single} model. We can directly predict interventional probabilities, simplifying inference and enhancing outcome prediction accuracy. We demonstrate that an AR model adapted for CI is efficient and effective in various complex applications such as navigating mazes, playing chess endgames, and evaluating the impact of certain keywords on paper acceptance rates.

### Corpus-informed Retrieval Augmented Generation of Clarifying Questions
**Authors**: Antonios Minas Krasakis, Andrew Yates, Evangelos Kanoulas

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T09:20:42Z

**Summary**: This study aims to develop models that generate corpus informed clarifying questions for web search, in a way that ensures the questions align with the available information in the retrieval corpus. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Retrieval Augmented Language Models (RAG) in this process, emphasising their ability to (i) jointly model the user query and retrieval corpus to pinpoint the uncertainty and ask for clarifications end-to-end and (ii) model more evidence documents, which can be used towards increasing the breadth of the questions asked. However, we observe that in current datasets search intents are largely unsupported by the corpus, which is problematic both for training and evaluation. This causes question generation models to ``hallucinate'', ie. suggest intents that are not in the corpus, which can have detrimental effects in performance. To address this, we propose dataset augmentation methods that align the ground truth clarifications with the retrieval corpus. Additionally, we explore techniques to enhance the relevance of the evidence pool during inference, but find that identifying ground truth intents within the corpus remains challenging. Our analysis suggests that this challenge is partly due to the bias of current datasets towards clarification taxonomies and calls for data that can support generating corpus-informed clarifications.

### Governing the Commons: Code Ownership and Code-Clones in Large-Scale   Software Development
**Authors**: Anders Sundelin, Javier Gonzalez-Huerta, Richard Torkar, Krzysztof Wnuk

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T09:17:52Z

**Summary**: Context: In software development organizations employing weak or collective ownership, different teams are allowed and expected to autonomously perform changes in various components. This creates diversity both in the knowledge of, and in the responsibility for, individual components.   Objective: Our objective is to understand how and why different teams introduce technical debt in the form of code clones as they change different components.   Method: We collected data about change size and clone introductions made by ten teams in eight components which was part of a large industrial software system. We then designed a Multi-Level Generalized Linear Model (MLGLM), to illustrate the teams' differing behavior. Finally, we discussed the results with three development teams, plus line manager and the architect team, evaluating whether the model inferences aligned with what they expected. Responses were recorded and thematically coded.   Results: The results show that teams do behave differently in different components, and the feedback from the teams indicates that this method of illustrating team behavior can be useful as a complement to traditional summary statistics of ownership.   Conclusions: We find that our model-based approach produces useful visualizations of team introductions of code clones as they change different components. Practitioners stated that the visualizations gave them insights that were useful, and by comparing with an average team, inter-team comparisons can be avoided. Thus, this has the potential to be a useful feedback tool for teams in software development organizations that employ weak or collective ownership.

### Towards an active-learning approach to resource allocation for   population-based damage prognosis
**Authors**: George Tsialiamanis, Keith Worden, Nikolaos Dervilis, Aidan J Hughes

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T09:15:44Z

**Summary**: Damage prognosis is, arguably, one of the most difficult tasks of structural health monitoring (SHM). To address common problems of damage prognosis, a population-based SHM (PBSHM) approach is adopted in the current work. In this approach the prognosis problem is considered as an information-sharing problem where data from past structures are exploited to make more accurate inferences regarding currently-degrading structures. For a given population, there may exist restrictions on the resources available to conduct monitoring; thus, the current work studies the problem of allocating such resources within a population of degrading structures with a view to maximising the damage-prognosis accuracy. The challenges of the current framework are mainly associated with the inference of outliers on the level of damage evolution, given partial data from the damage-evolution phenomenon. The current approach considers an initial population of structures for which damage evolution is extensively observed. Subsequently, a second population of structures with evolving damage is considered for which two monitoring systems are available, a low-availability and high-fidelity (low-uncertainty) one, and a widely-available and low-fidelity (high-uncertainty) one. The task of the current work is to follow an active-learning approach to identify the structures to which the high-fidelity system should be assigned in order to enhance the predictive capabilities of the machine-learning model throughout the population.

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T09:13:19Z

**Summary**: Compressing Transformer inputs into compressd tokens allows running LLMs with improved speed and cost efficiency. Based on the compression method ICAE, we carefully examine the position identifier choices for compressed tokens and also propose a new compression loss. We demonstrate empirically that our proposed methods achieve significantly higher compression ratios (15x compared to 4x for ICAE), while being able to attain comparable reconstruction performance.

### Optimizing DNN Inference on Multi-Accelerator SoCs at Training-time
**Authors**: Matteo Risso, Alessio Burrello, Daniele Jahier Pagliari

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T09:10:44Z

**Summary**: The demand for executing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with low latency and minimal power consumption at the edge has led to the development of advanced heterogeneous Systems-on-Chips (SoCs) that incorporate multiple specialized computing units (CUs), such as accelerators. Offloading DNN computations to a specific CU from the available set often exposes accuracy vs efficiency trade-offs, due to differences in their supported operations (e.g., standard vs. depthwise convolution) or data representations (e.g., more/less aggressively quantized). A challenging yet unresolved issue is how to map a DNN onto these multi-CU systems to maximally exploit the parallelization possibilities while taking accuracy into account. To address this problem, we present ODiMO, a hardware-aware tool that efficiently explores fine-grain mapping of DNNs among various on-chip CUs, during the training phase. ODiMO strategically splits individual layers of the neural network and executes them in parallel on the multiple available CUs, aiming to balance the total inference energy consumption or latency with the resulting accuracy, impacted by the unique features of the different hardware units. We test our approach on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, targeting two open-source heterogeneous SoCs, i.e., DIANA and Darkside. We obtain a rich collection of Pareto-optimal networks in the accuracy vs. energy or latency space. We show that ODiMO reduces the latency of a DNN executed on the Darkside SoC by up to 8x at iso-accuracy, compared to manual heuristic mappings. When targeting energy, on the same SoC, ODiMO produced up to 50.8x more efficient mappings, with minimal accuracy drop (< 0.3%).

### Make Large Language Model a Better Ranker

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate robust capabilities across various fields, leading to a paradigm shift in LLM-enhanced Recommender System (RS). Research to date focuses on point-wise and pair-wise recommendation paradigms, which are inefficient for LLM-based recommenders due to high computational costs. However, existing list-wise approaches also fall short in ranking tasks due to misalignment between ranking objectives and next-token prediction. Moreover, these LLM-based methods struggle to effectively address the order relation among candidates, particularly given the scale of ratings. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the large language model framework with Aligned Listwise Ranking Objectives (ALRO). ALRO is designed to bridge the gap between the capabilities of LLMs and the nuanced requirements of ranking tasks. Specifically, ALRO employs explicit feedback in a listwise manner by introducing soft lambda loss, a customized adaptation of lambda loss designed for optimizing order relations. This mechanism provides more accurate optimization goals, enhancing the ranking process. Additionally, ALRO incorporates a permutation-sensitive learning mechanism that addresses position bias, a prevalent issue in generative models, without imposing additional computational burdens during inference. Our evaluative studies reveal that ALRO outperforms both existing embedding-based recommendation methods and LLM-based recommendation baselines.

### Efficient Noise Mitigation for Enhancing Inference Accuracy in DNNs on   Mixed-Signal Accelerators
**Authors**: Seyedarmin Azizi, Mohammad Erfan Sadeghi, Mehdi Kamal, Massoud Pedram

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:45:55Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we propose a framework to enhance the robustness of the neural models by mitigating the effects of process-induced and aging-related variations of analog computing components on the accuracy of the analog neural networks. We model these variations as the noise affecting the precision of the activations and introduce a denoising block inserted between selected layers of a pre-trained model. We demonstrate that training the denoising block significantly increases the model's robustness against various noise levels. To minimize the overhead associated with adding these blocks, we present an exploration algorithm to identify optimal insertion points for the denoising blocks. Additionally, we propose a specialized architecture to efficiently execute the denoising blocks, which can be integrated into mixed-signal accelerators. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using Deep Neural Network (DNN) models trained on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results show that on average, by accepting 2.03% parameter count overhead, the accuracy drop due to the variations reduces from 31.7% to 1.15%.

**Authors**: Xingrui Gu, Chuyi Jiang, Erte Wang, Zekun Wu, Qiang Cui, Leimin Tian, Lianlong Wu, Siyang Song, Chuang Yu

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:40:26Z

**Summary**: Constrained by the lack of model interpretability and a deep understanding of human movement in traditional movement recognition machine learning methods, this study introduces a novel representation learning method based on causal inference to better understand human joint dynamics and complex behaviors. We propose a two-stage framework that combines the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to identify and quantify causal relationships between joints. Our method effectively captures interactions and produces interpretable, robust representations. Experiments on the EmoPain dataset show that our causal GCN outperforms traditional GCNs in accuracy, F1 score, and recall, especially in detecting protective behaviors. The model is also highly invariant to data scale changes, enhancing its reliability in practical applications. Our approach advances human motion analysis and paves the way for more adaptive intelligent healthcare solutions.

### Commonsense Scene Graph-based Target Localization for Object Search
**Authors**: Wenqi Ge, Chao Tang, Hong Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:29:50Z

**Summary**: Object search is a fundamental skill for household robots, yet the core problem lies in the robot's ability to locate the target object accurately. The dynamic nature of household environments, characterized by the arbitrary placement of daily objects by users, makes it challenging to perform target localization. To efficiently locate the target object, the robot needs to be equipped with knowledge at both the object and room level. However, existing approaches rely solely on one type of knowledge, leading to unsatisfactory object localization performance and, consequently, inefficient object search processes. To address this problem, we propose a commonsense scene graph-based target localization, CSG-TL, to enhance target object search in the household environment. Given the pre-built map with stationary items, the robot models the room-level knowledge with object-level commonsense knowledge generated by a large language model (LLM) to a commonsense scene graph (CSG), supporting both types of knowledge for CSG-TL. To demonstrate the superiority of CSG-TL on target localization, extensive experiments are performed on the real-world ScanNet dataset and the AI2THOR simulator. Moreover, we have extended CSG-TL to an object search framework, CSG-OS, validated in both simulated and real-world environments. Code and videos are available at https://sites.google.com/view/csg-os.

### Think Twice Before Trusting: Self-Detection for Large Language Models   through Comprehensive Answer Reflection
**Authors**: Moxin Li, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng, Fengbin Zhu, Qifan Wang, Tat-Seng Chua

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:22:21Z

**Summary**: Self-detection for Large Language Models (LLMs) seeks to evaluate the trustworthiness of the LLM's output by leveraging its own capabilities, thereby alleviating the issue of output hallucination. However, existing self-detection approaches only retrospectively evaluate answers generated by LLM, typically leading to the over-trust in incorrectly generated answers. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel self-detection paradigm that considers the comprehensive answer space beyond LLM-generated answers. It thoroughly compares the trustworthiness of multiple candidate answers to mitigate the over-trust in LLM-generated incorrect answers. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce a two-step framework, which firstly instructs LLM to reflect and provide justifications for each candidate answer, and then aggregates the justifications for comprehensive target answer evaluation. This framework can be seamlessly integrated with existing approaches for superior self-detection. Extensive experiments on six datasets spanning three tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

### Align$^2$LLaVA: Cascaded Human and Large Language Model Preference   Alignment for Multi-modal Instruction Curation
**Authors**: Hongzhe Huang, Zhewen Yu, Jiang Liu, Li Cai, Dian Jiao, Wenqiao Zhang, Siliang Tang, Juncheng Li, Hao Jiang, Haoyuan Li, Yueting Zhuang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:20:59Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), such as LLaVA-series models, are driven by massive machine-generated instruction-following data tuning. Such automatic instruction collection pipelines, however, inadvertently introduce significant variability in data quality. This paper introduces a novel instruction curation algorithm, derived from two unique perspectives, human and LLM preference alignment, to compress this vast corpus of machine-generated multimodal instructions to a compact and high-quality form: (i) For human preference alignment, we have collected a machine-generated multimodal instruction dataset and established a comprehensive set of both subjective and objective criteria to guide the data quality assessment critically from human experts. By doing so, a reward model was trained on the annotated dataset to internalize the nuanced human understanding of instruction alignment. (ii) For LLM preference alignment, given the instruction selected by the reward model, we propose leveraging the inner LLM used in MLLM to align the writing style of visual instructions with that of the inner LLM itself, resulting in LLM-aligned instruction improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that we can maintain or even improve model performance by compressing synthetic multimodal instructions by up to 90%. Impressively, by aggressively reducing the total training sample size from 158k to 14k (9$\times$ smaller), our model consistently outperforms its full-size dataset counterpart across various MLLM benchmarks. Our project is available at https://github.com/DCDmllm/Align2LLaVA.

### Few-shot Pairwise Rank Prompting: An Effective Non-Parametric Retrieval   Model
**Authors**: Nilanjan Sinhababu, Andrew Parry, Debasis Ganguly, Debasis Samanta, Pabitra Mitra

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:19:29Z

**Summary**: A supervised ranking model, despite its advantage of being effective, usually involves complex processing - typically multiple stages of task-specific pre-training and fine-tuning. This has motivated researchers to explore simpler pipelines leveraging large language models (LLMs) that are capable of working in a zero-shot manner. However, since zero-shot inference does not make use of a training set of pairs of queries and their relevant documents, its performance is mostly worse than that of supervised models, which are trained on such example pairs. Motivated by the existing findings that training examples generally improve zero-shot performance, in our work, we explore if this also applies to ranking models. More specifically, given a query and a pair of documents, the preference prediction task is improved by augmenting examples of preferences for similar queries from a training set. Our proposed pairwise few-shot ranker demonstrates consistent improvements over the zero-shot baseline on both in-domain (TREC DL) and out-domain (BEIR subset) retrieval benchmarks. Our method also achieves a close performance to that of a supervised model without requiring any complex training pipeline.

### AlphaMath Almost Zero: Process Supervision without Process
**Authors**: Guoxin Chen, Minpeng Liao, Chengxi Li, Kai Fan

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:16:28Z

**Summary**: Although recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their performance on various tasks, they still face challenges with complex and symbolic multi-step reasoning, particularly in mathematical reasoning. To bolster the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, most existing efforts concentrate on seeking assistance from either domain experts or GPT-4 for high-quality process-supervised data, which is not only expensive but also labor-intensive. In our study, we propose an innovative framework, AlphaMath, that bypasses the need for process annotations (from humans or GPTs) by leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This framework focuses on unleashing the potential of a well-pretrained LLM to autonomously enhance its mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we integrate a value model with the LLM, automatically generating both process supervision and step-level evaluation signals in MCTS. Furthermore, we propose an efficient inference strategy, step-level beam search, where the value model is crafted to assist the policy model (i.e., LLM) in navigating more effective reasoning paths, rather than solely relying on prior probabilities. The experimental results on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets demonstrate that even without GPT-4 or human-annotated process supervision, our AlphaMath framework achieves comparable or superior results to previous state-of-the-art methods.

### Token Caching for Diffusion Transformer Acceleration
**Authors**: Jinming Lou, Wenyang Luo, Yufan Liu, Bing Li, Xinmiao Ding, Weiming Hu, Jiajiong Cao, Yuming Li, Chenguang Ma

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:05:34Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have gained substantial interest in diffusion generative modeling due to their outstanding performance. However, their high computational cost, arising from the quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanisms and multi-step inference, presents a significant bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose TokenCache, a novel post-training acceleration method that leverages the token-based multi-block architecture of transformers to reduce redundant computations among tokens across inference steps. TokenCache specifically addresses three critical questions in the context of diffusion transformers: (1) which tokens should be pruned to eliminate redundancy, (2) which blocks should be targeted for efficient pruning, and (3) at which time steps caching should be applied to balance speed and quality. In response to these challenges, TokenCache introduces a Cache Predictor that assigns importance scores to tokens, enabling selective pruning without compromising model performance. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive block selection strategy to focus on blocks with minimal impact on the network's output, along with a Two-Phase Round-Robin (TPRR) scheduling policy to optimize caching intervals throughout the denoising process. Experimental results across various models demonstrate that TokenCache achieves an effective trade-off between generation quality and inference speed for diffusion transformers. Our code will be publicly available.

**Authors**: Wenbo Guo, Chengwei Liu, Limin Wang, Jiahui Wu, Zhengzi Xu, Cheng Huang, Yong Fang, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:03:44Z

**Summary**: The rise of malicious packages in public registries poses a significant threat to software supply chain (SSC) security. Although academia and industry employ methods like software composition analysis (SCA) to address this issue, existing approaches often lack timely and comprehensive intelligence updates. This paper introduces PackageIntel, a novel platform that revolutionizes the collection, processing, and retrieval of malicious package intelligence. By utilizing exhaustive search techniques, snowball sampling from diverse sources, and large language models (LLMs) with specialized prompts, PackageIntel ensures enhanced coverage, timeliness, and accuracy. We have developed a comprehensive database containing 20,692 malicious NPM and PyPI packages sourced from 21 distinct intelligence repositories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that PackageIntel achieves a precision of 98.6% and an F1 score of 92.0 in intelligence extraction. Additionally, it detects threats on average 70% earlier than leading databases like Snyk and OSV, and operates cost-effectively at $0.094 per intelligence piece. The platform has successfully identified and reported over 1,000 malicious packages in downstream package manager mirror registries. This research provides a robust, efficient, and timely solution for identifying and mitigating threats within the software supply chain ecosystem.

### Step-level Value Preference Optimization for Mathematical Reasoning
**Authors**: Guoxin Chen, Minpeng Liao, Chengxi Li, Kai Fan

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:03:07Z

**Summary**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using an implicit reward model has proven to be an effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for fine-tuning preference aligned large language models (LLMs). However, the overall preference annotations of responses do not fully capture the fine-grained quality of model outputs in complex multi-step reasoning tasks, such as mathematical reasoning. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel algorithm called Step-level Value Preference Optimization (SVPO). Our approach employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to automatically annotate step-level preferences for multi-step reasoning. Furthermore, from the perspective of learning-to-rank, we train an explicit value model to replicate the behavior of the implicit reward model, complementing standard preference optimization. This value model enables the LLM to generate higher reward responses with minimal cost during inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/MARIO-Math-Reasoning/Super_MARIO}.

### Do We Need Domain-Specific Embedding Models? An Empirical Investigation
**Authors**: Yixuan Tang, Yi Yang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T07:46:06Z

**Summary**: Embedding models play a crucial role in representing and retrieving information across various NLP applications. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have further enhanced the performance of embedding models, which are trained on massive amounts of text covering almost every domain. These models are often benchmarked on general-purpose datasets like Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), where they demonstrate superior performance. However, a critical question arises: Is the development of domain-specific embedding models necessary when general-purpose models are trained on vast corpora that already include specialized domain texts? In this paper, we empirically investigate this question, choosing the finance domain as an example. We introduce the Finance Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (FinMTEB), a counterpart to MTEB that consists of financial domain-specific text datasets. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art embedding models on FinMTEB and observe a significant performance drop compared to their performance on MTEB. To account for the possibility that this drop is driven by FinMTEB's higher complexity, we propose four measures to quantify dataset complexity and control for this factor in our analysis. Our analysis provides compelling evidence that state-of-the-art embedding models struggle to capture domain-specific linguistic and semantic patterns, even when trained on large general-purpose corpora. This study sheds light on the necessity of developing domain-specific embedding models in the LLM era, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners.

**Summary**: We propose a new conformity score for conformal prediction, in a general multivariate regression framework. The underlying score function is based on a covariance analysis of the residuals and the input points. We give theoretical guarantees on the prediction set. This set consists in an explicit ellipsoid that has a reduced volume compared to a classic ball. Further, we also study the asymptotic properties of the ellipsoid. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of all our results on an in-depth numerical study.

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T07:08:10Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) underscores the pressing need for evaluation methods. Existing works primarily rely on external evaluators, focusing on training and prompting strategies. However, a crucial aspect, model-aware glass-box features, is overlooked. In this study, we explore the utility of glass-box features under the scenario of self-evaluation, namely applying an LLM to evaluate its own output. We investigate various glass-box feature groups and discovered that the softmax distribution serves as a reliable quality indicator for self-evaluation. Experimental results on public benchmarks validate the feasibility of self-evaluation of LLMs using glass-box features.

### HSTFL: A Heterogeneous Federated Learning Framework for Misaligned   Spatiotemporal Forecasting
**Authors**: Shuowei Cai, Hao Liu

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T06:51:11Z

**Summary**: Spatiotemporal forecasting has emerged as an indispensable building block of diverse smart city applications, such as intelligent transportation and smart energy management. Recent advancements have uncovered that the performance of spatiotemporal forecasting can be significantly improved by integrating knowledge in geo-distributed time series data from different domains, \eg enhancing real-estate appraisal with human mobility data; joint taxi and bike demand predictions. While effective, existing approaches assume a centralized data collection and exploitation environment, overlooking the privacy and commercial interest concerns associated with data owned by different parties. In this paper, we investigate multi-party collaborative spatiotemporal forecasting without direct access to multi-source private data. However, this task is challenging due to 1) cross-domain feature heterogeneity and 2) cross-client geographical heterogeneity, where standard horizontal or vertical federated learning is inapplicable. To this end, we propose a Heterogeneous SpatioTemporal Federated Learning (HSTFL) framework to enable multiple clients to collaboratively harness geo-distributed time series data from different domains while preserving privacy. Specifically, we first devise vertical federated spatiotemporal representation learning to locally preserve spatiotemporal dependencies among individual participants and generate effective representations for heterogeneous data. Then we propose a cross-client virtual node alignment block to incorporate cross-client spatiotemporal dependencies via a multi-level knowledge fusion scheme. Extensive privacy analysis and experimental evaluations demonstrate that HSTFL not only effectively resists inference attacks but also provides a significant improvement against various baselines.

### Underwater Image Enhancement with Physical-based Denoising Diffusion   Implicit Models
**Authors**: Nguyen Gia Bach, Chanh Minh Tran, Eiji Kamioka, Phan Xuan Tan

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T06:33:35Z

**Summary**: Underwater vision is crucial for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and enhancing degraded underwater images in real-time on a resource-constrained AUV is a key challenge due to factors like light absorption and scattering, or the sufficient model computational complexity to resolve such factors. Traditional image enhancement techniques lack adaptability to varying underwater conditions, while learning-based methods, particularly those using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), offer more robust solutions but face limitations such as inadequate enhancement, unstable training, or mode collapse. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art approach in image-to-image tasks but require intensive computational complexity to achieve the desired underwater image enhancement (UIE) using the recent UW-DDPM solution. To address these challenges, this paper introduces UW-DiffPhys, a novel physical-based and diffusion-based UIE approach. UW-DiffPhys combines light-computation physical-based UIE network components with a denoising U-Net to replace the computationally intensive distribution transformation U-Net in the existing UW-DDPM framework, reducing complexity while maintaining performance. Additionally, the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) is employed to accelerate the inference process through non-Markovian sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that UW-DiffPhys achieved a substantial reduction in computational complexity and inference time compared to UW-DDPM, with competitive performance in key metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, UCIQE, and an improvement in the overall underwater image quality UIQM metric.

### Overcoming Growth-Induced Forgetting in Task-Agnostic Continual Learning
**Authors**: Yuqing Zhao, Divya Saxena, Jiannong Cao, Xiaoyun Liu, Changlin Song

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T06:32:01Z

**Summary**: In continual learning (CL), model growth enhances adaptability over new data, improving knowledge retention for more tasks. However, improper model growth can lead to severe degradation of previously learned knowledge, an issue we name as growth-induced forgetting (GIFt), especially in task-agnostic CL using entire grown model for inference. Existing works, despite adopting model growth and random initialization for better adaptability, often fail to recognize the presence of GIFt caused by improper model growth. This oversight limits comprehensive control of forgetting and hinders full utilization of model growth. We are the first in CL to identify this issue and conduct an in-depth study on root cause of GIFt, where layer expansion stands out among model growth strategies, widening layers without affecting model functionality. Yet, direct adoption of layer expansion presents challenges. It lacks data-driven control and initialization of expanded parameters to balance adaptability and knowledge retention. This paper presents a novel SparseGrow approach to overcome the issue of GIFt while enhancing adaptability over new data. SparseGrow employs data-driven sparse layer expansion to control efficient parameter usage during growth, reducing GIFt from excessive growth and functionality changes. It also combines sparse growth with on-data initialization at training late-stage to create partially 0-valued expansions that fit learned distribution, enhancing retention and adaptability. To further minimize forgetting, freezing is applied by calculating the sparse mask, allowing data-driven preservation of important parameters. Through experiments across datasets with various settings, cases, and task numbers, we demonstrate the necessity of layer expansion and showcase the effectiveness of SparseGrow in overcoming GIFt, highlighting its adaptability and knowledge retention for incremental tasks.

### PromptKD: Distilling Student-Friendly Knowledge for Generative Language   Models via Prompt Tuning
**Authors**: Gyeongman Kim, Doohyuk Jang, Eunho Yang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T06:25:33Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about inference costs, increasing the need for research into model compression. While knowledge distillation (KD) is a prominent method for this, research on KD for generative language models like LLMs is relatively sparse, and the approach of distilling student-friendly knowledge, which has shown promising performance in KD for classification models, remains unexplored in generative language models. To explore this approach, we propose PromptKD, a simple yet effective method that utilizes prompt tuning - for the first time in KD - to enable generative language models to transfer student-friendly knowledge. Unlike previous works in classification that require fine-tuning the entire teacher model for extracting student-friendly knowledge, PromptKD achieves similar effects by adding a small number of prompt tokens and tuning only the prompt with student guidance. Extensive experiments on instruction-following datasets show that PromptKD achieves state-of-the-art performance while adding only 0.0007% of the teacher's parameters as prompts. Further analysis suggests that distilling student-friendly knowledge alleviates exposure bias effectively throughout the entire training process, leading to performance enhancements.

**Summary**: This paper introduces a new approach to using Large Language Models (LLMs) for classification tasks, which are typically handled using Machine Learning (ML) models. Unlike ML models that rely heavily on data cleaning and feature engineering, this method streamlines the process using LLMs. This paper proposes a new concept called "Language Model Learning (LML)" powered by a new method called "Data-Augmented Prediction (DAP)". The classification is performed by LLMs using a method similar to humans manually exploring and understanding the data and deciding classifications using data as a reference. Training data is summarized and evaluated to determine the features that lead to the classification of each label the most. In the process of DAP, the system uses the data summary to automatically create a query, which is used to retrieve relevant rows from the dataset. A classification is generated by the LLM using data summary and relevant rows, ensuring satisfactory accuracy even with complex data. Usage of data summary and similar data in DAP ensures context-aware decision-making. The proposed method uses the words "Act as an Explainable Machine Learning Model" in the prompt to enhance the interpretability of the predictions by allowing users to review the logic behind each prediction. In some test cases, the system scored an accuracy above 90%, proving the effectiveness of the system and its potential to outperform conventional ML models in various scenarios.

**Authors**: Jiaming Li, Lei Zhang, Yunshui Li, Ziqiang Liu, yuelin bai, Run Luo, Longze Chen, Min Yang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T17:44:58Z

**Summary**: The instruction-following ability of large language models enables humans to interact with AI agents in a natural way. However, when required to generate responses of a specific length, large language models often struggle to meet users' needs due to their inherent difficulty in accurately perceiving numerical constraints. To explore the ability of large language models to control the length of generated responses, we propose the Target Length Generation Task (TLG) and design two metrics, Precise Match (PM) and Flexible Match (FM) to evaluate the model's performance in adhering to specified response lengths. Furthermore, we introduce a novel, model-agnostic approach called Ruler, which employs Meta Length Tokens (MLTs) to enhance the instruction-following ability of large language models under length-constrained instructions. Specifically, Ruler equips LLMs with the ability to generate responses of a specified length based on length constraints within the instructions. Moreover, Ruler can automatically generate appropriate MLT when length constraints are not explicitly provided, demonstrating excellent versatility and generalization. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of Ruler across different LLMs on Target Length Generation Task, e.g., at All Level 27.97 average gain on PM, 29.57 average gain on FM. In addition, we conduct extensive ablation experiments to further substantiate the efficacy and generalization of Ruler. Our code and data is available at https://github.com/Geaming2002/Ruler.

**Authors**: Heqing Zou, Tianze Luo, Guiyang Xie, Victor, Zhang, Fengmao Lv, Guangcong Wang, Juanyang Chen, Zhuochen Wang, Hansheng Zhang, Huaijian Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T17:38:36Z

**Summary**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual encoders has recently shown promising performance in visual understanding tasks, leveraging their inherent capability to comprehend and generate human-like text for visual reasoning. Given the diverse nature of visual data, MultiModal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) exhibit variations in model designing and training for understanding images, short videos, and long videos. Our paper focuses on the substantial differences and unique challenges posed by long video understanding compared to static image and short video understanding. Unlike static images, short videos encompass sequential frames with both spatial and within-event temporal information, while long videos consist of multiple events with between-event and long-term temporal information. In this survey, we aim to trace and summarize the advancements of MM-LLMs from image understanding to long video understanding. We review the differences among various visual understanding tasks and highlight the challenges in long video understanding, including more fine-grained spatiotemporal details, dynamic events, and long-term dependencies. We then provide a detailed summary of the advancements in MM-LLMs in terms of model design and training methodologies for understanding long videos. Finally, we compare the performance of existing MM-LLMs on video understanding benchmarks of various lengths and discuss potential future directions for MM-LLMs in long video understanding.

**Authors**: Kristina Radivojevic, Christopher McAleer, Catrell Conley, Cormac Kennedy, Paul Brenner

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T17:28:25Z

**Summary**: The emergence of Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) holds significant promise for transforming social media platforms. However, this advancement also introduces substantial security and ethical concerns, as it may facilitate malicious actors in the exploitation of online users. We aim to evaluate the strength of security protocols on prominent social media platforms in mitigating the deployment of MFM bots. We examined the bot and content policies of eight popular social media platforms: X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, Facebook, Threads, TikTok, Mastodon, Reddit, and LinkedIn. Using Selenium, we developed a web bot to test bot deployment and AI-generated content policies and their enforcement mechanisms. Our findings indicate significant vulnerabilities within the current enforcement mechanisms of these platforms. Despite having explicit policies against bot activity, all platforms failed to detect and prevent the operation of our MFM bots. This finding reveals a critical gap in the security measures employed by these social media platforms, underscoring the potential for malicious actors to exploit these weaknesses to disseminate misinformation, commit fraud, or manipulate users.

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T17:17:15Z

**Summary**: Simulated patient systems play a crucial role in modern medical education and research, providing safe, integrative learning environments and enabling clinical decision-making simulations. Large Language Models (LLM) could advance simulated patient systems by replicating medical conditions and patient-doctor interactions with high fidelity and low cost. However, ensuring the effectiveness and trustworthiness of these systems remains a challenge, as they require a large, diverse, and precise patient knowledgebase, along with a robust and stable knowledge diffusion to users. Here, we developed AIPatient, an advanced simulated patient system with AIPatient Knowledge Graph (AIPatient KG) as the input and the Reasoning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Reasoning RAG) agentic workflow as the generation backbone. AIPatient KG samples data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database, producing a clinically diverse and relevant cohort of 1,495 patients with high knowledgebase validity (F1 0.89). Reasoning RAG leverages six LLM powered agents spanning tasks including retrieval, KG query generation, abstraction, checker, rewrite, and summarization. This agentic framework reaches an overall accuracy of 94.15% in EHR-based medical Question Answering (QA), outperforming benchmarks that use either no agent or only partial agent integration. Our system also presents high readability (median Flesch Reading Ease 77.23; median Flesch Kincaid Grade 5.6), robustness (ANOVA F-value 0.6126, p<0.1), and stability (ANOVA F-value 0.782, p<0.1). The promising performance of the AIPatient system highlights its potential to support a wide range of applications, including medical education, model evaluation, and system integration.

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T16:54:36Z

**Summary**: Understanding and modeling collective intelligence is essential for addressing complex social systems. Directed graphs called fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) offer a powerful tool for encoding causal mental models, but extracting high-integrity FCMs from text is challenging. This study presents an approach using large language models (LLMs) to automate FCM extraction. We introduce novel graph-based similarity measures and evaluate them by correlating their outputs with human judgments through the Elo rating system. Results show positive correlations with human evaluations, but even the best-performing measure exhibits limitations in capturing FCM nuances. Fine-tuning LLMs improves performance, but existing measures still fall short. This study highlights the need for soft similarity measures tailored to FCM extraction, advancing collective intelligence modeling with NLP.

### Trained Without My Consent: Detecting Code Inclusion In Language Models   Trained on Code
**Authors**: Vahid Majdinasab, Amin Nikanjam, Foutse Khomh

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T16:54:33Z

**Summary**: Code auditing ensures that the developed code adheres to standards, regulations, and copyright protection by verifying that it does not contain code from protected sources. The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) as coding assistants in the software development process poses new challenges for code auditing. The dataset for training these models is mainly collected from publicly available sources. This raises the issue of intellectual property infringement as developers' codes are already included in the dataset. Therefore, auditing code developed using LLMs is challenging, as it is difficult to reliably assert if an LLM used during development has been trained on specific copyrighted codes, given that we do not have access to the training datasets of these models. Given the non-disclosure of the training datasets, traditional approaches such as code clone detection are insufficient for asserting copyright infringement. To address this challenge, we propose a new approach, TraWiC; a model-agnostic and interpretable method based on membership inference for detecting code inclusion in an LLM's training dataset. We extract syntactic and semantic identifiers unique to each program to train a classifier for detecting code inclusion. In our experiments, we observe that TraWiC is capable of detecting 83.87% of codes that were used to train an LLM. In comparison, the prevalent clone detection tool NiCad is only capable of detecting 47.64%. In addition to its remarkable performance, TraWiC has low resource overhead in contrast to pair-wise clone detection that is conducted during the auditing process of tools like CodeWhisperer reference tracker, across thousands of code snippets.

### IDGen: Item Discrimination Induced Prompt Generation for LLM Evaluation
**Authors**: Fan Lin, Shuyi Xie, Yong Dai, Wenlin Yao, Tianjiao Lang, Zishan Xu, Zhichao Hu, Xiao Xiao, Yuhong Liu, Yu Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T16:29:12Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow increasingly adept at managing complex tasks, the evaluation set must keep pace with these advancements to ensure it remains sufficiently discriminative. Item Discrimination (ID) theory, which is widely used in educational assessment, measures the ability of individual test items to differentiate between high and low performers. Inspired by this theory, we propose an ID-induced prompt synthesis framework for evaluating LLMs to ensure the evaluation set can continually update and refine according to model abilities. Our data synthesis framework prioritizes both breadth and specificity. It can generate prompts that comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs while revealing meaningful performance differences between models, allowing for effective discrimination of their relative strengths and weaknesses across various tasks and domains. To produce high-quality data, we incorporate a self-correct mechanism into our generalization framework, and develop two models to predict prompt discrimination and difficulty score to facilitate our data synthesis framework, contributing valuable tools to evaluation data synthesis research. We apply our generated data to evaluate five SOTA models. Our data achieves an average score of 51.92, accompanied by a variance of 10.06. By contrast, previous works (i.e., SELF-INSTRUCT and WizardLM) obtain an average score exceeding 67, with a variance below 3.2. The results demonstrate that the data generated by our framework is more challenging and discriminative compared to previous works. We will release a dataset of over 3,000 carefully crafted prompts to facilitate evaluation research of LLMs.

### CESNET-TimeSeries24: Time Series Dataset for Network Traffic Anomaly   Detection and Forecasting
**Authors**: Josef Koumar, Karel Hynek, Tomáš Čejka, Pavel Šiška

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T16:10:11Z

**Summary**: Anomaly detection in network traffic is crucial for maintaining the security of computer networks and identifying malicious activities. One of the primary approaches to anomaly detection are methods based on forecasting. Nevertheless, extensive real-world network datasets for forecasting and anomaly detection techniques are missing, potentially causing performance overestimation of anomaly detection algorithms. This manuscript addresses this gap by introducing a dataset comprising time series data of network entities' behavior, collected from the CESNET3 network. The dataset was created from 40 weeks of network traffic of 275 thousand active IP addresses. The ISP origin of the presented data ensures a high level of variability among network entities, which forms a unique and authentic challenge for forecasting and anomaly detection models. It provides valuable insights into the practical deployment of forecast-based anomaly detection approaches.

### BeanCounter: A low-toxicity, large-scale, and open dataset of   business-oriented text
**Authors**: Siyan Wang, Bradford Levy

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T16:07:54Z

**Summary**: Many of the recent breakthroughs in language modeling have resulted from scaling effectively the same model architecture to larger datasets. In this vein, recent work has highlighted performance gains from increasing training dataset size and quality, suggesting a need for novel sources of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce BeanCounter, a public dataset consisting of more than 159B tokens extracted from businesses' disclosures. We show that this data is indeed novel: less than 0.1% of BeanCounter appears in Common Crawl-based datasets and it is an order of magnitude larger than datasets relying on similar sources. Given the data's provenance, we hypothesize that BeanCounter is comparatively more factual and less toxic than web-based datasets. Exploring this hypothesis, we find that many demographic identities occur with similar prevalence in BeanCounter but with significantly less toxic context relative to other datasets. To demonstrate the utility of BeanCounter, we evaluate and compare two LLMs continually pre-trained on BeanCounter with their base models. We find an 18-33% reduction in toxic generation and improved performance within the finance domain for the continually pretrained models. Collectively, our work suggests that BeanCounter is a novel source of low-toxicity and high-quality domain-specific data with sufficient scale to train multi-billion parameter LLMs.

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T16:06:11Z

**Summary**: While next-token prediction is considered a promising path towards artificial general intelligence, it has struggled to excel in multimodal tasks, which are still dominated by diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) and compositional approaches (e.g., CLIP combined with LLMs). In this paper, we introduce Emu3, a new suite of state-of-the-art multimodal models trained solely with next-token prediction. By tokenizing images, text, and videos into a discrete space, we train a single transformer from scratch on a mixture of multimodal sequences. Emu3 outperforms several well-established task-specific models in both generation and perception tasks, surpassing flagship models such as SDXL and LLaVA-1.6, while eliminating the need for diffusion or compositional architectures. Emu3 is also capable of generating high-fidelity video via predicting the next token in a video sequence. We simplify complex multimodal model designs by converging on a singular focus: tokens, unlocking great potential for scaling both during training and inference. Our results demonstrate that next-token prediction is a promising path towards building general multimodal intelligence beyond language. We open-source key techniques and models to support further research in this direction.

### LLM Detectors Still Fall Short of Real World: Case of LLM-Generated   Short News-Like Posts
**Authors**: Henrique Da Silva Gameiro, Andrei Kucharavy, Ljiljana Dolamic

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T16:04:40Z

**Summary**: With the emergence of widely available powerful LLMs, disinformation generated by large Language Models (LLMs) has become a major concern. Historically, LLM detectors have been touted as a solution, but their effectiveness in the real world is still to be proven. In this paper, we focus on an important setting in information operations -- short news-like posts generated by moderately sophisticated attackers.   We demonstrate that existing LLM detectors, whether zero-shot or purpose-trained, are not ready for real-world use in that setting. All tested zero-shot detectors perform inconsistently with prior benchmarks and are highly vulnerable to sampling temperature increase, a trivial attack absent from recent benchmarks. A purpose-trained detector generalizing across LLMs and unseen attacks can be developed, but it fails to generalize to new human-written texts.   We argue that the former indicates domain-specific benchmarking is needed, while the latter suggests a trade-off between the adversarial evasion resilience and overfitting to the reference human text, with both needing evaluation in benchmarks and currently absent. We believe this suggests a re-consideration of current LLM detector benchmarking approaches and provides a dynamically extensible benchmark to allow it (https://github.com/Reliable-Information-Lab-HEVS/benchmark_llm_texts_detection).

### Mitigating Selection Bias with Node Pruning and Auxiliary Options
**Authors**: Hyeong Kyu Choi, Weijie Xu, Chi Xue, Stephanie Eckman, Chandan K. Reddy

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T15:53:54Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) often show unwarranted preference for certain choice options when responding to multiple-choice questions, posing significant reliability concerns in LLM-automated systems. To mitigate this selection bias problem, previous solutions utilized debiasing methods to adjust the model's input and/or output. Our work, in contrast, investigates the model's internal representation of the selection bias. Specifically, we introduce a novel debiasing approach, Bias Node Pruning (BNP), which eliminates the linear layer parameters that contribute to the bias. Furthermore, we present Auxiliary Option Injection (AOI), a simple yet effective input modification technique for debiasing, which is compatible even with black-box LLMs. To provide a more systematic evaluation of selection bias, we review existing metrics and introduce Choice Kullback-Leibler Divergence (CKLD), which addresses the insensitivity of the commonly used metrics to label imbalance. Experiments show that our methods are robust and adaptable across various datasets when applied to three LLMs.

### RAMBO: Enhancing RAG-based Repository-Level Method Body Completion
**Authors**: Tuan-Dung Bui, Duc-Thieu Luu-Van, Thanh-Phat Nguyen, Thu-Trang Nguyen, Son Nguyen, Hieu Dinh Vo

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T15:19:23Z

**Summary**: Code completion is essential in software development, helping developers by predicting code snippets based on context. Among completion tasks, Method Body Completion (MBC) is particularly challenging as it involves generating complete method bodies based on their signatures and context. This task becomes significantly harder in large repositories, where method bodies must integrate repositoryspecific elements such as custom APIs, inter-module dependencies, and project-specific conventions. In this paper, we introduce RAMBO, a novel RAG-based approach for repository-level MBC. Instead of retrieving similar method bodies, RAMBO identifies essential repository-specific elements, such as classes, methods, and variables/fields, and their relevant usages. By incorporating these elements and their relevant usages into the code generation process, RAMBO ensures more accurate and contextually relevant method bodies. Our experimental results with leading code LLMs across 40 Java projects show that RAMBO significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art repository-level MBC approaches, with the improvements of up to 46% in BLEU, 57% in CodeBLEU, 36% in Compilation Rate, and up to 3X in Exact Match. Notably, RAMBO surpassed RepoCoder Oracle method by up to 12% in Exact Match, setting a new benchmark for repository-level MBC.

### Exploring Prosocial Irrationality for LLM Agents: A Social Cognition   View
**Authors**: Xuan Liu, Jie Zhang, Song Guo, Haoyang Shang, Chengxu Yang, Quanyan Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T15:10:06Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to face hallucination issues due to the data they trained on often containing human bias; whether this is reflected in the decision-making process of LLM Agents remains under-explored. As LLM Agents are increasingly employed in intricate social environments, a pressing and natural question emerges: Can we utilize LLM Agents' systematic hallucinations to mirror human cognitive biases, thus exhibiting irrational social intelligence? In this paper, we probe the irrational behavior among contemporary LLM Agents by melding practical social science experiments with theoretical insights. Specifically, We propose CogMir, an open-ended Multi-LLM Agents framework that utilizes hallucination properties to assess and enhance LLM Agents' social intelligence through cognitive biases. Experimental results on CogMir subsets show that LLM Agents and humans exhibit high consistency in irrational and prosocial decision-making under uncertain conditions, underscoring the prosociality of LLM Agents as social entities and highlighting the significance of hallucination properties. Additionally, the CogMir framework demonstrates its potential as a valuable platform for encouraging more research into the social intelligence of LLM Agents.

**Authors**: Hamed Babaei Giglou, Jennifer D'Souza, Sören Auer

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T15:04:39Z

**Summary**: In response to the growing complexity and volume of scientific literature, this paper introduces the LLMs4Synthesis framework, designed to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating high-quality scientific syntheses. This framework addresses the need for rapid, coherent, and contextually rich integration of scientific insights, leveraging both open-source and proprietary LLMs. It also examines the effectiveness of LLMs in evaluating the integrity and reliability of these syntheses, alleviating inadequacies in current quantitative metrics. Our study contributes to this field by developing a novel methodology for processing scientific papers, defining new synthesis types, and establishing nine detailed quality criteria for evaluating syntheses. The integration of LLMs with reinforcement learning and AI feedback is proposed to optimize synthesis quality, ensuring alignment with established criteria. The LLMs4Synthesis framework and its components are made available, promising to enhance both the generation and evaluation processes in scientific research synthesis.

### MiniVLN: Efficient Vision-and-Language Navigation by Progressive   Knowledge Distillation
**Authors**: Junyou Zhu, Yanyuan Qiao, Siqi Zhang, Xingjian He, Qi Wu, Jing Liu

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T14:54:54Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) has advanced rapidly, yet the increasing size of models conflicts with the limited computational capabilities of Embodied AI platforms. To address this challenge, we aim to achieve both high model performance and practical deployability. Specifically, we focus on Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), a core task in Embodied AI. This paper introduces a two-stage knowledge distillation framework, producing a student model, MiniVLN, and showcasing the significant potential of distillation techniques in developing lightweight models. The proposed method aims to capture fine-grained knowledge during the pretraining phase and navigation-specific knowledge during the fine-tuning phase. Our findings indicate that the two-stage distillation approach is more effective in narrowing the performance gap between the teacher model and the student model compared to single-stage distillation. On the public R2R and REVERIE benchmarks, MiniVLN achieves performance on par with the teacher model while having only about 12% of the teacher model's parameter count.

**Authors**: Tyreal Yizhou Qian, Bo Yu, Weizhe Li, Chenglong Xu

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T14:53:04Z

**Summary**: This study examined the public opinions of esports at the 2023 Asian Games and value co-creation during the event using an LLM-enhanced BERTopic modeling analysis. We identified five major themes representing public perceptions, as well as how major stakeholders co-created value within and beyond the esports ecosystem. Key findings highlighted the strategic use of social media marketing to influence public opinion and promote esports events and brands, emphasizing the importance of event logistics and infrastructure. Additionally, the study revealed the co-creation value contributed by stakeholders outside the traditional esports ecosystem, particularly in promoting national representation and performance. Our findings supported the ongoing efforts to legitimize esports as a sport, noting that mainstream recognition remains a challenge. The inclusion of esports as a medal event showcased broader acceptance and helped mitigate negative public perceptions. Moreover, contributions from non-traditional stakeholders underscored the value of cross-subcultural collaborations in esports.

### Improving Diversity of Commonsense Generation by Large Language Models   via In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Tianhui Zhang, Bei Peng, Danushka Bollegala

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T14:50:59Z

**Summary**: Generative Commonsense Reasoning (GCR) requires a model to reason about a situation using commonsense knowledge, while generating coherent sentences. Although the quality of the generated sentences is crucial, the diversity of the generation is equally important because it reflects the model's ability to use a range of commonsense knowledge facts. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown proficiency in enhancing the generation quality across various tasks through in-context learning (ICL) using given examples without the need for any fine-tuning. However, the diversity aspect in LLM outputs has not been systematically studied before. To address this, we propose a simple method that diversifies the LLM generations, while preserving their quality. Experimental results on three benchmark GCR datasets show that our method achieves an ideal balance between the quality and diversity. Moreover, the sentences generated by our proposed method can be used as training data to improve diversity in existing commonsense generators.

### Open-Nav: Exploring Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in   Continuous Environment with Open-Source LLMs
**Authors**: Yanyuan Qiao, Wenqi Lyu, Hui Wang, Zixu Wang, Zerui Li, Yuan Zhang, Mingkui Tan, Qi Wu

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T14:47:18Z

**Summary**: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks require an agent to follow textual instructions to navigate through 3D environments. Traditional approaches use supervised learning methods, relying heavily on domain-specific datasets to train VLN models. Recent methods try to utilize closed-source large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to solve VLN tasks in zero-shot manners, but face challenges related to expensive token costs and potential data breaches in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce Open-Nav, a novel study that explores open-source LLMs for zero-shot VLN in the continuous environment. Open-Nav employs a spatial-temporal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning approach to break down tasks into instruction comprehension, progress estimation, and decision-making. It enhances scene perceptions with fine-grained object and spatial knowledge to improve LLM's reasoning in navigation. Our extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that Open-Nav achieves competitive performance compared to using closed-source LLMs.

**Authors**: Raphael Hagmanns, Peter Mortimer, Miguel Granero, Thorsten Luettel, Janko Petereit

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T14:36:20Z

**Summary**: The successful deployment of deep learning-based techniques for autonomous systems is highly dependent on the data availability for the respective system in its deployment environment. Especially for unstructured outdoor environments, very few datasets exist for even fewer robotic platforms and scenarios. In an earlier work, we presented the German Outdoor and Offroad Dataset (GOOSE) framework along with 10000 multimodal frames from an offroad vehicle to enhance the perception capabilities in unstructured environments. In this work, we address the generalizability of the GOOSE framework. To accomplish this, we open-source the GOOSE-Ex dataset, which contains additional 5000 labeled multimodal frames from various completely different environments, recorded on a robotic excavator and a quadruped platform. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the semantic segmentation performance on different platforms and sensor modalities in unseen environments. In addition, we demonstrate how the combined datasets can be utilized for different downstream applications or competitions such as offroad navigation, object manipulation or scene completion. The dataset, its platform documentation and pre-trained state-of-the-art models for offroad perception will be made available on https://goose-dataset.de/.   \

**Summary**: Honesty is a fundamental principle for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, requiring these models to recognize what they know and don't know and be able to faithfully express their knowledge. Despite promising, current LLMs still exhibit significant dishonest behaviors, such as confidently presenting wrong answers or failing to express what they know. In addition, research on the honesty of LLMs also faces challenges, including varying definitions of honesty, difficulties in distinguishing between known and unknown knowledge, and a lack of comprehensive understanding of related research. To address these issues, we provide a survey on the honesty of LLMs, covering its clarification, evaluation approaches, and strategies for improvement. Moreover, we offer insights for future research, aiming to inspire further exploration in this important area.

### Lego: Learning to Disentangle and Invert Personalized Concepts Beyond   Object Appearance in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Saman Motamed, Danda Pani Paudel, Luc Van Gool

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T14:04:35Z

**Summary**: Text-to-Image (T2I) models excel at synthesizing concepts such as nouns, appearances, and styles. To enable customized content creation based on a few example images of a concept, methods such as Textual Inversion and DreamBooth invert the desired concept and enable synthesizing it in new scenes. However, inverting personalized concepts that go beyond object appearance and style (adjectives and verbs) through natural language remains a challenge. Two key characteristics of these concepts contribute to the limitations of current inversion methods. 1) Adjectives and verbs are entangled with nouns (subject) and can hinder appearance-based inversion methods, where the subject appearance leaks into the concept embedding, and 2) describing such concepts often extends beyond single word embeddings.   In this study, we introduce Lego, a textual inversion method designed to invert subject-entangled concepts from a few example images. Lego disentangles concepts from their associated subjects using a simple yet effective Subject Separation step and employs a Context Loss that guides the inversion of single/multi-embedding concepts. In a thorough user study, Lego-generated concepts were preferred over 70% of the time when compared to the baseline in terms of authentically generating concepts according to a reference. Additionally, visual question answering using an LLM suggested Lego-generated concepts are better aligned with the text description of the concept.

### Charting the Future: Using Chart Question-Answering for Scalable   Evaluation of LLM-Driven Data Visualizations
**Authors**: James Ford, Xingmeng Zhao, Dan Schumacher, Anthony Rios

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T14:02:48Z

**Summary**: We propose a novel framework that leverages Visual Question Answering (VQA) models to automate the evaluation of LLM-generated data visualizations. Traditional evaluation methods often rely on human judgment, which is costly and unscalable, or focus solely on data accuracy, neglecting the effectiveness of visual communication. By employing VQA models, we assess data representation quality and the general communicative clarity of charts. Experiments were conducted using two leading VQA benchmark datasets, ChartQA and PlotQA, with visualizations generated by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and Meta's Llama 3.1 70B-Instruct models. Our results indicate that LLM-generated charts do not match the accuracy of the original non-LLM-generated charts based on VQA performance measures. Moreover, while our results demonstrate that few-shot prompting significantly boosts the accuracy of chart generation, considerable progress remains to be made before LLMs can fully match the precision of human-generated graphs. This underscores the importance of our work, which expedites the research process by enabling rapid iteration without the need for human annotation, thus accelerating advancements in this field.

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T13:20:18Z

**Summary**: As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) expand, it becomes increasingly important to evaluate them beyond basic knowledge assessment, focusing on higher-level language understanding. This study introduces MultiPragEval, the first multilingual pragmatic evaluation of LLMs, designed for English, German, Korean, and Chinese. Comprising 1200 question units categorized according to Grice's Cooperative Principle and its four conversational maxims, MultiPragEval enables an in-depth assessment of LLMs' contextual awareness and their ability to infer implied meanings. Our findings demonstrate that Claude3-Opus significantly outperforms other models in all tested languages, establishing a state-of-the-art in the field. Among open-source models, Solar-10.7B and Qwen1.5-14B emerge as strong competitors. By analyzing pragmatic inference, we provide valuable insights into the capabilities essential for advanced language comprehension in AI systems.

### The Impact of Unstated Norms in Bias Analysis of Language Models
**Authors**: Farnaz Kohankhaki, D. B. Emerson, Jacob-Junqi Tian, Laleh Seyyed-Kalantari, Faiza Khan Khattak

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T13:12:23Z

**Summary**: Bias in large language models (LLMs) has many forms, from overt discrimination to implicit stereotypes. Counterfactual bias evaluation is a widely used approach to quantifying bias and often relies on template-based probes that explicitly state group membership. It measures whether the outcome of a task, performed by an LLM, is invariant to a change of group membership. In this work, we find that template-based probes can lead to unrealistic bias measurements. For example, LLMs appear to mistakenly cast text associated with White race as negative at higher rates than other groups. We hypothesize that this arises artificially via a mismatch between commonly unstated norms, in the form of markedness, in the pretraining text of LLMs (e.g., Black president vs. president) and templates used for bias measurement (e.g., Black president vs. White president). The findings highlight the potential misleading impact of varying group membership through explicit mention in counterfactual bias quantification.

### Read Over the Lines: Attacking LLMs and Toxicity Detection Systems with   ASCII Art to Mask Profanity
**Authors**: Sergey Berezin, Reza Farahbakhsh, Noel Crespi

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:54:13Z

**Summary**: We introduce a novel family of adversarial attacks that exploit the inability of language models to interpret ASCII art. To evaluate these attacks, we propose the ToxASCII benchmark and develop two custom ASCII art fonts: one leveraging special tokens and another using text-filled letter shapes. Our attacks achieve a perfect 1.0 Attack Success Rate across ten models, including OpenAI's o1-preview and LLaMA 3.1.   Warning: this paper contains examples of toxic language used for research purposes.

### Reward-Robust RLHF in LLMs
**Authors**: Yuzi Yan, Xingzhou Lou, Jialian Li, Yiping Zhang, Jian Xie, Chao Yu, Yu Wang, Dong Yan, Yuan Shen

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:36:58Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to progress toward more advanced forms of intelligence, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly seen as a key pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the reliance on reward-model-based (RM-based) alignment methods introduces significant challenges due to the inherent instability and imperfections of Reward Models (RMs), which can lead to critical issues such as reward hacking and misalignment with human intentions. In this paper, we introduce a reward-robust RLHF framework aimed at addressing these fundamental challenges, paving the way for more reliable and resilient learning in LLMs. Our approach introduces a novel optimization objective that carefully balances performance and robustness by incorporating Bayesian Reward Model Ensembles (BRME) to model the uncertainty set of reward functions. This allows the framework to integrate both nominal performance and minimum reward signals, ensuring more stable learning even with imperfect RMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms baselines across diverse benchmarks, showing improved accuracy and long-term stability. We also provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that reward-robust RLHF approaches the stability of constant reward settings, which proves to be acceptable even in a stochastic-case analysis. Together, these contributions highlight the framework potential to enhance both the performance and stability of LLM alignment.

### TinyVLA: Towards Fast, Data-Efficient Vision-Language-Action Models for   Robotic Manipulation
**Authors**: Junjie Wen, Yichen Zhu, Jinming Li, Minjie Zhu, Kun Wu, Zhiyuan Xu, Ning Liu, Ran Cheng, Chaomin Shen, Yaxin Peng, Feifei Feng, Jian Tang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:23:06Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable potential in visuomotor control and instruction comprehension through end-to-end learning processes. However, current VLA models face significant challenges: they are slow during inference and require extensive pre-training on large amounts of robotic data, making real-world deployment difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new family of compact vision-language-action models, called TinyVLA, which offers two key advantages over existing VLA models: (1) faster inference speeds, and (2) improved data efficiency, eliminating the need for pre-training stage. Our framework incorporates two essential components to build TinyVLA: (1) initializing the policy backbone with robust, high-speed multimodal models, and (2) integrating a diffusion policy decoder during fine-tuning to enable precise robot actions. We conducted extensive evaluations of TinyVLA in both simulation and on real robots, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model, OpenVLA, in terms of speed and data efficiency, while delivering comparable or superior performance. Additionally, TinyVLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities across various dimensions, including language instructions, novel objects, unseen positions, changes in object appearance, background variations, and environmental shifts, often matching or exceeding the performance of OpenVLA. We believe that \methodname offers an interesting perspective on utilizing pre-trained multimodal models for policy learning. Our project is at https://tiny-vla.github.io.

### QPaug: Question and Passage Augmentation for Open-Domain Question   Answering of LLMs
**Authors**: Minsang Kim, Cheoneum Park, Seungjun Baek

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:18:34Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has received much attention for Open-domain question-answering (ODQA) tasks as a means to compensate for the parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). While previous approaches focused on processing retrieved passages to remove irrelevant context, they still rely heavily on the quality of retrieved passages which can degrade if the question is ambiguous or complex. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient method called question and passage augmentation (QPaug) via LLMs for open-domain QA. QPaug first decomposes the original questions into multiple-step sub-questions. By augmenting the original question with detailed sub-questions and planning, we are able to make the query more specific on what needs to be retrieved, improving the retrieval performance. In addition, to compensate for the case where the retrieved passages contain distracting information or divided opinions, we augment the retrieved passages with self-generated passages by LLMs to guide the answer extraction. Experimental results show that QPaug outperforms the previous state-of-the-art and achieves significant performance gain over existing RAG methods. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/kmswin1/QPaug}.

### Plurals: A System for Guiding LLMs Via Simulated Social Ensembles
**Authors**: Joshua Ashkinaze, Emily Fry, Narendra Edara, Eric Gilbert, Ceren Budak

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:12:44Z

**Summary**: Recent debates raised concerns that language models may favor certain viewpoints. But what if the solution is not to aim for a 'view from nowhere' but rather to leverage different viewpoints? We introduce Plurals, a system and Python library for pluralistic AI deliberation. Plurals consists of Agents (LLMs, optionally with personas) which deliberate within customizable Structures, with Moderators overseeing deliberation. Plurals is a generator of simulated social ensembles. Plurals integrates with government datasets to create nationally representative personas, includes deliberation templates inspired by democratic deliberation theory, and allows users to customize both information-sharing structures and deliberation behavior within Structures. Six case studies demonstrate fidelity to theoretical constructs and efficacy. Three randomized experiments show simulated focus groups produced output resonant with an online sample of the relevant audiences (chosen over zero-shot generation in 75% of trials). Plurals is both a paradigm and a concrete system for pluralistic AI. The Plurals library is available at https://github.com/josh-ashkinaze/plurals and will be continually updated.

### Schrodinger's Memory: Large Language Models
**Authors**: Wei Wang, Qing Li

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:12:19Z

**Summary**: Memory is the foundation of all human activities; without memory, it would be nearly impossible for people to perform any task in daily life. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), their language capabilities are becoming increasingly comparable to those of humans. But do LLMs have memory? Based on current performance, LLMs do appear to exhibit memory. So, what is the underlying mechanism of this memory? Previous research has lacked a deep exploration of LLMs' memory capabilities and the underlying theory. In this paper, we use Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT) to explain the memory mechanism in LLMs. We also conduct experiments to verify the memory capabilities of various LLMs, proposing a new method to assess their abilities based on these memory ability. We argue that LLM memory operates like Schr\"odinger's memory, meaning that it only becomes observable when a specific memory is queried. We can only determine if the model retains a memory based on its output in response to the query; otherwise, it remains indeterminate. Finally, we expand on this concept by comparing the memory capabilities of the human brain and LLMs, highlighting the similarities and differences in their operational mechanisms.

### Beyond Single-Audio: Advancing Multi-Audio Processing in Audio Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Yiming Chen, Xianghu Yue, Xiaoxue Gao, Chen Zhang, Luis Fernando D'Haro, Robby T. Tan, Haizhou Li

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:06:53Z

**Summary**: Various audio-LLMs (ALLMs) have been explored recently for tackling different audio tasks simultaneously using a single, unified model. While existing evaluations of ALLMs primarily focus on single-audio tasks, real-world applications often involve processing multiple audio streams simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose the first multi-audio evaluation (MAE) benchmark that consists of 20 datasets from 11 multi-audio tasks encompassing both speech and sound scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on MAE demonstrate that the existing ALLMs, while being powerful in comprehending primary audio elements in individual audio inputs, struggling to handle multi-audio scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel multi-audio-LLM (MALLM) to capture audio context among multiple similar audios using discriminative learning on our proposed synthetic data. The results demonstrate that the proposed MALLM outperforms all baselines and achieves high data efficiency using synthetic data without requiring human annotations. The proposed MALLM opens the door for ALLMs towards multi-audio processing era and brings us closer to replicating human auditory capabilities in machines.

### "Why" Has the Least Side Effect on Model Editing
**Authors**: Tsung-Hsuan Pan, Chung-Chi Chen, Hen-Hsen Huang, Hsin-Hsi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:05:12Z

**Summary**: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is an expensive endeavor, particularly as world knowledge continually evolves. To maintain relevance and accuracy of LLMs, model editing has emerged as a pivotal research area. While these methods hold promise, they can also produce unintended side effects. Their underlying factors and causes remain largely unexplored. This paper delves into a critical factor-question type-by categorizing model editing questions. Our findings reveal that the extent of performance degradation varies significantly across different question types, providing new insights for experimental design in knowledge editing. Furthermore, we investigate whether insights from smaller models can be extrapolated to larger models. Our results indicate discrepancies in findings between models of different sizes, suggesting that insights from smaller models may not necessarily apply to larger models. Additionally, we examine the impact of batch size on side effects, discovering that increasing the batch size can mitigate performance drops.

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T12:05:05Z

**Summary**: Question answering (QA) has been a long-standing focus in the NLP field, predominantly addressing reading comprehension and common sense QA. However, scenarios involving the preparation of answers to probable questions during professional oral presentations remain underexplored. In this paper, we pioneer the examination of this crucial yet overlooked topic by utilizing real-world QA conversation transcripts between company managers and professional analysts. We explore the proposed task using three causal knowledge graphs (KGs) and three large language models (LLMs). This work provides foundational insights into the application of LLMs in professional QA scenarios, highlighting the importance of causal KGs and perspective-taking in generating effective responses.

### Large Language Models are Limited in Out-of-Context Knowledge Reasoning
**Authors**: Peng Hu, Changjiang Gao, Ruiqi Gao, Jiajun Chen, Shujian Huang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T11:46:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and strong capabilities in performing in-context reasoning. However, previous work challenges their out-of-context reasoning ability, i.e., the ability to infer information from their training data, instead of from the context or prompt. This paper focuses on a significant aspect of out-of-context reasoning: Out-of-Context Knowledge Reasoning (OCKR), which is to combine multiple knowledge to infer new knowledge. We designed a synthetic dataset with seven representative OCKR tasks to systematically assess the OCKR capabilities of LLMs. Using this dataset, we evaluated several LLMs and discovered that their proficiency in this aspect is limited, regardless of whether the knowledge is trained in a separate or adjacent training settings. Moreover, training the model to reason with reasoning examples does not result in significant improvement, while training the model to perform explicit knowledge retrieval helps for retrieving attribute knowledge but not the relation knowledge, indicating that the model's limited OCKR capabilities are due to difficulties in knowledge retrieval. Furthermore, we treat cross-lingual knowledge transfer as a distinct form of OCKR, and evaluate this ability. Our results show that the evaluated model also exhibits limited ability in transferring knowledge across languages.

### Fusing Dynamics Equation: A Social Opinions Prediction Algorithm with   LLM-based Agents
**Authors**: Junchi Yao, Hongjie Zhang, Jie Ou, Dingyi Zuo, Zheng Yang, Zhicheng Dong

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T11:46:33Z

**Summary**: In the context where social media is increasingly becoming a significant platform for social movements and the formation of public opinion, accurately simulating and predicting the dynamics of user opinions is of great importance for understanding social phenomena, policy making, and guiding public opinion. However, existing simulation methods face challenges in capturing the complexity and dynamics of user behavior. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes an innovative simulation method for the dynamics of social media user opinions, the FDE-LLM algorithm, which incorporates opinion dynamics and epidemic model. This effectively constrains the actions and opinion evolution process of large language models (LLM), making them more aligned with the real cyber world. In particular, the FDE-LLM categorizes users into opinion leaders and followers. Opinion leaders are based on LLM role-playing and are constrained by the CA model, while opinion followers are integrated into a dynamic system that combines the CA model with the SIR model. This innovative design significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of the simulation. Experiments were conducted on four real Weibo datasets and validated using the open-source model ChatGLM. The results show that, compared to traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) opinion dynamics algorithms and LLM-based opinion diffusion algorithms, our FDE-LLM algorithm demonstrates higher accuracy and interpretability.

### Not the Silver Bullet: LLM-enhanced Programming Error Messages are   Ineffective in Practice
**Authors**: Eddie Antonio Santos, Brett A. Becker

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T11:45:56Z

**Summary**: The sudden emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has had a disruptive impact throughout the computing education community. LLMs have been shown to excel at producing correct code to CS1 and CS2 problems, and can even act as friendly assistants to students learning how to code. Recent work shows that LLMs demonstrate unequivocally superior results in being able to explain and resolve compiler error messages -- for decades, one of the most frustrating parts of learning how to code. However, LLM-generated error message explanations have only been assessed by expert programmers in artificial conditions. This work sought to understand how novice programmers resolve programming error messages (PEMs) in a more realistic scenario. We ran a within-subjects study with $n$ = 106 participants in which students were tasked to fix six buggy C programs. For each program, participants were randomly assigned to fix the problem using either a stock compiler error message, an expert-handwritten error message, or an error message explanation generated by GPT-4. Despite promising evidence on synthetic benchmarks, we found that GPT-4 generated error messages outperformed conventional compiler error messages in only 1 of the 6 tasks, measured by students' time-to-fix each problem. Handwritten explanations still outperform LLM and conventional error messages, both on objective and subjective measures.

### CausalBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Causal Learning Capability of   LLMs
**Authors**: Yu Zhou, Xingyu Wu, Beicheng Huang, Jibin Wu, Liang Feng, Kay Chen Tan

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T11:45:09Z

**Summary**: The ability to understand causality significantly impacts the competence of large language models (LLMs) in output explanation and counterfactual reasoning, as causality reveals the underlying data distribution. However, the lack of a comprehensive benchmark currently limits the evaluation of LLMs' causal learning capabilities. To fill this gap, this paper develops CausalBench based on data from the causal research community, enabling comparative evaluations of LLMs against traditional causal learning algorithms. To provide a comprehensive investigation, we offer three tasks of varying difficulties, including correlation, causal skeleton, and causality identification. Evaluations of 19 leading LLMs reveal that, while closed-source LLMs show potential for simple causal relationships, they significantly lag behind traditional algorithms on larger-scale networks ($>50$ nodes). Specifically, LLMs struggle with collider structures but excel at chain structures, especially at long-chain causality analogous to Chains-of-Thought techniques. This supports the current prompt approaches while suggesting directions to enhance LLMs' causal reasoning capability. Furthermore, CausalBench incorporates background knowledge and training data into prompts to thoroughly unlock LLMs' text-comprehension ability during evaluation, whose findings indicate that, LLM understand causality through semantic associations with distinct entities, rather than directly from contextual information or numerical distributions.

### MATHWELL: Generating Educational Math Word Problems Using Teacher   Annotations
**Authors**: Bryan R Christ, Jonathan Kropko, Thomas Hartvigsen

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T11:28:50Z

**Summary**: Math word problems are critical K-8 educational tools, but writing them is time consuming and requires extensive expertise. To be educational, problems must be solvable, have accurate answers, and, most importantly, be educationally appropriate. We propose that language models have potential to support K-8 math education by automatically generating word problems. However, evaluating educational appropriateness is hard to quantify. We fill this gap by having teachers evaluate problems generated by LLMs, who find existing models and data often fail to be educationally appropriate. We then explore automatically generating educational word problems, ultimately using our expert annotations to finetune a 70B language model. Our model, MATHWELL, is the first K-8 word problem generator targeted at educational appropriateness. Further expert studies find MATHWELL generates problems far more solvable, accurate, and appropriate than public models. MATHWELL also matches GPT-4's problem quality while attaining more appropriate reading levels for K-8 students and avoiding generating harmful questions.

### Model-based Preference Optimization in Abstractive Summarization without   Human Feedback
**Authors**: Jaepill Choi, Kyubyung Chae, Jiwoo Song, Yohan Jo, Taesup Kim

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T10:35:45Z

**Summary**: In abstractive summarization, the challenge of producing concise and accurate summaries arises from the vast amount of information contained in the source document. Consequently, although Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, they often introduce inaccuracies by hallucinating content not found in the original source. While supervised fine-tuning methods that maximize likelihood contribute to this issue, they do not consistently enhance the faithfulness of the summaries. Preference-based optimization methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), can further refine the model to align with human preferences. However, these methods still heavily depend on costly human feedback. In this work, we introduce a novel and straightforward approach called Model-based Preference Optimization (MPO) to fine-tune LLMs for improved summarization abilities without any human feedback. By leveraging the model's inherent summarization capabilities, we create a preference dataset that is fully generated by the model using different decoding strategies. Our experiments on standard summarization datasets and various metrics demonstrate that our proposed MPO significantly enhances the quality of generated summaries without relying on human feedback.

### Trio-ViT: Post-Training Quantization and Acceleration for Softmax-Free   Efficient Vision Transformer
**Authors**: Huihong Shi, Haikuo Shao, Wendong Mao, Zhongfeng Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T10:19:55Z

**Summary**: Motivated by the huge success of Transformers in the field of natural language processing (NLP), Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been rapidly developed and achieved remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks. However, their huge model sizes and intensive computations hinder ViTs' deployment on embedded devices, calling for effective model compression methods, such as quantization. Unfortunately, due to the existence of hardware-unfriendly and quantization-sensitive non-linear operations, particularly {Softmax}, it is non-trivial to completely quantize all operations in ViTs, yielding either significant accuracy drops or non-negligible hardware costs. In response to challenges associated with \textit{standard ViTs}, we focus our attention towards the quantization and acceleration for \textit{efficient ViTs}, which not only eliminate the troublesome Softmax but also integrate linear attention with low computational complexity, and propose Trio-ViT accordingly. Specifically, at the algorithm level, we develop a {tailored post-training quantization engine} taking the unique activation distributions of Softmax-free efficient ViTs into full consideration, aiming to boost quantization accuracy. Furthermore, at the hardware level, we build an accelerator dedicated to the specific Convolution-Transformer hybrid architecture of efficient ViTs, thereby enhancing hardware efficiency. Extensive experimental results consistently prove the effectiveness of our Trio-ViT framework. {Particularly, we can gain up to $\uparrow$$\mathbf{3.6}\times$, $\uparrow$$\mathbf{5.0}\times$, and $\uparrow$$\mathbf{7.3}\times$ FPS under comparable accuracy over state-of-the-art ViT accelerators, as well as $\uparrow$$\mathbf{6.0}\times$, $\uparrow$$\mathbf{1.5}\times$, and $\uparrow$$\mathbf{2.1}\times$ DSP efficiency.} Codes are available at \url{https://github.com/shihuihong214/Trio-ViT}.

**Authors**: Giandomenico Cornacchia, Giulio Zizzo, Kieran Fraser, Muhammad Zaid Hamed, Ambrish Rawat, Mark Purcell

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T10:16:37Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in diverse applications underscores the pressing need for robust security measures to thwart potential jailbreak attacks. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities within LLMs, endanger data integrity and user privacy. Guardrails serve as crucial protective mechanisms against such threats, but existing models often fall short in terms of both detection accuracy, and computational efficiency. This paper advocates for the significance of jailbreak attack prevention on LLMs, and emphasises the role of input guardrails in safeguarding these models. We introduce MoJE (Mixture of Jailbreak Expert), a novel guardrail architecture designed to surpass current limitations in existing state-of-the-art guardrails. By employing simple linguistic statistical techniques, MoJE excels in detecting jailbreak attacks while maintaining minimal computational overhead during model inference. Through rigorous experimentation, MoJE demonstrates superior performance capable of detecting 90% of the attacks without compromising benign prompts, enhancing LLMs security against jailbreak attacks.

### Do LLMs suffer from Multi-Party Hangover? A Diagnostic Approach to   Addressee Recognition and Response Selection in Conversations
**Authors**: Nicolò Penzo, Maryam Sajedinia, Bruno Lepri, Sara Tonelli, Marco Guerini

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T10:07:33Z

**Summary**: Assessing the performance of systems to classify Multi-Party Conversations (MPC) is challenging due to the interconnection between linguistic and structural characteristics of conversations. Conventional evaluation methods often overlook variances in model behavior across different levels of structural complexity on interaction graphs. In this work, we propose a methodological pipeline to investigate model performance across specific structural attributes of conversations. As a proof of concept we focus on Response Selection and Addressee Recognition tasks, to diagnose model weaknesses. To this end, we extract representative diagnostic subdatasets with a fixed number of users and a good structural variety from a large and open corpus of online MPCs. We further frame our work in terms of data minimization, avoiding the use of original usernames to preserve privacy, and propose alternatives to using original text messages. Results show that response selection relies more on the textual content of conversations, while addressee recognition requires capturing their structural dimension. Using an LLM in a zero-shot setting, we further highlight how sensitivity to prompt variations is task-dependent.

### Comparing Apples to Oranges: LLM-powered Multimodal Intention Prediction   in an Object Categorization Task
**Authors**: Hassan Ali, Philipp Allgeuer, Stefan Wermter

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T10:05:56Z

**Summary**: Human intention-based systems enable robots to perceive and interpret user actions to interact with humans and adapt to their behavior proactively. Therefore, intention prediction is pivotal in creating a natural interaction with social robots in human-designed environments. In this paper, we examine using Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer human intention in a collaborative object categorization task with a physical robot. We propose a novel multimodal approach that integrates user non-verbal cues, like hand gestures, body poses, and facial expressions, with environment states and user verbal cues to predict user intentions in a hierarchical architecture. Our evaluation of five LLMs shows the potential for reasoning about verbal and non-verbal user cues, leveraging their context-understanding and real-world knowledge to support intention prediction while collaborating on a task with a social robot.

### ASAG2024: A Combined Benchmark for Short Answer Grading
**Authors**: Gérôme Meyer, Philip Breuer, Jonathan Fürst

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T09:56:02Z

**Summary**: Open-ended questions test a more thorough understanding than closed-ended questions and are often a preferred assessment method. However, open-ended questions are tedious to grade and subject to personal bias. Therefore, there have been efforts to speed up the grading process through automation. Short Answer Grading (SAG) systems aim to automatically score students' answers. Despite growth in SAG methods and capabilities, there exists no comprehensive short-answer grading benchmark across different subjects, grading scales, and distributions. Thus, it is hard to assess the capabilities of current automated grading methods in terms of their generalizability. In this preliminary work, we introduce the combined ASAG2024 benchmark to facilitate the comparison of automated grading systems. Combining seven commonly used short-answer grading datasets in a common structure and grading scale. For our benchmark, we evaluate a set of recent SAG methods, revealing that while LLM-based approaches reach new high scores, they still are far from reaching human performance. This opens up avenues for future research on human-machine SAG systems.

### "Oh LLM, I'm Asking Thee, Please Give Me a Decision Tree": Zero-Shot   Decision Tree Induction and Embedding with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ricardo Knauer, Mario Koddenbrock, Raphael Wallsberger, Nicholas M. Brisson, Georg N. Duda, Deborah Falla, David W. Evans, Erik Rodner

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T09:53:48Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) provide powerful means to leverage prior knowledge for predictive modeling when data is limited. In this work, we demonstrate how LLMs can use their compressed world knowledge to generate intrinsically interpretable machine learning models, i.e., decision trees, without any training data. We find that these zero-shot decision trees can surpass data-driven trees on some small-sized tabular datasets and that embeddings derived from these trees perform on par with data-driven tree-based embeddings on average. Our knowledge-driven decision tree induction and embedding approaches therefore serve as strong new baselines for data-driven machine learning methods in the low-data regime.

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T09:52:57Z

**Summary**: This paper presents the submission of Huawei Translation Services Center (HW-TSC) to machine translation tasks of the 20th China Conference on Machine Translation (CCMT 2024). We participate in the bilingual machine translation task and multi-domain machine translation task. For these two translation tasks, we use training strategies such as regularized dropout, bidirectional training, data diversification, forward translation, back translation, alternated training, curriculum learning, and transductive ensemble learning to train neural machine translation (NMT) models based on the deep Transformer-big architecture. Furthermore, to explore whether large language model (LLM) can help improve the translation quality of NMT systems, we use supervised fine-tuning to train llama2-13b as an Automatic post-editing (APE) model to improve the translation results of the NMT model on the multi-domain machine translation task. By using these plyometric strategies, our submission achieves a competitive result in the final evaluation.

### Hit the Sweet Spot! Span-Level Ensemble for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yangyifan Xu, Jianghao Chen, Junhong Wu, Jiajun Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T09:41:29Z

**Summary**: Ensembling various LLMs to unlock their complementary potential and leverage their individual strengths is highly valuable. Previous studies typically focus on two main paradigms: sample-level and token-level ensembles. Sample-level ensemble methods either select or blend fully generated outputs, which hinders dynamic correction and enhancement of outputs during the generation process. On the other hand, token-level ensemble methods enable real-time correction through fine-grained ensemble at each generation step. However, the information carried by an individual token is quite limited, leading to suboptimal decisions at each step. To address these issues, we propose SweetSpan, a span-level ensemble method that effectively balances the need for real-time adjustments and the information required for accurate ensemble decisions. Our approach involves two key steps: First, we have each candidate model independently generate candidate spans based on the shared prefix. Second, we calculate perplexity scores to facilitate mutual evaluation among the candidate models and achieve robust span selection by filtering out unfaithful scores. To comprehensively evaluate ensemble methods, we propose a new challenging setting (ensemble models with significant performance gaps) in addition to the standard setting (ensemble the best-performing models) to assess the performance of model ensembles in more realistic scenarios. Experimental results in both standard and challenging settings across various language generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and versatility of our approach compared with previous ensemble methods.

**Authors**: Runsong Zhao, Pengcheng Huang, Xinyu Liu, Chunyang Xiao, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T09:13:19Z

**Summary**: Compressing Transformer inputs into compressd tokens allows running LLMs with improved speed and cost efficiency. Based on the compression method ICAE, we carefully examine the position identifier choices for compressed tokens and also propose a new compression loss. We demonstrate empirically that our proposed methods achieve significantly higher compression ratios (15x compared to 4x for ICAE), while being able to attain comparable reconstruction performance.

### Make Large Language Model a Better Ranker
**Authors**: Wen-Shuo Chao, Zhi Zheng, Hengshu Zhu, Hao Liu

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:57:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate robust capabilities across various fields, leading to a paradigm shift in LLM-enhanced Recommender System (RS). Research to date focuses on point-wise and pair-wise recommendation paradigms, which are inefficient for LLM-based recommenders due to high computational costs. However, existing list-wise approaches also fall short in ranking tasks due to misalignment between ranking objectives and next-token prediction. Moreover, these LLM-based methods struggle to effectively address the order relation among candidates, particularly given the scale of ratings. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the large language model framework with Aligned Listwise Ranking Objectives (ALRO). ALRO is designed to bridge the gap between the capabilities of LLMs and the nuanced requirements of ranking tasks. Specifically, ALRO employs explicit feedback in a listwise manner by introducing soft lambda loss, a customized adaptation of lambda loss designed for optimizing order relations. This mechanism provides more accurate optimization goals, enhancing the ranking process. Additionally, ALRO incorporates a permutation-sensitive learning mechanism that addresses position bias, a prevalent issue in generative models, without imposing additional computational burdens during inference. Our evaluative studies reveal that ALRO outperforms both existing embedding-based recommendation methods and LLM-based recommendation baselines.

### Commonsense Scene Graph-based Target Localization for Object Search
**Authors**: Wenqi Ge, Chao Tang, Hong Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:29:50Z

**Summary**: Object search is a fundamental skill for household robots, yet the core problem lies in the robot's ability to locate the target object accurately. The dynamic nature of household environments, characterized by the arbitrary placement of daily objects by users, makes it challenging to perform target localization. To efficiently locate the target object, the robot needs to be equipped with knowledge at both the object and room level. However, existing approaches rely solely on one type of knowledge, leading to unsatisfactory object localization performance and, consequently, inefficient object search processes. To address this problem, we propose a commonsense scene graph-based target localization, CSG-TL, to enhance target object search in the household environment. Given the pre-built map with stationary items, the robot models the room-level knowledge with object-level commonsense knowledge generated by a large language model (LLM) to a commonsense scene graph (CSG), supporting both types of knowledge for CSG-TL. To demonstrate the superiority of CSG-TL on target localization, extensive experiments are performed on the real-world ScanNet dataset and the AI2THOR simulator. Moreover, we have extended CSG-TL to an object search framework, CSG-OS, validated in both simulated and real-world environments. Code and videos are available at https://sites.google.com/view/csg-os.

### Think Twice Before Trusting: Self-Detection for Large Language Models   through Comprehensive Answer Reflection
**Authors**: Moxin Li, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng, Fengbin Zhu, Qifan Wang, Tat-Seng Chua

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:22:21Z

**Summary**: Self-detection for Large Language Models (LLMs) seeks to evaluate the trustworthiness of the LLM's output by leveraging its own capabilities, thereby alleviating the issue of output hallucination. However, existing self-detection approaches only retrospectively evaluate answers generated by LLM, typically leading to the over-trust in incorrectly generated answers. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel self-detection paradigm that considers the comprehensive answer space beyond LLM-generated answers. It thoroughly compares the trustworthiness of multiple candidate answers to mitigate the over-trust in LLM-generated incorrect answers. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce a two-step framework, which firstly instructs LLM to reflect and provide justifications for each candidate answer, and then aggregates the justifications for comprehensive target answer evaluation. This framework can be seamlessly integrated with existing approaches for superior self-detection. Extensive experiments on six datasets spanning three tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

### Align$^2$LLaVA: Cascaded Human and Large Language Model Preference   Alignment for Multi-modal Instruction Curation
**Authors**: Hongzhe Huang, Zhewen Yu, Jiang Liu, Li Cai, Dian Jiao, Wenqiao Zhang, Siliang Tang, Juncheng Li, Hao Jiang, Haoyuan Li, Yueting Zhuang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:20:59Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), such as LLaVA-series models, are driven by massive machine-generated instruction-following data tuning. Such automatic instruction collection pipelines, however, inadvertently introduce significant variability in data quality. This paper introduces a novel instruction curation algorithm, derived from two unique perspectives, human and LLM preference alignment, to compress this vast corpus of machine-generated multimodal instructions to a compact and high-quality form: (i) For human preference alignment, we have collected a machine-generated multimodal instruction dataset and established a comprehensive set of both subjective and objective criteria to guide the data quality assessment critically from human experts. By doing so, a reward model was trained on the annotated dataset to internalize the nuanced human understanding of instruction alignment. (ii) For LLM preference alignment, given the instruction selected by the reward model, we propose leveraging the inner LLM used in MLLM to align the writing style of visual instructions with that of the inner LLM itself, resulting in LLM-aligned instruction improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that we can maintain or even improve model performance by compressing synthetic multimodal instructions by up to 90%. Impressively, by aggressively reducing the total training sample size from 158k to 14k (9$\times$ smaller), our model consistently outperforms its full-size dataset counterpart across various MLLM benchmarks. Our project is available at https://github.com/DCDmllm/Align2LLaVA.

### Few-shot Pairwise Rank Prompting: An Effective Non-Parametric Retrieval   Model
**Authors**: Nilanjan Sinhababu, Andrew Parry, Debasis Ganguly, Debasis Samanta, Pabitra Mitra

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:19:29Z

**Summary**: A supervised ranking model, despite its advantage of being effective, usually involves complex processing - typically multiple stages of task-specific pre-training and fine-tuning. This has motivated researchers to explore simpler pipelines leveraging large language models (LLMs) that are capable of working in a zero-shot manner. However, since zero-shot inference does not make use of a training set of pairs of queries and their relevant documents, its performance is mostly worse than that of supervised models, which are trained on such example pairs. Motivated by the existing findings that training examples generally improve zero-shot performance, in our work, we explore if this also applies to ranking models. More specifically, given a query and a pair of documents, the preference prediction task is improved by augmenting examples of preferences for similar queries from a training set. Our proposed pairwise few-shot ranker demonstrates consistent improvements over the zero-shot baseline on both in-domain (TREC DL) and out-domain (BEIR subset) retrieval benchmarks. Our method also achieves a close performance to that of a supervised model without requiring any complex training pipeline.

### AlphaMath Almost Zero: Process Supervision without Process
**Authors**: Guoxin Chen, Minpeng Liao, Chengxi Li, Kai Fan

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:16:28Z

**Summary**: Although recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their performance on various tasks, they still face challenges with complex and symbolic multi-step reasoning, particularly in mathematical reasoning. To bolster the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, most existing efforts concentrate on seeking assistance from either domain experts or GPT-4 for high-quality process-supervised data, which is not only expensive but also labor-intensive. In our study, we propose an innovative framework, AlphaMath, that bypasses the need for process annotations (from humans or GPTs) by leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This framework focuses on unleashing the potential of a well-pretrained LLM to autonomously enhance its mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we integrate a value model with the LLM, automatically generating both process supervision and step-level evaluation signals in MCTS. Furthermore, we propose an efficient inference strategy, step-level beam search, where the value model is crafted to assist the policy model (i.e., LLM) in navigating more effective reasoning paths, rather than solely relying on prior probabilities. The experimental results on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets demonstrate that even without GPT-4 or human-annotated process supervision, our AlphaMath framework achieves comparable or superior results to previous state-of-the-art methods.

### PackageIntel: Leveraging Large Language Models for Automated   Intelligence Extraction in Package Ecosystems
**Authors**: Wenbo Guo, Chengwei Liu, Limin Wang, Jiahui Wu, Zhengzi Xu, Cheng Huang, Yong Fang, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:03:44Z

**Summary**: The rise of malicious packages in public registries poses a significant threat to software supply chain (SSC) security. Although academia and industry employ methods like software composition analysis (SCA) to address this issue, existing approaches often lack timely and comprehensive intelligence updates. This paper introduces PackageIntel, a novel platform that revolutionizes the collection, processing, and retrieval of malicious package intelligence. By utilizing exhaustive search techniques, snowball sampling from diverse sources, and large language models (LLMs) with specialized prompts, PackageIntel ensures enhanced coverage, timeliness, and accuracy. We have developed a comprehensive database containing 20,692 malicious NPM and PyPI packages sourced from 21 distinct intelligence repositories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that PackageIntel achieves a precision of 98.6% and an F1 score of 92.0 in intelligence extraction. Additionally, it detects threats on average 70% earlier than leading databases like Snyk and OSV, and operates cost-effectively at $0.094 per intelligence piece. The platform has successfully identified and reported over 1,000 malicious packages in downstream package manager mirror registries. This research provides a robust, efficient, and timely solution for identifying and mitigating threats within the software supply chain ecosystem.

### Step-level Value Preference Optimization for Mathematical Reasoning
**Authors**: Guoxin Chen, Minpeng Liao, Chengxi Li, Kai Fan

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:03:07Z

**Summary**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using an implicit reward model has proven to be an effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for fine-tuning preference aligned large language models (LLMs). However, the overall preference annotations of responses do not fully capture the fine-grained quality of model outputs in complex multi-step reasoning tasks, such as mathematical reasoning. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel algorithm called Step-level Value Preference Optimization (SVPO). Our approach employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to automatically annotate step-level preferences for multi-step reasoning. Furthermore, from the perspective of learning-to-rank, we train an explicit value model to replicate the behavior of the implicit reward model, complementing standard preference optimization. This value model enables the LLM to generate higher reward responses with minimal cost during inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/MARIO-Math-Reasoning/Super_MARIO}.

### Do We Need Domain-Specific Embedding Models? An Empirical Investigation
**Authors**: Yixuan Tang, Yi Yang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T07:46:06Z

**Summary**: Embedding models play a crucial role in representing and retrieving information across various NLP applications. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have further enhanced the performance of embedding models, which are trained on massive amounts of text covering almost every domain. These models are often benchmarked on general-purpose datasets like Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), where they demonstrate superior performance. However, a critical question arises: Is the development of domain-specific embedding models necessary when general-purpose models are trained on vast corpora that already include specialized domain texts? In this paper, we empirically investigate this question, choosing the finance domain as an example. We introduce the Finance Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (FinMTEB), a counterpart to MTEB that consists of financial domain-specific text datasets. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art embedding models on FinMTEB and observe a significant performance drop compared to their performance on MTEB. To account for the possibility that this drop is driven by FinMTEB's higher complexity, we propose four measures to quantify dataset complexity and control for this factor in our analysis. Our analysis provides compelling evidence that state-of-the-art embedding models struggle to capture domain-specific linguistic and semantic patterns, even when trained on large general-purpose corpora. This study sheds light on the necessity of developing domain-specific embedding models in the LLM era, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners.

### Self-Evaluation of Large Language Model based on Glass-box Features
**Authors**: Hui Huang, Yingqi Qu, Jing Liu, Muyun Yang, Bing Xu, Tiejun Zhao, Wenpeng Lu

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T07:08:10Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) underscores the pressing need for evaluation methods. Existing works primarily rely on external evaluators, focusing on training and prompting strategies. However, a crucial aspect, model-aware glass-box features, is overlooked. In this study, we explore the utility of glass-box features under the scenario of self-evaluation, namely applying an LLM to evaluate its own output. We investigate various glass-box feature groups and discovered that the softmax distribution serves as a reliable quality indicator for self-evaluation. Experimental results on public benchmarks validate the feasibility of self-evaluation of LLMs using glass-box features.

### PromptKD: Distilling Student-Friendly Knowledge for Generative Language   Models via Prompt Tuning
**Authors**: Gyeongman Kim, Doohyuk Jang, Eunho Yang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T06:25:33Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about inference costs, increasing the need for research into model compression. While knowledge distillation (KD) is a prominent method for this, research on KD for generative language models like LLMs is relatively sparse, and the approach of distilling student-friendly knowledge, which has shown promising performance in KD for classification models, remains unexplored in generative language models. To explore this approach, we propose PromptKD, a simple yet effective method that utilizes prompt tuning - for the first time in KD - to enable generative language models to transfer student-friendly knowledge. Unlike previous works in classification that require fine-tuning the entire teacher model for extracting student-friendly knowledge, PromptKD achieves similar effects by adding a small number of prompt tokens and tuning only the prompt with student guidance. Extensive experiments on instruction-following datasets show that PromptKD achieves state-of-the-art performance while adding only 0.0007% of the teacher's parameters as prompts. Further analysis suggests that distilling student-friendly knowledge alleviates exposure bias effectively throughout the entire training process, leading to performance enhancements.

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T05:55:01Z

**Summary**: With the rapid development of IT operations, it has become increasingly crucial to efficiently manage and analyze large volumes of data for practical applications. The techniques of Natural Language Processing (NLP) have shown remarkable capabilities for various tasks, including named entity recognition, machine translation and dialogue systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant improvements across various NLP downstream tasks. However, there is a lack of specialized LLMs for IT operations. In this paper, we introduce the OWL, a large language model trained on our collected OWL-Instruct dataset with a wide range of IT-related information, where the mixture-of-adapter strategy is proposed to improve the parameter-efficient tuning across different domains or tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of our OWL on the OWL-Bench established by us and open IT-related benchmarks. OWL demonstrates superior performance results on IT tasks, which outperforms existing models by significant margins. Moreover, we hope that the findings of our work will provide more insights to revolutionize the techniques of IT operations with specialized LLMs.

### Review of Digital Asset Development with Graph Neural Network Unlearning
**Authors**: Zara Lisbon

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T05:31:04Z

**Summary**: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital assets, the imperative for robust data privacy and compliance with regulatory frameworks has intensified. This paper investigates the critical role of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the management of digital assets and introduces innovative unlearning techniques specifically tailored to GNN architectures. We categorize unlearning strategies into two primary classes: data-driven approximation, which manipulates the graph structure to isolate and remove the influence of specific nodes, and model-driven approximation, which modifies the internal parameters and architecture of the GNN itself. By examining recent advancements in these unlearning methodologies, we highlight their applicability in various use cases, including fraud detection, risk assessment, token relationship prediction, and decentralized governance. We discuss the challenges inherent in balancing model performance with the requirements for data unlearning, particularly in the context of real-time financial applications. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both unlearning strategies to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of GNNs in digital asset ecosystems. Ultimately, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and implementing GNN unlearning techniques, paving the way for secure and compliant deployment of machine learning in the digital asset domain.

**Authors**: Aditi Godbole, Jabin Geevarghese George, Smita Shandilya

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T05:29:31Z

**Summary**: The rapid increase in unstructured data across various fields has made multi-document comprehension and summarization a critical task. Traditional approaches often fail to capture relevant context, maintain logical consistency, and extract essential information from lengthy documents. This paper explores the use of Long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-document summarization, demonstrating their exceptional capacity to grasp extensive connections, provide cohesive summaries, and adapt to various industry domains and integration with enterprise applications/systems. The paper discusses the workflow of multi-document summarization for effectively deploying long-context LLMs, supported by case studies in legal applications, enterprise functions such as HR, finance, and sourcing, as well as in the medical and news domains. These case studies show notable enhancements in both efficiency and accuracy. Technical obstacles, such as dataset diversity, model scalability, and ethical considerations like bias mitigation and factual accuracy, are carefully analyzed. Prospective research avenues are suggested to augment the functionalities and applications of long-context LLMs, establishing them as pivotal tools for transforming information processing across diverse sectors and enterprise applications.

### "Global is Good, Local is Bad?": Understanding Brand Bias in LLMs
**Authors**: Mahammed Kamruzzaman, Hieu Minh Nguyen, Gene Louis Kim

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T05:20:37Z

**Summary**: Many recent studies have investigated social biases in LLMs but brand bias has received little attention. This research examines the biases exhibited by LLMs towards different brands, a significant concern given the widespread use of LLMs in affected use cases such as product recommendation and market analysis. Biased models may perpetuate societal inequalities, unfairly favoring established global brands while marginalizing local ones. Using a curated dataset across four brand categories, we probe the behavior of LLMs in this space. We find a consistent pattern of bias in this space -- both in terms of disproportionately associating global brands with positive attributes and disproportionately recommending luxury gifts for individuals in high-income countries. We also find LLMs are subject to country-of-origin effects which may boost local brand preference in LLM outputs in specific contexts.

### Exploring Language Model Generalization in Low-Resource Extractive QA
**Authors**: Saptarshi Sengupta, Wenpeng Yin, Preslav Nakov, Shreya Ghosh, Suhang Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T05:06:43Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we investigate Extractive Question Answering (EQA) with Large Language Models (LLMs) under domain drift, i.e., can LLMs generalize well to closed-domains that require specific knowledge such as medicine and law in a zero-shot fashion without additional in-domain training? To this end, we devise a series of experiments to empirically explain the performance gap. Our findings suggest that: a) LLMs struggle with dataset demands of closed-domains such as retrieving long answer-spans; b) Certain LLMs, despite showing strong overall performance, display weaknesses in meeting basic requirements as discriminating between domain-specific senses of words which we link to pre-processing decisions; c) Scaling model parameters is not always effective for cross-domain generalization; and d) Closed-domain datasets are quantitatively much different than open-domain EQA datasets and current LLMs struggle to deal with them. Our findings point out important directions for improving existing LLMs.

**Authors**: Mucong Ding, Chenghao Deng, Jocelyn Choo, Zichu Wu, Aakriti Agrawal, Avi Schwarzschild, Tianyi Zhou, Tom Goldstein, John Langford, Anima Anandkumar, Furong Huang

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T03:49:56Z

**Summary**: While generalization over tasks from easy to hard is crucial to profile language models (LLMs), the datasets with fine-grained difficulty annotations for each problem across a broad range of complexity are still blank. Aiming to address this limitation, we present Easy2Hard-Bench, a consistently formatted collection of 6 benchmark datasets spanning various domains, such as mathematics and programming problems, chess puzzles, and reasoning questions. Each problem within these datasets is annotated with numerical difficulty scores. To systematically estimate problem difficulties, we collect abundant performance data on attempts to each problem by humans in the real world or LLMs on the prominent leaderboard. Leveraging the rich performance data, we apply well-established difficulty ranking systems, such as Item Response Theory (IRT) and Glicko-2 models, to uniformly assign numerical difficulty scores to problems. Moreover, datasets in Easy2Hard-Bench distinguish themselves from previous collections by a higher proportion of challenging problems. Through extensive experiments with six state-of-the-art LLMs, we provide a comprehensive analysis of their performance and generalization capabilities across varying levels of difficulty, with the aim of inspiring future research in LLM generalization. The datasets are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/furonghuang-lab/Easy2Hard-Bench.

### Lagrangian approach to origami vertex analysis: Kinematics
**Authors**: Matthew Grasinger, Andrew Gillman, Philip Buskohl

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T03:20:04Z

**Summary**: The use of origami in engineering has significantly expanded in recent years, spanning deployable structures across scales, folding robotics, and mechanical metamaterials. However, finding foldable paths can be a formidable task as the kinematics are determined by a nonlinear system of equations, often with several degrees of freedom. In this work, we leverage a Lagrangian approach to derive reduced-order compatibility conditions for rigid-facet origami vertices with reflection and rotational symmetries. Then, using the reduced-order conditions, we derive exact, multi-degree of freedom solutions for degree 6 and degree 8 vertices with prescribed symmetries. The exact kinematic solutions allow us to efficiently investigate the topology of allowable kinematics, including the consideration of a self-contact constraint, and then visually interpret the role of geometric design parameters on these admissible fold paths by monitoring the change in the kinematic topology. We then introduce a procedure to construct lower symmetry kinematic solutions by breaking symmetry of higher order kinematic solutions in a systematic way that preserves compatibility. The multi-degree of freedom solutions discovered here should assist with building intuition of the kinematic feasibility of higher degree origami vertices and also facilitate the development of new algorithmic procedures for origami-engineering design.

### VickreyFeedback: Cost-efficient Data Construction for Reinforcement   Learning from Human Feedback
**Authors**: Guoxi Zhang, Jiuding Duan

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T03:15:07Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the cost-efficiency aspect of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). RLHF leverages datasets of human preferences over outputs of large language models (LLM) to instill human expectations into LLMs. While preference annotation comes with a monetized cost, the economic utility of a preference dataset has not been considered by far. What exacerbates this situation is that given complex intransitive or cyclic relationships in preference datasets, existing algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs are still far from capturing comprehensive preferences. This raises severe cost-efficiency concerns in production environments, where preference data accumulate over time. In this paper, we see the fine-tuning of LLMs as a monetized economy and introduce an auction mechanism to improve the efficiency of the preference data collection in dollar terms. We show that introducing an auction mechanism can play an essential role in enhancing the cost-efficiency of RLHF while maintaining satisfactory model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed auction-based protocol is cost-efficient for fine-tuning LLMs by concentrating on high-quality feedback.

**Authors**: Liangtai Sun, Danyu Luo, Da Ma, Zihan Zhao, Baocai Chen, Zhennan Shen, Su Zhu, Lu Chen, Xin Chen, Kai Yu

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T03:00:29Z

**Summary**: Recently, there has been a significant upsurge of interest in leveraging large language models (LLMs) to assist scientific discovery. However, most LLMs only focus on general science, while they lack domain-specific knowledge, such as chemical molecules and amino acid sequences. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SciDFM, a mixture-of-experts LLM, which is trained from scratch and is able to conduct college-level scientific reasoning and understand molecules and amino acid sequences. We collect a large-scale training corpus containing numerous scientific papers and books from different disciplines as well as data from domain-specific databases. We further fine-tune the pre-trained model on lots of instruction data to improve performances on downstream benchmarks. From experiment results, we show that SciDFM achieves strong performance on general scientific benchmarks such as SciEval and SciQ, and it reaches a SOTA performance on domain-specific benchmarks among models of similar size. We further analyze the expert layers and show that the results of expert selection vary with data from different disciplines. To benefit the broader research community, we open-source SciDFM at https://huggingface.co/OpenDFM/SciDFM-MoE-A5.6B-v1.0.

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T02:55:06Z

**Summary**: With the increasing capabilities of large language models (LLMs), in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm for natural language processing (NLP), where LLMs make predictions based on contexts augmented with a few examples. It has been a significant trend to explore ICL to evaluate and extrapolate the ability of LLMs. In this paper, we aim to survey and summarize the progress and challenges of ICL. We first present a formal definition of ICL and clarify its correlation to related studies. Then, we organize and discuss advanced techniques, including training strategies, prompt designing strategies, and related analysis. Additionally, we explore various ICL application scenarios, such as data engineering and knowledge updating. Finally, we address the challenges of ICL and suggest potential directions for further research. We hope that our work can encourage more research on uncovering how ICL works and improving ICL.

### Word2Wave: Language Driven Mission Programming for Efficient Subsea   Deployments of Marine Robots
**Authors**: Ruo Chen, David Blow, Adnan Abdullah, Md Jahidul Islam

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T02:42:55Z

**Summary**: This paper explores the design and development of a language-based interface for dynamic mission programming of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The proposed 'Word2Wave' (W2W) framework enables interactive programming and parameter configuration of AUVs for remote subsea missions. The W2W framework includes: (i) a set of novel language rules and command structures for efficient language-to-mission mapping; (ii) a GPT-based prompt engineering module for training data generation; (iii) a small language model (SLM)-based sequence-to-sequence learning pipeline for mission command generation from human speech or text; and (iv) a novel user interface for 2D mission map visualization and human-machine interfacing. The proposed learning pipeline adapts an SLM named T5-Small that can learn language-to-mission mapping from processed language data effectively, providing robust and efficient performance. In addition to a benchmark evaluation with state-of-the-art, we conduct a user interaction study to demonstrate the effectiveness of W2W over commercial AUV programming interfaces. Across participants, W2W-based programming required less than 10% time for mission programming compared to traditional interfaces; it is deemed to be a simpler and more natural paradigm for subsea mission programming with a usability score of 76.25. W2W opens up promising future research opportunities on hands-free AUV mission programming for efficient subsea deployments.

### Code Vulnerability Repair with Large Language Model using Context-Aware   Prompt Tuning
**Authors**: Arshiya Khan, Guannan Liu, Xing Gao

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T02:25:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant challenges in detecting and repairing vulnerable code, particularly when dealing with vulnerabilities involving multiple aspects, such as variables, code flows, and code structures. In this study, we utilize GitHub Copilot as the LLM and focus on buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Our experiments reveal a notable gap in Copilot's abilities when dealing with buffer overflow vulnerabilities, with a 76% vulnerability detection rate but only a 15% vulnerability repair rate. To address this issue, we propose context-aware prompt tuning techniques designed to enhance LLM performance in repairing buffer overflow. By injecting a sequence of domain knowledge about the vulnerability, including various security and code contexts, we demonstrate that Copilot's successful repair rate increases to 63%, representing more than four times the improvement compared to repairs without domain knowledge.

### Scaling Behavior for Large Language Models regarding Numeral Systems: An   Example using Pythia
**Authors**: Zhejian Zhou, Jiayu Wang, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T02:18:22Z

**Summary**: Though Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in mathematics reasoning, they are still struggling with performing numeric operations accurately, such as addition and multiplication. Numbers can be tokenized into tokens in various ways by different LLMs and affect the numeric operations performance. Currently, there are two representatives: 1) Tokenize into $1$-digit, and 2) Tokenize into $1\sim 3$ digit. The difference is roughly equivalent to using different numeral systems (namely base $10$ or base $10^{3}$). In light of this, we study the scaling behavior of different numeral systems in the context of transformer-based large language models. We empirically show that a base $10$ system is consistently more data-efficient than a base $10^{2}$ or $10^{3}$ system across training data scale, model sizes under from-scratch training settings, while different number systems have very similar fine-tuning performances. We attribute this to higher token frequencies of a base $10$ system. Additionally, we reveal extrapolation behavior patterns on addition and multiplication. We identify that base $100$ and base $1000$ systems struggle on token-level discernment and token-level operations. We also sheds light on the mechanism learnt by the models.

### CurricuLLM: Automatic Task Curricula Design for Learning Complex Robot   Skills using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Kanghyun Ryu, Qiayuan Liao, Zhongyu Li, Koushil Sreenath, Negar Mehr

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T01:48:16Z

**Summary**: Curriculum learning is a training mechanism in reinforcement learning (RL) that facilitates the achievement of complex policies by progressively increasing the task difficulty during training. However, designing effective curricula for a specific task often requires extensive domain knowledge and human intervention, which limits its applicability across various domains. Our core idea is that large language models (LLMs), with their extensive training on diverse language data and ability to encapsulate world knowledge, present significant potential for efficiently breaking down tasks and decomposing skills across various robotics environments. Additionally, the demonstrated success of LLMs in translating natural language into executable code for RL agents strengthens their role in generating task curricula. In this work, we propose CurricuLLM, which leverages the high-level planning and programming capabilities of LLMs for curriculum design, thereby enhancing the efficient learning of complex target tasks. CurricuLLM consists of: (Step 1) Generating sequence of subtasks that aid target task learning in natural language form, (Step 2) Translating natural language description of subtasks in executable task code, including the reward code and goal distribution code, and (Step 3) Evaluating trained policies based on trajectory rollout and subtask description. We evaluate CurricuLLM in various robotics simulation environments, ranging from manipulation, navigation, and locomotion, to show that CurricuLLM can aid learning complex robot control tasks. In addition, we validate humanoid locomotion policy learned through CurricuLLM in real-world. The code is provided in https://github.com/labicon/CurricuLLM

### Internalizing ASR with Implicit Chain of Thought for Efficient   Speech-to-Speech Conversational LLM
**Authors**: Robin Shing-Hei Yuen, Timothy Tin-Long Tse, Jian Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T01:42:54Z

**Summary**: Current speech-based LLMs are predominantly trained on extensive ASR and TTS datasets, excelling in tasks related to these domains. However, their ability to handle direct speech-to-speech conversations remains notably constrained. These models often rely on an ASR-to-TTS chain-of-thought pipeline, converting speech into text for processing before generating audio responses, which introduces latency and loses audio features. We propose a method that implicitly internalizes ASR chain of thought into a speech LLM, enhancing its native speech understanding capabilities. Our approach reduces latency and improves the model's native understanding of speech, paving the way for more efficient and natural real-time audio interactions. We also release a large-scale synthetic conversational dataset to facilitate further research.

### Speech-Guided Sequential Planning for Autonomous Navigation using Large   Language Model Meta AI 3 (Llama3)
**Authors**: Alkesh K. Srivastava, Philip Dames

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T00:01:03Z

**Summary**: In social robotics, a pivotal focus is enabling robots to engage with humans in a more natural and seamless manner. The emergence of advanced large language models (LLMs) such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) and autoregressive models like Large Language Model Meta AI (Llamas) has driven significant advancements in integrating natural language understanding capabilities into social robots. This paper presents a system for speech-guided sequential planning in autonomous navigation, utilizing Llama3 and the Robot Operating System~(ROS). The proposed system involves using Llama3 to interpret voice commands, extracting essential details through parsing, and decoding these commands into sequential actions for tasks. Such sequential planning is essential in various domains, particularly in the pickup and delivery of an object. Once a sequential navigation task is evaluated, we employ DRL-VO, a learning-based control policy that allows a robot to autonomously navigate through social spaces with static infrastructure and (crowds of) people. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in simulation experiment using Turtlebot 2 in ROS1 and Turtlebot 3 in ROS2. We conduct hardware trials using a Clearpath Robotics Jackal UGV, highlighting its potential for real-world deployment in scenarios requiring flexible and interactive robotic behaviors.

### RoLoRA: Fine-tuning Rotated Outlier-free LLMs for Effective   Weight-Activation Quantization
**Authors**: Xijie Huang, Zechun Liu, Shih-Yang Liu, Kwang-Ting Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T23:47:03Z

**Summary**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), as a representative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)method, significantly enhances the training efficiency by updating only a small portion of the weights in Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, weight-only quantization techniques have also been applied to LoRA methods to reduce the memory footprint of fine-tuning. However, applying weight-activation quantization to the LoRA pipeline is under-explored, and we observe substantial performance degradation primarily due to the presence of activation outliers. In this work, we propose RoLoRA, the first LoRA-based scheme for effective weight-activation quantization. RoLoRA utilizes rotation for outlier elimination and proposes rotation-aware fine-tuning to preserve the outlier-free characteristics in rotated LLMs. Experimental results show RoLoRA consistently improves low-bit LoRA convergence and post-training quantization robustness in weight-activation settings. We evaluate RoLoRA across LLaMA2-7B/13B, LLaMA3-8B models, achieving up to 29.5% absolute accuracy gain of 4-bit weight-activation quantized LLaMA2- 13B on commonsense reasoning tasks compared to LoRA baseline. We further demonstrate its effectiveness on Large Multimodal Models (LLaVA-1.5-7B). Codes are available at https://github.com/HuangOwen/RoLoRA

### A Generalized LLM-Augmented BIM Framework: Application to a   Speech-to-BIM system
**Authors**: Ghang Lee, Suhyung Jang, Seokho Hyun

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T23:46:15Z

**Summary**: Performing building information modeling (BIM) tasks is a complex process that imposes a steep learning curve and a heavy cognitive load due to the necessity of remembering sequences of numerous commands. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), it is foreseeable that BIM tasks, including querying and managing BIM data, 4D and 5D BIM, design compliance checking, or authoring a design, using written or spoken natural language (i.e., text-to-BIM or speech-to-BIM), will soon supplant traditional graphical user interfaces. This paper proposes a generalized LLM-augmented BIM framework to expedite the development of LLM-enhanced BIM applications by providing a step-by-step development process. The proposed framework consists of six steps: interpret-fill-match-structure-execute-check. The paper demonstrates the applicability of the proposed framework through implementing a speech-to-BIM application, NADIA-S (Natural-language-based Architectural Detailing through Interaction with Artificial Intelligence via Speech), using exterior wall detailing as an example.

### Does End-to-End Autonomous Driving Really Need Perception Tasks?
**Authors**: Peidong Li, Dixiao Cui

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T23:30:48Z

**Summary**: End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2EAD) methods typically rely on supervised perception tasks to extract explicit scene information (e.g., objects, maps). This reliance necessitates expensive annotations and constrains deployment and data scalability in real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce SSR, a novel framework that utilizes only 16 navigation-guided tokens as Sparse Scene Representation, efficiently extracting crucial scene information for E2EAD. Our method eliminates the need for supervised sub-tasks, allowing computational resources to concentrate on essential elements directly related to navigation intent. We further introduce a temporal enhancement module that employs a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) world model, aligning predicted future scenes with actual future scenes through self-supervision. SSR achieves state-of-the-art planning performance on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrating a 27.2\% relative reduction in L2 error and a 51.6\% decrease in collision rate to the leading E2EAD method, UniAD. Moreover, SSR offers a 10.9$\times$ faster inference speed and 13$\times$ faster training time. This framework represents a significant leap in real-time autonomous driving systems and paves the way for future scalable deployment. Code will be released at \url{https://github.com/PeidongLi/SSR}.

### AER-LLM: Ambiguity-aware Emotion Recognition Leveraging Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Xin Hong, Yuan Gong, Vidhyasaharan Sethu, Ting Dang

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T23:25:21Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great success in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In addition to their cognitive intelligence, exploring their capabilities in emotional intelligence is also crucial, as it enables more natural and empathetic conversational AI. Recent studies have shown LLMs' capability in recognizing emotions, but they often focus on single emotion labels and overlook the complex and ambiguous nature of human emotions. This study is the first to address this gap by exploring the potential of LLMs in recognizing ambiguous emotions, leveraging their strong generalization capabilities and in-context learning. We design zero-shot and few-shot prompting and incorporate past dialogue as context information for ambiguous emotion recognition. Experiments conducted using three datasets indicate significant potential for LLMs in recognizing ambiguous emotions, and highlight the substantial benefits of including context information. Furthermore, our findings indicate that LLMs demonstrate a high degree of effectiveness in recognizing less ambiguous emotions and exhibit potential for identifying more ambiguous emotions, paralleling human perceptual capabilities.

### DeBaRA: Denoising-Based 3D Room Arrangement Generation
**Authors**: Léopold Maillard, Nicolas Sereyjol-Garros, Tom Durand, Maks Ovsjanikov

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T23:18:25Z

**Summary**: Generating realistic and diverse layouts of furnished indoor 3D scenes unlocks multiple interactive applications impacting a wide range of industries. The inherent complexity of object interactions, the limited amount of available data and the requirement to fulfill spatial constraints all make generative modeling for 3D scene synthesis and arrangement challenging. Current methods address these challenges autoregressively or by using off-the-shelf diffusion objectives by simultaneously predicting all attributes without 3D reasoning considerations. In this paper, we introduce DeBaRA, a score-based model specifically tailored for precise, controllable and flexible arrangement generation in a bounded environment. We argue that the most critical component of a scene synthesis system is to accurately establish the size and position of various objects within a restricted area. Based on this insight, we propose a lightweight conditional score-based model designed with 3D spatial awareness at its core. We demonstrate that by focusing on spatial attributes of objects, a single trained DeBaRA model can be leveraged at test time to perform several downstream applications such as scene synthesis, completion and re-arrangement. Further, we introduce a novel Self Score Evaluation procedure so it can be optimally employed alongside external LLM models. We evaluate our approach through extensive experiments and demonstrate significant improvement upon state-of-the-art approaches in a range of scenarios.

### Cross-Institutional Structured Radiology Reporting for Lung Cancer   Screening Using a Dynamic Template-Constrained Large Language Model
**Authors**: Chuang Niu, Parisa Kaviani, Qing Lyu, Mannudeep K. Kalra, Christopher T. Whitlow, Ge Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T21:59:11Z

**Summary**: Structured radiology reporting is advantageous for optimizing clinical workflows and patient outcomes. Current LLMs in creating structured reports face the challenges of formatting errors, content hallucinations, and privacy leakage concerns when uploaded to external servers. We aim to develop an enhanced open-source LLM for creating structured and standardized LCS reports from free-text descriptions. After institutional IRB approvals, 5,442 de-identified LCS reports from two institutions were retrospectively analyzed. 500 reports were randomly selected from the two institutions evenly and then manually labeled for evaluation. Two radiologists from the two institutions developed a standardized template including 29 features for lung nodule reporting. We proposed template-constrained decoding to enhance state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, including LLAMA, Qwen, and Mistral. The LLM performance was extensively evaluated in terms of F1 score, confidence interval, McNemar test, and z-test. Based on the structured reports created from the large-scale dataset, a nodule-level retrieval system was prototyped and an automatic statistical analysis was performed. Our software, vLLM-structure, is publicly available for local deployment with enhanced LLMs. Our template-constrained decoding approach consistently enhanced the LLM performance on multi-institutional datasets, with neither formatting errors nor content hallucinations. Our method improved the best open-source LLAMA-3.1 405B by up to 10.42%, and outperformed GPT-4o by 17.19%. A novel nodule retrieval system was successfully prototyped and demonstrated on a large-scale multimodal database using our enhanced LLM technologies. The automatically derived statistical distributions were closely consistent with the prior findings in terms of nodule type, location, size, status, and Lung-RADS.

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the field of Recommendation Systems (RSs). Most existing studies have focused on converting user behavior logs into textual prompts and leveraging techniques such as prompt tuning to enable LLMs for recommendation tasks. Meanwhile, research interest has recently grown in multimodal recommendation systems that integrate data from images, text, and other sources using modality fusion techniques. This introduces new challenges to the existing LLM-based recommendation paradigm which relies solely on text modality information. Moreover, although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capable of processing multi-modal inputs have emerged, how to equip MLLMs with multi-modal recommendation capabilities remains largely unexplored. To this end, in this paper, we propose the Multimodal Large Language Model-enhanced Multimodaln Sequential Recommendation (MLLM-MSR) model. To capture the dynamic user preference, we design a two-stage user preference summarization method. Specifically, we first utilize an MLLM-based item-summarizer to extract image feature given an item and convert the image into text. Then, we employ a recurrent user preference summarization generation paradigm to capture the dynamic changes in user preferences based on an LLM-based user-summarizer. Finally, to enable the MLLM for multi-modal recommendation task, we propose to fine-tune a MLLM-based recommender using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) techniques. Extensive evaluations across various datasets validate the effectiveness of MLLM-MSR, showcasing its superior ability to capture and adapt to the evolving dynamics of user preferences.

**Authors**: Yuexing Hao, Jason M. Holmes, Jared Hobson, Alexandra Bennett, Daniel K. Ebner, David M. Routman, Satomi Shiraishi, Samir H. Patel, Nathan Y. Yu, Chris L. Hallemeier, Brooke E. Ball, Mark R. Waddle, Wei Liu

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T21:00:51Z

**Summary**: In-basket message interactions play a crucial role in physician-patient communication, occurring during all phases (pre-, during, and post) of a patient's care journey. However, responding to these patients' inquiries has become a significant burden on healthcare workflows, consuming considerable time for clinical care teams. To address this, we introduce RadOnc-GPT, a specialized Large Language Model (LLM) powered by GPT-4 that has been designed with a focus on radiotherapeutic treatment of prostate cancer with advanced prompt engineering, and specifically designed to assist in generating responses. We integrated RadOnc-GPT with patient electronic health records (EHR) from both the hospital-wide EHR database and an internal, radiation-oncology-specific database. RadOnc-GPT was evaluated on 158 previously recorded in-basket message interactions. Quantitative natural language processing (NLP) analysis and two grading studies with clinicians and nurses were used to assess RadOnc-GPT's responses. Our findings indicate that RadOnc-GPT slightly outperformed the clinical care team in "Clarity" and "Empathy," while achieving comparable scores in "Completeness" and "Correctness." RadOnc-GPT is estimated to save 5.2 minutes per message for nurses and 2.4 minutes for clinicians, from reading the inquiry to sending the response. Employing RadOnc-GPT for in-basket message draft generation has the potential to alleviate the workload of clinical care teams and reduce healthcare costs by producing high-quality, timely responses.

### Criticality and Safety Margins for Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Alexander Grushin, Walt Woods, Alvaro Velasquez, Simon Khan

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T21:00:45Z

**Summary**: State of the art reinforcement learning methods sometimes encounter unsafe situations. Identifying when these situations occur is of interest both for post-hoc analysis and during deployment, where it might be advantageous to call out to a human overseer for help. Efforts to gauge the criticality of different points in time have been developed, but their accuracy is not well established due to a lack of ground truth, and they are not designed to be easily interpretable by end users. Therefore, we seek to define a criticality framework with both a quantifiable ground truth and a clear significance to users. We introduce true criticality as the expected drop in reward when an agent deviates from its policy for n consecutive random actions. We also introduce the concept of proxy criticality, a low-overhead metric that has a statistically monotonic relationship to true criticality. Safety margins make these interpretable, when defined as the number of random actions for which performance loss will not exceed some tolerance with high confidence. We demonstrate this approach in several environment-agent combinations; for an A3C agent in an Atari Beamrider environment, the lowest 5% of safety margins contain 47% of agent losses; i.e., supervising only 5% of decisions could potentially prevent roughly half of an agent's errors. This criticality framework measures the potential impacts of bad decisions, even before those decisions are made, allowing for more effective debugging and oversight of autonomous agents.

### Enhancing Post-Hoc Attributions in Long Document Comprehension via   Coarse Grained Answer Decomposition
**Authors**: Pritika Ramu, Koustava Goswami, Apoorv Saxena, Balaji Vasan Srinivavsan

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T20:40:15Z

**Summary**: Accurately attributing answer text to its source document is crucial for developing a reliable question-answering system. However, attribution for long documents remains largely unexplored. Post-hoc attribution systems are designed to map answer text back to the source document, yet the granularity of this mapping has not been addressed. Furthermore, a critical question arises: What exactly should be attributed? This involves identifying the specific information units within an answer that require grounding. In this paper, we propose and investigate a novel approach to the factual decomposition of generated answers for attribution, employing template-based in-context learning. To accomplish this, we utilize the question and integrate negative sampling during few-shot in-context learning for decomposition. This approach enhances the semantic understanding of both abstractive and extractive answers. We examine the impact of answer decomposition by providing a thorough examination of various attribution approaches, ranging from retrieval-based techniques to LLM-based attributors.

### PTQ4DiT: Post-training Quantization for Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Junyi Wu, Haoxuan Wang, Yuzhang Shang, Mubarak Shah, Yan Yan

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T20:37:52Z

**Summary**: The recent introduction of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image generation by using a different backbone architecture, departing from traditional U-Nets and embracing the scalable nature of transformers. Despite their advanced capabilities, the wide deployment of DiTs, particularly for real-time applications, is currently hampered by considerable computational demands at the inference stage. Post-training Quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a fast and data-efficient solution that can significantly reduce computation and memory footprint by using low-bit weights and activations. However, its applicability to DiTs has not yet been explored and faces non-trivial difficulties due to the unique design of DiTs. In this paper, we propose PTQ4DiT, a specifically designed PTQ method for DiTs. We discover two primary quantization challenges inherent in DiTs, notably the presence of salient channels with extreme magnitudes and the temporal variability in distributions of salient activation over multiple timesteps. To tackle these challenges, we propose Channel-wise Salience Balancing (CSB) and Spearmen's $\rho$-guided Salience Calibration (SSC). CSB leverages the complementarity property of channel magnitudes to redistribute the extremes, alleviating quantization errors for both activations and weights. SSC extends this approach by dynamically adjusting the balanced salience to capture the temporal variations in activation. Additionally, to eliminate extra computational costs caused by PTQ4DiT during inference, we design an offline re-parameterization strategy for DiTs. Experiments demonstrate that our PTQ4DiT successfully quantizes DiTs to 8-bit precision (W8A8) while preserving comparable generation ability and further enables effective quantization to 4-bit weight precision (W4A8) for the first time.

### RISCORE: Enhancing In-Context Riddle Solving in Language Models through   Context-Reconstructed Example Augmentation
**Authors**: Ioannis Panagiotopoulos, Giorgos Filandrianos, Maria Lymperaiou, Giorgos Stamou

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T20:26:24Z

**Summary**: Riddle-solving requires advanced reasoning skills, pushing LLMs to engage in abstract thinking and creative problem-solving, often revealing limitations in their cognitive abilities. In this paper, we examine the riddle-solving capabilities of LLMs using a multiple-choice format, exploring how different prompting techniques impact performance on riddles that demand diverse reasoning skills. To enhance results, we introduce RISCORE (RIddle Solving with COntext REcontruciton) a novel fully automated prompting method that generates and utilizes contextually reconstructed sentence-based puzzles in conjunction with the original examples to create few-shot exemplars. Our experiments demonstrate that RISCORE significantly improves the performance of language models in both vertical and lateral thinking tasks, surpassing traditional exemplar selection strategies across a variety of few-shot settings.

### Development of an Edge Resilient ML Ensemble to Tolerate ICS Adversarial   Attacks
**Authors**: Likai Yao, Qinxuan Shi, Zhanglong Yang, Sicong Shao, Salim Hariri

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T19:37:37Z

**Summary**: Deploying machine learning (ML) in dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS) can improve the security of industrial control systems (ICS). However, ML-based DDDAS are vulnerable to adversarial attacks because adversaries can alter the input data slightly so that the ML models predict a different result. In this paper, our goal is to build a resilient edge machine learning (reML) architecture that is designed to withstand adversarial attacks by performing Data Air Gap Transformation (DAGT) to anonymize data feature spaces using deep neural networks and randomize the ML models used for predictions. The reML is based on the Resilient DDDAS paradigm, Moving Target Defense (MTD) theory, and TinyML and is applied to combat adversarial attacks on ICS. Furthermore, the proposed approach is power-efficient and privacy-preserving and, therefore, can be deployed on power-constrained devices to enhance ICS security. This approach enables resilient ML inference at the edge by shifting the computation from the computing-intensive platforms to the resource-constrained edge devices. The incorporation of TinyML with TensorFlow Lite ensures efficient resource utilization and, consequently, makes reML suitable for deployment in various industrial control environments. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of reML, facilitated by the resilient DDDAS development environment, allows for continuous adaptation and improvement in response to emerging threats. Lastly, we evaluate our approach on an ICS dataset and demonstrate that reML provides a viable and effective solution for resilient ML inference at the edge devices.

### SPEER: Sentence-Level Planning of Long Clinical Summaries via Embedded   Entity Retrieval
**Authors**: Griffin Adams, Jason Zucker, Noémie Elhadad

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T19:07:30Z

**Summary**: Clinician must write a lengthy summary each time a patient is discharged from the hospital. This task is time-consuming due to the sheer number of unique clinical concepts covered in the admission. Identifying and covering salient entities is vital for the summary to be clinically useful. We fine-tune open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B-Instruct and Zephyr-7B-beta) on the task and find that they generate incomplete and unfaithful summaries. To increase entity coverage, we train a smaller, encoder-only model to predict salient entities, which are treated as content-plans to guide the LLM. To encourage the LLM to focus on specific mentions in the source notes, we propose SPEER: Sentence-level Planning via Embedded Entity Retrieval. Specifically, we mark each salient entity span with special "{{ }}" boundary tags and instruct the LLM to retrieve marked spans before generating each sentence. Sentence-level planning acts as a form of state tracking in that the model is explicitly recording the entities it uses. We fine-tune Mistral and Zephyr variants on a large-scale, diverse dataset of ~167k in-patient hospital admissions and evaluate on 3 datasets. SPEER shows gains in both coverage and faithfulness metrics over non-guided and guided baselines.

### Trustworthy AI: Securing Sensitive Data in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Georgios Feretzakis, Vassilios S. Verykios

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T19:02:33Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing (NLP) by enabling robust text generation and understanding. However, their deployment in sensitive domains like healthcare, finance, and legal services raises critical concerns about privacy and data security. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for embedding trust mechanisms into LLMs to dynamically control the disclosure of sensitive information. The framework integrates three core components: User Trust Profiling, Information Sensitivity Detection, and Adaptive Output Control. By leveraging techniques such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), Named Entity Recognition (NER), contextual analysis, and privacy-preserving methods like differential privacy, the system ensures that sensitive information is disclosed appropriately based on the user's trust level. By focusing on balancing data utility and privacy, the proposed solution offers a novel approach to securely deploying LLMs in high-risk environments. Future work will focus on testing this framework across various domains to evaluate its effectiveness in managing sensitive data while maintaining system efficiency.

### MMMT-IF: A Challenging Multimodal Multi-Turn Instruction Following   Benchmark
**Authors**: Elliot L. Epstein, Kaisheng Yao, Jing Li, Xinyi Bai, Hamid Palangi

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T18:51:46Z

**Summary**: Evaluating instruction following capabilities for multimodal, multi-turn dialogue is challenging. With potentially multiple instructions in the input model context, the task is time-consuming for human raters and we show LLM based judges are biased towards answers from the same model. We propose MMMT-IF, an image based multi-turn Q$\&$A evaluation set with added global instructions between questions, constraining the answer format. This challenges models to retrieve instructions dispersed across long dialogues and reason under instruction constraints. All instructions are objectively verifiable through code execution. We introduce the Programmatic Instruction Following ($\operatorname{PIF}$) metric to measure the fraction of the instructions that are correctly followed while performing a reasoning task. The $\operatorname{PIF-N-K}$ set of metrics further evaluates robustness by measuring the fraction of samples in a corpus where, for each sample, at least K out of N generated model responses achieve a $\operatorname{PIF}$ score of one. The $\operatorname{PIF}$ metric aligns with human instruction following ratings, showing 60 percent correlation. Experiments show Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, have a $\operatorname{PIF}$ metric that drops from 0.81 on average at turn 1 across the models, to 0.64 at turn 20. Across all turns, when each response is repeated 4 times ($\operatorname{PIF-4-4}$), GPT-4o and Gemini successfully follow all instructions only $11\%$ of the time. When all the instructions are also appended to the end of the model input context, the $\operatorname{PIF}$ metric improves by 22.3 points on average, showing that the challenge with the task lies not only in following the instructions, but also in retrieving the instructions spread out in the model context. We plan to open source the MMMT-IF dataset and metric computation code.

### AI Policy Projector: Grounding LLM Policy Design in Iterative Mapmaking
**Authors**: Michelle S. Lam, Fred Hohman, Dominik Moritz, Jeffrey P. Bigham, Kenneth Holstein, Mary Beth Kery

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T18:34:16Z

**Summary**: Whether a large language model policy is an explicit constitution or an implicit reward model, it is challenging to assess coverage over the unbounded set of real-world situations that a policy must contend with. We introduce an AI policy design process inspired by mapmaking, which has developed tactics for visualizing and iterating on maps even when full coverage is not possible. With Policy Projector, policy designers can survey the landscape of model input-output pairs, define custom regions (e.g., "violence"), and navigate these regions with rules that can be applied to LLM outputs (e.g., if output contains "violence" and "graphic details," then rewrite without "graphic details"). Policy Projector supports interactive policy authoring using LLM classification and steering and a map visualization reflecting the policy designer's work. In an evaluation with 12 AI safety experts, our system helps policy designers to address problematic model behaviors extending beyond an existing, comprehensive harm taxonomy.

### LowREm: A Repository of Word Embeddings for 87 Low-Resource Languages   Enhanced with Multilingual Graph Knowledge
**Authors**: Daniil Gurgurov, Rishu Kumar, Simon Ostermann

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T18:10:26Z

**Summary**: Contextualized embeddings based on large language models (LLMs) are available for various languages, but their coverage is often limited for lower resourced languages. Training LLMs for such languages is often difficult due to insufficient data and high computational cost. Especially for very low resource languages, static word embeddings thus still offer a viable alternative. There is, however, a notable lack of comprehensive repositories with such embeddings for diverse languages. To address this, we present LowREm, a centralized repository of static embeddings for 87 low-resource languages. We also propose a novel method to enhance GloVe-based embeddings by integrating multilingual graph knowledge, utilizing another source of knowledge. We demonstrate the superior performance of our enhanced embeddings as compared to contextualized embeddings extracted from XLM-R on sentiment analysis. Our code and data are publicly available under https://huggingface.co/DFKI.

### EgoLM: Multi-Modal Language Model of Egocentric Motions
**Authors**: Fangzhou Hong, Vladimir Guzov, Hyo Jin Kim, Yuting Ye, Richard Newcombe, Ziwei Liu, Lingni Ma

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T17:59:31Z

**Summary**: As the prevalence of wearable devices, learning egocentric motions becomes essential to develop contextual AI. In this work, we present EgoLM, a versatile framework that tracks and understands egocentric motions from multi-modal inputs, e.g., egocentric videos and motion sensors. EgoLM exploits rich contexts for the disambiguation of egomotion tracking and understanding, which are ill-posed under single modality conditions. To facilitate the versatile and multi-modal framework, our key insight is to model the joint distribution of egocentric motions and natural languages using large language models (LLM). Multi-modal sensor inputs are encoded and projected to the joint latent space of language models, and used to prompt motion generation or text generation for egomotion tracking or understanding, respectively. Extensive experiments on large-scale multi-modal human motion dataset validate the effectiveness of EgoLM as a generalist model for universal egocentric learning.

### E.T. Bench: Towards Open-Ended Event-Level Video-Language Understanding
**Authors**: Ye Liu, Zongyang Ma, Zhongang Qi, Yang Wu, Ying Shan, Chang Wen Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T17:53:04Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated their great potential in general-purpose video understanding. To verify the significance of these models, a number of benchmarks have been proposed to diagnose their capabilities in different scenarios. However, existing benchmarks merely evaluate models through video-level question-answering, lacking fine-grained event-level assessment and task diversity. To fill this gap, we introduce E.T. Bench (Event-Level & Time-Sensitive Video Understanding Benchmark), a large-scale and high-quality benchmark for open-ended event-level video understanding. Categorized within a 3-level task taxonomy, E.T. Bench encompasses 7.3K samples under 12 tasks with 7K videos (251.4h total length) under 8 domains, providing comprehensive evaluations. We extensively evaluated 8 Image-LLMs and 12 Video-LLMs on our benchmark, and the results reveal that state-of-the-art models for coarse-level (video-level) understanding struggle to solve our fine-grained tasks, e.g., grounding event-of-interests within videos, largely due to the short video context length, improper time representations, and lack of multi-event training data. Focusing on these issues, we further propose a strong baseline model, E.T. Chat, together with an instruction-tuning dataset E.T. Instruct 164K tailored for fine-grained event-level understanding. Our simple but effective solution demonstrates superior performance in multiple scenarios.

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T17:30:28Z

**Summary**: Data preparation is the first and a very important step towards any Large Language Model (LLM) development. This paper introduces an easy-to-use, extensible, and scale-flexible open-source data preparation toolkit called Data Prep Kit (DPK). DPK is architected and designed to enable users to scale their data preparation to their needs. With DPK they can prepare data on a local machine or effortlessly scale to run on a cluster with thousands of CPU Cores. DPK comes with a highly scalable, yet extensible set of modules that transform natural language and code data. If the user needs additional transforms, they can be easily developed using extensive DPK support for transform creation. These modules can be used independently or pipelined to perform a series of operations. In this paper, we describe DPK architecture and show its performance from a small scale to a very large number of CPUs. The modules from DPK have been used for the preparation of Granite Models [1] [2]. We believe DPK is a valuable contribution to the AI community to easily prepare data to enhance the performance of their LLM models or to fine-tune models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

### The Nexus of AR/VR, Large Language Models, UI/UX, and Robotics   Technologies in Enhancing Learning and Social Interaction for Children: A   Systematic Review
**Authors**: Biplov Paneru, Bishwash Paneru

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T17:19:25Z

**Summary**: The combination of large language models (LLMs), augmented reality (AR), and user interface/user experience (UI/UX) design in therapies for children, especially with disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is examined in this review study. 150 publications were found by a thorough literature search throughout PubMed, ACM, IEEE Xplore, Elsevier, and Google Scholar; 42 of them were chosen for in-depth study due to their methodological rigor and relevance. Three primary areas are covered in this review: how AR can improve social and learning results; how LLMs can help with communication; and how UI/UX design affects how effective these technologies are. Results reveal that while LLMs can provide individualized learning and communication support, AR has demonstrated promise in enhancing social skills, motivation, and attention. For children with ASD, accessible and interesting interventions depend heavily on effective UI/UX design. To optimize the benefits of these technologies in ASD therapies, the study emphasizes the need for additional research to address difficulties related to customization, accessibility, and integration.
